https://openalex.org/W2091673304,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC)-1α is a coactivator of nuclear receptors and other transcription factors that regulates several components of energy metabolism, particularly certain aspects of adaptive thermogenesis in brown fat and skeletal muscle, hepatic gluconeogenesis, and fiber type switching in skeletal muscle. PGC-1α has been shown to induce mitochondrial biogenesis when expressed in muscle cells, and preliminary analysis has suggested that this molecule may specifically increase the fraction of uncoupled versus coupled respiration. In this paper, we have performed detailed bioenergetic analyses of the function of PGC-1α and its homolog PGC-1β in muscle cells by monitoring simultaneously oxygen consumption and membrane potential. Cells expressing PGC-1α or PGC-1β display higher proton leak rates at any given membrane potential than control cells. However, cells expressing PGC-1α have a higher proportion of their mitochondrial respiration linked to proton leak than cells expressing PGC-1β. Although these two proteins cause a similar increase in the expression of many mitochondrial genes, PGC-1β preferentially induces certain genes involved in the removal of reactive oxygen species, recently recognized as activators of uncoupling proteins. Together, these data indicate that PGC-1α and PGC-1β profoundly alter mitochondrial metabolism and suggest that these proteins are likely to play different physiological functions.

Mitochondria play a central role in metabolism by coupling cellular respiration to the production of ATP. However, this coupling is not perfectly tight. Indeed, it is estimated that approximately 20% of the standard metabolic rate in mammals is due to a leak of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane in a manner that uncouples cellular respiration from ATP production, thereby generating heat (1Rolfe D.F. Brown G.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 731-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). This cycle is called basal proton leak. In addition to this basal leak, there is an inducible leak of protons catalyzed by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) 1The abbreviations used are: UCP, uncoupling protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PGC, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TPMP, [3H]triphenylmethylphosphonium; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. in brown fat. Two close homologs of this protein have been discovered, UCP2 and UCP3 (2Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D.

Although the function of these homologs is not clear, recent work suggests that they might have an important role in the protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) (7Arsenijevic D. Onuma H.

Interestingly, none of the genetic studies using either knockout mice or mice overexpressing moderate levels of UCP2 and UCP3 show a significant effect of these proteins in determining standard metabolic rate by uncoupling cellular respiration (11Argyropoulos G.

Many changes in the cellular environment result in modulation of mitochondrial metabolism. Basal proton leak rate changes in response to hormonal status and metabolic depression (13Hafner R.P.

Also, small mammals with high standard metabolic rates have higher proton leak rates than large mammals with low standard metabolic rates (20Porter R.K. Brand M.D. Nature. 1993; 362: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 21Porter R.K. Brand M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R1213-R1224PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, proton leak rates differ between phylogenetic groups; it is higher in endotherms than in ectotherms (22Brand M.D. Couture P. Else P.L. Withers K.W. Hulbert A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The fact that mitochondrial functions can be altered in response to environmental stimuli is due to the execution of a coordinated program of genes expression. PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) has been shown to be a powerful regulator of multiple aspects of mitochondrial gene expression. Indeed, PGC-1α is cold-induced in brown fat and muscle where it plays a role in adaptive thermogenesis by regulating a complex program of increased mitochondrial biogenesis and uncoupled respiration via coactivation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), nuclear respiratory factor 1, and perhaps other transcription factors (23Puigserver P.

Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing physiological levels of PGC-1α protein in skeletal muscle display an increased content of oxidative type I fibers compared with their wild-type counterparts (25Lin J.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3738-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The expression of PGC-1β and PGC-1-related coactivator is not cold-inducible in brown fat and skeletal muscle, suggesting that they might have distinct roles from PGC-1α (26Lin J. Puigserver P. Donovan J. Tarr P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1645-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 28Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3738-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, both PGC-1β and PGC-1-related coactivator coactivate nuclear respiratory factor 1, implying that they may also have a role in mitochondrial metabolism (26Lin J. Puigserver P. Donovan J. Tarr P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1645-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 28Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3738-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To date, there are no bioenergetic mechanisms that might explain how PGC-1α increases uncoupled respiration, nor any studies examining a role for its closest homolog PGC-1β in mitochondrial metabolism. In this report, we measure the respiration and proton leak kinetics of C2C12 muscle cells expressing either PGC-1α or PGC-1β. We report that PGC-1β, like PGC-1α, increases mitochondrial metabolism. Although both PGC-1α and PGC-1β increase proton leak, cells expressing PGC-1α have a higher proportion of their mitochondrial respiration linked to proton leak than those expressing PGC-1β. Cell Culture—C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes was induced by the standard protocol of allowing the cells to become confluent and changing the medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% horse serum. The differentiation into myotubes took 3–5 days. The cells were then infected with adenoviruses expressing GFP, PGC-1α, or PGC-1β. The GFP and PGC-1α viruses were made using the adeno-X expression system (Clontech). For PGC-1β, a recombinant adenovirus containing the full-length cDNA encoding PGC-1β was prepared by subcloning of the cDNA into the pACCMV.pLpA vector and cotransfection of the recombinant plasmid with plasmid pJM17 into 293 cells using previously described methods (29Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Two days after infection of myotubes, the cells were harvested to determine mitochondrial membrane potential, respiration rate, mitochondrial volume density, and cristae surface density. The cells were isolated by washing with phosphate-buffered saline and trypsinizing for 5 min. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% horse serum was added to stop the reaction, and the cells were resuspended and spin twice at 1000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. Finally, the cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 1 mm pyruvate, and 2% bovine serum albumin. Cell viability was determined using trypan blue. In all experiments, viability was approximately 90% or higher. Proton Leak Kinetics in C2C12 Myotubes—Proton leak kinetics analyses in cells were carried out as described in Ref. 30Brand M. Brown G. Cooper C. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar. The cells were incubated for 30 min with 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]triphenylmethylphosphonium (TPMP), 0.2 μm TPMP, and 1.5 μm tetraphenylboron as carriers, as well as 2.5 μg of oligomycin/106 cells. Controls were done to ensure that the oligomycin concentration was saturating for each group of cells. After this incubation period, the respiration rates and membrane potentials were determined. The first point of each proton leak curve represents the resting respiration rate and membrane potential of cells in the presence of oligomycin. Increasing amounts of myxothiazol (0.024, 0.048, and 0.072 μm) were then added gradually to decrease membrane potential and respiration rate. Finally, 2.5 μm myxothiazol and 2 μm carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone were added to ascertain nonmitochondrial respiration. Nonmitochondrial respiration was subtracted from the total respiration to obtain mitochondrial respiration. To calculate membrane potential, we used the mitochondrial volume density values measured in the present study (see “Results”), cell volume of 4 μl/106 cells (data not shown using the method described in Ref. 30Brand M. Brown G. Cooper C. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar), resting plasma membrane potential of –46 mV (31Henning R.H. Nelemans S.A. van den Akker J. den Hertog A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 111: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the following TPMP binding corrections: mitochondrial, 0.4; cytoplasmic, 0.2; and external medium, 0.7 (17Harper M.E. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14850-14860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Brand M. Brown G. Cooper C. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar). Contribution of ATP Turnover and Proton Leak to Mitochondrial Respiration—The contribution of ATP turnover and proton leak to mitochondrial respiration was calculated from the results of the proton leak kinetics. ATP turnover represents the fraction of mitochondrial respiration sensitive to oligomycin. Proton leak represents the fraction of mitochondrial respiration that is insensitive to oligomycin. Electron Microscopy—The samples were fixed for 1 h in a mixture of 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 1.25% paraformaldehyde, and 0.03% picric acid in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), washed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, postfixed with 1% osmiumtetroxide/1.5% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 h, washed in water, and stained in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 min followed by dehydration in grades of alcohol (5 min at 70%, 5 min at 90%, and 2 × 5 min at 100%). The samples were then infiltrated and embedded in TAAB Epon (Marivac Canada Inc., St. Laurent, Canada). Ultrathin sections (about 60 nm) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut-S microtome, picked up on to copper grids stained with uranylacetate and lead citrate, and examined in a JEOL 1200EX. The quantification of mitochondrial volume density and cristae surface density of cells expressing GFP, PGC-1α, and PGC-1β was carried out as described in Ref. 32Weibel E. Stereological Methods: Practical Methods for Biological Morphometry. Academic Press, London1979Google Scholar. Isolation of Mitochondria from Transgenic Mice—Wild-type and transgenic mice expressing PGC-1α from the muscle creatine kinase promoter in the muscle tissues (transgenic line 31) were housed on a 12D:12N photoperiod cycle and fed ad libitum (25Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). The mice were sacrificed, and their whole leg muscle mass was excised and minced with razor blades. The minced tissue was diluted 1/10 (w/v) in isolation buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and homogenized in a mortar with six passes using a medium tight pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in isolation medium and centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of isolation medium. The protein concentration of the mitochondrial suspensions was determined using the bicinchoninic acid kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proton Leak Kinetics in Isolated Mitochondria—The proton leak kinetics in isolated mitochondria was determined as described in Ref. 30Brand M. Brown G. Cooper C. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar. Mitochondria were incubated (0.3 mg/ml) in assay medium containing 120 mm KCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 3 mm Hepes, and 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.2 at room temperature) in a chamber thermostatted at 37 °C using a recirculating water bath. The oxygen consumption rates, measured with a Clark-type electrode, and the membrane potential values, determined using a TPMP electrode, were recorded simultaneously. Rotenone (5 μm), oligomycin (1 μg/mg mitochondrial protein), and nigericin (80 ng/ml) were present at the beginning of each run. TPMP was added up to 1.3 μm for calibration. Mitochondria were fed succinate (4 mm), and the inhibitor malonate was gradually added up to 1.3 mm to inhibit mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential. Finally, p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (0.15 μm) was added to determine the drift of the TPMP electrode, if any. The oxygen solubility of the medium was considered 406 nmol of oxygen/ml (33Reynafarje B. Costa L.E. Lehninger A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 145: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and the TPMP binding correction was considered 0.4 (μl/mg mitochondrial protein)–1 (30Brand M. Brown G. Cooper C. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analyses—Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 myotubes using Trizol (Invitrogen); 20 μg of RNA was analyzed by electrophoresis and transferred on a membrane. The RNA blots were hybridized with specific cDNA probes. Statistical Analyses—All of the statistical analyses were performed using Sigma Stat 2.0. Comparisons of the contribution of ATP turnover and proton leak to mitochondrial respiration between cells infected with GFP and PGC-1α or with GFP and PGC-1β were carried out with paired Student t test. Comparisons of mitochondrial volume density and cristae surface density values between GFP-, PGC-1α-, and PGC-1β-expressing cells were done with one-way analysis of variance and the a posteriori Tukey test. Proton Leak Kinetics of Muscle Cells Expressing PGC-1α or PGC-1β—To study the functions of PGC-1α and PGC-1β, these coactivators were expressed with adenoviral vectors in C2C12 muscle cells. These cells were used because skeletal muscle in vivo expresses both PGC-1s, but the cultured cells express much less of these proteins, making them an attractive system for studying PGC-1 function. As shown below, these infections achieved roughly equivalent levels of PGC-1α and PGC-1β mRNA. In addition, mRNAs for several well established target genes of PGC-1α (cytochrome c and UCP2) are activated equivalently in cells infected with PGC-1α or PGC-1β. We first measured the proton conductance in these cells, as well as cells expressing a control GFP. Proton conductance can be defined as the flow of protons (proton leak) across the mitochondrial membrane at a given membrane potential and represents the fraction of mitochondrial respiration that is not coupled to ATP production. Respiration, the consumption of oxygen, is used as a surrogate for proton leak (30Brand M. Brown G. Cooper C. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar). The highest point of a proton leak curve represents the respiration rate and membrane potential of cells/mitochondria in the presence of oligomycin, an inhibitor of the F1F0-ATP synthase (30Brand M. Brown G. Cooper C. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar). Then respiration and membrane potential are inhibited gradually by adding increasing amounts of myxothiazol, a specific inhibitor of the electron transport chain (30Brand M. Brown G. Cooper C. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), the respiration rate of PGC-1α- and PGC-1β-expressing cells at any given membrane potential was substantially higher than GFP controls. For example, the respiration rate at 190 mV of PGC-1α cells and the paired GFP control was ∼7 and 3 nmol of oxygen/min/106 cells, respectively, an increase of 2.5-fold (Fig. 1A). The respiration rate of PGC-1β cells and the paired GFP control at 172 mV was ∼3 and 0.5 nmol of oxygen/min/106 cells, respectively, a 6-fold increase (Fig. 1B). To compare the proton leak kinetics of the cells expressing PGC-1α and PGC-1β, we expressed the respiration rates and membrane potentials of these cells as percentages of the initial respiration rate and membrane potential of paired GFP controls (Fig. 1C). The proton conductance of cells expressing PGC-1β was approximately three times higher than those expressing PGC-1α (Fig. 1C). Indeed, the respiration rate of PGC-1β, when normalized to its paired GFP control, was at least twice that of PGC-1α cells at any given membrane potential (Fig. 1C). Contribution of ATP Turnover and Proton Leak to PGC-1-related Mitochondrial Respiration—Mitochondrial respiration is divided into two blocks: ATP turnover and proton leak. ATP turnover is the fraction of mitochondrial respiration coupled to ATP production and is sensitive to oligomycin. Proton leak is the fraction of mitochondrial respiration not coupled to ATP production and is insensitive to oligomycin. Metabolic efficiency represents the balance between the ATP turnover and proton leak blocks. Therefore, when total mitochondrial respiration is altered, metabolic efficiency can only be preserved if ATP turnover and proton leak are affected in a similar way. For example, if mitochondrial respiration doubles, metabolic efficiency will be preserved if both ATP turnover and proton leak double. We determined the proportion of mitochondrial respiration devoted to ATP turnover and proton leak in cells expressing PGC-1α, PGC-1β, and GFP. We used two different approaches to carry out this analysis; because each approach has its own limitation, together they provide a more reliable overview of the metabolic organization of these cells. In the first calculation, we expressed the respiration rate of PGC-1α, PGC-1β, and GFP cells in the presence of oligomycin (from Fig. 1) as a fraction of their mitochondrial respiration (data not shown) without taking into account membrane potential values. The potential problem with this approach is actually that it does not take into account differing membrane potential values of the different cells. By this method, PGC-1α-expressing cells devote 37% of their mitochondrial respiration to proton leak, compared with 23% for paired GFP controls (Fig. 2A). In other words, PGC-1α increases uncoupled respiration more than coupled respiration. This is in agreement with the initial study by Wu et al. (24Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar) using C2C12 myotubes infected with retroviruses reporting that PGC-1α increases uncoupled respiration more than coupled respiration. In contrast, cells expressing PGC-1β display a fraction of mitochondrial respiration caused by proton leak similar to that of the GFP controls (Fig. 2B). Indeed, the ATP turnover and proton leak blocks increased coordinately in PGC-1β-expressing cells so that they are almost as coupled as GFP control cells (Fig. 2B). As a second approach, we took into account the membrane potential values and calculated the proportion of mitochondrial respiration devoted to proton leak at the resting membrane potential of PGC-1α, PGC-1β, and GFP cells. This is the membrane potential in the absence of oligomycin (data not shown). The membrane potential value of these cells was slightly higher in the resting state than in the presence of oligomycin, which is the highest point of the proton leak curves presented in Fig. 1. To obtain the predicted proton leak rate at the resting membrane potential of these cells, we fitted a linear curve through the proton leak points of PGC-1α, PGC-1β cells, and paired GFP controls from Fig. 1 (A and B) (19Bishop T. St-Pierre J. Brand M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R372-R382PubMed Google Scholar). A caveat with this approach is that the proton leak rate value at the resting membrane potential of these cells must be predicted without being able to measure it experimentally. Using this method, we determined that cells expressing GFP, PGC-1α, and PGC-1β have 37, 62, and 44%, respectively, of their mitochondrial respiration linked to proton leak. Although these values are higher than the ones determined above in absolute terms, the general conclusion remains the same: cells expressing PGC-1α are less efficient than GFP- or PGC-1β-expressing cells. Whether PGC-1β significantly alters the fraction of respiration related to proton leak will require more detailed experiments. Ultrastructural Analyses of Muscle Cells Expressing PGC-1α or PGC-1β—Modification in mitochondrial volume density and changes in the intrinsic properties of mitochondria, such as membrane properties and cristae surface density, are key factors affecting proton conductance in cells (21Porter R.K. Brand M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R1213-R1224PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the increased proton conductance of cells expressing PGC-1α or PGC-1β was associated with elevated mitochondrial volume density and/or cristae surface density, we carried out ultrastructural analyses of these cells and of GFP controls via transmission electron microscopy. To calculate mitochondrial volume density, a grid was laid on randomly selected micrographs, and the number of points falling onto mitochondria was expressed as a fraction of those falling onto the cell area (32Weibel E. Stereological Methods: Practical Methods for Biological Morphometry. Academic Press, London1979Google Scholar). An analogous approach was used to determine the cristae surface density of individual mitochondrion (32Weibel E. Stereological Methods: Practical Methods for Biological Morphometry. Academic Press, London1979Google Scholar). Muscle cells expressing PGC-1α and PGC-1β showed 25 and 75% increases in mitochondrial volume density, respectively, compared with GFP controls (Figs. 3A and 4A). Concerning the ultrastructure of individual mitochondrion, we observed that mitochondria from C2C12 myotubes expressing PGC-1α displayed a 10% increase in cristae surface density compared with GFP controls, which was statistically significant (Figs. 3B and 4B).Fig. 4Representative electron micrographs from C2C12 myotubes expressing GFP, PGC-1α, and PGC-1β.

However, performing this type of experiment has been very difficult with cultured cells because of the problems associated with large scale purification. Hence, we took advantage of the availability of mice expressing PGC-1α transgenically in skeletal muscle and compared the proton leak kinetics of mitochondria isolated from their leg muscle with that of wild-type mice. Importantly, these mice do not grossly overexpress this coactivator; they express PGC-1α in type II muscle fibers at the level ordinarily seen in type I fibers (25Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Generally, the concentration of mitochondrial proteins from a given muscle mass was higher in transgenic mice than in wild-type animals (data not shown), suggesting that the ectopic expression of PGC-1α in vivo also leads to mitochondrial biogenesis. The highest point of a proton leak curve measured in isolated mitochondria represents the state 4 respiration rate and membrane potential. As shown in Fig. 5, mitochondria from transgenic mice displayed a slightly higher respiration rate than those from wild-type mice at any given membrane potential. In addition, the state 4 respiration rate was 50% higher in mitochondria from transgenic than wild-type mice, suggesting an increased substrate oxidation capacity (Fig. 5). Together, these results are consistent with the measurements performed in cells and demonstrate that PGC-1α can affect the intrinsic functional properties of mitochondria, notably increasing proton leak rate. Mitochondrial Gene Expression in Cells Expressing PGC-1α or PGC-1β—To gain possible insights into the molecular basis for the changes observed in respiration and proton leak, we examined the expression of several key mitochondrial components of the electron transport system (cytochrome c and ATP-synthase), the metabolism of ROS (manganese-superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase-1), as well as uncoupling proteins (UCP2 and UCP3). The expression of cytosolic enzymes involved in the metabolism of ROS (glutathione peroxidase-1, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase light subunit, and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy subunit) was also examined because the increased mitochondrial volume density and respiration of PGC-1α and PGC-1β cells could lead to elevated cellular levels of ROS. As shown in Fig. 6A, cells infected with these viruses expressed similar levels of PGC-1α or PGC-1β mRNA, and both coactivators induced mRNAs for the well studied PGC-1α target genes cytochrome c and UCP2 to the same extent. Specifically, the mRNA expression level of cytochrome c, ATP synthase, UCP2 and UCP3 (Fig. 6A), as well as manganese-superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase-1 (Fig. 6B) were all higher in cells expressing PGC-1α and PGC-1β than in control cells (Fig. 6). The quantitative induction in the expression level of mRNA for certain markers, like ATP synthase and UCP3, in PGC-1α and PGC-1β-expressing cells matched the 1.25- and 1.75-fold inductions in their mitochondrial volume density, respectively (Figs. 4 and 6). Others, like cytochrome c, UCP2, manganese-superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase-1, displayed higher inductions of at least 5-fold (Fig. 6). The fact that expression of these mRNAs displays a higher induction than the mitochondrial volume density suggests that each mitochondrion might have an elevated content of these proteins. Together, these results support the observation that myotubes expressing PGC-1α and PGC-1β ectopically have an increased mitochondrial volume density and also suggest that these cells have mitochondria with different intrinsic properties. Interestingly, PGC-1β cells displayed a higher expression of two cytosolic enzymes involved in the metabolism of ROS, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase light subunit, and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy subunit, compared with PGC-1α and GFP cells (Fig. 6B). The coactivator PGC-1α has been shown to induce mitochondrial biogenesis in cultured adipocytes as well as skeletal and cardiac myocytes (23Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar, 24Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S.

Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Initial studies using the inhibitor oligomycin suggested that PGC-1α might specifically induce an increased proton leak in skeletal muscle cells, but these studies had to be considered suggestive because a bona fide ascertainment of alterations in proton leak can only be determined by examining experimental and control cells at different mitochondrial membrane potentials. In this study, we have performed a much more complete and mechanistic analysis of the effects of PGC-1α and the related coactivator PGC-1β on the bioenergetics of mitochondria. One basic question addressed here is whether PGC-1β has the capacity to induce mitochondrial biogenesis and increase respiration. As shown in Figs. 1B, 3A, and 4A, PGC-1β powerfully stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration. Indeed, it is more potent in this regard than PGC-1α at similar levels of mRNA, even though several genes are induced by both coactivators to a similar extent. Another key issue addressed in this study is the fraction of mitochondrial respiration coupled or uncoupled in cells expressing PGC-1α or PGC-1β. There are several possible explanations for the increased fraction of uncoupled respiration observed in the presence of PGC-1α versus PGC-1β. First, it is necessary to examine how coupled and uncoupled respiration in particular can be regulated. A key factor that needs consideration with respect to respiration rate relates to the elevated mitochondrial volume density of these cells. We can account for the differences in mitochondrial volume density between cells expressing PGC-1α or PGC-1β and control cells simply by dividing the respiration rates of these cells by their respective mitochondrial volume density value. This calculation gives an indication of the respiration rate of mitochondria inside the cells. After correcting for differences in mitochondrial volume density, the total respiration rate of cells expressing PGC-1α or PGC-1β is similar to control cells. However, the proton leak rate (highest point of the proton leak curves in Fig. 1) of cells expressing PGC-1α remains higher than that of cells expressing PGC-1β or control cells, both of which have similar proton leak rates after correction. These data suggest the proton leak rate of individual mitochondria is higher in the presence of PGC-1α than PGC-1β and that mitochondrial volume density is not the only explanation for the higher fraction of leak-related respiration in cells expressing PGC-1α. Modifications in the intrinsic properties of mitochondria could explain higher proton leak rates in cells expressing PGC-1α versus PGC-1β. Cells expressing PGC-1α, but not PGC-1β, displayed a statistically significant increase of 10% in cristae surface density (Figs. 3B and 4B), which would be expected to augment their proton leak by increasing the area of membrane across which protons can re-enter the matrix compartment. In support of the idea that elevated PGC-1α levels increase the proton leak of individual mitochondria, a separate experiment using mitochondria isolated from the skeletal muscle of mice expressing PGC-1α at the level found in type I muscle fibers revealed that these mitochondria have higher resting proton leak rate (highest point of proton the leak curves in Fig. 5) and proton conductance than those from wild-type mice. Therefore, modifications in the intrinsic properties of mitochondria play an important role in the difference between PGC-1α and PGC-1β for the proportion of mitochondrial respiration linked to proton leak. Another possible difference between cells expressing PGC-1α and PGC-1β could relate to the function of the uncoupling proteins, that is the expression of UCP2 and/or UCP3, combined with altered levels of superoxide, activators of the UCPs. Cells expressing PGC-1α and PGC-1β both had similarly elevated expression levels of mRNA encoding UCP2 and UCP3 (Fig. 6). Intriguingly, only cells expressing PGC-1β had increased levels of two cytosolic genes, namely glutamylcysteine synthetase light subunit and glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy subunit, both involved in the removal/degradation of ROS (Fig. 6B). It is conceivable, or even likely, that both PGC-1α and PGC-1β action result in the generation of ROS via the activation of mitochondrial metabolism, thereby activating UCP2 and/or UCP3. However, it is also possible that PGC-1β is better at the removal of these ROS because mRNAs for two cytoplasmic enzymes playing a role in metabolism of ROS are induced by this coactivator but not by PGC-1α. Whether regulation of ROS in the cytoplasm can influence superoxide on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane and regulate UCP2 or UCP3 is an open question (35Echtay K.S. Murphy M.P. Smith R.A. Talbot D.A. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47129-47135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The relative ability of PGC-1α and PGC-1β to produce ROS and activate UCPs via this mechanism remains to be determined. Another important aspect to consider in this analysis concerns ATP turnover, the fraction of mitochondrial respiration providing ATP for the ATP consumers. There are important differences regarding ATP turnover between cells expressing PGC-1α and PGC-1β. Indeed, 75% of the increase in mitochondrial respiration in cells expressing PGC-1β was due to an increase in ATP turnover, and 25% was explained by an increase in proton leak. For cells expressing PGC-1α, the situation was completely reversed; only 25% of the increase in mitochondrial respiration in these cells was due to an increase in ATP turnover, and 75% was explained by an increase in proton leak. Together, these data indicate that the activity of the ATP consuming reactions was increased in cells expressing PGC-1β, providing another potential influence related to the higher fraction of coupled respiration in these cells. Overall, the data presented here indicate that the nature of the respiration induced by PGC-1α or PGC-1β is different. Indeed, cells expressing PGC-1α have a less efficient mitochondrial respiration than those expressing PGC-1β or GFP. This is particularly interesting in light of the fact that PGC-1α is induced in the cold in both brown fat and skeletal muscle, two key thermogenic tissues (23Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). In contrast, PGC-1β, which does not lead to a particularly inefficient mitochondrial metabolism (present study), is not cold-inducible in these tissues (26Lin J. Puigserver P. Donovan J. Tarr P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1645-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). However, it is important to appreciate that PGC-1α is also induced in muscle by exercise and is expressed in type 1 muscle, muscle associated with resistance to fatigue. Also, PGC-1α can induce an increase in type 1 fibers in muscle composed mainly of type 2 fibers (25Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PGC-1α is highly expressed in the heart, a tissue very dependent on ATP production. Certainly, mitochondrial uncoupling in these situations would be predicted to cause a reduced exercise tolerance in skeletal muscle and heart failure. These observations can be reconciled by an integrated view of the relative dependence of ATP turnover and proton leak on mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 7). In a state of physical rest, such as present in nonexercising muscle or cold-induced muscle or brown fat, a relatively low ATP demand will cause an increased mitochondrial membrane potential, which will in turn increase proton leak. In stark contrast, high ATP demand, expected upon the performance of muscular work, will slightly decrease membrane potentials resulting in a tighter coupling of metabolism because proton leak decreases rapidly as membrane potential is lowered. Said another way, PGC-1α, by setting up a relatively uncoupled state at rest, probably provides a system where rapid ATP turnover, such as occurs during the performance of exercise, will effectively slow down excessive proton leak. PGC-1β, in contrast, drives relatively less proton leak at rest, so it will provide more ATP when this is needed but cannot otherwise provide metabolic flexibility. Because both PGC-1α and PGC-1β are present in many tissues, the relative expression levels of these coactivators likely will play an important role in setting metabolic efficiency.

An excess of fat mass represents a breast cancer risk factor particularly in postmenopausal women, where estrogen production by adipose tissue through its own aromatase activity stimulates tumor progression.

In the present study, we have examined the possible link that exists between leptin and breast cancer, focusing our attention on the direct effect of leptin on aromatase activity, which may enhance estrogen production and induce tumor cell growth stimulation. We have shown that leptin enhances aromatase mRNA expression, aromatase content, and its enzymatic activity in MCF-7. Aromatase expression appears to be regulated by tissue-specific promoter. It has been demonstrated that promoters II and 1.3 are the major promoters that drive aromatase expression in MCF-7.

It is well known that an excess of fat mass represents a risk factor for breast cancer particularly in postmenopausal women, where estrogens produced by adipose tissue, through its own aromatase activity, stimulate breast tumor cells growth and progression (4Stoll B.A. Breast Cancer Res.

Aromatase is not only highly expressed in adipose stromal cells surrounding the tumor but also in epithelial cancer cells, suggesting that local estrogen biosynthesis may promote breast cancer growth through an autocrine and paracrine mechanism (6Chen S.

However, the possibility that plasma leptin levels in breast cancer patients could be used as a prognostic index (10Tessitore L. Vizio B. Antypas G. 2nd Balkan Congress on Oncology. Monduzzi, Bologna, Italy1998: 163-167Google Scholar) was confutated by the evidence that no difference was demonstrated between leptin levels in premenopausal patients with in situ breast cancer and the control group (11Mantzoros C.S.

Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate whether leptin per se was able to stimulate aromatase expression and activity in breast cancer epithelial cells, addressing its potential role in enhancing local estrogen production and thereby inducing tumor cell growth stimulation. In this study leptin has been shown to enhance aromatase mRNA expression, aromatase content, and its enzymatic activity in MCF-7. Aromatase expression appears to be regulated by tissue-specific promoter (21Simpson E.R. Mahendroo M S. Means G.D. Kilgore M.W. Hinshelwood M.M. Graham-Lorence S. Amarneh B. Ito Y. Fisher C.R.

Lately it has been demonstrated that promoters II and 1.3 are the major promoters driving aromatase expression in the MCF-7 cell line (22Zhou D. Clarke P. Wang J. Chen S. J. Biol.

Transient transfection experiments, using vector containing aromatase promoter PII/1.3 sequence fused with luciferase reporter gene, demonstrated that leptin is able to directly activate this promoter. In the presence of either MAPK inhibitor PD 98059 or ERK2 dominant negative as well as in the presence of STAT3 dominant negative, the stimulatory effect of leptin on aromatase promoter, aromatase protein content, and enzymatic activity was inhibited. Functional studies of mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that AP-1 motif is crucial in determining the up-regulatory effect induced by leptin on aromatase PII/P1.3 promoters activity in the MCF-7 cell line.

XETL is a plasmid containing an estrogen-responsive element conjugated with a luciferase reporter gene and has been described previously (23Bunone G. Briand P.A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The origins of the different antibodies used are described in the following paragraphs. Cell Cultures—Wild-type human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were gifts from E. Surmacz (Philadelphia, PA). This cell line was cultured in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% Eagle's nonessential amino acids, and 1 mg/ml penicillin-streptomycin. The cells were cultured in Phenol Red-free DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm l-glutamine for 24 h before each experiment. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—MCF-7 cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum for 1, 3, and 6 days in the presence of different concentrations of leptin (10 and 100 ng/ml). For the last 6 h, [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) was added to the culture medium. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were washed once with 10% and three times with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The cells were lysed by adding 0.1 n NaOH and then incubated 30 min at 37 °C. Thymidine incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. Aromatase Activity Assay—The aromatase activity in subconfluent MCF-7 cells medium was measured by the tritiated water release assay using 0.5 μm [1β-3H]androst-4-ene-3,17-dione as substrate (24Lephart E.D. Simpson E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were cultured for 48 and 96 h in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium in the absence or in presence of 10 and 100 ng/ml of leptin. The incubations were performed at 37 °C for 5 h under an air/CO2 (5%) atmosphere. The results obtained were expressed as fmol/h and normalized to mg of protein (fmol/h/mg protein). A set of experiments was carried out 24 h before each treatment, adding in the medium MAPK inhibitor PD 98059 (50 μm) or transfecting the cells with either ERK2 or STAT dominant negatives. RNA Isolation—Total cellular RNA was extracted from MCF-7 cells using Triazol reagent as suggested by the manufacturer. The purity and integrity of the RNA were checked spectroscopically and by gel electrophoresis before carrying out the analytical procedures. Reverse Transcription-PCR Assay—Aromatase mRNA was analyzed by the reverse transcription-PCR method. cDNA was synthesized by oligo(dT) using a RETROscript kit as suggested by the manufacturer. The cDNAs obtained were further amplified by a PCR using the following primers: 5′-CAAGGTTATTTTGATGCATGG-3′ (forward, nucleotides 776–796) and 5′-TTCTAAGGTTTGCGCATGA-3′ (reverse, nucleotides 1261–1241) for human P450arom and 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′ and 5′-CTCAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′ for the human housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH). The PCR was performed for 40 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) for P450arom and 24 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 64 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) to amplify the human G3PDH in the presence of 5 μl of first strand cDNA, 1 μm each of the primers mentioned above, 0.5 mm dNTP, Taq DNA polymerase (2 units/tube), and 2.2 mm magnesium chloride in a final volume of 25 μl. To check for the presence of DNA contamination, a reverse transcription-PCR was performed on 1 μg of total RNA without Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (the negative control). The PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. DNA quantity in each lane was analyzed by scanning densitometry. Standard DNA (50-bp DNA ladder) was run to provide the appropriate size marker. CYP19 encoding human P450arom (25Corbin C.G. Graham-Lorence S. McPhaul M.J. Mason J.I. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8948-8952Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) provided the positive control. Western Blot Analysis—MCF-7 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes to 70–80% confluence and lysed in 500 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, PMSF, and sodium orthovanadate). Equal amounts of total protein were resolved on an 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the human placental P450arom (1:4000) (Hauptman-Woodward, Medical Research Institute, Inc, Buffalo, NY). The antigen-antibody complex was detected by incubation of the membranes for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG and revealed using the ECL System. The blots were then exposed to film, and the bands of interest were quantified by densitometer (model 620; Bio-Rad). The results obtained as optical density arbitrary values were transformed to percentages of the control (percent control) taking the samples from cells not treated as 100%. R2C cells were used as a positive control. Transfection Assay—Transient transfection experiments were performed using human aromatase promoter II and I.3 sequence ligated to a luciferase reporter gene into the pGL3 vector. The deletions of AP-1 sequences in the aromatase promoter were generated by PCR. The resulting plasmids encoding the aromatase promoter II and 1.3 containing the desired deletions were designated AP-1 –498 and AP-1 –935 (containing the deletions of AP-1 motifs at positions –498 and –935, respectively); the AP-1 –498/–935 plasmid contains deletions at both AP-1 sites. The desired deletions of sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. FuGENE 6 was used as directed by the manufacturer to cotransfect cells plated in 3.5-cm2 wells with the pGL3 promoter construct (0.5 μg/well). A set of experiments was performed cotransfecting pGL3 promoters II/1.3 (0.5 μg/well) and pSG5 vector containing the cDNA encoding dominant negative STAT3, which is a variant of the transcription factor STAT3 lacking an internal domain of 50 base pairs located near the C terminus (STAT–) (0.5 μg/well) or pCMV5myc vector containing the cDNA encoding dominant negative ERK2 K52R (ERK2–) (0.5 μg/well). Empty vectors were used to ensure that DNA concentrations were constant in each transfection. TK Renilla luciferase plasmid (25 ng/well) was used to normalize the efficiency of the transfection. Empty PGL3-Basic vector was used as a control vector to measure basal activity. 24 h after transfection, the medium was changed, and the cells were treated in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium in the presence of 10 and 100 ng/ml leptin for 48 and 96 h. In another set of experiments, 24 h after transfection, we added MAPK inhibitor PD 98059 (50 μm) overnight in the medium before starting the treatment with leptin. Transient transfection experiments were also performed using XETL plasmid, a construct containing an estrogen-responsive element from the Xenopus vitellogenin promoter, driving expression of the luciferase gene (23Bunone G. Briand P.A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). FuGENE 6 was used as directed by the manufacturer with a mixture containing XETL reporter plasmid (0.5 μg/well) and TK Renilla luciferase plasmid (25 ng/well). After 6 h the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM in the presence of leptin 1000 ng/ml for 72 h. For the last 24 h we added 100 nm of androst-4-ene-3,17-dione with or without 1 μm of letrozole. The firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase kit. The firefly luciferase data for each sample were normalized on the basis of transfection efficiency measured by Renilla luciferase activity. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—The nuclear extracts were prepared from MCF-7 as previously described (26Anderws N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-7 cells plated into 60-mm2 dishes were scraped into 1.5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were pelleted for 10 s and resuspended in 400 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9 at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm leupeptin) by flicking the tube. The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min and then vortexed for 10 s. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 s, and the supernatant fraction was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of cold Buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm leupeptin) and incubated in ice for 20 min for high salt extraction. The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction (containing DNA binding proteins) was stored at –70 °C. The yield was determined by the Bradford method (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar). The probe was generated by annealing single-stranded oligonucleotides, labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and then purified using Sephadex G50 spin columns. The DNA sequences used as probe or as cold competitors are the following (the nucleotide motifs of interest are underlined, and mutations are shown as lowercase letters): AP-1, ATGGCCTGAGTGAGTCACTTTGAATTC; mutated AP-1, ATGGCCTGAGTtcaTCACTTTGAATTC. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma Genosys (Cambridge, UK). The protein binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) with 50,000 cpm of labeled probe, 20 μg of MCF-7 nuclear protein, and 5 μg of poly(dI-dC). The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 20 min in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides. The entire reaction mixture was electrophoresed through a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× Tris-borate-EDTA for 3 h at 150 V. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography at –70 °C. Statistical Analysis—Each data point represents the mean ± S.E. of three experiments. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance using the STATPAC computer program. Leptin Effect on Cell Proliferation in MCF-7 Cell Line—We evaluated the effects of leptin on MCF-7 cell line proliferation by measuring changes in the rate of DNA synthesis ([3H]thymidine incorporation). We confirmed, as previously demonstrated (14Dieudonne M.N. Machinal-Quelin F. Serazin-Leroy V. Leneveu M.C. Pecquery R. Giudicelli Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 622-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), that leptin induces proliferation of the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. The [3H]thymidine incorporation was significantly increased upon treatment with 10 and 100 ng/ml of leptin (335 and 238% compared with control, which was set at 100%) (data not shown). Stimulation of Aromatase Activity by Leptin in MCF-7 Cells—Aromatase activity was measured by tritiated water assay in MCF-7 cells incubated for 48 and 96 h in the presence of different concentrations of leptin (10 and 100 ng/ml). A significant increase of the enzymatic activity was observed upon 10 and 100 ng/ml of leptin at both times investigated (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that this phenomenon was completely reversed by the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1). Leptin Enhances P450arom mRNA and Protein Expression in MCF-7 Cells—In the MCF-7 cell line we investigated the effects of leptin on P450arom mRNA levels by reverse transcription-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A, the expected transcript of 465 bp was clearly detected using primers designated to amplify the highly conserved sequence of P450arom, which includes the helical and aromatic regions. Incubation with 100 ng/ml of leptin for 48 h resulted in a significant increase of P450arom mRNA (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2). mRNA expression of the aromatase gene was normalized using the human housekeeping gene G3PDH (Fig. 2). Next, we performed Western blot analysis using an antibody against human placental P450arom. A 55-kDa specific protein in MCF-7 cells comigrated with R2C cells used as positive control. Treatment with 100 ng/ml of leptin for 48 h enhanced aromatase protein content (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3). Effect of Leptin on Expression of Human P450arom PII and P1.3/Luciferase Reporter Gene in MCF-7 Cells—Transient transfection experiments using vector containing human aromatase promoter II and 1.3 sequence fused to the luciferase reporter gene have been used to evaluate whether leptin was able to activate directly this promoter identified in epithelial breast cancer cells. A significant enhancement of promoter activity was observed in the tranfected cells exposed to both leptin concentrations tested at 48 and 96 h (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4). These findings led us to analyze the functional sequences present in the promoter and responsible of up-regulation induced by leptin. Because leptin signaling is able via Janus kinase 2 to activate STAT and MAPKs proteins, we focused our attention on the AP-1 motif as a possible effector of both signals. Evidence That MAPK and STAT Signals Are Involved in the Leptin-induced Up-regulation of Aromatase Expression—Clear evidence of the crucial role of the MAPK in mediating leptin stimulation effects on aromatase has been pointed out by the fact that either in the presence of MAPK inhibitor PD 98059 or in the cells transiently transfected with ERK2 dominant negative, the up-regulatory effects on aromatase enzymatic activity (Fig. 5, A and B), aromatase protein content (Fig. 5C), and aromatase promoter activity (Fig. 5, D and E) were completely abrogated. The role of the STAT proteins, as another signal transductional pathway activated by leptin, was investigated in MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with a dominant negative of STAT proteins. It is noteworthy that in these circumstances the enhancing effects induced by leptin on enzymatic activity (Fig. 6A), aromatase protein content (Fig. 6B), and aromatase promoter (Fig. 6C) were also inhibited. AP-1 Motif Is Involved in the Regulation of Aromatase Promoter—Functional assays were performed also with PII/P1.3 aromatase promoter constructs with AP-1-deleted sites at positions –498 (AP-1 –498), –935 (AP-1 –935), and both (AP-1 –498/–935). In these circumstances the leptin-induced activation on aromatase promoter was completely abrogated in all of the constructs tested (Fig. 7). These results address the AP-1 response element as a sequence crucial in mediating aromatase promoter activation upon leptin exposure. Effect of in Vitro Leptin Treatment on AP-1 DNA Binding Activity in Nuclear Extracts from MCF-7 Evaluated by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—To further characterize the role of AP-1 in modulating promoter aromatase activity, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a [32P]AP-1 consensus sequence in the presence of nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells. Leptin treatment induced a strong increase in AP-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 8, lane 4) compared with basal levels (Fig. 8, lane 1). The specificity of DNA binding activity for AP-1 was confirmed by the observation that a 100-fold excess of unlabeled AP-1 probe inhibited the binding of the labeled probe to the nuclear proteins tested (Fig. 8, lane 2), whereas the use of mutated AP-1 homologous sequence as cold competitor revealed no change in this complex (Fig. 8, lane 3). In the presence of either MAPK inhibitor PD 98059 or in the MCF-7 transiently transfected with ERK2 dominant negative the AP-1 DNA binding activity induced by leptin treatment was drastically reduced (Fig. 8, lanes 5 and 6), whereas expression of dominant negative STAT3 determined a slight reduction of this binding complex (Fig. 8, lane 7). The Enhanced Aromatization of Androst-4-ene-3,17-dione Induced by Leptin Potentiates Estradiol/ERα Signal in MCF-7 Cells—Transient transfection experiments using XETL plasmid was performed to investigate whether leptin was able to enhance the potency of an aromatizable androgen like androst-4-ene-3,17-dione (A) on estradiol/ERα signal in MCF-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 9, we observed that the addition of leptin (1000 ng/ml) was able to enhance XETL activation induced by androst-4-ene-3,17-dione alone (p < 0.001), which was inhibited by the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (data not shown). Mammary adipose tissue is an important source of paracrine mitogens and anti-mitogens including insulin-like growth factor, transforming growth factor α, cytochines (tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin γ) and leptin (28Ahima R.S. Flier J.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 327-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Recently leptin was reported to stimulate the proliferation of various cell types (29Islam M.S. Morton N.M. Hansson A. Emilsson V. Biochem. Biophys. Res."
https://openalex.org/W2109332684,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5% of reproductive aged women and is the leading cause of anovulatory infertility. A hallmark of PCOS is excessive theca cell androgen secretion, which is directly linked to the symptoms of PCOS. Our previous studies demonstrated that theca cells from PCOS ovaries maintained in long term culture persistently secrete significantly greater amounts of androgens than normal theca cells, suggesting an intrinsic abnormality. Furthermore, previous studies suggested that ovarian hyperandrogenemia is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. However, the genes responsible for ovarian hyperandrogenemia of PCOS have not been identified. In this present study, we carried out microarray analysis to define the gene networks involved in excess androgen synthesis by the PCOS theca cells in order to identify candidate PCOS genes. Our analysis revealed that PCOS theca cells have a gene expression profile that is distinct from normal theca cells. Included in the cohort of genes with increased mRNA abundance in PCOS theca cells were aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 and retinol dehydrogenase 2, which play a role in all-trans-retinoic acid biosynthesis and the transcription factor GATA6. We demonstrated that retinoic acid and GATA6 increased the expression of 17α-hydroxylase, providing a functional link between altered gene expression and intrinsic abnormalities in PCOS theca cells. Thus, our analyses have 1) defined a stable molecular phenotype of PCOS theca cells, 2) suggested new mechanisms for excess androgen synthesis by PCOS theca cells, and 3) identified new candidate genes that may be involved in the genetic etiology of PCOS.

Res. 1998; 53: 217-256PubMed Google Scholar). The PCOS ovaries are enlarged bilaterally and contain follicles arrested at a size no larger than 10 mm embedded in a dense stroma (3Franks S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). The theca layers of these follicles are prominent and represent the major source of the increased circulating androgens in PCOS women (2Legro R.S. Spielman R. Urbanek M. Driscoll D. Strauss III, J.F. Dunaif A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 217-256PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that the ovarian hyperandrogenemia associated with PCOS clusters in families and appears to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (2Legro R.S. Spielman R. Urbanek M. Driscoll D. Strauss III, J.F. Dunaif A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 217-256PubMed Google Scholar). However, the genetic etiology of PCOS has not been defined. Studies using freshly isolated and short and long term cultures of theca cells have demonstrated that androgen synthesis is increased in PCOS compared with normal theca cells, suggesting that this PCOS phenotype is an intrinsic property of the theca cell (1Ehrmann D.A.

Increased theca cell steroidogenesis has been attributed to increased activity of the 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II enzymes (1Ehrmann D.A.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 946-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and increased expression of the P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc) and CYP17 mRNAs. Furthermore, CYP17 promoter activity is increased in PCOS compared with normal theca cells (6Nelson V.L. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 946-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wickenheisser J.K. Quinn P.G. Nelson V.L. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

In contrast, the abundance of the mRNAs for steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), which controls the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis (8Christenson L.K. Strauss III, J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type V, which is the theca cell enzyme that is thought to be responsible for the reduction of androsterone into testosterone (9Luu-The V. Dufort I. Pelletier G. Labrie F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 171: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as well as the transcriptional activity of the StAR promoter, are not different between normal and PCOS theca cells (6Nelson V.L. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 946-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wickenheisser J.K. Quinn P.G. Nelson V.L. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M.

Thus, these collective studies have defined a stable steroidogenic phenotype for the PCOS theca cell that includes altered expression of a subset of proteins that are important for androgen synthesis. Steroidogenesis in the ovarian theca cell is primarily regulated by luteinizing hormone (LH), which upon binding to the LH receptor promotes increased steroid production through activation of cAMP-dependent signal transduction cascades (11Leung P.C. Steele G.L. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 476-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Women with PCOS tend to have elevated levels of LH (3Franks S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence that PCOS theca cells may be hypersensitive to LH action (1Ehrmann D.A. Barnes R.B. Rosenfield R.L. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 322-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the differences in CYP17 and P450scc mRNA abundance and CYP17 promoter activity in PCOS theca cells are enhanced when cells are treated with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (6Nelson V.L. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 946-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wickenheisser J.K. Quinn P.G. Nelson V.L. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 2304-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), which mimics LH-dependent signal transduction in theca cells through production of the second messenger cAMP. However, the transcription of the StAR gene and other genes encoding steroidogenic proteins is also regulated by LH and cAMP (12Christenson L.K. Johnson P.F. McAllister J.M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26591-26598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Strauss III, J.F. Kallen C.B. Christenson L.K. Watari H. Devoto L. Arakane F. Kiriakidou M. Sugawara T. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1999; 54: 369-394PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that a downstream component of the cAMP-dependent signal transduction cascade that affects CYP17 and P450scc but not StAR gene transcription is affected in PCOS theca cells. Although the studies described above have identified important correlations between increased steroidogenic enzyme gene expression and increased androgen biosynthesis in PCOS theca cells, they have not disclosed the upstream genes that are important for increased transcription. Furthermore, the global changes in theca cell gene expression or the alterations in gene networks or signal transduction cascades that may play an important role in the manifestation of other PCOS theca cell phenotypes, which may contribute to arrested follicular growth, have not been defined. In order to define the genes that are differentially expressed in PCOS theca cells and to identify new candidate genes that may contribute to the etiology of PCOS, we compared gene expression profiles of normal and PCOS theca cells using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Theca Cell Culturing and RNA Isolation—Theca cells were isolated from 3–5-mm follicles from the ovaries of four normal women and five PCOS patients, and independent cultures were established using the cells that were isolated from each woman as previously described (6Nelson V.L. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 946-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wickenheisser J.K. Quinn P.G. Nelson V.L. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 2304-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The diagnosis of PCOS and the steroidogenic capacity of each sample was determined as previously described (6Nelson V.L. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 946-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wickenheisser J.K. Quinn P.G. Nelson V.L. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

For microarray hybridizations and RT-PCR experiments, fourth passage cells from the four normal and the five PCOS theca cell samples were cultured for 48 h in serum-free medium, which contained no treatment (untreated), 20 μm forskolin (Sigma), and/or 5 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma). After treatment, the medium was removed, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Dehydroepiandosterone (DHEA) Radioimmunoassay—Fourth passage normal and PCOS theca cells were grown to 80% confluence in six-well tissue culture plates. The cells were transferred to serum-free medium and were untreated, treated with 20 μm forskolin, treated with 5 μm atRA, or treated with 5 μm atRA and 20 μm forskolin. After 72 h, the medium was collected, and DHEA levels were detected with the Coat-A-Count DHEA Radioimmunoassay kit (Diagonistic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA). Microarray Hybridization—The Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U95A, U133A, and U133B microarray chips (Affymetrix) were hybridized at the University of Pennsylvania Microarray Core Facility. Briefly, biotin-labeled cRNA, which was generated from four different normal and five different PCOS theca cell samples that were untreated or forskolin-stimulated, was fragmented according to Affymetrix protocols. The fragmented cRNA from each sample was hybridized to individual Affymetrix U95A gene array chips using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 protocol (Affymetrix), the hybridized chips were scanned using the Agilent GeneArray Scanner (Affymetrix), and a scaling factor was applied to each chip using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software to normalize the mean raw fluorescence intensity for each chip to an average base-line fluorescence level. The same fragmented cRNA from each theca cell sample was subsequently hybridized to individual Affymetrix U133A and Affymetrix U133B gene array chips, and the hybridized chips were scanned and normalized as described. Gene Expression Analysis—Each transcript on the U95A, U133A, and U133B chip was determined to be present or absent in each theca cell sample using the statistical expression algorithm of the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software package (15Affymetrix, Inc.Affymetrix Microarray Suite, Version 5.0. Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA2001Google Scholar) and was identified as expressed in the normal or PCOS theca cell samples if it was called present in at least three samples in each group. The average normalized fluorescence intensity for each expressed transcript in the four normal or the five PCOS samples was determined using GeneSpring 4.2 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA) and expressed as a ratio of the mean normalized fluorescence intensity for the transcript in PCOS theca cells to the mean normalized fluorescence intensity for the transcript in normal theca cells (PCOS-to-normal ratio). The S.E. associated with each transcript's average normalized fluorescence intensity was determined using a cross-gene error model generated by the GeneSpring software program (16Silicon Genetics Inc. GeneSpring, Version 4.2. Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA2002Google Scholar). Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in the average normalized fluorescence intensity of each transcript between the normal and PCOS samples were determined by parametric testing, which used the cross-gene error model (16Silicon Genetics Inc. GeneSpring, Version 4.2. Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA2002Google Scholar). The gene associated with each differentially expressed transcript on the U95A, U133A, and U133B chips was identified, and the function of each of gene was determined. Reverse Transcription, PCR, and Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA (5 μg) which was isolated from the same theca cell samples that were used for the microarray hybridization was treated with DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) and reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus (Promega) as previously described (10Nelson V.L. Qin Kn K.N. Rosenfield R.L. Wood J.R. Penning T.M. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5925-5933Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The resulting cDNA was used to carry out PCR amplification of prostate short-chain dehydrogenase reductase (5′-CCACCTCTACTAAAAAATTGTGTATATCTTTG and 5′-TGTGGCTGTTTTGAACTTTGTGA), retinol dehydrogenase 4 (5′-GGCACCAATCCCACTCCTT and 5′-CCCGTTTTTCAGCTGCGTAA), cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (5′-TGGCCTTGGTGCCTCTTG and 5′-TGACTTCGAAACCGTGCAAA), and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2 (5′-GGTCACTGGGATGCCTCTTG and 5′-GCTCTTGCAGCCATTCCTCTT). The cDNA was also subjected to quantitative PCR amplification for 28 different transcripts (Supplemental Table 3) that were identified as present in theca cell samples by the Affymetrix U133A or U133B chip. For each of the 28 transcripts, primers were designed using the Primer Express 1.5 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Each primer set was tested empirically to determine the maximal concentration of primers that could be used to produce specific amplification of the target sequence in the absence of primer dimer amplification. For each of the 28 targets, quantitative PCRs were carried out using equivalent dilutions of each cDNA sample, the fluorescent indicator SYBR green, the empirically determined concentration of each primer, and the Applied Biosystems model 7700 sequence detector PCR machine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as previously described (10Nelson V.L. Qin Kn K.N. Rosenfield R.L. Wood J.R. Penning T.M. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5925-5933Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To verify that only a single PCR product was generated for each amplified transcript, the multicomponent data for each sample was subsequently analyzed using the Dissociation Curves 1.0 program (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To account for differences in starting material, quantitative PCR was also carried out for each cDNA sample using the Applied Biosystems human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 20× primer and probe reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). These quantitative PCRs defined a threshold cycle (C t) of detection for the target or the GAPDH in each cDNA sample. In order to convert this C t value into a relative abundance of target and GAPDH in each cDNA sample, quantitative PCR for the target and for the GAPDH was also carried out using serial dilutions of theca cell cDNA. An arbitrary value of template was assigned to the highest standard, and corresponding values were assigned to the subsequent dilutions, and these relative values were plotted against the C t value determined for each dilution to generate a standard curve. The relative amount of target and GAPDH in each sample was then determined using the equation, relativeabundance=10(Ct-b)/m(Eq. 1) where b represents the y intercept, and m is the slope. The relative abundance of the target was divided by the relative abundance of GAPDH in each sample to generate a normalized abundance for each of the 28 transcripts tested. Analysis of variance was then used to determine the mean and S.E. of the normalized abundance of each target in normal and PCOS theca cells. The nonparametric, Wilcoxon (rank sums) test was carried out to determine whether differences in the normalized abundance for each target between normal and PCOS samples were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Enzyme Assay—Whole cell extracts from two independent normal and two independent PCOS theca cell samples were assayed for retinol dehydrogenase activity. Briefly, 100 μg of each protein sample was combined with 178 pmol of [11,12-3H]all-trans-vitamin A alcohol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 100 μm NAD+ (Sigma) in buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.02% sodium azide) containing protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1). The retinoids were collected in the organic phase, which was evaporated using a stream of liquid nitrogen. Each sample was resuspended in 50 μl of ethanol. Each sample was applied to a Silica-Rapid-Platten Woelm F 254 thin layer chromatography plate. In addition, 2 μmols of retinaldehyde (Sigma) was also applied to the plate. The retinol and retinaldehyde were resolved on the plate using a petroleum ether/acetone (82:18) solvent, the plate was sprayed with EN3HANCE spray surface autoradiography enhancer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the retinaldehyde was detected by autoradiography. The radioactive retinaldehyde in each sample was counted, the background levels were subtracted, and the mean fmol of retinaldehyde/mg of protein/h of incubation was determined. Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear extracts from two independent normal and three independent PCOS theca cells samples, which were untreated or treated with 20 μm forskolin, were probed for the presence of GATA-6 protein. The GATA-6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used as described by the manufacturer for immunoblot assays. The 64- and 52-kDa immunoreactive bands were detected using SuperSignal West Pico Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce). Plasmids—The promoter region of CYP17 was amplified from genomic DNA using the primers 5′-GAACGAGCAAGCCTTCATCG-3′ (–1876 to –1857) and 5′-GACAGCAGTGGAGTAGAAGAGC-3′ (+12 to +33). Likewise, the promoter region of P450scc was amplified from genomic DNA using the primers 5′-GGAATGTGGGGCTGCGTAGA-3′ (–1843 to –1824) and 5′-CAGCTGTGACTGTACCTGCT-3′ (+12 to +31). Each amplified promoter product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), excised using the restriction endonucleases KpnI and XhoI, and ligated into the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega) to generate pGL3.CYP17–1876 and pGL3.CYP11A-1843. Sequence integrity and insert orientation were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pGL2.StAR-885 reporter plasmid has been previously described (17Sugawara T. Holt J.A. Kiriakidou M. Strauss III, J.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9052-9059Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). pcDNAG6, encoding the full-length murine GATA-6 was a generous gift from Dr. Edward Morrisey (18Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pRL-TK (Promega) were purchased. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—HeLa cells, which do not express GATA-6 mRNA (19Bruno M.D. Korfhagen T.R. Liu C. Morrisey E.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1043-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transient co-transfection experiments, 5.5 × 104 cells were seeded into each well of a 12-well plate. After 24 h, 500 ng of pGL3.CYP17–1876, CYP11A-1843, or pGL2.StAR-885; 25 ng of pcDNAG6 or pcDNA3; and 20 ng of pRL-TK were transiently transfected into cells using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) per the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, the transfected cells were lysed, and the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The firefly luciferase activity for each sample was normalized using the Renilla luciferase activity. Analysis of variance was used to calculate the mean and S.D. of the normalized luciferase activity for each experimental group in three independent experiments. The unpaired Student's t test was used to detect statistically significant differences (p value < 0.05) between pcDNAG6 and pcDNAG3-transfected cells. PCOS Theca Cells Exhibit a Distinct Gene Expression Profile Compared with Normal Theca Cells—Previous studies indicated that excess androgen synthesis is an intrinsic property of PCOS theca cells (6Nelson V.L. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 946-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wickenheisser J.K. Quinn P.G. Nelson V.L. Legro R.S. Strauss III, J.F. McAllister J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 2304-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In agreement with these previous findings, the PCOS theca cell samples used in this study also consistently produced higher levels of DHEA than the normal theca cell samples (Fig. 1), consistent with the possibility that PCOS and normal theca cells have distinct molecular phenotypes. To assess the molecular phenotype of these normal and PCOS theca cells, we carried out gene expression profiling using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. RNA was collected from four independent normal and five independent PCOS theca cell samples, was hybridized to individual Affymetrix U133 gene chips, and the gene expression profile of each sample was determined using the GeneSpring 4.2 data-mining software program. Of the 45,000 transcripts interrogated on the U133 chips, 15,267 (∼34%) transcripts were identified as present in either normal or PCOS theca cells, which is consistent with gene expression profiles of other tissues (20Brown V. Jin P. Ceman S. Darnell J.C. O'Donnell W.T. Tenenbaum S.A. Jin X. Feng Y. Wilkinson K.D. Keene J.D. Darnell R.B. Warren S.T.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1913-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). When the gene expression profiles from the normal and PCOS theca cell samples were compared, 346 genes had a statistically significant difference in mRNA abundance between normal and PCOS theca cells (Fig. 2A). These 346 transcripts represented only a small percentage (2.3%) of genes expressed in theca cells. Furthermore, only 106 of the genes had greater than a 2-fold difference in gene expression, and only four of the genes had greater than a 5-fold difference in mRNA abundance between normal and PCOS theca cells, demonstrating that the magnitude of differential gene expression between normal and PCOS theca cells is modest. When the 346 genes were organized into functional categories, signal transduction molecules, genes associated with cellular metabolism, transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules, cell surface antigens, ion channels, and expressed sequence tags were among the groups of genes with altered mRNA abundance in PCOS theca cells (Supplemental Table 4). One of the transcription factors that exhibited a highly significant increase in mRNA abundance in the PCOS theca cells was GATA-6, which has been shown to regulate StAR expression in the porcine ovary (23Gillio-Meina C. Hui Y.Y. LaVoie H.A. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 412-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for this transcription factor in increased PCOS theca cell steroidogenesis. Several of the differentially expressed genes could also be classified into specific signaling cascades or gene networks. For example, the mRNA levels of retinol dehydrogenase 2 (RoDH2) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 (ALDH6), which are involved in the conversion of retinol to atRA (24Rexer B.N. Zheng W.L. Ong D.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7065-7070PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chetyrkin S.V. Hu J. Gough W.H. Dumaual N. Kedishvili N.Y. Arch. Biochem.

Duvic M. Chandraratna R.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 269-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), were increased in PCOS theca cells. In addition, inhibin βA, which is a member of the TGF-β superfamily of growth factors (28Gaddy-Kurten D. Tsuchida K. Vale W. Recent Prog. Horm.

Induction of humoral responses to CA125 leads to increased survival times in patients with this form of cancer, suggesting a potential role for this mucin in tumor progression. In this study, oligosaccharides linked to CA125 derived from the human ovarian tumor cell line OVCAR-3 were subjected to rigorous biophysical analysis. Sequencing of the O-glycans indicates the presence of both core type 1 and type 2 glycans. An unusual feature is the expression of branched core 1 antennae in the core type 2 glycans. CA125 is also N-glycosylated, expressing primarily high mannose and complex bisecting type N-linked glycans. High mannose type glycans include Man5-Man9GlcNAc2. The predominant N-glycans are the biantennary, triantennary, and tetraantennary bisecting type oligosaccharides. Remarkably, the N-glycosylation profiles of CA125 and the envelope glycoprotein gp120 (derived from H9 lymphoblastoid cells chronically infected with HIV-1) are very similar. The CA125-associated N-glycans have also recently been implicated in crucial recognition events involved in both the innate and adaptive arms of the cell-mediated immune response. CA125 may therefore induce specific immunomodulatory effects by employing its carbohydrate sequences as functional groups, thereby promoting tumor progression. Immunotherapy directed against CA125 may attenuate these immunosuppressive effects, leading to the prolonged survival of patients with this extremely serious form of cancer.

Immunotherapy directed against CA125 may attenuate these immunosuppressive effects, leading to the prolonged survival of patients with this extremely serious form of cancer. CA125 is a mucin first detected by Bast et al. using the monoclonal antibody OC125 (1Bast Jr., R.C. Feeney M. Lazarus H. Nadler L.M. Colvin R.B. Knapp R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 1331-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar, 2Bast Jr., R.C. Klug T.L. St. John E. Jenison E. Niloff J.M. Lazarus H. Berkowitz R.S. Leavitt T. Griffiths C.T. Parker L. Zurawski Jr., V.R. Knapp R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). CA125 is also a significant tumor marker associated with many human cancers but is most widely utilized for the diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer (3Maggino T. Gadducci A. Eur. J. Gynaecol. Oncol. 2000; 21: 64-69PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study indicates that the induction of anti-CA125 responses in ovarian cancer patients leads to their prolonged survival compared with untreated controls (4Wagner U. Kohler S. Reinartz S. Giffels P. Huober J. Renke K. Schlebusch H. Biersack H.J. Mobus V. Kreienberg R. Bauknecht T. Krebs D. Wallwiener D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1154-1162PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, CA125 could act as a targeting antigen to elicit antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity against ovarian tumor cells. Another possibility is that CA125 plays some key physiological role that promotes tumor development in individuals with ovarian cancer. Its complete biochemical analysis is therefore crucial for defining its potential functional roles. CA125 is an extremely complex molecule from both the proteomic and glycomic perspectives (5Davis H.M. Zurawski Jr., V.R. Bast Jr., R.C. Klug T.L. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 6143-6148PubMed Google Scholar). Recent sequencing of its gene has yielded substantial information about the peptide backbone of this mucin (6Yin B.W. Lloyd K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27371-27375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 7O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Dennis R.A. Santin A.D. York L. Tumour Biol. 2001; 22: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). CA125 is composed of an N-terminal domain, a tandem repeat region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The N-terminal domain of CA125 consists of 1637 amino acids (8O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Shigemasa K. Tumour Biol. 2002; 23: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The tandem repeat domain is made up of 40–60 repeats of 156 amino acids (7O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Dennis R.A. Santin A.D. York L. Tumour Biol. 2001; 22: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of CA125 consists of 256 amino acids. Recently, an additional 10,431-amino acid extension of the N-terminal domain was reported (8O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Shigemasa K. Tumour Biol. 2002; 23: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, the core protein sequence of CA125 could have a mass approaching 2.5 million Da (8O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Shigemasa K. Tumour Biol. 2002; 23: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). CA125 is also highly enriched in serine and threonine residues, consistent with its recent designation as the MUC16 mucin (6Yin B.W. Lloyd K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27371-27375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate content of CA125 based on its mass is estimated to be ∼24–28% (5Davis H.M. Zurawski Jr., V.R. Bast Jr., R.C. Klug T.L. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 6143-6148PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lloyd K.O. Yin B.W. Kudryashov V. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 842-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), with the majority being O-linked glycans (7O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Dennis R.A. Santin A.D. York L. Tumour Biol. 2001; 22: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This very high degree of glycosylation suggests that the average molecular mass of CA125 may be 3.5 million Da (8O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Shigemasa K. Tumour Biol. 2002; 23: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Complete structural analysis of the CA125 molecule also requires sequencing of its oligosaccharides and localization of its glycosylation sites. Previously, Lloyd et al. identified several O-linked glycans expressed on CA125 (9Lloyd K.O. Yin B.W. Kudryashov V. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 842-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the results obtained were based solely on indirect structural analysis. Moreover, this approach did not yield complete characterization of all the oligosaccharides linked to CA125. Unambiguous sequencing of CA125-associated glycans requires the use of precise biophysical methods. We have characterized the glycans associated with CA125 using this very rigorous approach. The analysis detailed in this report reveals several notable structural features of the O-glycans associated with CA125. Surprisingly, the data also confirm robust N-glycosylation of CA125, supporting previous studies suggesting this possibility (5Davis H.M. Zurawski Jr., V.R. Bast Jr., R.C. Klug T.L. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 6143-6148PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nagata A. Hirota N. Sakai T. Fujimoto M. Komoda T. Tumour Biol. 1991; 12: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This sequencing data, other more recent immunological findings, and the observed beneficial effects of vaccination strategies directed against CA125 suggest the distinct possibility that the carbohydrate sequences linked to this mucin may play a crucial role in promoting modulation of the immune response in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Materials—The epithelial ovarian tumor cell line, OVCAR-3, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The anti-CA125 monoclonal antibody, OC125, was the generous gift from Dr. Robert Bast of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX. Reagents for gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis were purchased from Bio-Rad. Fetal calf serum used for tissue culture was obtained from Atlanta Biologicals, and RPMI 1640 media was from Invitrogen. All other chemicals and reagents used in this study were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Isolation of CA125 from OVCAR-3 Cells—Isolation of CA125 was performed as described previously (11Schultes B.C. Baum R.P. Niesen A. Noujaim A.A. Madiyalakan R. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1998; 46: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, OVCAR-3 cells were cultured in 225-cm2 tissue culture flasks using RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum until the cells were confluent. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium that was devoid of phenol red. The cells were then cultured for 5 days in this medium, after which the culture medium was removed and saved for extraction of CA125. Fresh, serum-free, non-phenol red RPMI 1640 medium was added to the tissue culture flasks, and the process was repeated two more times. The spent medium was pooled and dialyzed through a 3,500 molecular weight cutoff membrane against water containing 0.02% sodium azide. Material retained in the dialysis bag was lyophilized and resuspended in a small volume of 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Total protein content of this material was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). 10 mg of total protein in 500 μl of 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer was loaded on a 1× 45-cm Sephacryl S500 HR size exclusion column. The column was eluted with 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, and 0.8-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were monitored for absorbance at 280 nm. The two peaks obtained were pooled, lyophilized, and monitored for CA125 using Western blot analysis. CA125 isolated from different column runs was pooled, and the amount of this tumor marker was determined by using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Glycotech). Electrophoretic and Western Blot Analysis of CA125—Electrophoresis of CA125 under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) was routinely conducted on 5 or 7.5% separating and 3% or 5% stacking gels. Silver staining of the gels was conducted according to the supplier's (Bio-Rad) specifications. Gels were stained with PAS 1The abbreviations used are: PAS, periodic acid-Schiff; CAD, collisionally activated decomposition; ConA, concanavalin A; DC-SIGN, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin; ES, electrospray; FAB, fast atom bombardment; GC, gas chromatography; Hex, hexose; HexNAc, N-acetylhexosamine; LacNAc, N-acetyllactosamine; MALDI-TOF, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MS, mass spectrometry; NK, natural killer; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F. reagent to detect glycoproteins. For Western blot analysis, CA125 separated on denaturing gels was transferred to nylon membranes using Bio-Rad mini-gel apparatus. The nylon membranes were preincubated with bovine serum albumin and then layered with OC125 for 1 h. A goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection of the CA125 bands with chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). To detect binding of CA125 to ConA, the mucin was transferred to nylon membranes as described above. After preincubation with bovine serum albumin, the membranes were layered with 1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-labeled ConA (E-Y Laboratories) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin solution. After incubation for 1 h, the membrane was washed thoroughly, and lectin binding to CA125 was detected by chemiluminescence. Digestion of CA125 with PNGase F for Western Blotting Experiments—Lyophilized CA125 (50 μg) was dissolved in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.4) containing 5 mm mercaptoethanol. 10 milliunits of PNGase F (EC 3.5.1.52; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. A parallel experiment was conducted under the same conditions, except that PNGase F was omitted. Reduction and Carboxymethylation—Reduction and carboxymethylation was carried out as described (12Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A.

CA125 was reduced in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing dithiothreitol in a 4-fold molar excess over the number of disulfide bridges. Reduction was performed under nitrogen atmosphere at 37 °C for 1 h. Carboxymethylation was carried out in iodoacetic acid (5-fold molar excess over dithiothreitol), and the reaction was allowed to proceed under a nitrogen atmosphere at 37 °C for 1 h. Carboxymethylation was terminated by dialysis against 4 × 2.5 liters of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, at 4 °C for 48 h. After dialysis, the CA125 was lyophilized. Tryptic Digestion—CA125 was incubated with trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4; Sigma) at a 50:1 ratio (w/w) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, for 5 h at 37 °C. The digestion was terminated by placement in boiling water for 3 min, followed by lyophilization. PNGase F Digestion of Tryptic Glycopeptides—PNGaseF digestion was carried out in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, for 16 h at 37 °C with 3 units of enzyme. The reaction was terminated by lyophilization, and the released N-glycans were separated from peptides and O-glycopeptides by Sep-Pak C18 (Waters Corp.) as described (12Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). Reductive Elimination—O-glycans were released by reductive elimination, which was performed in 400 μl of sodium borohydride (1 mg/ml in 0.05 m sodium hydroxide) at 45 °C for 16 h. The reaction was terminated by dropwise addition of glacial acetic acid followed by Dowex chromatography and borate removal (12Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). Sequential Exoglycosidase Digestion—The released glycans were incubated with the following enzymes and conditions: neuraminidase (Vibro cholerae, EC 3.2.1.18; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 50 milliunits in 100 μl of 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.5; α-mannosidase (jack bean, EC 3.2.1.24; Glyko), 0.5 units in 100 μl of 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.6; β-galactosidase (bovine testes, EC 3.2.1.23; Calbiochem), 10 milliunits in 100 μl of 50 mm ammonium formate buffer, pH 4.6; and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (jack bean, EC 3.2.1.30; Calbiochem), 0.2 units in 100 μl of 50 mm ammonium formate buffer, pH 4.6. All of the enzyme digestions were carried out at 37 °C for 48 h with a fresh aliquot of enzyme added after 24 h. Each digestion was terminated by boiling for 3 min before lyophilization. Endo-β-galactosidase Digestion—Endo-β-galactosidase (Escherichia freundii, EC.3.2.1.103; Calbiochem) digestion was carried out in 100 μl of 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.5, 10 milliunits at 37 °C for 48 h with a fresh aliquot of enzyme added after 24 h. Periodate Cleavage—A solution of 40 mm sodium periodate in 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.5, was prepared. Released and dried O-glycans were dissolved in 100 μl of this reagent. The reaction was allowed to proceed in the dark at 0 °C for 48 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2–3 μl of ethylene glycol and incubation in the dark at room temperature for 30–60 min. The products of the periodate cleavage were lyophilized and reduced with 200 μl of sodium borohydride (10 mg/ml) in 2 m ammonium hydroxide. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 2 h and terminated by the dropwise addition of glacial acetic acid. This sample was subjected to Dowex chromatography, borate removal, permethylation, and Sep-Pak cleanup using an acetonitrile gradient as described (12Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). Methanolysis—The reagent was prepared by bubbling dry hydrochloric acid gas into methanol as described in a previous study (13Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). After cooling, 20 μl of this reagent was added to the permethylated sample. The reaction was performed at room temperature for 15 min and terminated by drying under a nitrogen stream. The sample was then resuspended in methanol, and an aliquot of 1 μl was removed for MALDI-TOF analysis. The free hydroxyl groups were then deuteromethylated and subjected to linkage analysis. Chemical Derivatization for FAB-MS, GC-MS, MALDI-TOF, and CAD-MS/MS Analysis—Permethylation was performed using the sodium hydroxide procedure as described previously (12Dell A. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Etienne A.T. Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 187-222Google Scholar). Briefly, sodium hydroxide pellets were crushed with dimethyl sulfoxide to form a slurry. An aliquot of this slurry was added to dried glycans along with 1 ml of methyl iodide. The reaction was terminated by the addition of water, and permethylated glycans were recovered by chloroform extraction. The chloroform layer was washed several times with water to remove any impurities. Partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared from permethylated samples for GC-MS linkage analysis as described (14Albersheim P. Nevins D.J. English P.D. Karr A. Carbohydr. Res. 1967; 5: 340-345Crossref Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). Briefly, the permethylated glycans were hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 121 °C, reduced with 10 mg/ml sodium borodeuteride in 2 m aqueous ammonium hydroxide at room temperature for 2 h, and then acetylated with acetic anhydride at 100 °C for 1h. FAB-MS Analysis—FAB mass spectra were acquired using a Fisons Instruments VG ZAB-2SE-2FPD mass spectrometer fitted with a cesium ion gun operated at 30 kV. The matrix used was monothioglycerol, and all samples were dissolved in methanol prior to loading. Data acquisition and processing were performed using VG Analytical Opus software. MALDI-TOF Analysis—MALDI data were acquired using a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager-DE™ STR mass spectrometer in the reflectron mode with delayed extraction. A permethylated sample was dissolved in 10 μl of methanol, and 1 μl of dissolved sample was premixed with 1 μl of matrix (2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid) before loading onto a metal plate. GC-MS Analysis—Linkage analysis of partially methylated alditol acetates was carried out on a Fisons Instruments MD 800 apparatus fitted with a RTX-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm internal diameter; Restek Corp.). The sample was dissolved in hexanes and injected onto the column at 65 °C. The column was maintained at this temperature for 1 min and then heated to 290 °C at a rate of 8 °C per min. CAD-ES-MS/MS Analysis—CAD-ES-MS/MS spectra were acquired using Q-TOF (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) and Q-STAR (Applied Biosystems) instruments. The permethylated glycans were dissolved in methanol before loading into a spray capillary coated with a thin layer of gold/palladium, inner diameter 2 μl (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark). A potential of 1.5 kV was applied to a nanoflow tip to produce a flow rate of 10–30 nl/min. The drying gas used was N2 and the collision gas was argon, with the collision gas pressure maintained at 10–4 millibar. Collision energies varied depending on the size of the carbohydrate, typically between 30 and 90 eV. Isolation of CA125 from OVCAR-3 Cells—An established two-step isolation procedure was utilized to purify CA125 from the spent media of OVCAR-3 cells (11Schultes B.C. Baum R.P. Niesen A. Noujaim A.A. Madiyalakan R. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1998; 46: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the first step, the media were dialyzed against a 3.5-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane to remove low molecular weight impurities. The dialyzed material was lyophilized and separated on a Sephacryl S500 HR size exclusion column equilibrated in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Fractions obtained from this column were monitored for absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. In a typical run, two peaks were obtained (Fig. 1). CA125 was detected exclusively in the first peak when the fractions were analyzed by Western blot (data not shown). This peak was pooled, lyophilized, and used for further analysis. Total protein content in this sample was determined. Approximately 2.5–3 million units of CA125 were detected per milligram of protein by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Similar values have been reported for highly enriched CA125 preparations isolated in other studies (6Yin B.W. Lloyd K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27371-27375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic and Western blot analyses were initially employed to determine the purity of the isolated CA125 sample. Silver stain analysis (Fig. 2A) indicated a broad band above the 200-kDa molecular mass marker. Some staining was also observed in the stacking gel as reported previously (9Lloyd K.O. Yin B.W. Kudryashov V. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 842-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These high molecular mass bands were easily detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-CA125 monoclonal antibody OC125 (Fig. 2B). Similar high molecular mass bands were also detected by PAS staining (Fig. 2C). In addition to the band corresponding to CA125, some low molecular mass bands were also detected in the silver stained gel (Fig. 2A). Such lower molecular mass bands are always present in CA125 preparations examined in other studies (6Yin B.W. Lloyd K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27371-27375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, these lower molecular mass bands did not bind OC125 and were also not stained by PAS, confirming that they are not glycosylated (Fig. 2, B and C) and, therefore, would not interfere with oligosaccharide sequencing. Confirmation that the high molecular mass band was CA125 was provided by proteomics analysis. ES-MS/MS analysis of an in-gel tryptic digest of this band gave data that corresponded to the peptide LTLLRPEK, which is a tandem repeat sequence that occurs 27 times in the CA125 sequence (7O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Dennis R.A. Santin A.D. York L. Tumour Biol. 2001; 22: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In a complementary experiment, MALDI-TOF analysis of a tryptic digest of a sample that had not been subjected to SDS-PAGE gave molecular ions mapping to residues 2451–2479, 4637–4665, 5105–5133, 6651–6661, 6819–6847, 7287–7315, 8223–8251, 9938–9966, 10094–10122, 10862–10872, and 10406–10434 that have been shown to be present in CA125 (6Yin B.W. Lloyd K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27371-27375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Peptides from proteins or glycoproteins other than CA125 were not detected in this analysis. The restricted PAS staining of the high molecular mass band within this preparation in combination with this proteomics data provides very strong evidence that the glycans analyzed in this study are covalently linked to CA125. Structural Analysis Strategy—The overall structural strategy employed to characterize CA125 glycosylation is summarized in Scheme 1. Oligosaccharides were derivatized and recovered in 35 and 50% acetonitrile fractions from the C18 Sep-Pak cartridge prior to analysis by FAB-MS, MALDI-TOF, CAD-MS/MS, and linkage analysis. Data from these experiments were complemented by sequential exoglycosidase digestions, periodate oxidation, and methanolysis experiments. Analyses of PNGase F Digests Reveals Abundant N-Glycosylation of CA125—N-glycans were released from tryptic digests of reduced carboxymethylated CA125 by digestion with PNGase F. Fig. 3 shows the MALDI data of the 50% acetonitrile fraction with the assignments given in Table I. The MALDI data obtained from the 35% acetonitrile fraction (data not shown) are similar to the 50% fraction, except that the signals are of lower abundance. The data indicate that CA125 is rich in N-glycans, having compositions consistent with high mannose structures (Hex5–9HexNAc2), and complex type structures of compositions NeuAc0–1Fuc0–2Hex5–7HexNAc4–7. After α-mannosidase digestion, signals corresponding to high mannose structures disappeared, and the putative complex type structures were unaffected. Notable features of the data include the following. (i) Complex type structures contribute to over 80% of the N-glycans with the remainder being high mannose. (ii) The most abundant complex type N-glycans have compositions consistent with mono-fucosylated bisected biantennary structures (m/z 2243, 2285, 2489, 2605, and 2850). (iii) The higher molecular mass components have compositions that are consistent with tri and tetraantennary structures; this result was confirmed by observing mass shifts after β-galactosidase digestion (data not shown). (iv) Two minor components have compositions consistent with fucose being present both on the core and on one of the antennae (m/z 2664 and 2780). (v) The presence of a minor A-type fragment ion in the FAB spectrum (data not shown) at m/z 638 (FucHexHexNAc+) provides supportive evidence for fucosylated antennae. (vi) The level of sialylation is relatively low, with no components carrying more than a single sialic acid.Table IAssignments of molecular ([M + Na]+) ions observed in the MALDI spectrum of permethylated N-glycans derived from the 50% acetonitrile fraction of CA125Signal (m/z)Assignment1579Hex5HexNAc21783Hex6HexNAc21987Hex7HexNAc22069Hex5HexNAc42191Hex8HexNAc22243FucHex5HexNAc42285FucHex4HexNAc52315Hex5HexNAc52489FucHex5HexNAc52605NeuAcFucHex5HexNAc42664Fuc2Hex5HexNAc52694FucHex6HexNAc52780NeuAcFuc2Hex5HexNAc42850NeuAcFucHex5HexNAc52938FucHex6HexNAc63054NeuAcFucHex6HexNAc53143FucHex7HexNAc63300NeuAcFucHex6HexNAc63388FucHex7HexNAc73503NeuAcFucHex7HexNAc6 Open table in a new tab CAD-ES-MS/MS Defines Sites of Fucosylation—Collisionally activated decomposition electrospray tandem mass spectrometry of the major components observed in the MALDI experiment yielded fragment ions that allowed the assignment of the positions of fucose substitution. Data derived from Fuc1Hex5HexNAc4, NeuAc1Fuc1Hex5HexNAc4, and Fuc2Hex5HexNAc5 are shown in Fig. 4, A, B, and Fig. 4C, respectively. Assignments of key signals are given in the insets. The diagnostic signal for fucose being attached to the terminal GlcNAc of the core is m/z 474 (whereas antennae substituted with Fuc give a major fragment ion at m/z 660). The difucosylated molecule exhibits major signals at both of these m/z values, indicating that the majority of the glycans of this composition carry one Fuc on the core and one on the antennae. In contrast, the monofucosylated glycans show a major signal at m/z 474 and a minor signal at m/z 660, indicating that these glycans are predominantly fucosylated on the core.Fig. 4CCAD-MS/MS spectra of the [M + 2Na]2+ molecular ions of Fuc1Hex5HexNAc4 (A), NeuAc1Fuc1Hex5HexNAc4 (B), and Fuc2Hex5HexNAc5 (C). The major component in each case is shown in the schematic. Additionally, panels A and B contain a minor component that lacks the fucose on the core and instead carries a fucose on a LacNAc antenna, giving the fragment ion at m/z 660.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Linkage Analysis of N-Glycans Released by PNGase F—Linkage analysis data for the PNGase F-released glycans and their desialylated counterparts are shown in Table II. These results are fully in agreement with the idea that high mannose and complex type structures are major constituents. Key features of these data are as follows. (i) The 3,4,6-linked Man confirms the presence of bisected glycans. (ii) The high abundance of 2-Man is consistent with the MALDI data, which showed that biantennary structures are the most dominant N-glycans. (iii) The 3,4- and 4,6-linked GlcNAcs are in accord with the CAD-ES-MS/MS data. (iv) The presence of 3- and 6-linked Gal, which were both diminished after sialidase treatment, indicates that the sialic acids are attached at either the 3- or the 6-position of Gal.Table IIGC-MS a"

The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt has been proposed to mediate insulin signaling in several processes. However, it is unclear whether Akt is involved in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and which isoforms of Akt are responsible for each insulin action. We confirmed that expression of a constitutively active Akt, using an adenoviral expression vector, promoted translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to plasma membrane, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake, and glycogen synthesis in both Chinese hamster ovary cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Inhibition of Akt either by adenoviral expression of a dominant negative Akt or by the introduction of synthetic 21-mer short interference RNA against Akt markedly reduced insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, 2-DG uptake, and glycogen synthesis. Experiments with isoform-specific short interference RNA revealed that Akt2, and Akt1 to a lesser extent, has an essential role in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and 2-DG uptake in both cell lines, whereas Akt1 and Akt2 contribute equally to insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. These data suggest a prerequisite role of Akt in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and distinct functions among Akt isoforms.

Its putative cellular homologue, Akt (c-Akt), encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase (3Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) whose catalytic domain, located in the carboxyl terminus of the protein, is closely related to that of protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (3Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 4Coffer P.J. Woodgett J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of Akt is stimulated by a variety of growth factors including insulin (5Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Recent extensive investigation revealed that Akt plays crucial roles in various cellular functions including cell survival, cell growth, cell differentiation, cell cycle progression, transcription, translation, and cellular metabolism through phosphorylation of target molecules (6Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Following insulin stimulation, insulin-receptor substrate proteins are phosphorylated, after which phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) is activated. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt binds to the lipid products of PI3-kinase and thereby mediates recruitment to the membrane in response to PI3-kinase activation (5Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R.

The translocation of Akt allows for phosphorylation at Thr308 by another Ser/Thr protein kinase, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (8Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). With regard to insulin action, Akt was shown to phosphorylate and inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and subsequently promote glycogen synthesis in response to insulin (13Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). However, regarding another important insulin action, which is the stimulation of glucose uptake by the GLUT4 translocation, the role of Akt remained controversial (14Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 15Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J.

In addition, although the participation of atypical protein kinase C (i.e. PKCλ and PKCξ), which is also thought to be activated by phosphoinositides and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, in glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes has been proposed (16Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the opposite result has also been reported in the case of the same cell type (17Tsuru M. Katagiri H. Asano T. Yamada T. Ohno S. Ogihara T. Oka Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E338-E345Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of atypical PKC also seems to be controversial. An adenoviral gene transfer technique now in common use is thought to be a powerful strategy to introduce high levels of transgene expression into mammalian cells (18He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar). The technique facilitates expression of inactive Akt in cells to overcome endogenous Akt activity, dominant negatively (14Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 15Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). According to other authors who have examined the role of Akt in glucose metabolism (14Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y.

We used Akt-MAA (Akt-K179M/T308A/S473A) in the present study, since we considered that Met (for Lys179; so-called catalytic Lys) has a relatively large side chain and is likely to impair kinase activity by occupying the ATP-binding pocket more efficiently compared with Ala as well as losing a positive charge for the stabilization of ATP binding and a hydrogen bond with the Glu in helix C. RNA interference (RNAi) is a process whereby double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces the degradation of cognate mRNA for prevention of the expression of alien genes. Originally, the RNAi phenomenon was discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans; however, recent studies revealed that such phenomena are evolutionarily conserved from plants to mammals (19Fire A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 358-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 20Tuschl T. Zamore P.D. Lehmann R. Bartel D.P. Sharp P.A.

Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8107) Google Scholar). According to recent data, duplexes of 21-nucleotide short interference RNA (siRNA) with 2-nucleotide 3′-overhangs are the most efficient triggers of sequence-specific mRNA degradation (24Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar, 25Elbashir S.M. Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). One fascinating aspect of RNAi is its extreme efficiency, since only a few trigger dsRNA molecules introduced into the cells suffice to inactivate a continuously transcribed cognate target mRNA for long periods of time (22Nishikura K. Cell. 2001; 107: 415-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although the introduction of dsRNA into mammalian cells has been known to cause RNA-dependent protein kinase-mediated apoptosis, the siRNA (e.g. 21-nucleotide dsRNA) has been shown not to cause such an effect (24Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). This important observation revealed new possibilities whereby one could prove gene function in mammalian cells. In attempts to elucidate the roles of Akt in insulin actions, we used both adenoviral overexpression and RNAi in both CHO cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Since it is unclear which isoforms of Akt are responsible for each insulin action, we investigated the role of each isoform in insulin actions using a specific RNAi against each Akt isoform.

Cell Culture—COS-7 cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing Myc-tagged rat glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4myc) were maintained in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) or F-12 culture medium (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) with 10% fetal calf serum, respectively (32Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 3T3-L1 fibroblast was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen) and differentiated into 3T3-L1 adipocytes stably expressing GLUT4myc (3T3-L1-GLUT4myc), as described (32Kanai F.

More than 90% of the cells expressed the adipocyte phenotype (i.e. lipid droplets). Human brain tumor-derived U251-MG cells were provided by the Health Science Research Resources Bank of Japan (Sen-nan, Osaka, Japan) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum as above. Preparation of Recombinant Adenovirus—The recombinant adenovirus encoding either dominant-negative (DN) Akt (Akt-MAA: K179M/T308A/S473A) or constitutively active (CA) Akt (myr-Akt1) was generated using the AdEasy system, as described (18He T.C.

The recombinant adenoviruses were amplified in 293 cells. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) was determined as pfu/ml, and either CHO cells or 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected at the multiplicities of infection (MOI; pfu/cell), as indicated. Adenoviral Gene Transduction—CHO-GLUT4myc cells or 3T3-L1 adipocytes (the 8th day after initiation of differentiation) were incubated with OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) containing the indicated MOI of adenovirus for 2 h with tilting every 30 min; we then added the growth medium and incubated the preparation for 32 h followed by serum starvation with serum-free medium (i.e. F-12 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) for 16 h. Experiments were performed 48 h after the infection. Akt in Vitro Kinase Assay—Akt kinase activity was measured using AKTide-2T (28Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) as a substrate, as described (33Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Kang P.M.

Cells seeded on either six-well or 24-well plates were incubated in serum-free medium for 16 h and then stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 10 min. Cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in solubilizing buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm Na4P2O7, 20 mm NaF, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the obtained cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Akt antibody (26Wang L. Hayashi H. Kishi K. Huang L. Hagi A. Tamaoka K. Hawkins P.T. Ebina Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 543-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated enzyme was incubated in 30 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 μm protein kinase inhibitor, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm cold ATP, 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 50 μm AKTide-2T for 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of 8 n HCl and spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman, Rockland, MA) and then washed five times with 0.5% phosphoric acid. Radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. GLUT4 Translocation—Insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane was examined by determination of the exposure of Myc epitope (GLUT4myc) to the outer surface of plasma membrane in response to insulin, as described (34Kishi K. Muromoto N. Nakaya Y. Miyata I. Hagi A. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In brief, cells on 24-well plates were incubated in 500 μl of Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer for 20 min at 37 °C and then stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 10 min at 37 °C. After fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with 100 mm glycine/PBS for 15 min. After the blocking, cells were incubated with 300 μl of anti-Myc antibody (9E10; 1:1000 dilution) for 2 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with 300 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2000 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed with five times with PBS. GLUT4myc translocation was determined and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence and a Luminescencer-JNR luminometer (AB-2100; ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). 2-Deoxy-d-glucose Uptake—Insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was measured based on the determination of 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose incorporation into the cell, as described (34Kishi K. Muromoto N. Nakaya Y. Miyata I. Hagi A. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Glycogen Synthesis Assay—Insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis was measured based on the determination of d-[6-3H]glucose incorporation into the glycogen fraction, as described (34Kishi K. Muromoto N. Nakaya Y. Miyata I. Hagi A. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—For immunoblotting, we used the indicated antibodies, and the signals were detected using horseradish peroxidase-mediated chemiluminescence, as described (35Obata T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Pillay T.S. Kikkawa R. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay—The specific (against Akt; siAKTc) and nonspecific (against GFP; siGFP) synthetic 21-mer dsRNAs (total of 0.5 μg/well) were co-transfected with FKHRL1 (0.01 μg/well), BP1-luc (0.5 μg/well), and pRL-SV40 (0.1 μg/well) into either COS-7 cells or 3T3-L1 adipocytes plated on a 24-well plate using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h of transfection, luciferase activity was measured using dual luciferase reporter assay kits (Promega, Madison, WI). A PI3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002 (100 μm), was also used for 1 h before cell harvest. Normalized relative luciferase activity (Photinus pyralis luciferase/Renilla reniformis luciferase activity) was expressed. The S.D. value of R. reniformis luciferase activity was within 5% of the average value. Statistical Analysis—The data are represented as mean ± S.E. p values were determined by Bonferroni-Dunncan's multiple comparison test, and a p < 0.05 value was considered to be statistically significant. Constitutively Active Akt Mimicked and Dominant Negative Akt Inhibited Insulin Actions in Both CHO Cells and 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—We generated recombinant adenovirus encoding either constitutively active Akt (CA-Akt; myr-AKT) or dominant negative Akt (DN-Akt; Akt-K179M/T308A/T473A) and examined effects of these Akt mutants on insulin actions, including GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake, and glycogen synthesis. As shown in Figs. 1A and 2A, infection of CA-Akt adenovirus markedly enhanced Akt kinase activity in both CHO cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In parallel, the infection mimicked effects of insulin on GLUT4 translocation, 2-DG uptake, and glycogen synthesis as shown in Figs. 1, B–D, and 2, B–D. On the other hand, the control adenovirus that encoded green fluorescent protein (GFP) had little effect on these actions as well as on Akt kinase activity. Interestingly, although CA-Akt enhanced glycogen synthesis in quiescent cells, the maximum rate of glycogen syntheses in insulin-stimulated cells was blunted in both CHO cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figs. 1D and 2D; see “Discussion”).Fig. 2Effects of CA- and DN-AKT on insulin actions in 3T3-L1-GLUT4myc adipocytes. Cells were infected with the indicated MOI (pfu/cell) of adenovirus, and insulin-stimulated Akt kinase activity (A and E; the antibody used for immunoprecipitation can recognize all Akt isoforms), GLUT4 translocation (B and F), 2-DG uptake (C and G), and glycogen synthesis (D and H) were measured. Data are expressed by mean ± S.E. from 4–6 experiments. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 versus control (GFP). For 2-DG uptake, 8.6 pmol/min/2 × 105 cells was regarded as 1 arbitrary unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the effect of DN-Akt on insulin actions in these cells. As shown in Figs. 1E and 2E, DN-Akt adenovirus efficiently inhibited insulin-stimulated Akt kinase activity and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, 2-DG uptake, and glycogen synthesis in an MOI-dependent manner in both cell lines. In the case of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, although DN-Akt (at MOI 80) inhibited Akt activity almost completely, insulin-stimulated metabolic activities, including 2-DG uptake and glycogen synthesis, still remained, which suggests an additional pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (see “Discussion”). Expression of DN-Akt had little effect on either phosphorylation of Erk-1/2 (by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibody) or activation of PI3-kinase activity (by in vitro kinase assay) in insulin-stimulated cells (data not shown). RNAi-mediated Gene Silencing of Akt—We then carried out RNAi-mediated gene silencing using a synthetic 21-mer oligonucleotide RNA duplex (siRNA) to determine the requirement of Akt for insulin actions. We designed a pair of oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequence of Akt1 that matches maximally with the other two Akt isoforms (rat, mouse, and human) and named “siAKTc,” as shown in Fig. 3A. There were a few mismatches within the corresponding sequences of rat Akt3, human Akt3, and mouse Akt2 and Akt3. COS-7 cells were then co-transfected with the siAKTc and Akt expression plasmid that also expressed GFP driven by an independent CMV promoter as w"

Growth under these conditions results in the de novo synthesis of a number of periplasmic c-type cytochromes, many of which are multiheme in nature and are thought to be involved in the Fe(III) respiratory process. To begin a biochemical study of these complex cytochromes, the mtrA gene that encodes an approximate 32-kDa periplasmic decaheme cytochrome has been heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Co-expression of mtrA with a plasmid that contains cytochrome c maturation genes leads to the assembly of a correctly targeted holoprotein, which covalently binds ten hemes. The recombinant MtrA protein has been characterized by magnetic circular dichroism, which shows that all ten hemes have bis-histidine axial ligation. EPR spectroscopy detected only eight of these hemes, all of which are low spin and provides evidence for a spin-coupled pair of hemes in the oxidized state. Redox titrations of MtrA have been carried out with optical- and EPR-monitored methods, and the hemes are shown to reduce over the potential range –100 to –400 mV. In intact cells of E. coli, MtrA is shown to obtain electrons from the host electron transport chain and pass these onto host oxidoreductases or a range of soluble Fe(III) species. This demonstrates the promiscuous nature of this decaheme cytochrome and its potential to serve as a soluble Fe(III) reductase in intact cells.

Bacterial iron respiration is the process in which the Fe(III) acts as the terminal electron acceptor in an energy-conserving bacterial respiratory electron transport chain. It is an anaerobic process that provides a bacterium with a means of respiration when oxygen is absent and is distinct from the process of iron assimilation in which iron is taken up into the cell by energy-consuming systems and incorporated in to cell biomass. The capacity for Fe(III) respiration is phylogenetically widespread, and the ecological impact in microoxic and anoxic soils and sediments is considerable (1Lovley D. Phillips E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 1472-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lovley D. Roden E.E. Phillips E.J.P. Woodward J.C. Marine Geol. 1993; 113: 41-53Crossref Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 3Lovley D. Annu.

A particular problem for Gram-negative bacteria is that at circum-neutral pH, the speciation of Fe(III) is complex because the cation is present as either insoluble polynuclear oxo/hydroxo-bridged complexes or as soluble organic chelates. Thus, depending on the environment, Fe(III) is presented to bacteria in a range of forms that can vary in solubility, steric properties, and overall charge. The best characterized group of Fe(III)-respiring bacteria are species of the genus Shewanella, which are widespread facultative anaerobes of the γ-proteobacteria group that can express a number of terminal respiratory reductases including nitrate, nitrite, fumarate, and trimethylamine N-oxide reductases (7Myers C. Nealson K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6232-6238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During growth under iron-respiring conditions, de novo synthesis of a number of multiheme c-type cytochromes that may a play a role in the Fe(III) respiration process occurs. Cytochrome oxidation has been observed during Fe(III) reduction, and a number of genetic loci that encode multiheme cytochromes have been implicated as being important for Fe(III) respiration (8Myers C. Myers J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3429-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Myers C. Myers J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 108: 15-22Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Richardson D.

These include cymA, which encodes an inner membrane periplasmic tetraheme quinol dehydrogenase (CymA), and the mtrDEF-OmcA-MtrCAB gene cluster, which encodes three outer membrane decaheme cytochromes (MtrF, OmcA, and MtrC), two periplasmic decaheme cytochromes (MtrD and MtrA), and two putative outer membrane β-barrel proteins (MtrE and MtrB). In addition some small periplasmic tetraheme cytochromes such as the small tetraheme cytochrome c and iron-induced flavocytochrome c 3 may also play a role in Fe(III) respiration (12Gordon E. Pike A. Hill A. Cuthbertson P. Reid G. Chapman S. Turner D. Salgueiro C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Dobbin P. Butt J. Powell A. Reid G. Richardson D. Biochem.

These periplasmic cytochromes may then be able to nonspecifically reduce soluble Fe(III) chelates, but in order to reduce insoluble Fe(III) complexes, the electrons must then be passed to outer membrane cytochromes, e.g. OmcA.Much of the work that has led to the development of this model for Fe(III) respiration has been done on two species, Shewanella frigidimarina NCMIB400 and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. The genome sequence of the latter has recently been completed and reveals that there are around forty genes encoding c-type cytochromes in this organism, many of which are predicted to be multiheme in character (15Heidelberg J. Paulsen I. Nelson K. Gaidos E. Nelson W. Read T. Eisen J. Seshadri R. Ward N. Methe B. Clayton R. Meyer T. Tsapin A. Scott J. Beanan M. Brinkac L. Daugherty S. DeBoy R. Dodson R. Durkin A. Haft D.

Venter J. Nealson K. Fraser C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The large number of c-type cytochromes synthesized during growth in the presence of Fe(III) makes it difficult to assess the properties and function of individual cytochromes in vivo. In this work, we have thus begun to resolve the properties and functions of individual cytochromes in Fe(III) respiration through heterologous expression of mtrA in Escherichia coli with the aim of providing both large quantities of protein for biophysical analysis and insight into any new metabolic capacity that the expression of the gene confers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression of mtrA in E. coli—The mtrA gene (GenBank™ accession number AF083240) was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA prepared from S. oneidensis MR-1 as the template, suitable homologous primers, and TaqDNA polymerase. An AccepTor Vector™ kit (Novagen and CN Biosciences) was used to ligate the 1-kb PCR product into the β-galactosidase gene of pETBlue-1, now called pKP1. Plasmid DNA was prepared from the resulting white colonies and checked by single and double digestions with PstI and NcoI, which both cut one restriction site each on the mtrA gene. Expression host cells, E. coli JM109(DE3), were transformed first with the vector pEC86 containing the ccmABCDEFGH (cytochrome c maturation) genes (16Thöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Kunzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were grown and subsequently transformed with pKP1.Growth Conditions—Cells of the E. coli JM109(DE3) (pKP1+pEC86) strain were grown aerobically at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium (10 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter NaCl, 5 g/liter of yeast extract, pH adjusted with NaOH to 7.5) until they reached an optical density of approximately 1.0. They were then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown under the same conditions overnight.Cell Fractionation and Protein Purification—Cells were harvested at 7000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min and resuspended in 100 mm NaHepes at pH 7.5 (0.3 g of wet cells ml–1). The cells were treated with polymixin B (1 mg ml–1) to break the outer membrane and were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The lysed cells were spun at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 45 min. The resulting periplasmic fraction was found to contain the c-type cytochrome and was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose (fast flow) anion exchange column, which had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After washing with 2 column volumes of buffer, MtrA was eluted under a linear gradient of 0–250 mm over 4 column volumes. Fractions were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, overnight. MtrA was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography at room temperature on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75-gel filtration column. Prior to spectroscopic characterization, MtrA was concentrated and buffer exchanged into 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, by ultrafiltration with a 10-kDa cut-off membrane.General Analytical Procedures and Cytochrome Oxidation Kinetics— Analyses of the cell extracts and purified proteins were routinely performed with SDS-PAGE. Gels were examined for the presence of c-type cytochromes by heme-linked peroxidase staining as described previously (17Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). For quantification of c-type hemes, 0.5 ml of a stock solution containing 200 mm NaOH and 40% by volume pyridine was placed in a cuvette with 0.5 ml of cytochrome solution, 3 μl of 0.1 m ferricyanide were added, and the spectrum was recorded. Sodium dithionite was then added to reduce the sample. The extinction coefficient of the reduced minus oxidized sample at 550–535 nm was taken as 24 mm–1 cm–1 (18Berry E. Trumpower B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Oxidation kinetics of reduced MtrA following addition of different electron acceptors was followed at 552 nm. Iron chelates were prepared as described by Dobbin et al. (19Dobbin P. Requena L. Heath S. Powell A. McEwan A. Richardson D. BioMetals. 1996; 8: 291-301Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar).UV-visible, EPR, and Magnetic Circular Dichroism Spectroscopies— Absorption spectra of whole cells or purified MtrA were obtained on an SLM Aminco DW-2000 or a Hitachi U4001 UV-visible spectrometer. EPR spectra were obtained on a Bruker EMX system X-band spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instrument ESR-9 liquid helium flow cryostat and a dual mode EPR cavity. Spin quantification of the EPR spectra was carried out by integration the gz peaks in comparison with a Cu(II)(EDTA) standard (1 mm) using the method of Aasa and Vanngård (20Aasa R. Vanngård T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar). Where there was overlap of the gz features, the peaks were first deconvoluted with gaussian fits using WinEPR software from Bruker. Magnetic circular dichroism spectra were measured with circular dichroism spectrometers from Jasco with models J800 and J730 being employed for the wavelength ranges of 240–800 and 700–2000 nm, respectively. The magnetic field was applied with a SM-1 super-conducting solenoid with a 25-mm room temperature bore from Oxford Instruments, which generates a maximum field of 6 Tesla.Optical Redox Titration—Mediated spectrophotometric redox potentiometry was undertaken using methodology described by Dobbin et al. (13Dobbin P. Butt J. Powell A. Reid G. Richardson D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) Titrations with dithionite on 0.2 μm MtrA protein were performed under argon atmosphere at 15 °C in 20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.5. Mediators (duroquinone, phenazine ethosulfate, phenazine methosulfate, anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, antraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid, menadione, and benzyl viologen) were used at a concentration of 10 μm. Reduction potentials are referenced to standard hydrogen electrode.Potentiometric Titration Monitored by EPR—Under a nitrogen atmosphere, mediated redox potentiometry was performed using a polished graphite electrode in the form of a carbon pot in the range of 50–273 mV. Samples were allowed to equilibrate in the carbon pot for 1–2 h, removed in EPR tubes under nitrogen, and frozen immediately. Potential drift was monitored and was <5 mV in all of the cases. Mediators, which were used at a concentration of 10 or 30 μm, were duroquinone, menadione, anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, safranine O, methyl, and benzyl viologen. In the range below –273 mV, dithionite was used as a reductant in a similar manner to the optical redox titration because of the difficulty of poising the samples with the carbon electrode alone.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDe novo synthesis of Periplasmic c-Type Cytochromes during Growth of S. oneidensis on Soluble Fe(III) Species and Heterologous Expression of mtrA in E. coli—The c-type cytochrome profile of periplasmic fractions prepared from S. oneidensis MR-1 was compared in cells grown microaerobically or anaerobically with a variety of respiratory electron acceptors. Hemestained SDS-PAGE gels revealed that a large number of different periplasmic cytochromes were synthesized in the cells grown with Fe(III) by comparison with the other growth conditions (Fig. 1A). Of particular note is the de novo synthesis of ∼35-kDa cytochrome(s). The genome of S. oneidensis MR-1 encode four putative paralogues of a decaheme 35-kDa c-type cytochrome including two, MtrA and MtrD, that are part of the mtrDEF-omcA-mtrCAB gene cluster and that are known to be important in Fe(III) respiration (11Beliaev A. Saffarini D. McLaughlin J. Hunnicutt D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). No detailed biochemical characterization of any of these periplasmic decaheme cytochromes has been reported to date, and thus to investigate the biophysical and functional properties of this family of cytochromes, the gene for mtrA was selected for heterologous expression in E. coli.The mtrA gene was amplified from chromosomal DNA prepared from S. oneidensis MR-1 and cloned into pETBlue-1 to yield pKP1. This and pEC86, which contains genes that encode cytochrome c maturation (Ccm) 1The abbreviations used are: Ccm, cytochrome c maturation; E m, midpoint redox potential; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; HQNO, 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide; NIR, near infrared; Maltol, 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pyrone. proteins and that are required for the covalent attachment of heme via thioether linkages to polypeptide chains in the periplasmic compartment, was transformed into E. coli JM109(DE3). Colonies of these cells were notably pink in color. Visible spectra of aerobically grown cultures of E. coli JM109(DE3) (pKP1+pEC86) collected between 500 and 600 nm revealed intense absorption bands at ∼550 nm (Fig. 1C). This is characteristic of the α-absorbance band of reduced c-type cytochrome and was absent from E. coli JM109(DE3), E. coli JM109(DE3) (pEC86), and E. coli JM109(DE3) (pKP1), all of which exhibited weak absorption bands at 560 nm that are characteristic of reduced b-type cytochromes and are likely to arise from endogenous cytochromes such as the cytochrome bo oxidase. Periplasmic and membrane fractions were prepared from aerobic cultures of E. coli JM109(DE3) (pKP1+pEC86) that had been induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Heme-stained SDS-PAGE gels of these fractions revealed the presence in both fractions of a 35-kDa heme-staining band that is the expected size of MtrA (Fig. 1B). This band was absent in E. coli JM109(DE3), E. coli JM109(DE3) (pKP1) (data not shown), and E. coli JM109(DE3) (pEC86) (Fig 1B). A 17-kDa heme-staining band was also present in the membrane fractions of JM109(DE3) (pEC86) and JM109(DE3) (pKP1 + pEC86) but absent from JM109(DE3). This corresponds to the size of the heme-binding cytochrome c maturation protein CcmE, which is membrane-associated and encoded by pEC86. Additional faint bands at 24 kDa could be seen in membranes of JM109(DE3) (pEC86) and JM109(DE3) (pKP1 + pEC86), which correspond to the size expected of the membrane-anchored tetraheme quinol dehydrogenase, NapC, of the NaAB nitrate reductase system. A heme-staining band at around 55 kDa was present in all of the periplasm and membrane samples. This corresponds to the periplasmic pentaheme NrfA nitrite reductase protein. The observation that some of the periplasmic NrfA “sticks” to membrane preparations has been reported previously (17Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The nap and nrf genes are characteristically expressed during anaerobic growth of E. coli. The synthesis of the Nap and Nrf cytochromes revealed by heme staining was confirmed by direct enzymological assays for nitrate and nitrite reductase and suggests that a low level of nap and nrf expression is occurring as a result of the cultures becoming oxygen-limited at high cell densities.Taken together, the data from the heme-stained SDS-PAGE analysis suggest that E. coli can express mtrA and correctly locate and assemble holo-MtrA in the periplasm when mtrA is co-expressed with the ccm genes in E. coli JM109(DE3) (pKP1 + pEC86). Similar to NrfA, it seems that some MtrA will also stick to membranes and this finding suggests that it can associate with the periplasmic face of either or both inner and outer membranes. Quantification of the reduced absorption band at 552 nm in the intact cells that have synthesized MtrA with an extinction coefficient (derived from purified protein) of 280 mm–1 cm–1 (28 mm–1 cm–1/heme) reveals that around 6 nmol protein (mg cells)–1 is produced.Purification and Characterization of MtrA—The recombinant 35-kDa MtrA was purified using a combination of anion exchange and gel-filtration chromatographies (see “Experimental Procedures”). The protein stained poorly with Coomassie Blue but was judged to be pure by the absence of additional bands on Coomassie Blue-stained gels (Fig. 2A, inset). Purified protein has a ratio of A 408/A 280 nm of ∼4.5. An analysis of the native protein in solution by dynamic light scattering revealed the MtrA samples to be monodisperse with an approximate molecular mass of 30 kDa, suggesting that it is monomeric in solution. An analysis using the program SignalP (21Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar) suggested a cleavage site for the signal peptide sequence after position 34 in the MtrA pre-protein amino acid sequence (Fig. 9). This would suggest a processed molecular mass of 32,422 Da for the apopeptide and a total mass of 38,584 Da with the 10 predicted c hemes. An analysis of MtrA by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry gave a molecular mass value of 38,581 kDa, and this suggests that the heterologously synthesized protein does indeed bind ten hemes.Fig. 2UV-visible spectropotentiometric analysis of MtrA (reductive and oxidative titration).

The spectrum is typical of low spin ferric heme. Upon reduction, the Soret band λmax shifts to 420 nm and β- and α-peaks at 525 and 552 nm that are characteristic of low spin ferrous c-type cytochromes appear (Fig. 2A). Pyridine hemochromogen assays give a value of ∼132 mm–1 cm–1/heme for the MtrA Soret band, which is a value typical of low spin hemoproteins (18Berry E. Trumpower B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar,22Moore G. Pettigrew G. Springer Series in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1990: 316-320Google Scholar). This would correspond to an extinction coefficient of 1,320 mm–1 cm–1 for the entire protein. Absorption spectra of MtrA were collected at a range of potentials between +400 and –450 mV. An increase in absorbance at 552 nm was observed over the range of approximately –100 to –450 mV. The change in absorption at 552 nm is best fitted to two groups of hemes that titrate as n = 1 components and that account for 30 and 70% of the total absorption change with midpoint potentials, E m, of –375 and –200 mV (Fig. 2B). This simple fit suggests that three hemes have near iso-midpoint potentials at –375 mV and seven hemes have near iso-midpoint potentials at –200 mV. These values are in the range that is commonly found for bis-His ligated hemes as a result of the electron-donating properties of the imidazole ring nitrogens, which serve to stabilize the oxidized state (22Moore G. Pettigrew G. Springer Series in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1990: 316-320Google Scholar).Magnetic Circular Dichroism of MtrA—The size and position of signals in UV-visible region of the spectrum, which is shown in Fig. 3A, is consistent with ferric low spin heme, with a Soret derivative cross-over at 407 nm and a peak-to-trough intensity of 97 mm–1 cm–1/heme. In fact, the Soret and visible region is very similar to other bis-histidine-ligated multiheme cytochromes such as CymA and OmcA from S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 (23Field S. Dobbin P. Cheesman M. Watmough N. Thomson A. Richardson D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8515-8522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The charge-transfer band for low spin ferric heme occurs in the NIR region (800–2500 nm), and the peak wavelength is an indicator of the axial ligands to the heme iron (24Gadsby P. Thomson A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5003-5011Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25McKnight J. Cheesman M. Thomson A. Miles J. Munro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The NIR spectrum of MtrA shows a positive LMCT (CTls) band at 1490 nm with vibrational side structures to higher energy (Fig. 3B). The position of the CTls maximum at 1490 nm is consistent with low spin ferric heme with bis-histidine ligation. Histidine/lysine or histidine/amine coordination could also give rise to a CTls band of similar position and intensity, but the EPR of amine-bound hemes is quite unique in shape and position (24Gadsby P. Thomson A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5003-5011Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the EPR of MtrA is not consistent with lysine ligation (see below). The intensity of this CTls band is also consistent with an almost 100% population of low spin heme.Fig. 3Room temperature (RT) magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) of MtrA in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH* 7.2, in D 2O.

Normally three features are observed in rhombic spectra, but in these spectra, only the gmax (gz) features are clearly observed. The second feature is an overlay of at least two gy features, and the third feature is also obscured, either because of its width or by other features. The two major species have gmax values of 2.95 and 2.88 and a second feature in the derivative at g ∼2.27. The third feature is broadened and is not observed. These g-values are consistent with bis-histidine ligation at the heme in which the histidine imidazole ring planes are approximately parallel to each other. Spin integration of the signals reveals that these two major low spin species each account for ∼40% of the heme population. There is also a positive feature at g = 2.43 that is likely to arise from a small population of low spin histidine/hydroxide heme, probably from a heme or hemes in which one of the histidine ligands has become detached, and a derivative feature at g = 2.06, which may be assigned to adventitious copper.Fig. 4X-band perpendicular mode EPR of MtrA.

Nernstian fits of two n = 1 components gave E m values of –136 and –288 mV for the g = 2.95 peak (70:30% total change in peak height). The majority of the g = 1.80 trough titrates away with an E m of –88 mVView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Approximately 20% of the heme population is unaccounted for by the integrations of the low spin features. This population of heme may account for a pair of spin-coupled hemes, which could be EPR silent. However and notably, there is a broad trough at g = 1.80 that could in principle arise from a weakly coupled heme pair of low spin paramagnets. Parallel mode EPR spectra of MtrA were run to examine whether any integer spin systems could be detected, but no signals were observed. Examples of S = 1/2 spin-coupled systems have been detected in the multiheme hydroxylamine-cytochrome c oxidoreductase and have similar spectral features (26Hendrich M. Petasis D. Arciero D.

We investigate the mechanisms underlying the short term activation of NKCC2 by vasopressin in vivo, finding that administration of a vasopressin analogue (deamino-Cys-d-Arg vasopressin) causes a 2-fold increase in mouse kidney NKCC2 phosphorylation, as detected with a phosphospecific antibody, R5. The subtissue localization of the activation is defined by immunofluorescence. In vasopressin-treated animals, a dramatic increase in R5 immunostaining is observed in the initial segment of the thick ascending limb located in the inner stripe of the outer medulla, the region with a higher sensitivity to vasopressin. Although a pool of NKCC2 is present in cytoplasmic vesicles, the distribution of the phosphorylated cotransporter seems to be restricted to the cell membrane compartment; morphometric analysis of electron microscope images demonstrates a 55% increase in NKCC2 molecules at the apical membrane, suggesting the administration of vasopressin induces trafficking of the cotransporter. Thus, the short term actions of vasopressin on the thick ascending limb cotransporter are mediated by both an effect on the translocation of the protein and an increase in phosphorylation of regulatory threonines in the amino terminus of NKCC2.

Vasopressin controls extracellular fluid osmolarity by adjusting the amount of free water excreted by the kidney. The main effect of the hormone is found in the collecting duct, where vasopressin causes insertion of aquaporin channels in the apical membrane (1Nielsen S. Chou C.L. Marples D. Christensen E.I.

Cardiovasc Res. 2001; 51: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the amount of water that is finally reabsorbed depends upon the osmolar gradient between the medullary interstitium and the luminal fluid. The existence of a medullary hypertonic interstitium is ensured by the reabsorption of NaCl against its electrochemical gradient in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL). 1The abbreviations used are: TAL, thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle; NKCC2, kidney-specific Na-K-Cl cotransporter; NKCC1, ubiquitous Na-K-Cl cotransporter; isOM, inner stripe of the outer medulla; dDAVP, deamino-cysteine-d-arginine vasopressin. Transport of Na+ and Cl– across the luminal membrane of the TAL is provided by the renal isoform of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter, NKCC2, which, in mammals, is exclusively expressed in TAL and macula densa cells (3Kaplan M.R.

A rational design of the mechanism responsible for urine concentration would thus include vasopressin stimulation of NKCC2 for the generation of the hypertonic interstitium. The existence of V2-type vasopressin receptors in the TAL strongly supports this hypothesis (6Nonoguchi H. Owada A. Kobayashi N. Takayama M. Terada Y. Koike J. Ujiie K. Marumo F. Sakai T. Tomita K.

J. Physiol. 1986; 251: F271-F277PubMed Google Scholar) and expression levels of NKCC2 (8Kim G.H. Ecelbarger C.A. Mitchell C. Packer R.K. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F96-F103PubMed Google Scholar), which are significantly reduced in this vasopressin-deficient rat strain. More importantly, the short term effects of vasopressin on TAL electrolyte transport were demonstrated in early studies in isolated microperfused tubules. Addition of vasopressin to the bath stimulates cAMP production (11Imbert M. Chabardes D. Montegut M. Clique A. Morel F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

These effects of vasopressin are more pronounced in rodents, whereas they are weak or absent in species with a lesser urinary concentrating ability (17Ruggles B.T. Murayama N. Werness J.L.

Vasopressin is just one of many hormonal and paracrine factors that have been shown to acutely up-regulate NaCl transport in the thick ascending limb (for review, see Ref. 18Bailly C. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1998; 65: S29-S35PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of NKCC2 seems to be tightly regulated, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying its activation. Phosphorylation is involved in the activation of many membrane transport systems; indeed, the amino acid sequence of NKCC2 contains several potential consensus sites for protein kinases. However, before this study, a link between phosphorylation and activation of NKCC2 has not been demonstrated. Activation of the secretory isoform of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) involves phosphorylation of five to eight threonine and serine residues (19Lytle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15069-15077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To date, three of these phosphoacceptors (Thr-184, Thr-189, and Thr-202; shark NKCC1) have been identified; these amino acids reside in a region of highly conserved amino acid sequence in the N terminus of the cotransporter (20Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these residues correlates with transport activity, and their substitution dramatically affects the function of the protein. A phosphospecific antibody, R5, raised against two of the phosphothreonines (Thr-184, Thr-189), has recently proven to be a very useful tool for the study of NKCC regulation in vivo (21Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The region containing the three regulatory threonines identified by Darman and Forbush (20Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) is the most highly conserved sequence between NKCC1 and NKCC2 within the N terminus. This high degree of conservation has led us to suggest a common mechanism of activation between these proteins (21Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis and further elucidate the mechanisms responsible for regulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport in the thick ascending limb, we studied the short term stimulation of NKCC2 by vasopressin in vivo using the R5 antibody. Herein, we report the first evidence for a role of phosphorylation in the regulation of NKCC2, the renal Na-K-Cl cotransporter. Moreover, we report that increased translocation of the protein to the cell membrane accompanies the increase in NKCC2 phosphorylation after short term vasopressin administration in vivo. An abstract of this work has been presented previously (22Gimenez I. Forbush B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 28AGoogle Scholar). Animal Handling and Tissue Collection—All procedures employed in the present work involving animals were approved by Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male ∼8-week-old CD-1 mice (Charles River Laboratories) were maintained at Yale's School of Medicine facilities under standard conditions, including free access to food and water. On the day of the experiment, 10 ng of dDAVP (a vasopressin analogue) per animal (Sigma) or vehicle alone was administered by subcutaneous injection. One hour after injection, animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (70 mg/kg of body weight; intraperitoneal inection). Under deep anesthesia, the thoracic and abdominal cavities were exposed, and a catheter was placed in the left ventricle. Warmed Krebs-Henseleit-bicarbonate solution (140 mm Na+, 5 mm K+, 130 mm Cl–, 1.8 mm Ca2+, 0.9 mm Mg2+, 25 mm HCO3–, 1 mmPO42- , and 1 mm SO42- , pH 7.4 after equilibration with 5% CO2/95% O2 at 37 °C) was perfused through the left ventricle and the blood drained through an incision in the Cava vein. The right kidney was removed after placing a clamp around the renal vessels. To minimize tissue manipulation before phosphatase blockage, we did not dissect the kidney into cortex and medulla. Whole kidneys were thus immediately homogenized in ice-cold antiphosphatase buffer (150 mm NaCl, 30 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 15 mm Na2HPO4, 15 mm pyrophosphate, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) with 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor cocktails added, using 25 strokes at 25,000 rpm with a Polytron tissue homogenizer and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet debris. Membrane-containing supernatant was centrifuged for 40 min at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the resulting membrane fraction resuspended in homogenization buffer and stored at –20 °C. Perfusion fixation of the left kidney was initiated after removal of the right kidney using prewarmed paraformaldehyde-lysine-phosphate solution (23McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar). Blocks of fixed kidney were postfixed in the same solution for an additional 2–4 h at 4 °C. To reduce the level of endogenous vasopressin, some animals were water-loaded by offering them a 5% dextrose/1% ethanol solution overnight. Water load was assessed by measuring solution intake. The response of the animals to dDAVP and water load was confirmed by assessing the changes in urinary concentration. Urinary osmolarity was measured with a freezing point osmometer (MicroOsmometer 3300; Advance Instruments) in diluted urine samples collected directly from the bladder at the time of sacrifice. Antibodies—Two antibodies of the T series of monoclonal antibodies raised against the last 310 residues of the human colonic Na-K-Cl cotransporter (hNKCC1) (24Lytle C. Xu J.C. Biemesderfer D. Forbush 3rd., B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1496-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used in the present study. The T4 antibody is widely used to quantify NKCC protein expression in many tissues and species by Western blot. For immunofluorescence studies, we found T9 antibody to be better suited for staining of NKCC2 in mouse kidney. Both antibodies recognize the two isoforms of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter. However, given the low expression of NKCC1 in the kidney, an isoform-specific antibody is not required for the studies described here. In fact, the main band recognized by T4 by Western blotting corresponds to the size of NKCC2. Moreover, immunocytochemistry with T9 antibody showed strong staining exclusively in the luminal membrane of thick ascending limb tubules, as well as slight staining in the tip of the papilla and the glomerulus. For phospho-NKCC analysis, we used the previously described R5 antibody (21Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes the phosphorylated cotransporter with high affinity and specificity over the non-phosphorylated cotransporter. This antibody was raised against the NKCC1 amino acid sequence (YYLRT*FGHNT*MDAVP) but because of the high conservation of the antigen, it also recognizes NKCC2 (YYLQT*FGHNT*MDAVP, where Q is the only residue that differs between the two sequences provided). Similarly, our attempt to produce an isoform-specific phosphoantibody by immunizing rabbits with the phosphopeptide sequence found in NKCC2 resulted in a serum (R78) that recognizes both the phosphorylated NKCC2 and NKCC1. Because the affinity of R78 for the cotransporter was somewhat lower than that of R5, we used the latter in our analysis. The same considerations mentioned above for T4 and T9 regarding discrimination between isoforms apply in this case; by immunofluorescence, only TAL cells showed R5 positive staining of the luminal membrane. Staining with the T9 and R5 antibodies required antigen retrieval with SDS, which made these antibodies inadequate for ultrastructural studies. For electron microscopy studies, we used the L320 antibody (generous gift of Dr. M. Knepper), which has been successfully employed in previous studies of the ultrastructural localization of NKCC2 in the rat kidney (30Nielsen S. Maunsbach A.B. Ecelbarger C.A. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F885-F893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L320 is a polyclonal NKCC2 isoform-specific antibody, raised against a non-conserved 20-amino acid sequence in the initial N terminus of NKCC2. Finally, an anti-Tamm Horsfall antibody (generous gift from Dr. J. R. Hoyer) was used as a marker for thick ascending limb cells. Western Blotting—Equal amounts of protein (typically 40 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 7.5% acrylamide gels. After protein transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P; Millipore), Western blotting was performed as described previously (21Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) in duplicate blots, using R5 and T4 as primary antibodies. The presence of antigen-IgG complex was detected using an HRP-conjugated anti-IgG antibody and a peroxidase-based chemiluminescence assay (WestDura; Pierce); light was recorded by means of a cooled charge-coupled device camera. For quantitative analysis, band densities were obtained using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Immunocytochemistry—Blocks of fixed tissue were cryoprotected by incubation for 1 h in 2.3 m sucrose with 50% polyvinylpyrrolidone, mounted on aluminum nails, and stored in liquid nitrogen (21Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Dowd B.F. Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thin (2 μm) or semithin cryosections (0.5 μm) were cut with a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome fitted with an FC-4E cryoattachment. Sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus glass slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). After antigen retrieval by incubation with 1% SDS for 5 min, sections were stained using primary antibodies (R5, T9, or Tamm-Horsfall) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 10% goat serum. After washing the primary antibody, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa fluorescent dyes (Molecular Probes). For double-label experiments, pilot studies were performed to ensure that the fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies did not cross-react with the inappropriate primary antibody. Pictures were taken using a digital camera (Olympus), fitted on a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse E800). Electron Microscopy—Ultrathin (200 Å) sections of the outer stripe of the medulla were sectioned with a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome fitted with an FC-4E cryoattachment and placed on carbon-coated Formvar grids. Sections were labeled overnight with affinity-purified rabbit anti-NKCC2 (L320) diluted 1:100 in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum. After being washed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, the sections were incubated for 1 h in the goat anti-rabbit gold conjugate, which was diluted 1:20 in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum. Sections were subsequently postfixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and processed for electron microscopy and then examined and photographed with a Zeiss 910 electron microscope. Digital images were prepared by scanning the negatives with a Microtek scanner. The frequency distribution calculated to determine NKCC2 subcellular distribution was obtained used imaging software (LabWorks; UVP) to measure the shortest distance of each gold particle from the user-defined apical membrane. NKCC2 Is Phosphorylated at N-terminal Threonines—A major finding of this work is to show for the first time evidence for phosphorylation of NKCC2, the kidney-specific Na-K-Cl cotransporter. We hypothesized that a regulatory site previously identified in NKCC1 is also present in NKCC2, so that in vivo activation of the protein can be measured by means of a phosphospecific antibody, R5. The experiments presented in this report (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4) demonstrate that phosphorylation of the N-terminal threonines recognized by R5 also happens in NKCC2 in vivo.Fig. 2Fluorescence immunohistochemistry analysis of vasopressin-stimulated NKCC2 phosphorylation. a, low magnification view of mouse kidney sections stained with R5 antibody (anti-phoNKCC).

The antidiuretic effect of dDAVP was confirmed by measuring urinary osmolarity in samples collected at the time of sacrifice (2175 ± 477 versus 3139 ± 559 mOsm in control and vasopressin-treated animals, respectively; p = 0.0093, n = 7). As shown in Fig. 1b, in vivo short term administration of vasopressin induces a 2-fold increase in overall NKCC2 phosphorylation, determined as the ratio of R5 to T4 signal of parallel blots. Importantly, this short term administration of vasopressin does not increase expression of NKCC2 as measured by the T4 antibody (Fig. 1a). These data are the first to show regulatory phosphorylation of NKCC2 and suggest that, in vivo, vasopressin stimulates an increase in interstitial tonicity via the phosphorylation and activation of NKCC2 in the thick ascending limb. Vasopressin-mediated NKCC2 Phosphorylation Is Localized to the Medullary Section of the TAL—Because of the well known differential sensitivity to vasopressin among segments from the cortical and medullary portions of the TAL, we used immunofluorescence to examine whether a subpopulation of NKCC2 was preferentially regulated in response to vasopressin. As shown in Fig. 2, a and b, micrographs of mouse kidney sections clearly demonstrate a dramatic increase in R5-detected NKCC2 phosphorylation within the region of the inner stripe of the outer medulla (isOM) in animals treated with dDAVP. It can be seen that, in control animals, R5 staining was evident in the cortex and the outer stripe of outer medulla. The isOM showed very little staining under basal conditions. Short term administration of vasopressin caused the cotransporter in the isOM to be phosphorylated to levels similar to those found in other regions of the TAL (Fig. 2, a and b). To establish the tissue distribution of total NKCC in the mouse kidney, we used T9 antibody. In double staining images with T9 and anti-Tamm Horsall protein antibodies, it can be observed that the T9 signal colocalizes with that of the TAL marker (Fig. 2c). In our study, T9 staining was restricted to the apical membrane compartment in cells of medullary and cortical TAL cells, as well as in macula densa cells, which are Tamm-Horsfall-negative (Fig. 2c, bottom; arrowhead indicates macula densa cells). Outside of the thick ascending limb, T9 weakly stained the glomeruli and inner medullary collecting duct in the tip of the papilla (not shown), areas described previously to express the housekeeping isoform NKCC1 (26Kaplan M.R. Plotkin M.D. Brown D. Hebert S.C. Delpire E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). From analysis of micrographs, NKCC2 phosphorylation in the isOM increases more than 3-fold, although it is hard to be precise about the -fold-increase because of the very low R5 labeling usually present in this region in samples from control mice. In these animals, which have free access to water, the levels of vasopressin are sufficient to produce a moderately concentrated urine (∼2000 mOsm). However, with regard to NKCC2 phosphorylation, the mouse isOM TAL seems to be rather insensitive to these levels of the antidiuretic hormone. Only after administration of exogenous vasopressin, which induces a degree of urinary concentration comparable with that observed in water-restricted animals (∼3500–4000 mOsm), is the isOM NKCC2 phosphorylated to the same extent as the rest of the TAL cotransporter. This result is in good agreement with previous studies using microperfused isolated tubules (reviewed in Refs. 14Hebert S.C. Schafer J.A. Andreoli T.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1981; 58: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Burg M.B. Kidney Int. 1982; 22: 454-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 28Reeves W.B. Molony D.A. Andreoli T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F1145-F1154PubMed Google Scholar) that had described a quantitatively larger response to vasopressin in the murine medullary TAL, compared with the cortical TAL. In the mouse, the rise in interstitial tonicity resulting from the increased NKCC2-mediated NaCl reabsorption in the isOM TAL is apparently only required under conditions that maximize water reabsorption in the medullary collecting duct. It remains a puzzle how the mouse isOM TAL is kept at a lower level of activation at rest. This observation is in marked contrast with the uniform activation of NKCC2 along the TAL present under normal conditions in the rat, a species with a lower ability to concentrate urine. 2I. Giménez and B. Forbush, unpublished observations. The distinctive sensitivity of the isOM TAL to vasopressin adds another layer of specialization to this segment of the nephron, characterized by the exclusive expression of the NKCC2 alternative splice variant F. NKCC2F exhibits low affinities for the cotransported ions such that its transport rates can be affected by physiological changes in ion concentration in the lumen of the initial TAL (29Gimenez I. Isenring P. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8767-8770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the murine medullary TAL has evolved to serve as a buffer of Na+ and Cl– reabsorption. Short Term Vasopressin Administration Increases NKCC2 Traffic to the Cell Membrane—When viewing higher magnification images of double-stained mouse kidney sections, we noticed that the R5 signal consistently appears as a sharp line at the surface of the TAL cells, whereas T9 staining extends from the membrane into the cytosol (Fig. 3a). We wondered whether this represented a redistribution of NKCC2 within the cell in response to vasopressin. NKCC2 has previously been shown to be present in intracellular vesicles, leading Nielsen and Knepper and colleagues (30Nielsen S. Maunsbach A.B. Ecelbarger C.A. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F885-F893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to speculate that vasopressin may induce the shuttling of these vesicles to the cell membrane in a manner reminiscent of its actions in the collecting duct. To quantitate the intracellular distribution of NKCC2, we analyzed medullary TAL cells in sections from control and vasopressin-treated mice using electron microscopy. For this experiment, NKCC2 protein was detected with an NKCC2-specific antibody (L320) that has previously been used in ultrastructural studies (30Nielsen S. Maunsbach A.B. Ecelbarger C.A. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F885-F893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wang W. Kwon T.H. Li C. Frokiaer J. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F34-F44Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Micrographs illustrating the distribution of NKCC2 molecules in control and vasopressin-treated animals are shown in Fig. 3b. The presence of gold particles in intracellular areas compatible with vesicular compartments was higher in control animals compared with vasopressin-treated animals. Data from the morphometric analysis of ∼100 images like those in Fig. 3b shows that in control conditions, 40.1% of the NKCC2 molecules were found within 0.10 μm from the cell membrane; the rest were in regions ranging from 0.10 to 1.5 μm (Fig. 3, c and d). With administration of vasopressin, the percentage of gold particles within 0.10 μm from the apical membrane rose to 62.0% (Fig. 3, c and d). This change represents a 1.55-fold increase in the absolute number of NKCC2 transporters available at the membrane for solute transport. Two different TAL cell types, rough and smooth, have been distinguished in the thick ascending limb according to their ultrastructural features (32Allen F. Tisher C.C. Kidney Int. 1976; 9: 8-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Subapical vesicles are thought to be more abundant in the smooth-cell type (30Nielsen S. Maunsbach A.B. Ecelbarger C.A. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F885-F893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Allen F. Tisher C.C. Kidney Int. 1976; 9: 8-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and because this is the predominant type in medullary TAL, we hypothesized that vasopressin may have a selective effect within the cell type. However, we found no noticeable differences in either cotransporter expression levels or vasopressin-induced membrane translocation when comparing smooth and rough TAL cells (smooth cells, 44.6% vs 69.9%; rough cells, 34.2% vs 62.5%; particles at the luminal membrane in control and vasopressin-treated TAL cells, respectively). We conclude from these data that the function and regulation of NKCC2 by vasopressin does not differ between the two subtypes of TAL cells. Evidence linking the activation of NKCCs with translocation to the cell surface is scarce and limited to NKCC1 (33D'Andrea L. Lytle C. Matthews J.B. Hofman P. Forbush 3rd, B. Madara J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28969-28976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34D'Andrea-Winslow L. Strohmeier G.R. Rossi B. Hofman P. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 147-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, an intact cytoskeleton seems to be necessary to achieve vasopressin stimulation of Na-K-Cl cotransporter in cultured mouse TAL cells (35Wu M.S. Bens M. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and a C terminus truncated variant of NKCC2 has been shown, in Xenopus laevis oocytes, to modulate the traffic of full-length NKCC2 molecules to the cell membrane (36Meade P. Hoover R.S. Plata C. Vazquez N. Bobadilla N.A. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F1145-F1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that, in addition to its effects on NKCC2 phosphorylation, vasopressin increases the traffic of NKCC2 to the apical membrane of TAL cells in vivo. Based on this evidence, one might propose a model for the action of vasopressin in the mouse TAL that reflects that found in the collecting duct, where protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of aquaporin-2 seems to be involved in the increased translocation of the water channel elicited by vasopressin (37Ward D.T. Hammond T.G. Harris H.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 683-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, a causal relationship between phosphorylation and trafficking of NKCC2 has yet to be established. Although the effect of the truncated variant of NKCC2 mentioned above is observed after the elevation of cAMP in the oocyte (36Meade P. Hoover R.S. Plata C. Vazquez N. Bobadilla N.A. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F1145-F1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), evidence for direct phosphorylation of NKCC2 by protein kinase A is lacking. Although we cannot rule out at this time a causal relationship between phosphorylation and increased NKCC2 traffic, we postulate that phosphorylation of N-terminal threonines and changes in protein traffic may work independently to regulate the activity of NKCC2. The increase in phosphorylated cotransporter brought about by vasopressin seems to exceed that observed for the protein translocation. This observation suggests that, in vivo, phosphorylation of cell membrane-resident NKCC2 molecules acts as the primary regulatory step in the short term activation of the cotransporter. NKCC2 Phosphorylation in Mice Undergoing Water Diuresis—NKCC2 phosphorylation, as measured by R5, was found in the isOM of untreated, control animals, albeit at low levels (Fig. 2, a and b). This suggests either that endogenous levels of vasopressin were maintaining a basal NKCC2 activation or the existence of an additional non-vasopressin-mediated component to NKCC2 phosphorylation. To distinguish between these two possibilities, mice were subjected to water loading to abolish the secretion of endogenous vasopressin. Surprisingly, despite a significant reduction in urinary osmolarity (822 ± 573 versus 2510 ± 830 mOsm, control versus vasopressin-treated, respectively), NKCC2 phosphorylation state in water-loaded mice was increased compared with animals under normal water balance (Fig. 4a). The levels of NKCC2 phosphorylation were not significantly different in control or vasopressin-treated water-loaded mice (Fig. 1b). Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the increased NKCC2 phosphorylation in mice undergoing water diuresis. Strong R5 labeling, comparable with that observed after administration of vasopressin, was observed in the TAL of water-loaded mice, even in the region of the isOM (Fig. 4b). This result suggests the extracellular conditions imposed during water-loading trigger a separate activation pathway for NKCC2. We hypothesize that this non-additive, alternative NKCC2 stimulatory mechanism acts to compensate for the decrease in net ion reabsorption expected from the higher tubular flow and reduced luminal substrate in water-loaded animals, which underscores the role of the medullary portion of the TAL as a buffer for electrolyte reabsorption, as discussed above. Therefore, the increase in sodium and chloride reabsorption in the medullary TAL would assist the kidney in the clearance of a large amount of electrolyte-free water. The phosphorylation of N-terminal threonines in NKCC2 is thus shown to represent the end point for different stimuli regulating ion transport in the TAL. It is well understood that sodium chloride transport in the TAL is sensitive to many regulatory factors, including those involved in renal handling of calcium and magnesium (18Bailly C. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1998; 65: S29-S35PubMed Google Scholar, 38De Rouffignac C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R739-R748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that the molecular mechanisms of NKCC2 regulation described here for vasopressin underlie the activation of NKCC2 by any known stimuli of ion reabsorption in TAL and macula densa cells. In this report, we show that conditions previously described to increase NKCC2 activity also increase the phosphorylation of two threonines in NKCC2 N terminus. In addition, we demonstrate an increase in translocation of NKCC2 to the apical membrane upon administration of vasopressin. The phosphorylation of N-terminal threonines is emerging as a common regulatory process shared between isoforms of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter. The conservation of this sequence in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter, NCC, leads us to speculate that it may also participate in the regulation of NCC. The significance of elucidating the mechanisms involved in the phosphorylation of renal Na-(K)-Cl cotransporters arises from the role that these transport systems play in keeping constant body electrolyte and water content. These mechanisms, especially the as-yet unidentified cotransporter-kinase, are expected to occupy a central spot in the regulation, at the cellular level, of sodium and chloride reabsorption in the distal nephron."

We have previously shown that sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), a key transcriptional regulator of triglyceride synthesis, and the lipogenic enzymes under its control are markedly suppressed in adipocytes from genetically obese ob/ob mice. Here we demonstrate that p53 and its target genes are highly induced in adipocytes of ob/ob mice in a fed state, leading to the negative regulation of SREBP-1 and thereby lipogenic genes. In fact, disruption of p53 in ob/ob mice completely suppressed the p53-regulated genes to wild-type levels and partially restored expression of lipogenic enzymes. Consistently, reporter gene analysis showed that p53 overexpression suppressed the promoter activity of the SREBP-1c gene and its downstream genes. Thus, the activation of p53 might constitute a negative feedback loop against excess fat accumulation in adipocytes. In conclusion, we discovered a novel role of p53 in the pathophysiology of obesity.

The genetically obese ob/ob mice develop obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance owing to an inherited deficiency of the appetite-suppressing hormone, leptin (2Ingalls A.M. Dickie M.M.

Although the underlying mechanisms that link obesity and defective insulin signaling are as yet undefined, hypertrophied adipocyte-derived cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1; IGFBP-3, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3; GPDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1; IGFBP-3, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3; GPDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.-α have been reported to be mediators of insulin resistance in obesity (8Hotamisligil G.S.

Nature. 1997; 389: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar).In the insulin signaling pathways, a transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) has recently been established to be a key molecule for the transcriptional regulation of triglyceride synthesis (10Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). SREBPs are members of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcription factors that regulate fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis (reviewed in Refs. 11Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 12Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whereas SREBP-2 plays a crucial role in regulation of cholesterol synthesis, SREBP-1 controls the transcription and expression of lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase (FAS) (reviewed in Refs. 14Shimano H. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Shimano H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 16Shimano H. Vitam.

In fact, SREBP-1 and its downstream lipogenic enzymes are drastically induced when fasted animals are refed (18Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). These lipogenic genes belong to the group of genes that are induced most strongly by glucose/insulin 2N. Yahagi, unpublished data.2N. Yahagi, unpublished data. and can be regarded as indicators of insulin signaling.We have recently reported that the refeeding responses of SREBP-1 and its downstream lipogenic enzymes are markedly suppressed in adipocytes of ob/ob mice, which is presumably associated with impaired insulin signaling (19Yahagi N. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T. Ide T. Yoshikawa T. Amemiya-Kudo M. Tomita S. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Nagai R. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19353-19357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of this down-regulation is currently undefined, it could be a negative feedback mechanism to prevent excess fat accumulation in extremely obese animals.The p53 gene was the first tumor suppressor gene to be identified and has been found to be inactivated in most human cancers (20Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5745) Google Scholar). The p53 protein is responsible for preventing division of stressed cells and even causes programmed cell death (apoptosis) through activation and/or suppression of the transcription of target genes. For example, γ-irradiation activates p53 to turn on the transcription of p21Waf1/CIP1, which binds to and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases, thus blocking the G1-S and G2-to-mitosis transitions. p53 not only activates transcription of genes such as p21 through its response element, but also represses genes lacking the element by binding to and sequestering essential transcription factors such as TATA-binding protein (21Seto E. Usheva A. Zambetti G.P. Momand J. Horikoshi N. Weinmann R. Levine A.J. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12028-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 22Mack D.H. Vartikar J. Pipas J.M. Laimins L.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The stresses that activate p53 are diverse, ranging from DNA damage to oxidative stress, hypoxia, and heat shock (23Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of TNFα were also demonstrated to be mediated, at least in part, by p53 activation (24Jeoung D.-i. Tang B. Sonenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18367-18373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Donato N.J. Perez M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5067-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Rokhlin O.W. Gudkov A.V. Kwek S. Glover R.A. Gewies A.S. Cohen M.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, p53 has been thought to be a guardian angel against cellular stresses. Especially, it has been extensively studied and well established as a tumor suppressor. However, other roles of p53 beyond tumor suppression are still obscure.Considering that TNFα is relevant to both cell growth and metabolic events and that its effects are partly mediated by p53, we speculated that p53 could be involved in situations of metabolic deterioration associated with insulin resistance. It is possible that p53 as a general repressor of gene transcription could prevent insulin-responsive genes from being activated. Moreover, a previous report on the gene expression profile of ob/ob mouse adipose tissue examined by DNA microarray analysis has revealed that p21 and Bax α, both of which are well-known p53 target genes, are increased from 2- to 3-fold in ob/ob mice (27Soukas A. Cohen P. Socci N.D. Friedman J.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 963-980PubMed Google Scholar).Based on these facts, we hypothesized that hypertrophied adipocytes are under various stresses that induce p53, which in turn suppresses lipogenesis in a negative feedback regulation. In our present study, we discovered that p53 is induced upon refeeding in ob/ob adipocytes and activates its target genes including p21. In addition, p53 is involved in the suppression of SREBP-1 and the concomitant down-regulation of lipogenic enzymes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—p53+/–-C57BL/6J (28Livingstone L.R. White A. Sprouse J. Livanos E. Jacks T. Tlsty T.D. Cell. 1992; 70: 923-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar) and Lep +/ob-C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine). These mice were intercrossed to produce double homozygotes. Genotypes at the p53 loci were determined using the PCR method with primer pairs specific for the wild-type allele of p53 (primers directed against p53 exon 6 and 7; 5′-GGAAATTTGTATCCCGAGTATCTG-3′ and 5′-GTCTTCCAGTGTGATGATGGTAA-3′, respectively) and the mutant allele of p53 (primers directed against neo; 5′-ATGATTGAACAAGATGGATTGC-3′ and 5′-TCGGTCTTGACAAAAAGAACC-3′). Genotypes at the leptin loci were determined by a PCR-based restricted fragment length polymorphism analysis as previously described (19Yahagi N. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T. Ide T. Yoshikawa T. Amemiya-Kudo M. Tomita S. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Nagai R. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19353-19357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle and free access to water and a standard chow diet (Oriental MF, Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan). All experiments were performed with 12-week-old male mice. For fasting and refeeding studies, mice were fasted for 24 h or refed for 12 h after 24-h starvation. For the ob/ob×p53 –/– experiment, mice were refed for 12 h following a 24-h fast prior to sacrifice. All animals were sacrificed in an early phase of the light cycle.Nuclear Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting—Nuclear extract protein from white adipose tissue was prepared as described previously (27Soukas A. Cohen P. Socci N.D. Friedman J.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 963-980PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh adipose tissue (∼3 g pooled from 3–10 male mice) was rinsed in ice-cold PBS, minced, and homogenized with 10 strokes of a Teflon homogenizer in 15 ml of NDS buffer at 4 °C (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 14 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (12.5 μg/ml N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal-CHO (ALLN, Calbiochem), 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nonidet P-40 concentration was increased to 1% and nuclei were pelleted at 700 × g for 10 min, washed once with 25 ml NDS buffer (1% Nonidet P-40), filtered through 70 μm mesh, pelleted at 500 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 1 volume of 1% citric acid, lysed by the addition of 2.5 volumes of 0.1 m Tris, 2.5% SDS and 0.1 m dithiothreitol, sonicated briefly, and heated to 90 °C for 5 min. Aliquots of nuclear protein (15 μg) were subjected to SDS/PAGE. p53 was detected using a 1:500 dilution of anti-p53FL (sc-6243, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The phosphorylation at Ser-15 of p53 was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-p53Ser-15 (9284S, New England Biolabs). To confirm equal loading of nuclear protein, a 1:500 dilution of anti-c-myc (sc-764, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was also used. Bound antibodies were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized using ECL Western blotting detection system kit (Amersham Biosciences).Northern Blotting—Total RNA from epididymal fat pad was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and 10 μg RNA samples equally pooled from each group (n = 3–6) were run on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane. For experiments with isolated adipocytes, total RNA from adipocytes isolated by collagenase digestion was prepared as previously described (29Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, fresh adipose tissue (∼4 g) was minced in 8 ml buffer A (10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 5.2 mm KCl, 1.3 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 3% BSA, 2 mm glucose, 200 nm adenosine) at 37 °C and mixed with equal volume of buffer A containing 4 mg/ml collagenase (type II for adipocyte, Sigma). Following 1-hour digestion with gentle shaking at 37 °C, adipocytes were filtered through 250 μm nylon mesh, washed with 30 ml of buffer A, transferred to another tube, and mixed with 4 volumes of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA sample (10 μg) from one mouse was applied on each lane. The cDNA probes for SREBP-1, fatty acid synthase, ATP citrate lyase, spot 14 and 36B4 (acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0) were cloned as described previously (30Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E.

The cDNA probes for p53, p21, p27, mdm-2, Bax α, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) were prepared by cloning RT-PCR products from mouse liver or adipose tissue RNA into pGEM-T easy vectors (Promega). The primers used for PCR were as follows: for p53, 5′ primer was 5′-GGAAATTTGTATCCCGAGTATCTG-3′ and 3′ primer was 5′-GTCTTCCAGTGTGATGATGGTAA-3′; for p21, 5′ primer was 5′-TGTCCAATCCTGGTGATGTC-3′ and 3′ primer was 5′-TCTCTTGCAGAAGACCAATCTG-3′; for p27, 5′ primer was 5′-GTCAAACGTGAGAGTGTCTAACG-3′ and 3′ primer was 5′-GCGAAGAAGAATCTTCTGCA-3′; for mdm-2, 5′ primer was 5′-CCAGGCCAATGTGCAATAC-3′ and 3′ primer was 5′-GTGAGCAGGTCAGCTAGTTGAA-3′; for Bax α, 5′ primer was 5′-GCTCTGAACAGATCATGAAGACA-3′ and 3′ primer was 5′-CATGATGGTTCTGATCAGCTC-3′; for IGFBP-3, 5′ primer was 5′-CATGCCAAGATGGATGTCATC-3′ and 3′ primer was 5′-GAGGCAATGTACGTCGTCTTTC-3′; for GPDH, 5′ primer was 5′-CCATGGCTGGCAAGAAAGT-3′ and 3′ primer was 5′-AATCACTTCAGAAATGAGCTTCAG-3′; for TNFα, 5′ primer was 5′-GGTTCTGTCCCTTTCACTCACTG-3′ and 3′ primer was 5′-TTGACCTCAGCGCTGAGTTG-3′. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Megaprime DNA labeling system kit (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were hybridized with the radiolabeled probe in Rapid-hyb Buffer (Amersham Biosciences) at 65 °C with the exception of p53 and TNFα, for which ULTRAhyb hybridization buffer (Ambion) was used at 42 °C. The membranes were washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Blots were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film.Plasmid Constructions—Luciferase gene constructs containing 2.6-kb fragments of the mouse SREBP-1c promoter (pBP1c-Luc) and 0.24-kb fragments of the rat fatty acid synthase promoter (pFAS-Luc) were prepared as described previously (32Amemiya-Kudo M. Shimano H. Yoshikawa T. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Sato R. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol.

Plasmid pGPDH-Luc was constructed by PCR amplification of –489 bp to +23 bp of the mouse glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) promoter region (34Phillips M. Djian P. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10821-10827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and insertion of the PCR products into pGL2-basic vector (Promega). Plasmid p53-Luc, a luciferase reporter plasmid containing 14 tandem copies of p53-binding motif (TGCCTGGACTTGCCTGG) and the luciferase gene was purchased from Stratagene. Mouse p53 expression plasmid driven by the CMV promoter (pCMV-p53) was constructed by inserting a DNA fragment amplified with PCR using first strand cDNA from mouse adipose tissue as a template, two primers (5′ primer: 5′-TGGCTGTAGGTAGCGACTACAGTTA-3′ and 3′ primer: 5′-AGGCAGTCAGTCTGAGTCAGG-3′) and Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) into pCMV7 vector (35Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All DNA fragments generated with PCR were verified by sequencing.Transfections and Luciferase Assays—p53-null human osteogenic sarcoma cell line SaOS-2 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). SaOS-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. On day 0, cells were plated on a 12 well plate at 5 × 104 cells/well. On day 3, pCMV-p53 plasmid (1.0 μg), each luciferase reporter plasmid (0.25 μg), and a CMV-β-galactosidase reference plasmid (pCMV-β-gal, Promega, 0.1 μg) were transfected into SaOS-2 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. As a control, the same amount of empty vector pCMV7 was transfected instead of pCMV-p53 plasmid. After 48-h incubation, cells were harvested, and the amount of luciferase activity in transfectants was measured by standard kits (Promega).RESULTSp53 Activation upon Refeeding in ob/ob Adipocytes at the mRNA Level—In our first series of experiments, we demonstrated that ob/ob mouse adipose tissue had higher levels of p53 mRNA and protein than did wild type (Fig. 1). p53 is known to be regulated at different levels including through transcription, protein phosphorylation and degradation, and we found that the primary step of p53 activation in ob/ob mouse adipose tissue was at mRNA level, although this does not rule out additional post-transcriptional regulations. Consistent with the induced expression, an active form of p53, phosphorylated at Ser-15, was also up-regulated in ob/ob adipose tissue (Fig. 1b).Next we evaluated the mRNA abundance of p53 under various nutritional conditions. To our surprise, the increased expression of p53 in ob/ob mouse adipose tissue was limited to a fed state and no difference was observed in a fasted state (Fig. 2a). The mRNA elevation of p53 appeared to be fully induced within 6 h after refeeding (Fig. 2b). p53 was revealed to be induced mainly in adipocytes when they were isolated from stromal cells by collagenase digestion (Fig. 2c), and the residual stromal cells showed far lower levels of p53 expression which did not rise upon refeeding (data not shown).Fig. 2p53 induction upon refeeding in ob/ob mouse adipocytes. a, Northern blot analysis of p53 and its downstream genes in adipose tissue from wild type (WT) and ob/ob (OB) mice (six male mice each) is shown. Mice were sacrificed in a fasted (left two lanes) or refed state. b, time course of p53 induction after refeeding in ob/ob mouse adipose tissue. Northern blot analysis of p53 in ob/ob mice (three male mice each) refed for the indicated time is shown. c, Northern blot analysis of isolated adipocytes from fasted (left three lanes) or refed (right three lanes) ob/ob mice. Total RNA (10 μg) was subjected to Northern blotting, followed by hybridization with the indicated cDNA probes. A cDNA probe for 36B4 (acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0) was used to confirm equal loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)p53 Activation in ob/ob Adipocytes Is Associated with Induction of p53-regulated Genes—To clarify the potential role of p53 in ob/ob adipocytes, we further examined the expression profile of p53 downstream genes such as p21, mdm-2, Bax α, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). As shown in Fig. 2a, these p53-regulated genes were elevated in adipose tissue of refed ob/ob mice. These data indicate that p53 activation causes the up-regulation of its target genes in ob/ob adipocytes.Effects of p53 Absence on the mRNA Expression of p53-regulated Genes in ob/ob Mouse Adipose Tissue—To assess the effects of p53 deficiency in ob/ob mice and validate that the elevation of p53 downstream genes are really caused by p53, we intercrossed ob/ob and p53-null mice, and obtained 6 male mice deficient in both leptin and p53 (ob/ob×p53 –/–) in the C57BL/6J background. Doubly mutant ob/ob×p53 –/– mice showed no significant difference in body weight, epididymal fat pad weight, plasma glucose or insulin concentration compared with ob/ob mice (data not shown). The Northern blot analysis on these mice in a refed state (Fig. 3) exhibited that p53-regulated genes such as p21, mdm-2, Bax α, and IGFBP-3 in ob/ob mice lacking p53 were completely suppressed to the same levels as in wild type. These results established that p53 induction after refeeding caused the elevated expression of its target genes in ob/ob adipocytes. Heterozygotes of p53 gene disruption in ob/ob mice maintained the similar levels of p53 downstream genes to those of ob/ob mice conceivably by compensation by the intact allele.Fig. 3Effects of p53 absence on the mRNA expression of p53-regulated genes in ob/ob mouse adipose tissue.

To determine whether these changes are ascribable to p53, we analyzed p53–/– mice in fasted or refed conditions. As shown in Fig. 4, the elevation of p21 and IGFBP-3 in a fasted state was also observed in p53–/– mice, and hence, entirely independent of p53.Fig. 4Up-regulation of p21 by fasting is independent of p53. Northern blot analysis of various genes including p53-regulated genes in adipose tissue from wild type and p53–/– mice is shown. Mice were sacrificed in a fasted (left two lanes) or refed state.

In contrast, we have previously reported that the adipose tissue of ob/ob mice shows lower levels and defective refeeding responses in the expression of lipogenic enzymes as well as SREBP-1 that regulates their transcription (19Yahagi N. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T. Ide T. Yoshikawa T. Amemiya-Kudo M. Tomita S. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Nagai R. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19353-19357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In the current studies we found that the suppression of lipogenic enzymes in ob/ob adipose tissue is confined to a subgroup of enzymes such as fatty acid synthase and ATP citrate lyase, whose expression is primarily dominated by SREBP-1 (Fig. 5a). In contrast, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme for glycerogenesis and also important for lipogenesis, was not suppressed in refed ob/ob mouse adipose tissue. Based on the lack of change in its gene expression by the SREBP-1 overexpression, we assume that glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is not an SREBP-1 target gene.2 These results suggest that p53 suppresses lipogenic gene expression in ob/ob adipocytes by the inhibition of SREBP-1 expression.Fig. 5p53 overexpression suppresses lipogenic gene responses upon refeeding. a, defective refeeding responses of lipogenic genes in ob/ob mouse adipose tissue.

Northern blot analysis displayed that lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase and ATP citrate lyase along with SREBP-1 were moderately elevated in ob/ob mice lacking p53, showing that the absence of p53 partially de-suppresses lipogenic gene down-regulation (Fig. 5b). These findings demonstrate that p53 is involved in the suppression of lipogenic genes in ob/ob adipocytes. However, the restoration was limited within relatively minor range, suggesting that other factors than p53 are involved in this negative regulation.Mechanism by Which p53 Suppresses Lipogenic Gene Expression—To explore the mechanism by which p53 suppresses lipogenic gene expression, we performed luciferase reporter assays in cultured cells. We used p53-null cell line SaOS-2 as the transfectant. As shown in Fig. 5c, p53 overexpression suppressed the promoter activity of fatty acid synthase gene as well as that of SREBP-1c gene. In contrast, the promoter activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was not suppressed by p53, which corresponds to the in vivo results described above. These findings provide further evidence that p53 suppress lipogenic genes by reducing SREBP-1 expression.DISCUSSIONOur present studies clearly demonstrate that p53 is induced upon refeeding in ob/ob adipocytes, leading to the negative regulation of lipogenic genes. The mechanisms of p53 induction are currently not clear. However, the causes that lead to p53 activation are diverse, ranging from DNA damag"
https://openalex.org/W2012378866,"Troglitazone (TGZ), a member of the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic compounds and a peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, restores systemic insulin sensitivity and improves the full insulin resistance syndrome in vivo. The mechanisms underlying its in vivo function are not understood. Here we investigated the potential functional interaction between PPAR-gamma and NF-kappaB in adipocytes. We show that TGZ selectively blocked tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced and NF-kappaB-dependent repression of multiple adipocyte-specific genes and induction of growth phase and other genes. This occurs without interfering with NF-kappaB expression, activation, nuclear translocation, or DNA binding and without suppressing NF-kappaB-dependent survival signals. Notably, the expressions of some tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced genes in adipocytes were unaffected by PPAR-gamma activation. In reporter gene assays in HeLa cells, ectopic expression of PPAR-gamma abolished induction of a NF-kappaB-responsive reporter gene by the p65 subunit (RelA) of NF-kappaB, and the inhibition was further enhanced in the presence of TGZ. Conversely, overexpression of p65 inhibited induction of a PPAR-gamma-responsive reporter gene by activated PPAR-gamma in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was independent of the presence of NF-kappaB-binding sites in the promoter region. Other NF-kappaB family members, p50 and c-Rel as well as the S276A mutant of p65, blocked PPAR-gamma-mediated gene transcription less effectively. Thus, p65 antagonizes the transcriptional regulatory activity of PPAR-gamma in adipocytes, and PPAR-gamma activation can at least partially override the inhibitory effects of p65 on the expression of key adipocyte genes. Our data suggest that inhibition of NF-kappaB activity is a mechanism by which PPAR-gamma agonists improve insulin sensitivity in vivo and that adipocyte NF-kappaB is a potential therapeutic target for obesity-linked type 2 diabetes."

Although activated forms of Ras are frequently associated with oncogenesis, they may also provoke growth-antagonistic effects. These include senescence, cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis. The mechanisms that underlie these growth-inhibitory activities are relatively poorly understood. Recently, two related novel Ras effectors, NORE1 and RASSF1, have been identified as mediators of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Both of these proteins exhibit many of the properties normally associated with tumor suppressors. We now identify a novel third member of this family, designated RASSF2. RASSF2 binds directly to K-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner via the Ras effector domain. However, RASSF2 only weakly interacts with H-Ras. Moreover, RASSF2 promotes apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and is frequently down-regulated in lung tumor cell lines.

The Ras family of oncoproteins is intimately involved in the regulation of a wide variety of biological processes (1Malumbres M. Pellicer A. Front.

In contrast to the Ras pathways mediating mitogenesis and transformation, those mediating growth-antagonistic effects remain relatively poorly characterized. RASSF1 has recently been identified as a potential tumor suppressor that can serve as a Ras effector (12Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol.

Wilczynski S.P. Dammann R. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). NORE1 is related to RASSF1 and can also induce a Ras-dependent apoptosis (16Khokhlatchev A.

Like RASSF1, NORE1 is frequently down-regulated in primary tumors and tumor cell lines (17Vos M.D. Martinez A. Ellis C.A. Valecorsa T. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21938-21943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Data base analysis suggests that there may be more members of this family. We identified in the GenBank™ data base a human RASSF1-like hypothetical protein that was originally designated KIAA0168 but now is being referred to as RASSF2. We cloned the gene and sought to determine whether RASSF2 is also a Ras effector/tumor suppressor of the RASSF1 family. We now report that RASSF2 can bind directly to K-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner via the Ras effector domain. Therefore, RASSF2 demonstrates the basic characteristics of a Ras effector. The interaction of RASSF2 with Ras appears to be specific to K-Ras, as only a weak interaction could be detected with H-Ras. Rather than promoting transformation, over-expression of RASSF2 inhibits the growth of lung tumor cells. RASSF2-mediated growth inhibition is enhanced by activated K-Ras and appears to involve both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Analysis of RASSF2 protein expression in a series of human lung tumor cell lines shows that the protein is frequently down-regulated. Thus, we show that RASSF2 is a new member of the RASSF1 family and shares the properties of being a potential Ras effector/tumor suppressor. Identification of RASSF2—RASSF2 was identified by performing a tblastn search of the GenBank™ data base using the Ras association (RA) 1The abbreviations used are: RA, Ras association; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein. domain of RASSF1 as a query. The human hypothetical protein KIAA0168 was identified as a potential RASSF1-like protein. This protein is now being referred to as RASSF2/Rasfadin (18Comincini S. Castiglioni B.M. Foti G.M. Del Vecchio I. Ferretti L. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and we will conform to this convention. Sequences were aligned using ClustalW. DNA and Plasmids—RASSF2 was identified as IMAGE Consortium clone 22950 distributed by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). The RASSF2 coding region was PCR-cloned using oligomers 5′-ggatccatggactacagccaccaaac and 3′-caattgtcagattgttgctggggtc, which added a BamHI site to the 5′ end and an MfeI site to the 3′ end. After sequencing to confirm fidelity, the gene was cloned into pZIPHA, pCDNAF (17Vos M.D. Martinez A. Ellis C.A. Valecorsa T. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21938-21943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and pEGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as a BamHI/MfeI fragment. The RA domain of RASSF2 (nucleotides 535–789) was cloned as a BamHI/MfeI fragment into pMal (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) and pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences). Activated K-Ras was cloned into the BamHI site of pCGNHA (19Fiordalisi J.J. Johnson R.L. Ulku A.S. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and effector mutants were generated using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Ras Binding Assays—In vivo assays were performed by transfecting 293-T cells with 5 μg of each plasmid using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20Ellis C.A. Vos M.D. Howell H. Vallecorsa T. Fults D.W. Clark G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9876-9881Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitated with HA beads (Sigma). The immunoprecipitate was then subjected to Western analysis with an anti-FLAG monoclonal (Sigma) to measure the co-precipitation of RASSF2. In vitro binding assays were performed using purified GST fusion protein of the RA domain of RASSF2 and purified K-Ras derived from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (a generous gift of D. Stokoe, University of California, San Francisco, CA). K-Ras protein was loaded with the GTP analog guanylyl-5-imidodiphosphate (Sigma) by incubating in 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA with 6 mm GTP analog (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. The loaded protein was then stabilized with 10 mm MgCl2. 2 pg of loaded protein were then added to 100 ng of fusion protein on Sepharose beads in phosphate-buffered saline with 1× protease inhibitors (Pharmingen), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20. The proteins were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, washed three times, and then subjected to Western analysis. Growth Inhibition Assays—Cell lines were obtained from the ATCC. A549 human lung carcinoma cells were transfected with 1 μg of pZIPHA RASSF2 or empty vector and selected in 500 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks. Cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. Transient growth inhibition assays were performed in 293-T cells by transfecting with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (12Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35669-35672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Apoptosis Assays—RASSF2-induced apoptosis was examined by using the pCaspase3-Sensor system (Clontech) and fluorescent microscopy to measure caspase-3 activation in individual live cells. This system uses an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) fused with a nuclear export signal and a nuclear localization signal. The nuclear export signal is dominant and separated from the EYFP by a caspase-3 cleavage site. In the absence of active caspase-3, the EYFP localizes to the cytosol. In the presence of active caspase-3, the nuclear export signal is cleaved off, and the nuclear localization signal promotes transport into the nucleus. Cells were transfected with 100 ng of pCaspase3-Sensor and/or red fluorescent protein-RASSF2. After 24 h, red cells were examined for the localization of EYFP. The detection of caspase-3 activation and induction of apoptosis using this method were quantified by identifying and counting cells that co-expressed the nuclear localized pCaspase3-Sensor protein and red fluorescent protein-RASSF2. In situ trypan blue uptake was performed on 293 HEK cells (ATCC). Cells were transfected with 5 μg of RASSF2 in the presence or absence of 50 ng of K-Ras12V. 72 h post-transfection trypan blue was added at a final concentration of 0.04%. Dye uptake was quantitated by counting the number of blue cells in three random 40× fields. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—Cell cycle analysis was performed in 293-T cells transfected with 5 μg of pEGFP empty vector or pEGFP-RASSF2 using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection cells were harvested and resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in medium with low serum (2%). Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 3 μg/ml and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation cells were immediately centrifuged in the cold, resuspended to a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml, and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. DNA content of GFP-positive cells was determined using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting Vantage S.E. (BD Biosciences). The software programs CellQuest (BD Biosciences) and ModFit (Verity Software House) were used for data acquisition and cell cycle modeling. Northern Analysis—A commercial, prequantitated normal tissue blot of mRNA was obtained from Clontech. The coding region of RASSF2 was used as a probe. Experiments were performed as described previously (12Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35669-35672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Assay of RASSF2 Protein Expression in Tumor Cell Lines—RASSF2 polyclonal antiserum was prepared to the peptide GLRRPIRLQMQDDNERIR (residues 61–78) by ResGen (Huntsville, AL) and affinity-purified. The antibody did not cross-react with NORE1 or RASSF1 (data not shown). Specificity was confirmed by peptide competition experiments (data not shown). The antibody was then used at a dilution of 1/1000 to perform Western analysis of a series of human lung tumor cell lines. Sequence Comparison of Human RASSF2, RASSF1, and NORE1—Sequences were aligned using ClustalW (Fig. 1). The RA domain is boxed in Fig. 1 and shows 28% identity to that of RASSF1A and 31% identity to that of NORE1. RASSF2 lacks the cysteine-rich domain of NORE1 and RASSF1A. Binding of K-Ras to RASSF2—To determine whether Ras and RASSF2 could interact, we first performed co-transfection experiments in 293-T cells with FLAG-tagged RASSF2 and HA-tagged activated and wild type K-Ras. After 48 h, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with HA-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 1 h. After washing, the immunoprecipitate was subjected to Western analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody. Fig. 2a (top) shows that RASSF2 preferentially precipitates with activated K-Ras. The relative quantities of Ras and RASSF2 in the lysate were determined by immunoblotting the lysate with HA and FLAG (Fig. 2a, bottom). We next determined if the interaction required the effector domain of Ras by using a similar strategy with a series of effector mutants of K-Ras. Figure 2b (top) shows that mutations in the effector domain of K-Ras severely impair the ability of the protein to bind RASSF2. Again, a Western blot of the lysates before immunoprecipitation is shown at the bottom of Fig. 2b. Finally, we examined the possibility that RASSF2 might preferentially bind K-Ras over H-Ras. In Fig. 2c we show that although activated K-Ras readily precipitated RASSF2, the levels of RASSF2 precipitating with activated H-Ras were barely detectable. Protein levels in the lysate are again shown at the bottom of Fig. 2c. To confirm that the K-Ras-RASSF2 interaction is direct, we prepared recombinant GST fusion protein of the RA domain of RASSF2. This was used as an affinity reagent to precipitate purified, farnesylated K-Ras (generous gift of D. Stokoe, University of California, San Francisco, CA). Fig. 3a shows that the RASSF2-RA domain fusion protein can precipitate farnesylated K-Ras from solution. Equal loading of GST fusion protein was confirmed by Western blotting of a sample of the precipitate with an anti-GST antibody (Fig. 3b) (Santa Cruz Biochemicals, Santa Cruz, CA). Note that the GST-RA domain fusion protein construct also produced GST. Similar results were obtained with a maltose-binding protein fusion of the RASSF2 RA domain (data not shown). Therefore, RASSF2 binds directly to K-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner via the effector domain. RASSF2 Expression Inhibits Cell Growth—RASSF2 was cloned into a selectable expression vector, pZIPHA, and transfected into A549 human lung carcinoma cells. Cells were selected for 2 weeks and then stained with crystal violet (Fig. 4). Cells transfected with RASSF2 failed to generate colonies, whereas the vector alone gave a virtually confluent plate. As we were unable to generate stable cell lines expressing RASSF2, we resorted to transient transfections to determine the effects of Ras on RASSF2-mediated growth inhibition. 293-T cells were transfected with RASSF2 ± activated Ras and examined after 48 h (Fig. 5). At this time point, modest growth inhibition was detected with the RASSF2 alone, but this was dramatically enhanced by the presence of activated K-Ras. Interestingly, H-Ras had little effect on this activity. To determine whether the growth inhibition by RASSF2 was apoptotic in nature and whether the presence of activated Ras enhanced this process, we transfected 293 cells with RASSF2 ± K-Ras12V. 72 h post-transfection we added trypan blue directly to the cells and quantitated dead cells by dye uptake. Fig. 6 shows that RASSF2 on its own promotes modest cell death, but in the presence of activated K-Ras cell death is enhanced. Quantification is shown in Fig. 6b.Fig. 6RASSF2-mediated cell death is enhanced by K-Ras4B. 293 cells were transiently transfected with RASSF2 ± activated K-Ras.

Cells were co-transfected with pCaspase3-Sensor and red fluorescent protein-RASSF2. After 24 h, red cells were examined for the localization of EYFP. Fig. 7a shows that in vector-transfected cells the EYFP remained cytosolic. However, in RASSF2-co-transfected cells, the majority of cells showed nuclear localization of EYFP, hence demonstrating caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. The results are quantified in Fig. 7b. We also performed cell cycle assays on GFP-RASSF2-transfected 293-T cells. Fig. 8 demonstrates that GFP-RASSF2-expressing cells consistently show an ∼20% decrease in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, suggesting that the cells tend to arrest in the G0/G1 phase. Expression of RASSF2 in Normal Tissue and Tumor Cells—To determine the tissue specificity of RASSF2 we performed Northern analysis on a commercial normal tissue mRNA blot. A single transcript was detected at 5.4 kb in most tissue. The signal was most intense in the brain, peripheral blood, placenta, and lung samples (Fig. 9). To determine whether RASSF2 might be down-regulated during tumorigenesis, we generated a RASSF2-specific polyclonal antibody. We prepared lysates from a series of human lung tumor cell lines and examined them for RASSF2 protein expression. A normal bronchial epithelial cell line was used as a control. Western analysis demonstrated that the RASSF2 protein was frequently down-regulated in the human lung tumor cell lines (Fig 10). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen was used as an internal control for protein loading.Fig. 10RASSF2 protein expression is frequently down-regulated in human lung tumor cell lines. A RASSF2-specific polyclonal antibody to RASSF2 was prepared and used to examine a series of lung tumor cell lines by Western analysis. A normal human bronchial epithelia (NHBE) cell line was used as a positive control. Most lung tumor cell lines were negative for expression.

A. 2001; 98: 5025-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This capacity to induce transformation or death is not unique to Ras but has also been described for other key oncoproteins such as c-MYC (23Hueber A.O. Evan G.I. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Lowe S.W. Lin A.W. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Thus, certain critical oncoproteins provide a close linkage between the processes of life and death. Which function attains dominance in a particular cell after oncogene activation will determine whether that cell extinguishes itself or progresses to become a successful tumor. Understanding the anti-oncogenic pathways mediated by oncogenes may provide valuable alternative targets for therapeutics. Ras pathways mediating growth inhibition and death are not as well characterized as those used to promote mitogenesis and transformation. However, the recent discovery of the NORE1-RASSF1 class of Ras effectors has started to address this deficiency. RASSF1 and NORE1 have been reported to mediate Ras-dependent apoptosis as well as cell cycle arrest (12Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35669-35672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 14Shivakumar L. Minna J. Sakamaki T. Pestell R. White M.A. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21938-21943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Not only do these proteins mediate growth inhibition, but they are also frequently down-regulated during tumor development. Moreover, reintroduction of the genes into tumor cell lines results in a loss of tumorigenicity (13Dammann R. Li C. Yoon J.H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 16Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21938-21943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, these proteins have the potential to serve as tumor suppressors that are directly activated by Ras. Loss of function of these growth-inhibitory Ras-controlled pathways may prove as critical as gain of function of conventional Ras-controlled pathways during tumor development. Bioinformatic data base analysis suggests that there may be several other members of the NORE1-RASSF1 family that remain uncharacterized. We have now cloned and characterized RASSF2 to determine whether it too serves as a Ras effector/tumor suppressor. Examination of the Ras binding properties of RASSF2 showed that it would readily associate with farnesylated K-Ras in a GTP-preferential manner. Moreover, the interaction was direct as the purified RA domain bound purified, farnesylated K-Ras4B. K-ras is the most commonly activated ras gene in human tumors (25Clark G.J. Der C.J. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. GTPases in Biology. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1993: 259-287Google Scholar) and is the only ras gene that is essential for embryonic development (26Johnson L. Greenbaum D. Cichowski K. Mercer K. Murphy E. Schmitt E. Bronson R.T. Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2468-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that K-Ras protein is functionally different from the other Ras isoforms and has a special role in transformation and development. It has been hypothesized that the reason for the special properties of K-Ras is that there may be certain Ras effector proteins that are particularly critical to tumorigenesis and development that preferentially associate with K-Ras (27Ellis C.A. Clark G.J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, although differences in effector binding between the Ras isoforms have been reported (28Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), these involved only a 2–3-fold difference in binding activity. Here we see an almost complete preference for K-Ras over H-Ras. Thus, RASSF2 could play a key role in mediating some of the unique biological properties of K-Ras. As we had found some difficulty in showing stable association of RASSF2 with H-Ras, we manufactured the three classic Ras effector mutants, E37G, T35S, and Y40C (29White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) in K-Ras4B12V. Only the T35S mutant retained any ability to interact with RASSF2, and this was rather weak. Thus, the interaction of RASSF2 and K-Ras4B is via the Ras effector domain. Hence, RASSF2 meets the basic requirements for a potential Ras effector. Ras effector mutants have been used as tools to identify the Ras pathways that are critical for tumor development (30Ward Y. Wang W. Woodhouse E. Linnoila I. Liotta L. Kelly K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5958-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Hamad N.M. Elconin J.H. Karnoub A.E. Bai W. Rich J.N. Abraham R.T. Der C.J. Counter C.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2045-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Interpreting the results of this type of study should now take into account the potential loss of interaction with tumor suppressor effectors, such as RASSF2, as well as the loss of interaction with oncoprotein effectors, such as Raf-1. The mechanism of action of the RASSF1 family of proteins remains under investigation. Whereas RASSF1 and NORE1 have been shown to promote apoptosis in some cell types (12Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35669-35672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 16Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T.

Biol. 2002; 22: 4309-4318Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) suggest they cause cell cycle arrest, not apoptosis, in others. Consequently, we decided to examine both parameters for RASSF2. We found that RASSF2 promoted the activation of caspase-3 in COS-7 cells. A similar effect was observed in 293-T cells (data not shown), but the results were much clearer in the COS-7 cell type due to their flatter morphology. Thus, RASSF2 can promote apoptosis. To examine cell cycle effects, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of GFP-RASSF2 expressing 293-T cells. These fast cycling cells showed a 20% decrease in the G2/M component in three separate experiments. This suggests that the cells are tending to arrest in G0/G1. Thus, RASSF2 can promote apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. A potential mechanism for NORE1-induced apoptosis was recently identified by Khokhlatchev et al. (16Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S. Xavier R. Nedwidek M. Chen T. Zhang X.F. Seed B. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 253-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) when it was demonstrated that NORE1 binds to the pro-apoptotic kinase MST1. However, they were unable to demonstrate that NORE1 activated the MST1 kinase activity (in fact, it appears to inhibit it), and so although this is an intriguing observation, the role of MST1 kinase in NORE1/RASSF1/RASSF2-mediated cell death remains unclear. Analysis of RASSF2 mRNA levels in normal tissue shows considerable differential expression. Interestingly, some of the tissues which show the lowest levels of RASSF2 expression (heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle) give among the highest levels of RASSF1 expression in an identical blot (12Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35669-35672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Both genes show detectable levels of mRNA in normal lung tissue. Analysis of RASSF2 expression in a panel of lung tumor cell lines showed that the protein is expressed at modest levels in a normal human bronchial epithelia cell line but fell to undetectable levels in most of the tumor cell lines examined. Intriguingly, one cell line, 441, showed very high levels of RASSF2 expression. This suggests that either there is a mutation in the RASSF2 that renders it non-growth-inhibitory or that there is a mutation in a downstream component of the RASSF2 pathway that makes this cell line resistant to RASSF2-mediated growth inhibition. These possibilities are currently being investigated. In summary, we now identify a third member of the RASSF1-NORE1 family that preferentially binds K-Ras with the characteristics of an effector. RASSF2 inhibits the growth of tumor cells, and its growth-inhibitory properties are enhanced by activated K-Ras. RASSF2 promotes both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis; consequently, its down-regulation may play a key role in the development of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1977013265,"We have investigated the mechanism of frataxin, a conserved mitochondrial protein involved in iron metabolism and neurodegenerative disease. Previous studies revealed that the yeast frataxin homologue (mYfh1p) is activated by Fe(II) in the presence of O2 and assembles stepwise into a 48-subunit multimer (α48) that sequesters >2000 atoms of iron in 2–4-nm cores structurally similar to ferritin iron cores. Here we show that mYfh1p assembly is driven by two sequential iron oxidation reactions: A ferroxidase reaction catalyzed by mYfh1p induces the first assembly step (α → α3), followed by a slower autoxidation reaction that promotes the assembly of higher order oligomers yielding α48. Depending on the ionic environment, stepwise assembly is associated with accumulation of 50–75 Fe(II)/subunit. Initially, this Fe(II) is loosely bound to mYfh1p and can be readily mobilized by chelators or made available to the mitochondrial enzyme ferrochelatase to synthesize heme. Transfer of mYfh1p-bound Fe(II) to ferrochelatase occurs in the presence of citrate, a physiologic ferrous iron chelator, suggesting that the transfer involves an intermolecular interaction. If mYfh1p-bound Fe(II) is not transferred to a ligand, iron oxidation, and mineralization proceed to completion, Fe(III) becomes progressively less accessible, and a stable iron-protein complex is formed. Iron oxidation-driven stepwise assembly is a novel mechanism by which yeast frataxin can function as an iron chaperone or an iron store.

Iron oxidation-driven stepwise assembly is a novel mechanism by which yeast frataxin can function as an iron chaperone or an iron store. Mitochondria require micromolar concentrations of iron to support the heme and the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthetic pathways (1Petrat F. de Groot H. Rauen U. Biochem.

Making this iron bioavailable while limiting its participation in free radical reactions is an essential function accomplished by mechanisms that remain largely uncharacterized (2Tangeras A. Biochim.

Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 221-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). FRDA is caused by defects in frataxin, a conserved nucleus-encoded mitochondrial protein of as yet unknown function (6Rotig A. Sidi D. Munnich A. Rustin P. Trends Mol.

Monticelli A. et al.Science. 1996; 271: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar). Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that the loss of frataxin results in accumulation of iron in mitochondria, widespread oxidative damage to mitochondrial and nuclear DNA via Fenton chemistry, and impaired respiration (8Babcock M. de Silva D.

An open question is how frataxin influences two different iron-dependent pathways and also provides protection from iron toxicity. We have proposed that such diverse roles could be reconciled if the basic function of frataxin were to bind and store iron in a bioavailable and nontoxic form (20Patel P.I. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our studies with recombinant yeast frataxin have shown that the protein is activated by Fe(II) in the presence of O2 and forms an oligomeric species (α3) that catalyzes Fe(II) oxidation (21Park S. Gakh O. Mooney S.M. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38589-38595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). When the Fe(II) concentration exceeds the iron-loading capacity of α3, stepwise assembly of α3 oligomers yields a 48-subunit multimer (α48) that sequesters ∼2,400 atoms of ferric iron. The multimer is a regular spherical particle with a hydrodynamic radius of ∼11 nm and contains small iron cores of 2–4 nm (22Gakh O. Adamec J. Gacy M.A. Twesten R.D. Owen W.G. Isaya G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6798-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with Fe-O and Fe-Fe interactions similar to those found in ferritin iron cores (23Nichol H. Gakh O. O'Neill H.A. Pickering I.J. Isaya G. Graham N.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5971-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similarly, recombinant human frataxin assembles during expression in Escherichia coli yielding regular spherical particles of ∼1 MDa and ordered polymers of these particles that sequester up to 10 atoms of iron per subunit in small cores structurally identical to the yeast frataxin iron cores (23Nichol H. Gakh O. O'Neill H.A. Pickering I.J. Isaya G. Graham N.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5971-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). High molecular weight forms of frataxin can be detected by gel filtration and Western blotting in yeast cells or mouse cardiac tissue, and the native protein binds stoichiometric amounts of 55Fe in metabolically labeled yeast cells (24Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 25Cavadini P. O'Neill H.A. Benada O. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 33: 217-227Crossref Google Scholar). These previous findings support the idea that frataxin, like ferritin, has an iron storage role. Here, we have tested if frataxin might also serve as a reservoir of bioavailable iron. We describe the coupled stepwise-assembly/iron-oxidation reaction of yeast frataxin and show that this mechanism is compatible with both iron chaperone and storage functions.

Stock solutions of ferrous ammonium sulfate (2–10 mm) were freshly prepared in water previously deaerated by purging with argon gas (<0.2 ppm O2). Calmodulin and albumin were desalted into the appropriate buffer using NAP-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The mature forms of yeast frataxin (mYfh1p and mYfh1p[C98A]) and yeast ferrochelatase were expressed in E. coli (24Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum.

Arosio (Brescia University, Brescia, Italy) and S. Levi (Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy). Protein concentration was determined from the absorbance and extinction coefficient (ϵ280 nm = 20,000/44,200/27,900/34,000 m–1 cm–1 for mYfh1p, bovine serum albumin, H- and L-chain apoferritin, respectively, and ϵ276 nm = 3,000 m–1 cm–1 for calmodulin). Iron concentration was either directly measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) at the Mayo Metals Laboratory or deduced from the concentration of Fe[BIPY]32+ (ϵ520 nm = 9,000 m–1 cm–1) (21Park S.

The drift of the electrode was ∼2 μm/60 min at 30 or 20 °C. Iron binding by mYfh1p and other proteins were measured by ultrafiltration with a molecular mass cutoff of 5 kDa (21Park S. Gakh O.

To analyze stepwise assembly of α48, independent samples containing identical concentrations of mYfh1p and Fe(II) were incubated at 30 °C for different periods of time. Each sample was rapidly cooled down to 4 °C to stop assembly, and analyzed by Superdex 200 or Sephacryl 300 gel filtration (22Gakh O. Adamec J. Gacy M.A. Twesten R.D. Owen W.G. Isaya G.

Tryptophan fluorescence intensity was measured in a Quanta Master fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Ontario, Canada) with a monochromator bandwidth of 2–4 nm and a pathlength of 4 mm. Excitation was at 294 nm, and tryptophan emission was quantitated from the area under the emission band integrated from 300 to 400 nm. Fe[BIPY]32 + and Ferrochelatase Assays—Fe(II) was added to purified mYfh1p monomer, H- or L-apoferritin, or calmodulin in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, and each sample (8 ml) was incubated at 30 °C. Two aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time points. BIPY was added to the first aliquot (500 μl) at a final concentration of 2 mm, and after 5 min of incubation at room temperature, the concentration of Fe[BIPY]32+ was determined (21Park S. Gakh O.

Ferrochelatase and deuteroporphyrin IX were added to the second aliquot (300 μl) at final concentrations of 2 and 118 μm, 2 and 200 μm, or 4 and 400 μm, respectively, and incubation was continued for an additional 20 min at 30 °C. The ferrochelatase reaction was stopped by adding 1 m NaOH and pyridine (176 μl each), and iron-deuteroporphyrin was measured by the pyridine hemochromogen method (29Porra R.J. Jones O.T.G. Biochem.

Competition assays were designed to test if transfer of Fe(II) from mYfh1p to ferrochelatase can occur in the presence of a Fe(II) chelator, as was done by others to study the transfer of copper from a metallochaperone to its target protein (31Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Unlike in the transfer equilibrium between a copper chaperone and its target protein, we measured the end product of the transfer reaction, i.e. heme. Thus, upstream and downstream steps that are also susceptible to iron chelation had to be considered in choosing an appropriate chelator. We have shown that mYfh1p assembles stepwise into an 840-kDa molecule sequestering up to 50–75 Fe(II) atoms per subunit; this iron is accessible to direct chelation until it is oxidized and incorporated into a stable ferrihydrite mineral (Refs. 22Gakh O. Adamec J. Gacy M.A. Twesten R.D. Owen W.G. Isaya G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6798-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 24Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar and this study). Yeast ferrochelatase is a homodimer of ∼80 kDa containing one Fe(II) substrate binding site and one protoporphyrin binding cleft per subunit; heme synthesis requires the insertion of the Fe(II) atom into the porphyrin ring (32Karlberg T. Lecerof D. Gora M. Silvegren G. Labbe-Bois R. Hansson M. Al-Karadaghi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13499-13506Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A second site in each ferrochelatase subunit is thought to be involved in the initial Fe(II) binding or enzyme regulation (32Karlberg T. Lecerof D. Gora M. Silvegren G. Labbe-Bois R. Hansson M. Al-Karadaghi S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13499-13506Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Citrate is a relatively weak Fe(II) chelator (Fe(II)-binding constant = 104m–1) (33Aslamkhan A.G. Aslamkhan A. Ahearn G.A. J. Exp. Zool. 2002; 292: 507-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) believed to represent one of the most abundant ligands to the “free” iron pool in vivo (Refs. 19Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 34Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16922-16927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and Refs. therein). In ferrochelatase assays performed under strictly anaerobic conditions, Fe(II) can be provided as a ferrous citrate salt (35Ferreira G.C. Shi Z. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, citrate should not be able to remove the Fe(II) ion from ferrochelatase after the transfer or to destabilize heme, as has been shown to occur with thiol reagents (36Porra R.J. Vitols K.S. Labbe R.F. Newton N.A. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, at the neutral pH and under the aerobic conditions used in our assays, citrate will promote rapid autoxidation of Fe(II) (37Minotti G. Aust S.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) such that any mYfh1p-bound Fe(II) mobilized by citrate will be rapidly oxidized and excluded from the reaction. Both citrate and a stronger chelator, EDTA (EDTA Fe(II)-binding constant = 1014m–1) (38Skoog D.A. West D.M. College S. Analytical Chemistry. Philadelphia, PA1980: 253Google Scholar), were used in competition assays. We used citrate/total iron ratios ranging from 0.06:1 to 166:1, and citrate/ferrochelatase ratios ranging from 1:1 to 2500:1, which encompass and exceed the ratios used in anaerobic ferrochelatase assays (citrate/Fe = 1:1; citrate/ferrochelatase = 28:1) (35Ferreira G.C. Shi Z. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). EDTA/total iron ratios ranged from 0.33:1 to 7:1 and EDTA/ferrochelatase ratios from 5:1 to 100:1. Stepwise Assembly of mYfh1p Is Coupled with Two Sequential Iron Oxidation Reactions—At Fe(II)/mYfh1p ratios ≤0.5, mYfh1p catalyzes Fe(II) oxidation with a stoichiometry of ∼2 Fe(II)/O2 and production of H2O2 (ferroxidase reaction) (21Park S. Gakh O. Mooney S.M. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38589-38595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A ∼50-kDa oligomer (α3) is responsible for this activity suggesting that three mYfh1p subunits may form one binuclear ferroxidation site (21Park S. Gakh O. Mooney S.M. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38589-38595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, we have analyzed the iron oxidation reaction of mYfh1p at concentrations of iron (40–75 Fe(II)/mYfh1p) that encompass the iron loading capacity of mYfh1p (50–75 Fe(III)/mYfh1p depending on the ionic environment) and result in stepwise assembly of α3 to yield iron-loaded α48 (22Gakh O. Adamec J. Gacy M.A. Twesten R.D. Owen W.G. Isaya G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6798-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows representative O2 consumption curves recorded when 100 μm Fe(II) was incubated in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, in the absence or presence of 2 μm mYfh1p (Fe(II)/mYfh1p = 50/1). In buffer without protein there was an initial lag phase due to the time required to generate sufficient hydrolyzed Fe(III) to initiate autoxidation of Fe(II) (39Yang X. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, black plot). The final Fe(II)/O2 stoichiometry was 3.7 ± 0.3 (n = 3) as expected for autoxidation (39Yang X. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of mYfh1p, the initial rate of O2 consumption was faster compared with buffer, consistent with ferroxidase activity, but became slower after the first 4 min (Fig. 1A, red plot). The final Fe(II)/O2 stoichiometry was 3.6 ± 0.3 (n = 3), indicating that ferroxidation was rapidly overcome by autoxidation. We were unable to detect any H2O2 released into the solution, which should be expected given the high Fe(II)/mYfh1p ratio used in these experiments (21Park S. Gakh O. Mooney S.M. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38589-38595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Zhao G. Bou-Abdallah F. Yang X. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1B, gel filtration was used to determine the speciation of mYfh1p during the iron oxidation reaction described above. Experimental conditions were similar to those employed for electrode oximetry in Fig. 1A except that both the protein and the iron concentrations were increased 2-fold to enable detection of mYfh1p by absorbance measurements. Such an increase is not expected to change the rate of α48 assembly to a significant degree (22Gakh O. Adamec J. Gacy M.A. Twesten R.D. Owen W.G. Isaya G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6798-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and therefore the gel filtration data (Fig. 1B) can be correlated with the two phases in the O2 consumption curve of mYfh1p (Fig. 1A). The initial faster phase (Fig. 1A, 0–4 min, red plot) was associated with the assembly of an oligomer of ∼50 kDa (Fig. 1B, 3 min), while the subsequent slower phase (Fig. 1A, 4–50 min, red plot) was associated with stepwise assembly of higher order oligomers (Fig. 1B, 6, 10, and 30 min), in agreement with the previously described progression, α → α3 → α6 → α12 → α24 → α48 (22Gakh O. Adamec J. Gacy M.A. Twesten R.D. Owen W.G. Isaya G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6798-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The A 280 of assembled mYfh1p species increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). At the end of the iron oxidation reaction, the A 280 of α48 was much higher than the A 280 of monomer analyzed in the absence of any added Fe(II) (Fig. 1B, peak α). These results are consistent with progressive oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) and formation of a ferrihydrite-like mineral (which, unlike Fe(II), absorbs at 280 nm) within the assembled protein (23Nichol H. Gakh O. O'Neill H.A. Pickering I.J. Isaya G. Graham N.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5971-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We showed previously that the mature form of Yfh1p is generated by cleavage of an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal between residues 51–52 (24Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 41Branda S.S. Cavadini P. Adamec J. Kalousek F. Taroni F. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22763-22769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This cleavage eliminates one cysteine residue at position 32. The mature form of the protein (amino acids 52–174), which is the form used in our experiments, contains one cysteine residue at position 98. Thus, an alternative explanation for the results in Fig. 1B could be that chelation of iron by cysteine residues from different mYfh1p subunits leads to formation of metal-thiolate aggregates (42Reese R.N. Mehra R.K. Tarbet E.B. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4186-4192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, others have reported that when yeast frataxin is treated with iodoacetamide to block any exposed cysteine residues and subsequently incubated with 20 equivalents of Fe(II), iron-dependent oligomerization is not affected (43Adinolfi S. Trifuoggi M. Politou A.S. Martin S. Pastore A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We obtained similar results using a mYfh1p variant in which cysteine 98 was replaced by an alanine residue (data not shown). We therefore conclude that mYfh1p assembly is driven by iron oxidation: A ferroxidase reaction catalyzed by mYfh1p is associated with the first assembly step (α → α3), followed by a slower autoxidation reaction associated with assembly of higher order oligomers to ultimately yield α48. The Ferrous Iron Sequestered by mYfh1p Is Bioavailable— The time required to complete the iron oxidation reaction of mYfh1p is in the order of hundreds of seconds (Fig. 1A), much longer than the iron oxidation reaction of ferritin, which is in the order of tens of seconds (Ref. 40Zhao G. Bou-Abdallah F. Yang X. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and data not shown). At the beginning of its reaction, however, mYfh1p rapidly sequesters up to 50–75 Fe(II)/subunit, which are then progressively oxidized within the assembled protein (Ref. 21Park S. Gakh O. Mooney S.M. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38589-38595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Gakh O. Adamec J. Gacy M.A. Twesten R.D. Owen W.G. Isaya G.

Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar and data presented below). Given that mobilization of iron from ferritin is inefficient in the absence of reducing agents (44Crichton R. Inorganic Biochemistry of Iron Metabolism. John Wiley & Sons, LTD, New York2001: 133-165Crossref Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the coupling of a slow iron autoxidation reaction with stepwise assembly might enable mYfh1p to serve as a temporary reservoir and a chaperone for Fe(II). We therefore measured iron mobilization during mYfh1p assembly by use of α,α′-bipyridine (BIPY), a chelator that preferentially binds Fe(II) (45Richards T.D. Pitts K.R. Watt G.D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1996; 61: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or purified yeast ferrochelatase, a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the insertion of Fe(II) into protoporphyrin IX to yield heme (reviewed in Ref. 46Ferreira G.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Iron mobilization from human H- or L-apoferritin (28Levi S. Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Corsi B. Tamborini E. Spada S. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was analyzed in parallel. These two proteins are pre-assembled 24-subunit shells with a negatively charged inner surface that promotes iron autoxidation and mineralization; in addition, H-apoferritin has 24 dinuclear ferroxidation sites (28Levi S. Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Corsi B. Tamborini E. Spada S. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 47Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As a negative control we used calmodulin, a calcium-binding protein with a molecular mass and an isoelectric point similar to those of mYfh1p (17 versus 14 kDa, and 4.09 versus 4.34). Reactions were started by addition of a fixed concentration of Fe(II) (30 μm) to buffer in the absence or presence of protein (0.4 μm; Fe(II)/subunit = 75:1 for all proteins tested). At successive time points, an aliquot was withdrawn and divided in two parts that were immediately incubated with either BIPY (2 mm) or ferrochelatase (2 μm) and deuteroporphyrin IX (118 μm). The half-life of BIPY-accessible iron estimated from a single exponential fitting was 21.5 min in the presence of mYfh1p compared with 1.0, 4.0, 6.7, and 8.8 min in the presence of H-apoferritin, L-apoferritin, buffer only, and calmodulin, respectively (Fig. 2A). Similarly, ferrous iron was more accessible to ferrochelatase in the presence of mYfh1p relative to buffer or calmodulin (Fig. 2B). BIPY can bind Fe(III) and/or reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) although with lower affinity compared with Fe(II) (48Schmid R. Kirchner K. Dickert F.L. Inorg. Chem. 1988; 27: 1530-1536Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 49Monsted O. Nord G. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 37: 2381-2397Google Scholar, 50Pehkonen S. Analyst. 1995; 120: 2655-2663Crossref Google Scholar), suggesting that the BIPY accessible iron mobilized from mYfh1p could represent a mixture of both ferrous and ferric iron. However, the concentrations of BIPY-accessible iron at successive time points in the presence of mYfh1p (Fig. 2A) were in the same order as the concentrations of ferrochelatase-accessible iron measured under similar conditions (Fig. 2B). We therefore conclude that the iron mobilized by direct chelation (i.e. BIPY accessible iron) during mYfh1p assembly is largely in ferrous form, becoming progressively less accessible as it is oxidized t"
https://openalex.org/W2062418948,"Sox8 is a member of the Sox family of developmental transcription factor genes and is closely related to Sox9, a key gene in the testis determination pathway in mammals. Like Sox9, Sox8 is expressed in the developing mouse testis around the time of sex determination, suggesting that it might play a role in regulating the expression of testis-specific genes. An early step in male sex differentiation is the expression of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in Sertoli cells. Expression of the Amh gene during sex differentiation requires the interaction of several transcription factors, including SF1, SOX9, GATA4, WT1, and DAX1. Here we show that SOX8 may also be involved in regulating the expression of Amh. Expression of Sox8 begins just prior to that of Amh at 12 days post coitum (dpc) in mouse testes and continues beyond 16 dpc in Sertoli cells. In vitro assays showed that SOX8 binds specifically to SOX binding sites within the Amh minimal promoter and, like SOX9, acts synergistically with SF1 through direct protein-protein interaction to enhance Amh expression, albeit at lower levels compared with SOX9. SOX8 and SOX9 appear to have arisen from a common ancestral gene and may have retained some common functions during sexual development. Our data provide the first evidence that SOX8 may partially compensate for the reduced SOX9 activity in campomelic dysplasia and substitute for Sox9 where Sox9 is either not expressed or expressed too late to be involved in sex determination or regulation of Amh expression.

Gonadal sex determination in eutherian mammals begins when the indifferent gonad responds to an unidentified signal resulting in the expression of Sry in males followed by the up-regulation of Sox9 expression in pre-Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells are the primary supporting cell type surrounding the germ cells and are required for further differentiation of the testes, including signaling to the steroidogenic Leydig cell lineage. One of the critical steps in male development is the regulation of expression of the anti-Müllerian hormone gene (Amh) in Sertoli cells. AMH 1The abbreviations used are: AMH, anti-Müllerian hormone; dpc, days post coitum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HISS, heat-inactivated sheep serum; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HMG, high mobility group. is responsible for the regression of the Müllerian duct in males and marks the start of the hormonal cascade required for male sexual differentiation. Deletion of the Amh gene results not in full sex reversal but pseudohermaphroditism in male mice (1Behringer R.R. Finegold M.J. Cate R.L. Cell. 1994; 79: 415-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), confirming its involvement in sex differentiation rather than sex determination. Expression of Amh results from the interplay of several factors on the 360-bp Amh minimal promoter, including SOX9, the Wilms tumor-associated protein WT1, the GATA-binding protein GATA4, the orphan nuclear receptor DAX1 (NR0B1 (2Tremblay A. Viger R. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)), and the steroidogenic orphan nuclear receptor SF1 (Ad4BP, NR5A1). SF1 is central to the expression of Amh and cooperatively interacts with WT1 (3Nachtigal M.W. Hirokawa Y. Enyeart-van Houten D.L. Flanagan J.N. Hammer G.D. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), GATA4 (4Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1388-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and the HMG domain of SOX9 (5de Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Südbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F. Berta P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6653-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). How or, indeed, whether all four factors interact together on the Amh promoter is still unknown. A number of SOX transcription factors have been shown to play important roles during sex determination and differentiation. For example, the Y-encoded testis-determining factor SRY is believed to be involved in directing the differentiation of the gonadal supporting cell lineage into Sertoli cells and thus acts as the sex determination switch in eutherian mammals (for review see Ref. 6Koopman P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 839-856PubMed Google Scholar). Complementary results have also implicated SOX9 as a male-specific sex determinant, with deletion or disruption of human SOX9 often resulting in XY sex reversal (7Foster J.W. Dominguez-Steglich M.A. Guioli S. Kwok C. Weller P.A. Weissenbach J. Mansour S. Young I.D. Goodfellow P.N. Brook J.D. Schafer A.J.

Chaboissier M.C. de Rooij D.G. Schedl A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 216-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Recently we showed that Sox8, a gene closely related to Sox9, is expressed in the developing brain, branchial arches, limbs, and kidneys and sex-specifically expressed in the testes (10Schepers G.E. Bullejos M. Hosking B.M. Koopman P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Structural comparison of SOX8 and SOX9 revealed considerable conservation, particularly within the HMG domain and the C-terminal trans-activation domain. We now report that Sox8 and Sox9 have overlapping expression patterns during testis development in mice and that both proteins bind specifically to the SOX binding site in the Amh promoter and interact with SF1 to synergistically enhance the expression of Amh. Thus we conclude that SOX8 may act redundantly with SOX9 to activate Amh expression during testis development. In Situ Hybridization—Whole-mount in situ hybridization was carried out essentially as described previously (11Hargrave M. Koopman P. Darby I.A. In Situ Hybridisation Protocols. 2nd. Ed. Vol. 123. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 279-289Google Scholar). Three Sox8 riboprobes corresponding to nucleotides 156–1447, 2746–2855, and 3595–4424 (GenBank™ accession number AF191325) were used together for Sox8 whole-mount in situ hybridization, to optimize the signal. The Oct4 riboprobe was generated from a plasmid kindly donated by Prof. Peter Rathjen and corresponds to nucleotides 594–1055 (GenBank™ NM_013633). Probes for Amh and Sox9 were synthesized as described previously (12Wright E. Hargrave M.R. Christiansen J. Cooper L. Kun J. Evans T. Gangadharan U. Greenfield A. Koopman P. Nat.

Fluorescent color development was performed in place of NBT/BCIP staining and was achieved using “Fast red” tablets (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Post in situ immunofluorescence involved washing the sections in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), followed by three washes in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 5 min each). The sections were blocked for 1 h in 1% heat-inactivated sheep serum (HISS) in PBS. Anti-SOX9 antibody (15Ng L.J. Wheatley S. Muscat G.E.O. Conway-Campbell J. Bowles J. Wright E. Bell D.M. Tam P.P.L.

Sections were washed three times in PBS, blocked for 5 min at room temperature in 1% HISS in PBS, and probed with anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature in 1% HISS, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Finally, sections were washed as before in PBS, mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS, and photographed. Cell Culture and Transfection Assays—Trans-activation domain analysis of GAL fusion constructs were performed as previously described (10Schepers G.E. Bullejos M. Hosking B.M. Koopman P.

Luciferase assays were performed essentially as previously described (10Schepers G.E. Bullejos M. Hosking B.M. Koopman P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with the following alteration: 80 μl of the 100-μl cell lysate was added to 100-μl Luciferase assay reagent (Roche Applied Science). The statistical analysis performed on transfection data include a two-way, paired analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis with a 95% confidence score. These analyses were performed using StatView 5.0.1 (SAS Institute Inc.). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSA analysis was performed using recombinant, bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins of full-length SF1, SOX2, SOX8, and truncated SOX9 (amino acids 1–440). Recombinant plasmids were constructed using the vector pGEX-KG (19Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) for SOX2, -8, and -9 and pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) for SF1. Wild-type and mutated Amh promoter fragments were cloned by PCR into the pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega) using MIS-wt, MIS-R1, MIS-R2, and MIS-R3 (20Arango N.A. Lovell-Badge R. Behringer R.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 409-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) as templates and the following primers: AMHpro-for (AAG CTT GAT ATC GAA TTC CTG) for amplifying R1, R2, and R3 fragments, AMHpro-for2 (AGT GGA TCC CCC GGG CTG) for amplifying the wild-type fragment, together with AMHpro-rev (GGA ATT CGC CCC CTA TCA ACA CCA AA). Fragments were cut out of the respective constructs with EcoRI and gel-purified. Oligonucleotide probes (S2) harboring two SOX2 binding sites had the following sequence: GGG ATC CCT TTG TGT CTG GCA ATG CAC AAT ATT G. Fragments as well as oligonucleotide probes were labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 30 μl in binding buffer (100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 4% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)/poly(dA-dT), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Reaction mixtures containing 100 ng of purified protein were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature followed by the addition of end-labeled probe. After 20-min incubation at room temperature, DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels (containing 2.5% glycerol) at 150 V for 2 h in 0.5× TBE buffer. GST Pull-down Assays—Fragments of SOX8 were generated using PCR and cloned into the pcDNA3.1+ expression vector. 35S-Labeled proteins were generated in vitro using the T7-TnT system (Promega). GST-SF1 fusion protein was purified from BL21 cells as described previously (21Hosking B. Wyeth J. Pennisi D. Wang S. Koopman P. Muscat G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 262: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and left attached to glutathione-agarose beads. Bound SF1 fusion protein was then incubated with different 35S-labeled proteins in NTEN buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed four times with NTEN, and bound proteins were eluted with 6× Laemmli buffer, boiled, analyzed on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel, and visualized by autoradiography. Sox8 Expression in Developing mouse Testes—We have previously shown expression of Sox8 in mouse fetal testes at 13.5-day post coitum (dpc) (10Schepers G.E. Bullejos M. Hosking B.M. Koopman P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To determine the timing of expression of Sox8 in the testis, we performed a detailed in situ hybridization analysis of gonads at different developmental stages spanning sex determination and differentiation (11.5–16 dpc). Sox8 transcripts were first detected in the center of the testis at 12 dpc (25 tail somites), before cord formation (Fig. 1A). The expression domain expanded to include the rostral and caudal poles by 12.5 dpc and continued in testis cords beyond 16 dpc, with the strongest expression observed around 13.5–15 dpc. Expression of Sox8 in the ovary was undetectable from 11 to 16 dpc (Fig. 1A). We next compared the expression of Sox8 with that of Sox9 and Amh, two key genes involved in testis development, to shed light on the potential regulatory relationships between these genes. At each stage studied, left and right genital ridges or testes from the same fetus were assessed in parallel for Sox8 and Sox9 expression. Sox8 and Amh expression was compared in other samples in a similar fashion (Fig. 1B). As a control, left and right gonads from the same fetus were assessed for differences in expression of each gene, and equal levels were observed in each case (data not shown). The up-regulation of Sox9 expression was first evident at 11.5 dpc (18 tail somites, Fig. 1B), with expression continuing in the testis cords at 13 dpc through to 16 dpc. Similar to Sox8, expression of Sox9 began in the center of the testis and expanded to both poles by 12 dpc, when the first transcripts of Sox8 were detected in the center of the testis. Thus, Sox9 expression precedes that of Sox8 during sex determination by some 12 h. Sox8 and Amh expression patterns showed considerable overlap, with Amh transcripts first detected at 12 dpc in a patch of cells that was spatially more restricted than that expressing Sox8. The expression of Amh began in the center of the testis and encompassed the poles within 24 h; between 12 and 12.5 dpc the expression domain of Sox8 was more extended than that of Amh (Fig. 1B), suggesting that expression of the former preceded that of the latter. These data, combined with the localization of transcripts of all three genes to the developing testis cords, are consistent with the regulation of Amh expression by Sox9 and Sox8 in vivo. Previous studies have established that Sox8 expression is associated with developing testis cords in mice (10Schepers G.E. Bullejos M. Hosking B.M. Koopman P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Shen W.-H. Moore C.C.D. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). To further test the hypothesis that Amh expression may be regulated by SOX8 in addition to SOX9, it was necessary to determine whether Sox8 is expressed in the Sertoli or germ cell component of the testis cords, because both Sox9 and Amh are known to be expressed in developing Sertoli cells (13Münsterberg A. Lovell-Badge R. Development. 1991; 113: 613-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kent J. Wheatley S.C. Andrews J.E. Sinclair A.H. Koopman P. Development. 1996; 122: 2813-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Morais da Silva S. Hacker A. Harley V. Goodfellow P. Swain A. Lovell-Badge R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). We performed in situ hybridization on serial sections of 15 dpc testes using probes for Sox8, Sox9, Amh, or the germ cell marker Oct4. Characteristic Sertoli cell expression was clearly evident for Amh, because it was distinct from the expression pattern of Oct4 (Fig. 2A). This analysis showed that Sox9 and Sox8 are also expressed in Sertoli cells (Fig. 2A). To confirm the expression of Sox8, Sox9, and Amh in the same cells, we performed double-labeling experiments, detecting Sox8 or Amh transcripts by in situ hybridization and SOX9 protein by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2B). All three genes were detected in the same cell type, as evident from the co-localization of signal observed in each case (Fig. 2B). Binding of SOX8 to Amh Promoter Sequences—Based on the overlapping expression of Sox8 and Amh in Sertoli cells, we wished to determine whether SOX8 was capable of binding the critical SOX binding site in the Amh promoter (20Arango N.A. Lovell-Badge R. Behringer R.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 409-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). We performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with wild-type and mutant Amh promoter fragments spanning both the established SOX and SF1 binding sites (Fig. 3A). As expected, SF1 bound to promoter fragments with a wild-type SF1 binding site but not to those with a mutant SF1 site or an oligonucleotide (S2) harboring SOX2 binding sites (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–5), and SOX9 bound to wild-type but not mutant SOX binding site fragments (Fig. 3B, lanes 11–14). In these experiments, SOX8 also bound specifically to probes containing the wild-type but not the mutated SOX site (Fig. 3B, lanes 6–9), thus demonstrating sequence-specific DNA binding of SOX8 within the Amh minimal promoter. In contrast, the unrelated SOX2 protein was not able to bind to any of the Amh promoter fragments (Fig. 3B, lanes 16–19). All three SOX proteins bound to the SOX2 binding site oligonucleotide S2 (Fig. 3B, lanes 10, 15, and 20). SOX8 DNA binding in vitro was consistently weaker than that shown by SOX9. Activation of the Amh Promoter by SOX8 and SF1—SOX9 has previously been shown to act synergistically with SF1 to activate transcription from the minimal Amh promoter in cultured cells (5de Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Südbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F. Berta P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6653-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Considering the temporal and spatial expression of Sox8, and the sequence-specific DNA binding to the Amh promoter, we tested directly whether SOX8 is able to stimulate Amh promoter activity. To investigate potential cooperative trans-activation between SF1 and SOX proteins, we performed co-transfection experiments similar to those described by de Santa Barbara and co-workers studying SOX9 and SF1 (5de Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Südbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F. Berta P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6653-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were transfected with an Amh promoter-reporter construct and co-transfected with expression constructs for SF1 and the SOX proteins SOX8, SOX9, or SOX2. In agreement with previous studies (5de Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Südbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F. Berta P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6653-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), SOX9 and SF1 synergistically activated transcription from the Amh promoter 4-fold above the levels observed with the reporter vector alone (Fig. 4A). SOX8 was also able to cooperatively activate transcription in the presence of SF1 (Fig. 4A). The synergistic activation of the Amh promoter by SF1 in combination with either SOX8 or SOX9 was found to be statistically significant with a confidence value of 0.05. In over a dozen independent experiments, the activation levels achieved by SOX8 and SF1 were consistently lower than those achieved by SOX9 and SF1, although the difference was not always statistically significant (Fig. 4 (A and B) and data not shown). The unrelated SOX protein SOX2 was found to have no effect on Amh expression in the presence or absence of SF1 (Fig. 4A). Finally, we also assessed whether SOX8 and SOX9 are able to act synergistically on the Amh promoter. The level of trans-activation achieved in the presence of SOX8, SOX9, and SF1 (around 5-fold, Fig. 4B) was similar to that observed for SOX9 and SF1 (difference not statistically significant). The small increase in trans-activation in the presence of all three factors shows that SOX8 and SOX9 do not act synergistically. Potency of the SOX8 Activation Domain—Activation of the Amh promoter in the presence of SOX8 and SF1 was consistently lower than that observed with SOX9 and SF1. To further investigate this observation, we compared directly the relative trans-activation domain potency of SOX8 and SOX9 (Fig. 4C). The entire coding regions C-terminal to the HMG domains of SOX8 and SOX9 were fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and used in trans-activation domain analyses, similar to those performed in earlier studies (10Schepers G.E. Bullejos M. Hosking B.M. Koopman P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Ng L.J. Wheatley S. Muscat G.E.O. Conway-Campbell J. Bowles J. Wright E. Bell D.M. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. Koopman P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 108-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). These regions contain a conserved trans-activation domain at the C terminus and a second non-conserved trans-activation region (10Schepers G.E. Bullejos M. Hosking B.M. Koopman P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24McDowall S. Argentaro A. Ranganathan S. Weller P. Mertin S. Mansour S. Tolmie J. Harley V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24023-24030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The C terminus of SOX9 consistently showed an 80-fold increase in trans-activation compared with GAL alone, whereas SOX8 enhanced expression ∼10-fold (Fig. 4C). Both fusion proteins were expressed at similar levels as detected by Western analysis (data not shown). These data suggest that SOX8 has a weaker C-terminal trans-activation domain than SOX9. SOX8 and SF1 Interact Directly via the HMG Domain— Target specificity of SOX proteins is thought to be mediated by direct interaction with cell type-specific partner proteins and cofactors (25Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 26Wilson M. Koopman P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To support the in vivo significance of the observed synergy between SOX8 and SF1, we next tested the ability of SOX8 and SF1 to interact directly. Radiolabeled full-length SOX8 and fragments representing the N terminus, HMG domain, and C terminus were produced and incubated with GST-SF1 fusion protein attached to glutathione-Sepharose resin. After several washes, only full-length SOX8 and the HMG domain fragment remained bound by GST-SF1 (Fig. 5). These data confirm that SOX8 can bind to SF1 in vitro and that this interaction is mediated by the HMG domain of SOX8. Interestingly, SOX2 was also found to bind SF1 (Fig. 5), as might be expected for an interaction mediated by the highly conserved HMG domain. This latter observation is unlikely to have any in vivo relevance, because SOX2 is not co-expressed with SF1 in Sertoli cells of the developing testis 2G. Schepers, M. Wilson, D. Wilhelm, and P. Koopman, unpublished observations. and does not activate transcription from the Amh promoter (Fig. 4A). Taken together, our observations suggest that SOX8 and SF1 can bind to adjacent sites on the Amh promoter and form a complex that is able to activate transcription from the Amh promoter in Sertoli cells. The involvement of SOX genes in sex determination and differentiation is well documented, with the founding member of the family, Sry, shown to be the critical sex determining gene on the mammalian Y chromosome (27Koopman P. Gubbay J. Vivian N. Goodfellow P. Lovell-Badge R. Nature. 1991; 351: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar), and heterozygous SOX9 mutations often resulting in XY sex reversal in humans (7Foster J.W. Dominguez-Steglich M.A. Guioli S.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1111-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). One of the early steps in sex differentiation is the up-regulation of Amh expression in Sertoli cells, which results in regression of the female-specific Müllerian duct and marks the onset of the male-specific hormonal pathway. All of the regulatory elements required for Amh expression during sexual differentiation are located within a relatively small, 180-bp promoter fragment (22Shen W.-H. Moore C.C.D. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), making this promoter particularly amenable to studying gene regulation. At least five factors are known to be involved in regulating Amh expression during sex differentiation. SF1 is believed to play a central role and has been shown to synergistically interact with SOX9 (5de Santa Barbara P. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Desclozeaux M. Moniot B. Südbeck P. Scherer G. Poulat F.

In this study we show that SOX8 is also able to synergize with SF1 to enhance expression of Amh. Sox8, Sox9, and Amh all show similar spatiotemporal expression patterns in developing mouse gonads, with expression beginning in the center of the genital ridge and spreading to the poles within 12 h. This is the first evidence that the expression of all three genes begins at, and expands from, the center of the developing testis, and is congruent with recent evidence that Sry expression also occurs as a wave beginning in the center of the testis and moving to the anterior and then posterior pole (28Bullejos M. Koopman P. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 221: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).

A dramatic up-regulation of MMP-13 by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β or by fibronectin fragments has been observed in chondrocytes. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) on the expression of MMP-13, which was induced by fibronectin fragment or IL-1β in human immortalized or human primary chondrocytes. IGF-1 and OP-1 each significantly reduced the basal level as well as fibronectin fragment- or IL-1β-stimulated transcription of the MMP-13 gene in a dose-dependent fashion with the corresponding decreases in the protein level of MMP-13. The most prominent suppressive effect was observed by the combination of IGF-1 and OP-1, which decreased the basal promoter activity by 60% and almost completely abrogated the fibronectin fragment-stimulated MMP-13 promoter activity. OP-1 was found to enhance mRNA levels of IGF-1 and the IGF-1 receptor, the latter of which appeared to be responsible for the combined effect of IGF-1 and OP-1. The suppressive effect of IGF-1 and OP-1 on MMP-13 expression was due in part to down-regulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activity of their intermediate molecules, including NF-κB and AP-1 factors. We propose that IGF-1 and OP-1 could be key physiological regulators of MMP-13 gene expression and that the combination of IGF-1 and OP-1 may be useful in controlling the excess catabolic activity in arthritis.

OP-1 blocks cartilage damage caused by Fn-f and may promote repair by enhancing proteoglycan and collagen synthesis (18Koepp H.E. Sampath K.T. Kuettner K.E. Homandberg G.A. Inflamm. Res. 1999; 48: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been demonstrated that OP-1 is expressed in human articular chondrocytes and in osteoarthritis cartilage (19Chubinskaya S. Merrihew C. Cs-Szabo G. Mollenhauer J. McCartney J. Rueger D.C. Kuettner K.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings imply potential involvement of endogenous OP-1 in cartilage repair mechanisms, either by enhancing matrix synthesis (18Koepp H.E. Sampath K.T. Kuettner K.E. Homandberg G.A. Inflamm. Res. 1999; 48: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or by repressing the pro-inflammatory expression of cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1β, as well as the chemokines IL-8 and monocyte chemotatic protein-1 (20Gould S.E. Day M. Jones S.S. Dorai H. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 51-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the effects of OP-1 in chondrocytes are mediated through type I serine/threonine kinase receptors (activin receptor-like kinase), ALK/BMPR-IB (21Haaijman A. Burger E.H. Goei S.W. Nelles L. Ten Dijke P. Huylebroeck D. Bronckers A.L. Growth Factors. 2000; 17: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Synergistic stimulation of cell differentiation and proliferation by insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and OP-1 has been demonstrated in rat osteoblastic cells (22Yeh L.-C.C. Adamo M.L. Olson M.S. Lee J.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4181-4190Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and in human primary chondrocytes. 2Loeser, R. F., Pacione, C. A., and Chubinskaya, S.

Physiol. 1998; 175: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have presented data indicating that IGF-1 gene expression may be up-regulated by OP-1 at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional level in osteoblastic cells. IGF-1 is a polypeptide that exerts anabolic/anticatabolic effects on cartilage. The overexpression of human IGF-1 promoted new tissue formation in an ex vivo model of articular chondrocyte transplantation (24Madry H. Zurakowski D. Trippel S.B. Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 1443-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The anabolic effects of IGF-1 appeared to be mediated by stimulating proteoglycan synthesis in articular chondrocytes (24Madry H. Zurakowski D. Trippel S.B. Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 1443-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Fortier L.A. Mohammed H.O. Lus G. Nixon A.J. J. Bone Joint Surg. Br. 2002; 84: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) or by down-regulating the transcriptional induction of MMP enzymes (e.g. MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-8, and MMP-13) and inflammatory cytokines (26Delany A.M. Rydziel S. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4665-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Hui W. Rowan A.D. Cawston T. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2001; 60: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, we assessed the inhibitory effects of IGF-1 and OP-1 on the basal as well as Fn-f- and IL-1β-induced expression of MMP-13. We demonstrated that the combination of IGF-1 and OP-1 was effective at inhibiting both the Fn-f- and IL-1β-stimulated MMP-13 gene expression and defined the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed inhibitory effects. Cell Culture—Human chondrocytes were isolated by enzymatic digestion of normal ankle articular cartilage obtained from tissue donors through the Gift of Hope Organ and Tissue Donor Network (formerly the Regional Organ Bank of Illinois) as previously described (6Forsyth C.B. Pulai J. Loeser R.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2368-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The immortalized human chondrocyte C-28I2 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Mary Goldring (New England Baptist Bone and Joint Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The primary and immortalized chondrocytes both were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen). Plasmid Construction and Transfection—A series of human MMP-13 promoter deletional DNA fragments, –1600MMP-13, –736MMP-13, –370MMP-13, and –186MMP-13, were subcloned into a firefly luciferase promoterless vector, pGL2-Enhancer (Promega) at the sites of SacI and BglII. The human MMP-1 promoter region (–562/+1) was subcloned into the same vector at the sites of XhoI and HindIII. For transfection, the cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with 2 μg of promoter-reporter constructs or 500 ng of cDNA expression vectors using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. The promoterless vector, pGL2-Enhancer was used as a control, and a Renilla luciferase construct was included as an internal control for transfection efficiency. After 24 h incubation, the cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and changed to serum-free condition for 20 –24 h followed by treatment with the 110-kDa Fn-f (1 μm) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), IL-1β (25 ng/ml) (R&D System, Minneapolis, MN), IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) (a gift from Chiron Cooperation, Emeryville, CA), or OP-1 (100 ng/ml) (provided by Stryker Biotech, Hopkinton, MA). Inhibition of IL-1β was performed using 100 ng/ml IL-1Ra (Anakinra; a gift from Amgen, Thousand Oakes, CA). A neutralizing antibody to human IGF-1 (100 μg/ml) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or IGF-1 receptor monoclonal antibody (100 μg/ml) (Oncogene, San Diego, CA) and IgG (100 μg/ml) for negative control (Sigma) were added directly to the medium. The cells were harvested after 24 h, and luciferase activity was assayed using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). All of the transfection experiments were repeated at least three times in duplicate. An IGF-1 receptor cDNA construct, CVNIGF-1R, and its dominant negative, hIGF-1RDN, were provided by Dr. R. Baserga (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The human IGF-1 promoter reporter construct, IGF-1Luc, was provided by Dr. Peter S. Rotwein (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). The constitutive active AP-1 factors, c-Jun and c-Fos cDNA constructs, LNCXc-Fos, and LNCXc-Jun were provided by Dr. Stephen Murphy (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). NF-κB dominant negative, pCMV-IkBαM, and cis-reporting systems of pNF-κB-Luc, pAP-1-Luc, were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). RNA and Genomic DNA Extraction—Total cellular RNA and genomic DNA were isolated using the RNeasy® Mini kit and DNeasy® Tissue kit (Qiagen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the samples were stored at –80 °C until analyzed. Reverse Transcription and Semi-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction—Reverse transcription (RT) was carried out with 2 μg of total cellular RNA using the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) for first strand cDNA synthesis in 50 μl of reaction volume. The sequences for the primers and the conditions for their use are summarized in Table I. For all experiments, the conditions were determined to be in the linear range for the PCR amplification as described previously (29Tsuzaki M. Guyton G. Garrett W. Archambault J.M. Herzog W. Almekinders L. Bynum D. Yang X. Banes A.J. J. Orthop. Res. 2003; 21: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Briefly, all of the samples were subjected to RT at the same time, and subsequently, all of the samples of cDNA were amplified by PCR at the same time to avoid any potential experiment to experiment variation in efficiency. Each RT sample was assessed for GAPDH cDNA. The levels of GAPDH mRNA did not vary with time after the addition of Fn-f, cytokine, or growth factors following 24 PCR cycles. Genomic DNA was included for the PCR to ensure that there was no genomic DNA contamination in the total RNA samples. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using 24 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58∼69 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s in the presence of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), 50 pmol of sense and antisense primers. PCR primers and annealing temperature used is shown in Table I. PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide and UV transillumination. Integrated density values for the genes in question were normalized to the GAPDH values to yield a semi-quantitative assessment.Table IPCR primers and annealing temperature usedGenePrimersaf, forward; r, reverse.Annealing temperatureRT-PCR product°CbpMMP-13f:GGC TCC GAG AAA TGC AGT CTT TCT T64337r:ATC AAA TGG GTA GAA GTC GCC ATG CIL-1βf:GAG CTC GCC AGT GAA ATG ATG GC58387r:CAA GCT TTT TTG CTG TGA GTC CCGIL-6f:GGA TGC TTC CAA TCT GGA TTC AAT GAG66302r:CGC AGA ATG AGA TGA GTT GTC ATG TCCIL-8f:CGT GGC TCT CTT GGC AGC CTT CCT GAT68270r:TCA AAA ACT TCT CCA CAA CCC TCT GCAIGF-If:CAC TGT CAC TGC TAA ATT CAG AGC AGA T66378r:AGC CCC TGT CTC CAC ACA CGA ACT GAA GIGF-1 receptorf:CGA GTA CTT GCT GCT GTT CCG AGT69583r:CAC AGC GCC AGC CCT CAA ACC TGTGAPDHf:GGT ATC GTG GAA GGA CTC AT60341r:ACC ACC TGG TGC TCA GTG TAa f, forward; r, reverse. Open table in a new tab MMP-13 Analysis by Western Blot—Conditioned media from control and treated chondrocytes were concentrated (10:1) using Centricon YM 10 filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and centrifugation. The soluble protein concentration was determined with BCA reagent (Pierce), and the samples containing equal amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transferring to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. The detection of MMP-13 was performed by using antibody to MMP-13 and ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). MMP-13 antibody L2916 was generously provided by Dr. Gillian Murphy (Norwich, UK). Characterization of Basal Promoter Activity of the 5′-Flanking Region of the Human MMP-13 Gene in Chondrocytes—The MMP-13 promoter contains multiple putative recognition sites for distinct classes of transcription factors. To evaluate the basal promoter activity of the MMP-13 gene, we prepared a series of 5′ deletion constructs of MMP-13 and a MMP-1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct (for the purpose of comparison) (Fig. 1). The 5′ promoter region deletion constructs of MMP-13 and –562MMP-1 were transiently transfected into immortalized human chondrocytes. The full-length of MMP-13 promoter construct, –1600MMP-13, showed the strongest basal promoter activity. The shortest promoter construct, –186MMP-13, containing the essential promoter region, such as TATA box, AP-1, Ets/PEA3, and Runx2 sites, demonstrated ∼60% of the basal promoter activity shown in –1600MMP-13. The –562MMP-1 promoter construct showed activity similar to that of –370MMP-13. These results suggested that not only the proximal core factors, such as AP-1 or Ets, but also the multiple putative recognition motifs for transcription factors present in the 5′-flanking region are necessary to exert the maximum basal promoter activity of the MMP-13 gene in chondrocytes. IGF-1 and OP-1 Down-regulate Chondrocyte-associated Basal MMP-13 Gene Expression—Transcriptional down-regulation of MMP-13 expression by IGF-1 has been previously reported in rat bone cell cultures (26Delany A.M. Rydziel S. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4665-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and in bovine nasal cartilage (27Hui W. Rowan A.D. Cawston T. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2001; 60: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the treatment of IGF-1, OP-1, or the combination of IGF-1 and OP-1 is capable of down-regulating the basal level of the MMP-13 expression in human articular chondrocytes. As shown in Fig. 2A, the full-length of MMP-13 promoter construct, –1600MMP-13, demonstrated the strongest response to IGF-1 or OP-1 with an ∼30% reduction in the promoter activity. Further deletions (–736, –370, and –186MMP-13) resulted in the gradual decrease of the inhibitory effect of IGF-1 and OP-1 by down-regulating the promoter activities approximately from 20% to 15% (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that not a single motif but multiple regulatory motifs within the MMP-13 promoter are responsible for the maximum inhibitory effect of IGF-1 and/or OP-1. The combination of IGF-1 and OP-1 further reduced the basal promoter activity of MMP-13 (60% reduction) compared with control. The inhibitory effects of IGF-1, OP-1, and especially the combination of the two growth factors on MMP-13 transcription were further confirmed by Western blot analysis using primary human chondrocytes (Fig. 2, B and C). The inhibitory effect of IGF-1 and OP-1 on MMP-13 promoter activity was concentration-dependent. The maximum inhibitory activity of IGF-1 or OP-1 was observed at the concentration of 100 ng/ml, whereas the treatment with more than 200 ng/ml of either IGF-1 or OP-1 alone showed no further dose-dependent inhibitory effect on MMP-13 expression (Fig. 2D). Individual treatment of IGF-1 or OP-1 at the concentration of 10 ng/ml showed no effect on the MMP-13 promoter activity. However, it was noted that when a fixed amount of IGF-1 or OP-1 (each 100 ng/ml) was preincubated, the concentration of 10 ng/ml of the other growth factor was able to further down-regulate MMP-13 promoter activity. These results suggest that one growth factor enhances the cellular sensitivity for the other growth factor. IGF-1 and OP-1 Inhibit IL-1β- and Fn-f-elicited MMP-13 Expression—Up-regulation of MMP-13 expression in response to Fn-f or IL-1β has been observed in chondrocytes. Therefore, we examined whether IGF-1 and OP-1 had suppressive effects on Fn-f- or IL-1β-stimulated MMP-13 expression by transient transfection assays. IGF-1 and OP-1 alone and in combination showed a stronger inhibitory effect on Fn-f-induced MMP-13 promoter activity (Fig. 3A) than the activity induced by IL-1β (Fig. 3B). The combination of IGF-1 and OP-1 almost completely inhibited Fn-f-stimulated activity and partially inhibited IL-1β-stimulated activity of MMP-13 promoter expression. Similar results were obtained in cells transfected with the –562MMP-1 promoter construct. Taken together, we conclude that IGF-1 and OP-1 exert a combinatory effect in the suppression of basal as well as Fn-f- or IL-1β-stimulated MMP-13 gene expression in human chondrocytes. The Combined Effect of IGF-1 and OP-1 on MMP-13 Expression Is Due to Enhancement of the IGF-1 Autocrine System by OP-1—Individual treatment with the increased amounts of either IGF-1 (2 μg) or OP-1 (2 μg) did not show any further inhibitory effect on the promoter activity of MMP-13 (Fig. 2D). In addition, the preincubated fixed amount (100 ng/ml) of IGF-1 or OP-1 allowed the cells to respond as to low a concentration as 10 ng/ml of IGF-1 or OP-1 by increasing the cellular sensitivity. Therefore, studies were initiated to understand the molecular mechanisms by which the combination of two growth factors, IGF-1 and OP-1, exerts the most prominent effect on the expression of MMP-13 gene in chondrocytes. The elevated mRNA levels of rat IGF-1 and IGF-1-binding proteins but not IGF-1 receptors by human OP-1 have been reported in rat osteoblast cells (23Yeh L.-C.C. Adamo M.L. Duan C. Lee J.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulated that IGF-1 and OP-1 may influence each other, stimulating the cellular autocrine system for either IGF-1 or OP-1. To study the influence of OP-1 on the expression of the IGF-1 gene, a human IGF-1 promoter construct containing a luciferase reporter gene was utilized. Transient transfection of the IGF-1 promoter-luciferase construct followed by the treatment with OP-1 increased the IGF-1 promoter activity ∼100% in immortalized chondrocytes and 60% in primary human chondrocytes above controls (Fig. 4A). The induction of IGF-1 expression by OP-1 was further supported by semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay. The addition of OP-1 increased the mRNA levels of not only IGF-1 but also the IGF-1 receptor in immortalized chondrocytes (Fig. 4B). Treatment with IGF-1 for 36 h, on the other hand, showed no significant effect on the mRNA or protein levels of OP-1 or OP-1 receptors including ActR-I, BMPR-1A, BMPR-1B, and BMPRII (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that OP-1 may stimulate the IGF-1 autocrine system at the level of transcription in human chondrocytes. To determine whether the stimulated autocrine system of IGF-1 caused the suppression of the MMP-13 gene, we tested the effect of a blocking monoclonal antibody to the IGF-1 receptor and an IGF-1 neutralizing antibody on the inhibitory activity of IGF-1. Treatment with nonspecific IgG (100 μg/ml) was included as a negative control. Indeed, the treatment with either the antibody to IGF-1 receptor or the IGF-1 neutralizing antibody completely abolished the IGF-1 effect on MMP-13 promoter activity (Fig. 5A). The treatment with control IgG did not alter the MMP-13 promoter activity. Next, we examined the effect of the same antibodies on the inhibitory activity of OP-1. Importantly, we found that the same antibodies also blocked the inhibitory activity of OP-1 on MMP-13 gene expression. Similar results were obtained by transient transfection studies performed by using human IGF-1 receptor dominant negative (hIGF-1RDN), which blocks IGF-1-induced cellular signaling pathway. The forced expression of the hIGF-1RDN almost completely abolished cellular responses to not only IGF-1 but also OP-1 (Fig. 5B). The empty vector that was used for negative control did not show any significant effect on the promoter activity. These results suggest that OP-1 was acting through stimulation of the IGF-1 system to down-regulate MMP-13 gene expression. However, it was worth noting that the antibodies to IGF-1, IGF-1 receptor, or the co-expression of hIGF-1RDN only partially abolished the combinatory effects of IGF-1 and OP-1 on MMP-13 expression (Fig. 5). The fact that increasing the amount of IGF-1 above 100 ng/ml had no further inhibitory effect on MMP-13 expression, along with the fact that OP-1 increases the IGF-1 receptor expression, suggested that the IGF-1 receptor could be a limiting factor in this system. If the cellular level of IGF-1 receptor is the limiting factor in the response to IGF-1, we may observe dose-dependent down-regulation of MMP-13 gene expression by forced expression of the IGF-1 receptor. Transient transfection experiments were performed to express human IGF-1 receptor (pCVNIGF-1R) followed by the treatment of increasing IGF-1 up to 2 μg/ml in chondrocytes. We observed an enhanced cellular response to IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) by the forced expression of IGF-1 receptor (Fig. 6A). Higher concentration of IGF-1 (2 μg/ml) with the forced expression of IGF-1 receptor did not show a further enhanced cellular response. No significant enhancement of the IGF-1 effect on MMP-13 promoter activity was observed when the OP-1 receptor (BMPR-1B) was expressed followed by the addition of IGF-1. On the other hand, the forced expression of either IGF-1 receptor or OP-1 receptor enhanced the inhibitory effect of OP-1 on MMP-13 promoter activity (Fig. 6B). Taken together, we concluded that OP-1-mediated up-regulation of IGF-1 and the IGF-1 receptor, thereby stimulating the IGF-1 autocrine system, was responsible in part for the combinatory effect of IGF-1 and OP-1 on MMP-13 expression in human chondrocytes. IGF-1 and OP-1 Mediate Repression of Inflammatory Cytokines in Human Chondrocytes—It has been reported that IGF-1 and OP-1 suppress inflammatory cytokine expression in primary human proximal tubule epithelial cells or in skin (20Gould S.E.

Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 1409-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The pro-inflammatory cytokines are also strong inducers for MMPs (31Mengshol J.A. Vincenti M.P. Brinckerhoff C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4361-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 32Liacini A. Sylvester J. Li W.Q. Zafarullah M.

Therefore, we postulated that the potent inhibitory effects of IGF-1 and OP-1 on MMP-13 expression may in part result from the suppression of inflammatory cytokine expression and/or interference with the inflammatory cytokine-associated intermediate gene product signaling pathways in human chondrocytes. IL-1β or Fn-f stimulation significantly increased the mRNA level of MMP-13 as well as inflammatory cytokines in immortalized chondrocytes (Fig. 7A). These included IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. Upon the addition of the combination of IGF-1 and OP-1, we observed decreased expression of endogenous inflammatory cytokines that were induced by Fn-f or IL-1β (Fig. 7, B and C). Several studies have demonstrated that the inhibition of inflammatory cytokinestimulated AP-1 and NF-κB transcription factors down-regulates MMP-13 gene expression in chondrosarcoma cells or human chondrocytes (32Liacini A. Sylvester J. Li W.Q. Zafarullah M. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 33Bondeson J. Brennan F. Foxwell B. Feldmann M. J.

An automated procedure was used to compare the structure of BioH with structural templates from a variety of different enzyme active sites. This screen identified a catalytic triad (Ser82, His235, and Asp207) with a configuration similar to that of the catalytic triad of hydrolases. Analysis of BioH with a panel of hydrolase assays revealed a carboxylesterase activity with a preference for short acyl chain substrates.

The combined use of structural bioinformatics with experimental screens for detecting enzyme activity could greatly enhance the rate at which function is determined from structure. The protein complement of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes remains largely uncharacterized. At least 30% of all proteins have no known biochemical function, and a larger percentage have sequence similarity to proteins of known biochemical activity (e.g. most predicted protein kinases) but for which the physiological role is unknown. The challenge in the post-genomic era is to define both the biochemical and physiological functions of all proteins as rapidly as possible.Structural proteomics, the large scale determination of protein structure, is expected to provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms by which a protein sequence adopts a defined three-dimensional structure. Most of the organized efforts in structural proteomics (Ref. 1Stevens R.C. Yokoyama S. Wilson I.A. Science. 2001; 294: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar; rcsb.org/pdb/strucgen.html) specifically target protein sequences for which there is no known structural homologue in the public data bases at a level of 30% sequence identity. One aim of this effort is to more fully define the universe of protein folds. Importantly, because protein structure is often conserved in the absence of detectable sequence homology, the comparison of new protein structures with those of known proteins will likely provide clues to biochemical function.The discovery of biochemical function from a new protein structure begins with automated searches for structural homologues of known function. The results of these comparisons are provided as lists with significance scores. The methods of comparison are now used routinely in the structural community and have proved invaluable for detecting structural conservation and for providing the basis for hypotheses (2Zarembinski T.I. Hung L.W. Mueller-Dieckmann H.J. Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim R. Kim S.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 95: 15189-15193Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, the interpretation of the results from structural comparisons often consumes a significant amount of time and is influenced by the extent to which the investigator is able to scour the literature.In an effort to improve the process by which function is derived from structure, we have combined two methods to facilitate functional studies. First, we have employed a data base of structural templates derived from the active sites of 189 different classes of enzymes. 1C. Porter, manuscript in preparation.1C. Porter, manuscript in preparation. This exploits the fact that the chemistry of the reaction restricts the types and the topological arrangement of the catalytic amino acids and hence results in strong conservation of their spatial arrangement, even where the protein folds are very different (3Wallace A.C. Borkakoti N. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2308-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). By focusing on the catalytic moieties, functional similarities can be detected in cases where there is no similarity in sequence, fold, or secondary structure. Second, we have created and used a panel of generic biochemical assays to test the functional hypotheses raised by the structural comparisons. These assays are based on simple, often nonphysiological, substrates; the experiment is designed to reveal the chemistry of the active site and not the cellular substrate.Here we present the results of the combined structural, bioinformatic, and enzymatic analysis of Escherichia coli BioH, a target within the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics (www.mcsg.anl.gov). By comparing the crystal structure of BioH with other known enzymes, we found that BioH is a member of the protein hydrolase superfamily and contains a classical Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad. A screen with different hydrolase substrates revealed that BioH has significant carboxylesterase activity, with a preference for short acyl chain substrates, and weak thioesterase activity. The strategy used for BioH might facilitate analysis of novel, uncharacterized proteins and structures arising form structural proteomics projects.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBioH Expression and Purification—The open reading frame of bioH was amplified by PCR from E. coli DH5α genomic DNA. The gene was cloned as previously described (4Zhang R.-G. Skarina T. Kats J.E. Beasley S. Khachatryan A. Vyas S. Arrowsmith C.H. Clarke S. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. Structure. 2001; 9: 1095-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) into the NdeI and BamHI sites of a modified form of pET15b (Novagen) in which a TEV protease cleavage site replaced the thrombin cleavage site and a double stop codon was introduced downstream from the BamHI site. The fusion protein was overexpressed and purified using nickel affinity chromatography as previously described (4Zhang R.-G. Skarina T. Kats J.E. Beasley S. Khachatryan A. Vyas S. Arrowsmith C.H. Clarke S. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. Structure. 2001; 9: 1095-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).For the preparation of the selenomethionine enriched protein, BioH was expressed in the E. coli methionine auxotroph strain B834 (DE3) (Novagen) in supplemented M9 medium. The sample was prepared under the same conditions as the native protein except for the addition of 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol to the purification buffers.Crystallization—BioH was crystallized by vapor diffusion in hanging drops (ratio of 2 μl of protein to 2 μl of precipitant) equilibrated against reservoir containing 1.2 m sodium citrate trihydrate and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). X-ray quality crystals grow at 21 °C in 2–5 days. For diffraction studies, the crystals were stabilized with the crystallization buffer supplemented with 15% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.Mass Spectrometry—All of the mass spectrometry data were acquired and analyzed using Masslynx 3.5 (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) 2The abbreviations used are: ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; pNP, p-nitrophenyl. was performed on a Micromass Q-Tof2 mass spectrometer. Positive ion mode ESI-MS of the whole protein was achieved in 50:50 acetonitrile:water with 0.1% formic acid. Exact mass MS was performed in negative ion mode regular ESI-MS using 10% aqueous methanol containing 1% ammonia as a carrier solvent. Tryptic digestions were performed overnight in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.8) or in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 6.4) for 1.5 h followed by MALDI-MS analysis. MALDI-MS was performed on a Micromass MALDI-R mass spectrometer (Micromass) using an m/z range of 500–4000. ESI-MS and MS/MS analysis of the low pH tryptic digest were performed on a Micromass Q-Tof2 mass spectrometer using nano-LC with a C18 column (0.3 × 5 mm; LC Packings). Data-dependent acquisition parameters were set to select the doubly and triply charged unmodified and modified precursor ions corresponding to residues 78–100 of the protein. MS-MS spectra were processed by base-line subtraction and deconvoluted using the Max-Ent3 module of MassLynx 3.5. The peptide sequences were determined semi-automatically from the resulting singly charged, deisotoped spectra using PepSeq, version 3.3 supplied with MassLynx 3.5.Enzyme Assays—Rapid screening for enzyme activities were performed using the following procedures: (a) fatty acid esterase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 37 °C using p-nitrophenyl (pNP) acetate or pNP esters of other fatty acids (C3–C18) as substrates (5Vorderwülbecke T. Kieslich K. Erdmann H. Enzyme Micriob. Technol. 1992; 14: 631-639Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar), (b) thioesterase activity was measured spectrophotometrically using CoA thioesters of fatty acids (acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and palmitoyl-CoA) as described earlier (6Berge R.K. Farstad M. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), (c) lipase activity (with sonicated olive oil as substrate) was measured spectrophotometrically by the copper soap assay after extraction of released free fatty acids with chloroform: heptane:methanol mixture (7Nixon M. Chan S.H.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 97: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), (d) protease activity was measured using l-leucine p-nitroanilide (aminopeptidase activity) or Nα-benzoyl-l-arginine p-nitroanilide (trypsin-like endopeptidase activity) as described (8Bienvenue D.L.

Biochem. 1999; 268: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), (e) phosphatase activity was determined spectrophotometrically using 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 50 mm HEPES-K (pH 7.5) buffer at 37 °C (10Kuo M.-H. Blumenthal H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 54: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and (f) bromoperoxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically with phenol red or monochlorodimedon as described previously (11Pelletier I. Altenbuchner J. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Crystallographic Data Collection—A two-wavelength multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment was carried out on the 19ID line of the Structural Biology Center at Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL). All of the crystallographic data were collected at 110 K on one crystal containing selenomethionine-substituted protein. The crystal belongs to the tetragonal space group P43 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 75.2 Å, c = 49.3 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. The multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set was colleted using inverse beam strategy at the selenium absorption peak energy (0.97947 Å) and at a remote wavelength (0.95373 Å). The absorption edge was determined from the x-ray fluorescence spectrum and the f′ and f″ plots versus energy obtained with the program CHOOCH (12Evans G. Pettifer R.F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 82-86Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar). High resolution data were collected from the unexposed part of the same crystal, which had been stored in liquid nitrogen. All of the data were measured with the CCD detector (13Westbrook E.M. Naday I. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 244-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) 210 × 210-mm2 sensitive area and fast duty cycle. Control of the experiment, data collection and visualization was done with d*TREK (14Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar), and all of the data were integrated and scaled with the program package HKL2000 (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Experimental phases were extended from 2.5 to 2.0 Å resolution with density modification, using data collected at the f″ peak wavelength. With these improved phases, the initial model was built with the program ARP/wARP (17Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). The high quality of the phases allowed 94% of the main chain to be built automatically and most of the side chains to be placed with a confidence level of 79%. The remainder of the model was built, and all of the side chains were corrected manually using the program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). This model was then refined against the 1.7 Å resolution data with several macro cycles of CNS, including simulated annealing, B-factor, and positional refinements. After each macro cycle, the model was inspected, and corrections and/or additions were made manually, with the programs O and QUANTA (Accelrys, Inc.). All subsequent refinement was carried out with REFMAC (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The last two residues of the model, Gly257 and Ser258, were appended to the protein as a result of the cloning strategy. The first two residues of the native sequence, Met1 and Asn2, were not included because of the absence of the corresponding electron density. Two molecules of ethylene glycol from the cryoprotectant were bound to the protein molecule mostly because of hydrophobic interactions. Residue 100 was unambiguously identified as Arg, instead of Gln, in electron density maps and is likely a PCR-induced mutation. The side chains of residues Glu116, Lys121, Asp123, Phe136, Glu152, and Lys213 have incomplete electron density.BioH is a two-domain protein (Fig. 1A). The α/β/α three layer sandwich of the large domain (residues 5–109 and 188–256; see below) consists of a twisted β-sheet formed by seven mostly parallel strands β1↓ (residues 5–9), β3↑ (residues 14–19), β2↑ (residues 41–46), β4↑ (residues 76–81), β5↑ (residues 101–105), β6↑ (residues 198–203) and β7↑ (residues 225–230) and flanked on both sides by five α-helices α1 (residues 31–39), α2 (residues 60–70), α3 (residues 83–94), α8 (residues 215–222), and α9 (residues 237–252). Ile32 and Pro242 introduce ∼90° kinks into the first and last helices, respectively. This domain resembles the Rossman fold, which is commonly found in enzymes.A small auxiliary domain is formed by the C-terminal segment of the polypeptide chain (Cys110–Asp187) and is inserted into the catalytic domain. The auxiliary domain contains four α-helices, residues 122–134 (α4), 136–145 (α5), 155–166 (α6), and 173–185 (α7), that create a bundle of two V-shaped bends (Fig. 1B). The two domains are connected by a hinge region near Cys110 and Asp187. The interface between domains is stabilized by multiple hydrophobic interactions including helices α6 and α7 that run across the surface of catalytic domain and intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl of Pro109 and the nitrogen of Leu188 and two hydrogen bonds between Asp187 and Arg189.Automated Structural Bioinformatics Reveals a Ser-His-Asp Catalytic Triad—One of the aims of structural proteomics is to perform more comprehensive automated analysis of protein structures to reduce the level of time-intensive human intervention. To screen new structures for potential catalytic function, we have created a data base of ∼189 three-dimensional enzyme active site structural templates. 1C. Porter, manuscript in preparation. The BioH structure was scanned against this data base of using the TESS program (3Wallace A.C. Borkakoti N. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2308-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This automated search gave a close match of BioH to the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad of lipases (21Schrag J.D. Li Y. Cygler M. Lang D. Burgdorf T. Hecht H.J. Schmid R. Schomburg D. Rydel T.J. Oliver J.D. Strickland L.C. Dunaway C.M. Larson S.B. Day J. McPherson A. Structure. 1997; 5: 187-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) (EC 3.1.1.3). The BioH residues involved (Ser82, His235, and Asp207) matched the template with a root mean square deviation of 0.28 Å for the overlaid side chains (Fig. 2). This is well within the cut-off of 1.2 Å used for discriminating true from false matches for this template. The presence of the catalytic triad suggested that BioH might possess lipase, protease, or esterase activity. Furthermore, the serine nucleophile (Ser82) is located within one of the two earlier identified Gly-Xaa-Ser-Xaa-Gly motifs (22Lemoine Y. Wach A. Jeltsch J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which is typical for acyltransferases and thioesterases.Fig. 2Superposition of the Ser82, His235, and Asp207 residues onto the catalytic triad template. The template side chains are depicted by the thicker, transparent bonds, whereas the BioH residues are represented by the thinner, solid bonds and include the main chain atoms. The root mean square deviation between equivalent atoms in the template and matched side chains is 0.28 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The structure of BioH was also compared with all other known structures using conventional methods such as the DALI algorithm (23Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The results from the DALI search revealed structural homology to a large number of proteins with a broad range of enzymatic functions. The closest matches with strong structural similarities include a bromoperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.10; Z score, 22.6; Protein Data Bank code 1brt), an aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.5; Z score, 21.1; Protein Data Bank code 1qtr), two epoxide hydrolases (EC 3.3.2.3; Z scores, 20.5 and 18.2; Protein Data Bank codes 1ehy and 1cr6, respectively), two haloalkane dehalogenases (EC 3.8.1.5; Z scores, 20.2 and 16.2; Protein Data Bank codes 1bn6 and 1b6g, respectively), and a lyase (EC 4.2.1.39; Z score, 17.2; Protein Data Bank code qj4). A comparison of BioH with a chloroperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.10) is shown in Fig. 3. The sequence identities between BioH and these proteins range from 15 to 25% and therefore do not suggest a specific catalytic function for BioH. Further manual analysis of these enzymes and literature review would have revealed to the expert that each contains a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad in their active sites.Fig. 3Superposition of the E. coli BioH (magenta) and Streptromyces aureofaciens chloroperoxidase (yellow) structures; superposition of the catalytic domains, including the loops connecting secondary structure elements. The overall architecture of the auxiliary domains is the same for both proteins, although the placement of the helices, especially of α5 and α6, relative to the catalytic domain differs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ser82 Is Covalently Modified by a Hydrolase Inhibitor—The structural informatics provided initial evidence for the location of the BioH catalytic site. The experimental density maps also showed an unusual feature that extended from the side chain of Ser82 (Fig. 4). The shape of the density and its environment, insinuated that the corresponding compound was covalently attached to the Oγ atom of Ser82 and formed hydrogen bonds with the backbone nitrogens of Trp22 and Leu83. To investigate the properties of the Ser82 modification, we analyzed the full length and trypsinized BioH with mass spectroscopy. Under denaturing conditions, two major peaks were observed with molecular masses of 29,152 Da (corresponding to the full-length protein) and 29,306 Da with similar intensity. Treatment of the protein with mild base caused the peak at 29,306 Da to disappear over time and the peak at 29,152 Da to increase in relative intensity. In addition, a new peak was detected with mass of 172 Da, interpreted as singly hydrated 154-Da molecule (see below). We also examined the mass of the tryptic fragment of BioH that contains Ser82. When the tryptic digestion was done under slightly acidic conditions and examined by both MALDI and ESI-MS, only the Ser82-containing fragment showed a 154-Da adduct. Therefore the catalytic potential of Ser82 seems responsible for observed additional mass attached to Ser82.Fig. 4Experimental electron density maps after density modification. Residues of the catalytic triad, Ser82, Asp207, and His235 of the refined model are labeled along with Trp22, Leu83, and several solvent molecules (labeled with numbers only). Note the additional electron density extending from the Oγ atom of Ser82. According to biochemical data, this density was interpreted as PMSF, but only parts of it are visible because of disorder and partial occupancy. Several functionally important hydrogen bonds, including those between the sulfonate oxygen of the inhibitor and backbone nitrogens of Trp22 and Leu83 (oxyanion hole) are shown with magenta dashed lines and numbers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For crystallographic experiments and initial MALDI and ESI-MS, the BioH protein was purified in the presence of protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), which is known to react with the catalytic serine in hydrolases (24Gold A.M. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and form a stable covalent adduct. Therefore it appears that BioH was modified during purification The protein purified in the absence of PMSF did not reveal this modification. These results strongly suggest that the modification corresponds to the addition of PMSF (expected Δm = 154) at Ser82 and that the serine possesses nucleophilic properties.BioH Is a New Carboxylesterase in E. coli—BioH purified in the absence of PMSF was subjected to several enzymatic assays that focused on hydrolase function including carboxylesterase, lipase, thioesterase, phosphatase, endopeptidase, aminopeptidase, and bromoperoxidase. BioH demonstrated significant carboxylesterase activity (Table III) (EC 3.1.1.1) and hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids. The enzyme showed rather narrow pH optimum (8.0–8.5) and broad substrate specificity with a preference for short chain substrates (Fig. 5). The kinetic parameters of BioH were determined for several substrates (Table III). These results demonstrate that although BioH was most active with pNP-acetate, the K m for all C-2–C-6 substrates was essentially the same. In agreement with the results of the mass spectrometry and crystallography, BioH was strongly inhibited by PMSF (10.5% of residual activity after 10 min of incubation with 2 mm PMSF). Purified BioH showed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and linear double reciprocal plots were obtained for all of the pNP substrates tested (data not shown).Table IIISteady state kinetic parameters for E. coli BioH carboxylesterase activity with various substratesSubstrateK mkcatk cat/K mmMs -1M -1 s -1pNP-acetate (C2)0.29±0.0418.5±1.763.8×103pNP-propionate (C3)0.35±0.0813.1±1.237.4×103pNP-butyrate (C4)0.33±0.066.1±0.718.5×103pNP-caproate (C6)0.25±0.024.0±0.116.0×103pNP-laurate (C12)0.60±0.131.5±0.22.5×103 Open table in a new tab Fig. 5Carboxylesterase activity of BioH on p-nitrophenyl esters with various acyl chain lengths.

Leptin receptors were shown to exist as dimers, but the role of dimerization in receptor activation remains unknown. Using a quantitative Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer approach, we show here in living cells that ∼60% of the leptin receptor exists as constitutive dimers at physiological expression levels in the absence of leptin. No further increase in leptin receptor dimerization was detected in the presence of leptin. Importantly, in cells expressing the short leptin receptor isoform, leptin promoted a robust enhancement of energy transfer signals that reflect specific conformational changes of pre-existing leptin receptor dimers and that may be used as read-out in screening assays for leptin receptor ligands. Both leptin receptor dimerization and the leptin-induced energy transfer were Janus kinase 2-independent. Taken together, our data support a receptor activation model based on ligand-induced conformational changes rather than ligand-induced dimerization.

Leptin is a 16-kDa protein primarily secreted by adipose tissues that targets a receptor (OB-R) belonging to the cytokine receptor family. Five membrane-bound isoforms of this receptor have been identified that derive from a single gene by alternative splicing. These isoforms, which share identical extracellular and transmembrane domains, are characterized by intracellular domains of variable length (1Tartaglia L.A. Dembski M. Weng X. Deng N. Culpepper J. Devos R. Richards G.J. Campfield L.A. Clark F.T. Deeds J. et al.Cell. 1995; 83: 1263-1271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3197) Google Scholar). A soluble form of OB-R was also identified that may arise from RNA splicing or ectodomain shedding of a membrane-spanning OB-R isoform (2Ge H. Huang L. Pourbahrami T. Li C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45898-45903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The short OB-R isoform (OB-Rs), which is believed to be involved in leptin transport across the blood-brain barrier, is the most abundantly expressed isoform. The long OB-R isoform (OB-Rl) is only expressed in some tissues such as the hypothalamus and is believed to mediate most biological effects of leptin (3Sweeney G. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Leptin and its receptor have received particular attention because of their involvement in the regulation of energy balance, metabolism, and neuroendocrine responses to food intake. Recently, leptin has also been shown to be involved in additional important functions such as bone mass regulation (4Ducy P. Amling M. Takeda S. Priemel M. Schilling A.F. Beil F.T. Shen J. Vinson C.

The reasons for this resistance are still poorly understood, but several potential mechanisms have been suggested. These include impaired leptin transport across the blood-brain barrier, defects in OB-R activation, or OB-R-associated signaling and up-regulation of negative feedback regulators such as the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (12Bjorbaek C.

Deciphering the phenomenon of leptin resistance requires a more detailed characterization of the mechanisms involved in OB-R activation. OB-R is constitutively associated with the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). 1The abbreviations used are: JAK2, Janus kinase 2; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; YFP, yellow variant of the green fluorescent protein; Luc, Renilla luciferase; Epo, erythropoietin.1The abbreviations used are: JAK2, Janus kinase 2; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; YFP, yellow variant of the green fluorescent protein; Luc, Renilla luciferase; Epo, erythropoietin. JAK2 binding to the receptor is critical for OB-R signaling and has been proposed to be involved in the stabilization of receptor dimers (15Devos R. Guisez Y. Van der Heyden J. White D.W. Kalai M. Fountoulakis M. Plaetinck G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18304-18310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16White D.W. Tartaglia L.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Agonist activation is believed to induce a conformational change in the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic tail of OB-R. JAK2, which is constitutively bound to the box 1 motif within this region (see Fig. 1), is activated by autophosphorylation and phosphorylates in turn OB-Rl but not OB-Rs. Phosphorylated OB-Rl then provides a docking site for STAT proteins, which bind to the receptor and are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Activated STAT proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to stimulate gene transcription via STAT-responsive elements (17Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6093-6096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). The oligomerization state of membrane receptors was suggested to be correlated with their activation state (18Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 19Schlessinger J. Cell. 2002; 110: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Several observations indicate that the OB-R may indeed exist as dimer. Western blot analysis of OB-R cross-linked to leptin revealed bands with apparent molecular weights corresponding to monomeric, dimeric, and higher oligomeric states of the receptor (15Devos R. Guisez Y. Van der Heyden J. White D.W. Kalai M. Fountoulakis M. Plaetinck G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18304-18310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16White D.W. Tartaglia L.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments also suggested that both OB-Rl and OB-Rs may form dimers (15Devos R.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the co-expression of wild-type OB-Rl with a constitutively active mutant resulted in the inhibition of the activity of the mutant receptor, and it was suggested that this phenomenon involves dimer formation (22White D.W. Kuropatwinski K.K. Devos R. Baumann H. Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4065-4071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Finally, the soluble extracellular domain of OB-R was shown to bind leptin in a 2:2 ratio (15Devos R. Guisez Y. Van der Heyden J. White D.W. Kalai M. Fountoulakis M. Plaetinck G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18304-18310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16White D.W. Tartaglia L.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations support the idea that OB-R can form dimers. However, OB-R dimerization was not shown in living cells. In addition, the proportion of receptors engaged in dimeric complexes and the relationship between ligand-induced receptor activation and dimerization are still open questions. Here, we used a quantitative bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based approach to study the dimerization and activation of OB-R isoforms. The noninvasive BRET assay, which was developed recently to detect protein-protein interactions in living cells (23Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), was used successfully to study the oligomerization state of membrane receptors (24Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) and to monitor ligand-induced conformational changes (25Boute N. Pernet K. Issad T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 640-645PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ayoub M.A. Couturier C. Lucas-Meunier E. Angers S. Fossier P. Bouvier M. Jockers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We show here that OB-R exist as preformed dimers in living cells and that leptin binding does not change the proportion of dimers but promoted the enhancement of BRET signals that reflect receptor conformational changes and that may be used as read-out in screening assays for OB-R ligands. Plasmid Constructions, Transfections, and Cell Culture—OB-R-YFP and OB-R-Luc fusion proteins were constructed by ligating the yellow variant of the green fluorescent protein (YFP) and the Renilla luciferase (Luc) moieties at the C-terminal end of the receptors. The coding region of YFP was obtained from the Cytogem®-Topaze (pGFPtpz-N1) vector (Packard, Meriden, CT) and was inserted in the EcoRV site of a pcDNA3/CMV vector (Invitrogen) containing a modified polylinker. The coding region of Renilla luciferase was obtained from the pRL-CMV vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and inserted in the EcoRV site of the modified pcDNA3 vector. Coding regions of OB-Rl and OB-Rs (gift of Dr. Gainsford, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia) were inserted in the two vectors described above in the EcoRI/BamHI cloning sites and in the NheI cloning site, respectively. Stop codons were then deleted by site-directed mutagenesis, and the phase of the fusion protein was adjusted at the same time. The OB-Rs–SNS mutants (OB-Rs-SNS, OB-Rs–SNS-Luc, and OB-Rs–SNS-YFP) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the PNP motif in box 1 of the corresponding wild-type constructs. All of the constructs were verified by sequencing. HEK 293, COS-7, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm glutamine (all from Invitrogen). PAZ6 preadipocytes were grown as described (45Jockers R. Issad T. Zilberfarb V. de Coppet P. Marullo S. Strosberg A.D. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2676-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using the transfection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence Microscopy—COS-7 cells transfected with either OBRs–YFP or OB-Rl–YFP expression plasmids were grown on 35-mm glass-bottomed microwell dishes (Plastek Cultureware, MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). One day after transfection living COS-7 cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy using fluorescein isothiocyanate filter settings. Membrane Preparation and Solubilization—Membranes were prepared as described (26Ayoub M.A. Couturier C. Lucas-Meunier E. Angers S. Fossier P. Bouvier M. Jockers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21522-21528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), resuspended in 75 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 12.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA and immediately used for BRET experiments. In some experiments, the receptors were solubilized with 0.15% digitonin for 2 h at 4 °C, the lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 48,000 × g, and the supernatant was used for BRET experiments. Detection of Leptin-induced JAK2 Autophosphorylation—HeLa cells co-expressing HA2-JAK2 (gift of Dr. Wojchowski, Pennsylvania State University) and the indicated OB-R constructs were preincubated for 1 h in the absence or presence of 5 nm AG490 (Sigma-Aldrich) and then stimulated with 100 nm leptin for 5 min. The cells were scraped in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm orthovanadate, 5 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 mg/liter benzamidine) and centrifuged for 15 min at 18,000 × g. The soluble fraction was subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h with a polyclonal anti-JAK2 (HR-758) antibody (1 μg/ml) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). JAK2 immunoprecipitates were denatured and separated by 7% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting was carried out with an anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody (2 μg/ml) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Immunoreactivity was revealed using appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase and the ECL chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Radioligand Binding Experiments—Radioligand binding experiments were essentially performed as described (29Barr V.A. Lane K. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine cell surface leptin binding, the cells plated in 6-well plates were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% bovine serum albumin) containing 100000 cpm/well of 125I-leptin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the absence or presence of 200 nm of cold leptin (PeproTech Inc.) for 4 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter. To determine the total leptin binding in extracts, the cells were plated in 10-cm-diameter dishes and were solubilized in 1.5 ml of binding buffer containing 0.15% of digitonin for 2 h at 4 °C. The extracts were centrifuged for 30 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at maximal speed at 4 °C. The supernatant (0.2 ml) was incubated with 100,000 cpm of 125I-leptin in the presence or absence of 200 nm leptin in a total volume of 0.25 ml while rotating overnight at 4 °C. 0.5 ml of γ-globulin (1.25 mg/ml) and 0.5 ml of polyethylene glycol 6000 (25% w/v) were added to precipitate receptor-ligand complexes, which were pelleted by centrifugation (17,000 × g for 3 min). The pellet was washed once with 1 ml of 12% (w/v) of polyethylene glycol 6000, and the radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter. Reporter Gene Activation Assay—HeLa cells were co-transfected with 2.6 μg of a STAT3 reporter gene plasmid (gift of Dr. Levy, New York University, New York), 200 pg of the pcDNA3 vector containing the Renilla luciferase coding region (used as internal control between samples) and with 1.4 μg of the different OB-R construct or vehicle alone. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin prior to stimulation or not by 10 nm leptin for 6-8 h. The cells were then washed and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min at room temperature. Total lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 15,000 rpm, and the supernatants were used in a dual luciferase assay system (Promega) using a Berthold Luminometer (Lumat LB 9507). The results were expressed as ratios of activities for firefly luciferase over Renilla luciferase. Microplate BRET Assay—Forty-eight hours post-transfection, COS-7, HeLa, or HEK 293 cells expressing OB-R fusion proteins were detached and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. 1–2 × 105 cells were distributed in a 96-well Optiplate (Packard) in the absence or presence of ligands at 25 °C. Alternatively, the membranes prepared from OB-R-expressing cells were used for BRET measurements. Coelenterazine h substrate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were performed with a lumino/fluorometer Fusion™ (Packard), which allows the sequential integration of luminescence signals detected with two filter settings (Luc filter, 485 ± 10 nm; YFP filter, 530 ± 12.5 nm). The BRET ratio was defined as the difference of the emission at 530 nm/485 nm) of co-transfected Luc and YFP fusion proteins and the emission at 530 nm/485 nm of the Luc fusion protein alone. The results were expressed in milliBRET units (1 milliBRET unit corresponds to the BRET ratio values multiplied by 1000). Correlation of Fluorescence and Luminescence Levels of Receptor Fusion Proteins to 125I-Leptin-binding Sites—Luminescence and fluorescence levels of several Luc and GFP receptor fusion proteins have been shown to be linearly correlated to receptor numbers (26Ayoub M.A. Couturier C.

Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14092-14099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Because this correlation is an intrinsic characteristic of each fusion protein, correlation curves have to be established for each construct. COS-7 cells were transfected with increasing DNA concentrations of the OB-Rs-Luc or OB-Rs-YFP construct. Maximal luminescence was determined at 485 ± 10 nm (gain 4, photomultiplier tube 1100 V, 1.0 s) in 96-well Optiplates using coelenterazine h (5 μm) as substrate in OB-Rs-Luc-expressing cells, and the fluorescence obtained upon exogenous YFP excitation (gain 8, PMT 1100 V, 1.0 s) was measured in 96-well homogenous time-resolved fluorescence plates (Packard) in OB-Rs-YFP-expressing cells with a lumino/fluorometer Fusion™. Background luminescence and fluorescence determined in wells containing untransfected cells was subtracted. To correlate the luminescence and the fluorescence values with relative receptor numbers, the total number of 125I-leptin-binding sites was determined in the same cells as described under “Radioligand Binding Experiments.” Luminescence and fluorescence were plotted against binding sites, and linear regression curves were generated (see Fig. 6A). To determine the relative expression level of OB-Rs-YFP versus OB-Rs-Luc in cells co-expressing both fusion proteins, the maximal luciferase activity and fluorescence were determined using the same parameters as described above, and the OB-Rs-YFP/OB-Rs-Luc ratio was calculated using the corresponding standard curves. Reliable quantification of luciferase activity was possible under conditions of energy transfer between OB-Rs-YFP and OB-Rs-Luc because the amount of energy transfer observed in the presence of YFP fusion receptors was negligible compared with the luciferase signal. Indeed, the luciferase activity remained constant under conditions where the basal energy transfer increased 3-fold in the presence of leptin (see Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Effect of leptin binding on the constitutive BRET of OB-R. A, intact COS-7 cells expressing OB-Rs (○) or OB-Rl (•) fusion proteins at a 1:1 protein ratio were preincubated for 5 min at 25 °C with increasing concentrations of leptin before initiating the luciferase reaction. B, comparison of the effect of leptin incubation on the BRET between OB-Rs-Luc and OB-Rs-YFP in whole cells in the absence (•)or presence (○) of 0.015% of saponin. The data are presented as percentages of BRET in the absence of leptin and are the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. C, effect of leptin incubation on the BRET measured between OB-Rl-Luc and OB-Rl-YFP in whole cells in the absence (•) and presence (○) of 0.015% saponin. The data are the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments and are presented as percentages of BRET without leptin preincubation. D, cell surface OB-R expression levels of human PAZ6 preadipocytes expressing endogenous OB-R and COS-7 cells transfected with OB-RsBRET partners were determined in 125I-leptin binding studies as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” BRET was measured in the same COS-7 cells, preincubated with 0.015% saponin in the presence or absence of leptin (10 nm) for 5 min prior to addition of luciferase substrate. E, specificity of the leptin-induced BRET change. COS-7 cells were preincubated with 0.015% saponin and saturating concentrations of the indicated ligands: erythropoietin (EPO, 10 units/ml), trombopoietin (TPO, 10 nm), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulatory factor (GM-CSF, 250 ng/ml), interleukin 3 (IL3, 280 ng/ml), interleukin 6 (IL6, 100 ng/ml), prolactin (PRL, 200 ng/ml), stem cell factor α (SCFα, 250 ng/ml), epidermal growth factor (EGF, 100 ng/ml), insulin (Ins, 100 nm), lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/ml), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα, 50 ng/ml), and 1 nm of human and murine leptin. The data expressed as percentages of BRET without stimulation are the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Functional Expression of OB-R Fusion Proteins—C-terminal fusions between OB-Rl and OB-Rs and either the YFP or the Luc were constructed (Fig. 1). Fusion proteins and wild-type receptors were studied independently in 125I-leptin binding experiments in COS-7 cells that do not express detectable quantities of endogenous OB-R. The expression levels of all constructs were comparable (not shown), and cell surface expression varied between 10 and 20% of total synthesized receptors (Fig. 2A). These values were similar to those measured in HEK 293 cells expressing endogenous OB-R and confirmed previous reports showing that only a minor fraction of OB-R is expressed at the cell surface (29Barr V.A. Lane K. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of OB-R-YFP fusion proteins was further studied by fluorescence microscopy. OB-Rs-YFP- and OB-Rl-YFP-associated fluorescence was localized in intracellular membranes and endosome-like vesicles (Fig. 2B), confirming the predominant localization of OB-R in intracellular compartments. A similar localization has previously been reported for another OB-Rl-GFP fusion construct (30Lundin A. Rondahl H. Walum E. Wilcke M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1499: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Functional expression of surface fusion proteins was assessed by measuring the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Upon leptin stimulation, OB-R constructs promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, indicating that JAK2 was activated by the receptor (Fig. 2C). The activity of a STAT3 reporter gene was increased 2–4-fold upon stimulation of OB-Rl-wt and OB-Rl fusion proteins, whereas the activation of OB-Rs constructs had no effect, as expected from the absence of STAT-binding sites in this isoform. Collectively, these results indicate that the fusion of Luc and YFP does not significantly affect OB-R signaling and subcellular localization. Detection of Constitutive OB-R Dimers in Living Cells by BRET—The BRET assay was recently used to monitor protein-protein interactions in living cells (23Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In the case of physical proximity (<100 Å) between two interacting proteins, energy transfer may occur between the energy donor Luc and the energy acceptor YFP, fused to the two proteins of interest. To study OB-R dimerization, equimolar amounts of the Luc and YFP fusion receptors were co-expressed in COS-7 cells. Quantification of fusion proteins was achieved by generating calibration curves between fluorescence and luminescence versus the number of receptor-binding sites determined in radioligand binding assays (see Fig. 6A). A significant basal energy transfer was observed in intact cells co-expressing OB-Rs-Luc and OB-Rs-YFP or OB-Rl-Luc and OB-Rl-YFP (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that constitutive dimers exist for both receptor isoforms. The specificity of these interactions is illustrated by the absence of significant transfer between OB-Rs-Luc or OB-Rl-Luc and a control insulin receptor YFP fusion protein (25Boute N. Pernet K. Issad T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 640-645PubMed Google Scholar) expressed at levels comparable with those of OB-R-YFP fusions. Similar results were obtained in HEK 293 and HeLa cells (not shown). Experiments performed on crude membrane preparations showed a similar pattern with higher BRET values compared with whole cells (Fig. 3A), indicating that the energy transfer between Luc and YFP depends on the environment (buffer composition, interaction partners, cytoskeleton, etc...). Comparable BRET signals were observed in isolated plasma membrane and light membrane preparations, indicating that constitutive dimerization occurs in both compartments (not shown). BRET was not due to receptor overexpression because it was observed at OB-R expression levels similar to those determined in human PAZ6 preadipocytes expressing endogenous OB-R (as assessed in 125I-leptin binding experiments) (Fig. 4D). Therefore, the constitutive dimerization of OB-R detected by BRET experiments likely reflects a physiological phenomenon. To study the stability of OB-R dimers, BRET measurements were performed on receptors solubilized with digitonin, which solubilizes OB-R without affecting its ligand binding properties (29Barr V.A. Lane K. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Solubilization of OB-Rs caused a marked decrease of the BRET signal (Fig. 3B) in the absence of any significant reduction of luciferase activity, of YFP fluorescence, and of 125I-leptin-binding sites (not shown), suggesting that solubilization dissociates preformed OB-Rs dimers. In contrast, the constitutive BRET measured for OB-Rs was preserved when receptors were stabilized by the agonist before solubilization. The constitutive BRET of OB-Rl was not affected by solubilization, indicating that basal OB-Rl dimers are more stable than OB-Rs dimers, possibly because of their longer intracellular domain. Activation of OB-R Monitored by BRET—Energy transfer-based techniques such as fluorescence and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer have been successfully used to monitor membrane receptor activation in living cells (25Boute N.

https://openalex.org/W2126669642,"Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a mammalian amidase signature enzyme that inactivates neuromodulatory fatty acid amides, including the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide and the sleep-inducing substance oleamide. The recent determination of the three-dimensional structures of FAAH and two distantly related bacterial amidase signature enzymes indicates that these enzymes employ an unusual serine-serine-lysine triad for catalysis (Ser-241/Ser-217/Lys-142 in FAAH). Mutagenesis of each of the triad residues in FAAH has been shown to severely reduce amidase activity; however, how these residues contribute, both individually and in cooperation, to catalysis remains unclear. Here, through a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, enzyme kinetics, and chemical labeling experiments, we provide evidence that each FAAH triad residue plays a distinct role in catalysis. In particular, the mutation of Lys-142 to alanine indicates that this residue functions as both a base involved in the activation of the Ser-241 nucleophile and an acid that participates in the protonation of the substrate leaving group. This latter property appears to support the unusual ability of FAAH to hydrolyze amides and esters at equivalent rates. Interestingly, although structural evidence indicates that the impact of Lys-142 on catalysis probably occurs through the bridging Ser-217, the mutation of this latter residue to alanine impaired catalytic activity but left the amide/ester hydrolysis ratios of FAAH intact. Collectively, these findings suggest that FAAH possesses a specialized active site structure dedicated to a mechanism for competitive amide and ester hydrolysis where nucleophile attack and leaving group protonation occur in a coordinated manner dependent on Lys-142.

In particular, the mutation of Lys-142 to alanine indicates that this residue functions as both a base involved in the activation of the Ser-241 nucleophile and an acid that participates in the protonation of the substrate leaving group. This latter property appears to support the unusual ability of FAAH to hydrolyze amides and esters at equivalent rates. Interestingly, although structural evidence indicates that the impact of Lys-142 on catalysis probably occurs through the bridging Ser-217, the mutation of this latter residue to alanine impaired catalytic activity but left the amide/ester hydrolysis ratios of FAAH intact. Collectively, these findings suggest that FAAH possesses a specialized active site structure dedicated to a mechanism for competitive amide and ester hydrolysis where nucleophile attack and leaving group protonation occur in a coordinated manner dependent on Lys-142. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) 1The abbreviations used are: FAAH, fatty acid amide hydrolase; MAE2, malonamidase E2; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; PAM, peptide amidase; OME, oleoyl methyl ester; FP, fluorophosphonate; AS, amidase signature; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: FAAH, fatty acid amide hydrolase; MAE2, malonamidase E2; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; PAM, peptide amidase; OME, oleoyl methyl ester; FP, fluorophosphonate; AS, amidase signature; WT, wild type. is an integral membrane enzyme that degrades members of the fatty acid amide class of neural signaling lipids, including the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide (1Devane W.A.

Studies of FAAH(–/–) mice have confirmed that this enzyme is a key regulator of fatty acid amide signaling in vivo (4Cravatt B.F. Demarest K. Patricelli M.P. Bracey M.H. Giang D.K. Martin B.R.

For example, FAAH(–/–) mice possess elevated endogenous brain levels of anandamide and related fatty acid amides that correlate with enhanced cannabinoid receptor 1-dependent analgesia in these animals (4Cravatt B.F. Demarest K. Patricelli M.P. Bracey M.H. Giang D.K. Martin B.R. Lichtman A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9371-9376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Likewise, FAAH inhibitors produce analgesic and anxiolytic effects in rodents (6Kathuria S. Gaetani S. Fegley D. Valiño F. Duranti A. Tontini A. Mor M. Tarzia G. La Rana G. Calignano A. Giustino A. Tattoli M. Palmery M. Cuomo V. Piomelli D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that FAAH may represent an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of pain and related neural disorders. Toward this end, a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanism of FAAH may assist in the design of specific inhibitors of this enzyme.FAAH belongs to a diverse group of alkyl and aryl amidases known as the amidase signature (AS) family whose members are characterized by a conserved serine- and glycine-rich stretch of ∼130 amino acids (7Mayaux J.-F. Cerbelaud E. Soubrier F. Faucher D. Petre D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6764-6773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chebrou H. Bigey F. Arnaud A. Galzy P. Biochim. Biophys.

Despite the evolutionary extent of AS enzymes, their catalytic mechanism has only recently been investigated. A series of mutagenesis and chemical labeling studies of FAAH has targeted residues conserved across the AS family and provided evidence that three of these residues, Ser-241, Lys-142, and Ser-217, are of primary importance for catalysis (15Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19177-19184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In particular, these investigations have indicated roles for Ser-241 and Lys-142 as the catalytic nucleophile and a catalytic acid/base, respectively, with the latter residue contributing to the unusual ability of FAAH to hydrolyze structurally similar fatty acid amides and esters at equivalent rates (16Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a more detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanism of FAAH has to date been limited by a lack of structural information for this enzyme and the AS family as a whole.With the recently solved x-ray crystal structures of FAAH (18Bracey M.H. Hanson M.A. Masuda K.R. Stevens R.C. Cravatt B.F. Science. 2002; 298: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and the distantly related bacterial AS enzymes malonamidase E2 (MAE2) (19Shin S. Lee T.-H. Ha N.-C. Koo H.M. Kim S.-Y. Lee H.-S. Kim Y.-S. Oh B.-H. Eur. Mol. Biol. Org. 2002; 21: 2509-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and peptide amidase (PAM) (20Labahn J. Neumann S. Buldt G. Kula M.-R. Grazin J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the central catalytic residues of the AS family have been revealed to form a novel serine-serine-lysine catalytic triad (Ser-241, Ser-217, and Lys-142 in FAAH). This unusual arrangement of catalytic residues raises intriguing questions regarding the specific roles played by the bridging serine and lysine residues in hydrolysis. For example, based on the structures of MAE2 and PAM, models have been proposed for catalysis in which the bridging serine of the triad plays a primary role in both the base-catalyzed activation of the neighboring serine nucleophile and the acid-catalyzed protonation of the substrate-leaving group, whereas the lysine residue purportedly has a more supportive function mainly in the latter event (19Shin S. Lee T.-H. Ha N.-C. Koo H.M. Kim S.-Y. Lee H.-S. Kim Y.-S. Oh B.-H. Eur. Mol. Biol. Org. 2002; 21: 2509-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Labahn J. Neumann S. Buldt G. Kula M.-R. Grazin J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Somewhat inconsistent with this mechanism, however, are previous mutagenesis analyses of FAAH that have indicated a more central participation of Lys-142 in catalysis (17Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Here, through a combination of mutagenesis, substrate selectivity profiles, and chemical labeling experiments, we provide evidence that both Ser-217 and Lys-142 contribute to the base-catalyzed activation of the Ser-241 nucleophile of FAAH, whereas Lys-142 appears to play a uniquely important role in the acid-catalyzed protonation of the substrate-leaving group. This latter property of Lys-142, which is unaffected by mutation of Ser-217, may support the unusual ability of FAAH to hydrolyze fatty acid amides and esters at equivalent rates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of FAAH Mutants—For the studies described below, rat FAAH mutants were constructed in the prokaryotic expression vector pTrcHisA (Invitrogen), which contains an N-terminal His6 tag. Point mutants were generated using the QuikChange procedure (Stratagene). All of the enzymes contained an N-terminal truncation of amino acid residues 1–29, which constitute a predicted transmembrane domain. This deletion has been shown to have no effect on catalytic activity or membrane binding but does enhance expression and purification (21Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For clarity, numbered residues refer to the full-length enzyme.Expression and Purification of FAAH and Mutants—Enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by sequential metal affinity, heparin-agarose, and gel-filtration chromatography as described previously (21Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). All of the enzymes yielded ∼0.5 mg of protein/liter of culture volume.Circular Dichroism Spectrometry—Protein samples at 0.5 mg/ml (7.75 μm) in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.015% lauryldimethylamine oxide were measured by far-UV circular dichroism at 25 °C in a 0.1-cm cell on an Aviv stopped-flow CD spectrometer.Synthesis of FAAH Substrates—[14C]Oleamide and [14C]oleoyl methyl ester (OME) were synthesized by reaction of [14C]oleoyl chloride with ammonium hydroxide and methanol, respectively, as described previously (2Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar).Enzyme Assays—Enzyme assays were performed by following the conversion of [14C]oleamide and [14C]OME to oleic acid using a thin layer chromatography (TLC) assay as described previously (21Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Reactions were conducted in a buffer of 50 mm Bis-Tris propane, 50 mm CAPS, 50 mm citrate, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The pH of the buffer was adjusted using HCl or NaOH. Reactions were quenched with 0.5 n HCl at 4 time points. Oleic acid was separated from oleamide by TLC in 65% ethyl acetate, 35% hexanes and from OME by TLC in 20% ethyl acetate, 80% hexanes. The radioactive compounds were quantified using a Cyclone PhosphorImager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). FAAH enzymes exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and apparent Km and k cat values were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots of four substrate concentrations run in triplicate. Additional assays conducted with 0.01 and 0.25% Triton X-100-afforded k cat and Km values for FAAH-catalyzed oleamide and OME hydrolysis equivalent to the values obtained with 0.05% Triton X-100, indicating that over this concentration range of detergent (0.01–0.25% Triton X-100), the substrate/detergent ratio did not significantly impact the measurement of the catalytic parameters of FAAH. Enzyme concentrations were estimated assuming an absorbance at 280 nm of 0.8 absorbance unit for a 1 mg/ml solution of FAAH (21Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).Fluorophosphonate Labeling—Labeling reactions of 80 nm enzyme and 1 μm fluorophosphonate-tetramethyl rhodamine (FP-rhodamine, Activx Biosciences) (22Patricelli M.P. Giang D.K. Stamp L.M. Burbaum J.J. Cravatt B.F. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) were allowed to proceed at 25 °C for 5 and 20 min using the reaction buffer above and quenched with one volume of 2× SDS loading buffer. Control samples of wild type (WT) FAAH were labeled to completion and used as a reference for 100% reactivity. Quenched reactions were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE with 1.2 pmol of protein/gel lane. The extent of FP-labeling was visualized in-gel using a Hitachi FMBio IIe flatbed laser-induced fluorescence scanner and quantified by measuring the integrated fluorescence band intensities. The rates of FP reactivity of FAAH variants were calculated using Equation 1, E=E0e-kobst(Eq. 1) where E is the amount of unlabeled enzyme at time point t, E 0 is the total enzyme, and k obs is the calculated rate of labeling. Values for FP-labeling are reported as the second order rate constant kobs /[I] where [I] is the concentration of FP-rhodamine. For each mutant enzyme, similar k obs/[I] values were obtained at 5- and 20-min time points and these values were averaged from duplicate trials to provide the values reported in Table IV and Fig. 3. For WT-FAAH, k obs/[I] values were obtained from reactions with 8 nm enzyme and 100 nm FP-rhodamine, pH 7.0, measured at 15, 30, 45, and 60 s. These values were averaged to provide the k obs/[I] value reported in Table IV.Table IVFP reactivity of FAAH mutants at pH 7.0FAAHK142AS217AK142A/S217AS241Ak obs/[I] (M-1 s-1)(1.4 ± 0.6) × 10523 ± 749 ± 122 ± 10.15 ± 0.11 Open table in a new tab RESULTSGeneration and Purification of FAAH Variants with Mutations in the Serine-Serine-Lysine Catalytic Triad—Previous studies of FAAH have provided strong evidence that Ser-241 represents the catalytic nucleophile of the enzyme (16Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a finding substantiated by the three-dimensional structure of FAAH where covalent modification of Ser-241 by a methoxyarachidonyl fluorophosphonate inhibitor was observed (18Bracey M.H. Hanson M.A. Masuda K.R. Stevens R.C. Cravatt B.F. Science. 2002; 298: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The FAAH structure revealed that Ser-241 forms part of an unusual catalytic triad with Ser-217 and Lys-142 (Fig. 1), an active site architecture also observed in the structures of the bacterial AS enzymes MAE2 (19Shin S. Lee T.-H. Ha N.-C. Koo H.M. Kim S.-Y. Lee H.-S. Kim Y.-S. Oh B.-H. Eur. Mol. Biol. Org. 2002; 21: 2509-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and PAM (20Labahn J. Neumann S. Buldt G. Kula M.-R. Grazin J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Given the complete conservation of this serine-serine-lysine triad among members of the AS family, a deeper investigation of the roles that its constituents play in catalysis is warranted. To examine the catalytic functions of Ser-217 and Lys-142, each residue was mutated to alanine and the resulting FAAH variants were expressed and purified as described previously (21Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Additionally, the double mutant K142A/S217A was generated and purified. All of the mutant enzymes were properly folded based on gel-filtration profiles (data not shown) and far-UV circular dichroism spectra that matched those of WT-FAAH (Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 1The serine 241-serine 217-lysine 142 catalytic triad of FAAH. Shown is a portion of the FAAH active site with the Ser-241/Ser-217/Lys-142 catalytic triad highlighted.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), both the K142A and S217A FAAH mutants exhibited significant decreases in apparent k cat values for oleamide hydrolysis relative to WT-FAAH at pH 9.0 (∼40,000- and 3,000-fold, respectively) (Table I). The K142A/S217A double mutant displayed an even greater catalytic deficiency at this pH (∼70,000-fold). In contrast to both the K142A and S217A mutants, which showed wild type apparent Km values for oleamide, the K142A/S217A variant displayed a 3-fold increase in apparent Km for oleamide, suggesting that the mutation of both Lys-142 and Ser-217 had a modest effect on substrate binding. Both of the K142A and K142A/S217A mutants exhibited a strong pH dependence on catalysis (Fig. 2A), although their severely reduced activities were difficult to measure in the lower pH range (hydrolysis rates below 1×10–5 s–1 approached the sensitivity limit of the substrate assay). In contrast, the S217A mutant was found to display a relatively flat pH-rate profile for oleamide hydrolysis from pH 6.5 to 9.0 (Fig. 2A). The distinct pH-rate profiles of the FAAH mutants resulted in catalytic defects relative to WT-FAAH at pH 7.0 of 104,000- and 2,000-fold for the K142A and S217A variants, respectively.Table ICatalytic properties of FAAH mutants with oleamideEnzymeCatalytic triadkcataDetermined at pH 9.0 unless otherwise noted.,bFAAH is an integral membrane enzyme, and therefore assays are conducted in the presence of detergent.

J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 3505-3515Google Scholar). FAAH represents a notable exception to this general principle as this enzyme has been shown to hydrolyze fatty acid amides and esters at equivalent rates by an acylation rate-limiting mechanism (17Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this special property of FAAH depends on Lys-142 because a K142A mutant has been shown to strongly prefer OME over oleamide (17Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, at pH 9.0 the K142A mutant exhibited only a 50-fold decrease in apparent k cat for OME (Table 2), hydrolyzing this substrate at a 320-fold faster rate than oleamide (Table III). In contrast, the S217A mutant was found to hydrolyze OME at an ∼5-fold slower rate than oleamide (Table III). This preference for amide substrates over esters exhibited by the S217A mutant mirrored the substrate selectivity of WT-FAAH, which displayed a 2.5-fold greater activity with oleamide than OME (Table III). Thus, despite exhibiting considerable reductions in absolute catalytic activity with both oleamide and OME, the S217A mutant maintained wild type amide/ester hydrolysis ratios. The striking differences in the amide/ester hydrolysis ratios of the K142A and S217A mutants resulted in opposite relative substrate preferences for these enzymes with the former enzyme being a 120-fold better esterase but a 13-fold worse amidase than the latter enzyme at pH 9.0 (Tables I and II).Table IICatalytic properties of FAAH mutants with oleoyl methyl esterEnzymeCatalytic triadkcataDetermined at pH 9.0 unless otherwise noted.,bFAAH is an integral membrane enzyme, and therefore assays are conducted in the presence of detergent.

In contrast, the S217A mutant showed a flattened pH-rate profile for OME hydrolysis similar to the pH-rate profile displayed by this enzyme for oleamide hydrolysis (Fig. 2B). The differences in the pH-rate profiles of the K142A/S217A and S217A mutants resulted in progressively slower relative rates of catalysis for the former enzyme as pH was lowered (Fig. 2A). Finally, the K142A/S217A mutant exhibited an ∼5-fold preference for OME over oleamide (Table III), thus displaying an amide/ester selectivity ratio that fell in between those displayed by either single mutant.Comparative Analysis of the FP Reactivities of FAAH Mutants—Assuming that the K142A and S217A mutants, similar to WT-FAAH (17Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), both hydrolyze amide and ester substrates through an acylation rate-limiting mechanism (a premise that is supported by the wild type apparent Km values displayed by these enzymes for oleamide and OME), the reduced catalytic activities of these mutants suggest roles for each residue in nucleophile activation, leaving group protonation, or both. To distinguish the impact of mutation of Lys-142 and Ser-217 on nucleophile activation separate from leaving group protonation, the rates of reactivity of each mutant enzyme with a fluorophosphonate (FP-rhodamine) (22Patricelli M.P.

Reduced rates of labeling of serine hydrolases by FPs are typically caused by mutations that 1) decrease the strength of the serine nucleophile (15Patricelli M.P. Cravat"

Up to 16 weeks of age, the db/db mouse is insulin-resistant and hyperglycemic and is a good model of Type 2 diabetes. After ∼16 weeks of age, the mice develop pancreatic beta cell failure that can progress to a Type 1 diabetes phenotype. We have previously shown that glucose increases production of endothelial 12/15 lipoxygenase (12/15LO) products in vitro. In young 10-week-old Type 2 diabetic db/db mice, we found significant elevations in levels of urinary 12/15LO products, 12S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12S-HETE) and 13S-hydroxyoctadecaenoic acid (13S-HODE) in vivo compared with C57BLKS/J mice. Using isolated primary aortic endothelial cells (ECs) from db/db mice and WEHI78/24 mouse monocyte cells in static adhesion assays, we found increased WEHI monocyte adhesion to db/db ECs (14 ± 2 monocytes/field for db/db ECs versus 4 ± 1 monocytes/field for C57BLKS/J ECs, p < 0.002). Thus, ECs from db/db mice appear to be “pre-activated” to bind monocytes. Analysis of db/db ECs revealed a 2-fold elevation in 12/15LO protein compared with C57BLKS/J EC. To determine that 12/15LO products were responsible for the increased monocyte adhesion observed with db/db ECs, we inhibited expression of murine 12/15LO using either an adenovirus expressing a ribozyme to 12/15LO (AdRZ) or with the 12/15LO inhibitor cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-α-cyanocinnamate. Treatment of db/db ECs for 48 h with AdRZ or 4 h with 10 μm cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-α-cyanocinnamate significantly reduced monocyte adhesion to db/db endothelium (p < 0.009). Thus, inhibition of the murine 12/15LO in db/db mice significantly reduced monocyte/endothelial interactions. We also found that adhesion of monocytes to diabetic db/db ECs was mediated by interactions of α4β1 integrin on monocytes with endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and connecting segment 1 fibronectin and interactions of β2 integrins with endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule 1. In summary, regulation of the 12/15LO pathway is important for mediating early vascular changes in diabetes.

In the current study, we examined early inflammatory events that mediate vascular complications in vivo using diabetic db/db mice. We found that db/db mice produce significant amounts of 12/15LO eicosanoid products in vivo. We found that aortic endothelial cells from these mice are “pre-activated” to bind monocytes. Blocking of the 12/15LO pathway in endothelial cells of the db/db mice prevented monocyte/endothelial interactions. The results of this study indicate that products of the 12/15LO pathway mediate monocyte/endothelial interactions in diabetes. Reagents—Antibodies to endothelial adhesion molecules for flow cytometry (FITC anti-mouse CD106 (#553332), FITC anti-mouse CD54 (#553252), and FITC-labeled isotype controls) were purchased from BD Biosciences. Rat anti-mouse antibodies to VLA-4 (PS/2) and VCAM-1 (MK/2.7) were provided by Dr. Klaus Ley (University of Virginia). Rabbit anti-mouse ICAM-1 antibody (YN1.1) was purchased from Chemicon. Anti-mouse β2 integrin antibody (GAME-46) was purchased from BD Biosciences. Polyclonal antibody to 12/15LO was provided by Dr. Jerry L. Nadler (University of Virginia). CS-1 peptide (EILDVPST) was purchased from American Peptide Co. WEHI 78/24 monocytes were a gift of Dr. J. A. Berliner (UCLA). Cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-α-cyanocinnamate (CDC) was purchased from Biomol. Mitochondrial ROS inhibitors carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and thenoyltrifluoroacetone were purchased from Sigma. Mice—Young 10-week-old male db/db (BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (stock number 000642). The db/db mice were on a pure C57BLKS/J background strain; thus 10-week-old male C57BLKS/J mice from Jackson Laboratories (stock number 000662) were used as controls. Mice were fed rodent chow and housed in micro-isolator cages in a pathogen-free facility. All experiments followed Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) guidelines and approval for use of rodents was obtained from University of Virginia. Eicosanoid Measurement in Urine—For extraction of lipids from urine, 0.5 ml of urine from each mouse was added to 40 nmol of internal standard nonphysiological 8-HETE in siliconized screw-capped glass tubes. The pH was adjusted to pH 3 using 1 n HCl; 2.25 ml of ethyl acetate was added and tubes were centrifuged at 3000 rpm. The ethyl acetate phase was transferred to a 5-ml glass vial and dried under nitrogen. The dried lipid phase was dissolved in 0.2 ml of acetonitrile and diluted with 0.8 ml of water. Free fatty acids were separated from phospholipids and neutral lipids using two C18 Bond-Elute columns, (1 ml, 50 mg; Varian). Samples were loaded onto the first column, and polar phospholipids were eluted with 30% acetonitrile; free fatty acids and neutral lipids were eluted with 0.4 ml of 90% acetonitrile. These fractions were diluted with 0.9 ml of water and reapplied to a fresh column, and the free fatty acids alone were eluted using 0.6 ml of ethyl acetate. The fluorescence derivatives of the free fatty acids were formed using 8 mg of 2-(2,3-naphthalimino)ethyltrifluoromethanesulfonate dissolved in 0.5 ml of acetonitrile. The reaction mixes were dried with nitrogen, resuspended in 0.4 ml of acetonitrile, diluted with 0.6 ml of water, and applied to a third Bond-Elut column. The fatty acid derivatives were eluted with 0.6 ml of ethyl acetate, evaporated under nitrogen, and resuspended in 100 μl of methanol for HPLC analysis. HPLC separation and analysis was performed using a C18 Waters symmetry column and eluting isocratically for 100 min at solvent B = 61%, where B = 50% methanol/tetrahydrofuran plus 0.1% acetic acid and A = 0.1% acetic acid following related protocols of Roman et al. (31Maier K.G. Henderson L. Narayanan J. Alonso-Galicia M. Falck J.R. Roman R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H863-H871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peaks were detected fluorometrically at an excitation wavelength of 259 nm and emission wavelength of 394 nm. The area ratio of sample HETE area/internal standard (8-HETE) area was plotted against nanograms of HETE injected, and unknown sample HETE values were calculated from their area ratios. All HETEs (5-, 12-, and 15-HETE) and HODEs (9- and 13-HODE) were baseline separated using this elution protocol. HETE and HODE measurements in urine were normalized to milligrams of creatinine. Isolation of Mouse Aortic Endothelial Cells—Aortic endothelial cells from C57BLKS/J and db/db mice were harvested from mouse aorta under sterile conditions. The aorta was excised; all peri-adventitial fat was removed, and the aortic pieces were placed onto Matrigel in DMEM plus 15% heat-inactivated FBS following the methods outlined by Shi and colleagues (32Shi W. Haberland M.E. Jien M.L. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 33Shi W. Wang N.J. Shih D.M. Sun V.Z. Wang X. Lusis A.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). After 3 days, the aortic explants were removed, and the endothelial cells were allowed to grow in DMEM plus 15% heat-inactivated FBS supplemented with 180 μg/ml heparin and 20 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement. At confluency, the cells were passaged using Dispase and then cultured for 2 days in DMEM plus 15% heat-inactivated FBS containing d-valine to eliminate possible fibroblast contamination. After 2 days, the ECs were returned to growth medium without d-valine and allowed to grow to confluency. Mouse endothelial cell cultures were tested for purity at passage 2 using either Von Willebrand factor staining or di-acetylated LDL uptake and were used in experiments from passages 3 to 6. Mouse Monocyte Adhesion Assay—Our laboratory has recently developed a monocyte adhesion assay that utilizes primary MAECs and WEHI78/24 cells. WEHI78/24 cells are a mouse monocytoid cell line that has been fully characterized by McEvoy and colleagues (34McEvoy L.M. Sun H. Tsao P.S. Cooke J.P. Berliner J.A. Butcher E.C. J. Exp.

Circulation. 1994; 89: 2176-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). WEHI were cultured in DMEM plus 10% heat-inactivated FBS. WEHI cells are labeled with calcein-AM using standard methods described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). For the adhesion assay, MAECs were cultured to confluency in a 48-well plate and incubated with 35,000 calcein-labeled WEHI cells/well for 30 min at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were rinsed, and adherent cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde. The number of adherent monocytes within a 10 × 10 eyepiece grid at ×40 magnification was counted using epifluorescence microscopy. As a positive control for monocyte adhesion, MAECs were incubated with 10 units/ml recombinant murine TNFα (R&D Systems #410-MT) for 4 h. For studies using blocking antibodies or peptides, WEHI cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with CS-1 peptide (10 μg/ml, EILDVPST), antibody to α4 integrin (clone PS/2, 20 μg/ml), antibody to β2 integrin (clone GAME-46, 20 μg/ml), or isotype control antibody prior to adding to MAECs for adhesion assay. In some studies, VCAM-1 antibody (clone MK2.7, 20 μg/ml) to block endothelial VCAM-1, ICAM-1 antibody (clone YN1.1, 20 μg/ml) to block endothelial ICAM-1, or isotype control antibody was added to ECs for 4 h at 37 °C. To block 12/15LO activity in ECs, MAECs were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 50 for 48 h with the recombinant adenoviral vectors, AdRZ (expresses 12/15LO ribozyme) or AdLacZ control (22Patricia M.K.

Flow Cytometry—C57BLKS/J and db/db MAECs at passage 4 were collected in PBS by gentle scraping using a cell scraper. 150,000 cells per sample were analyzed for each antibody. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 1:100 dilution of antibody (FITC anti-mouse VCAM-1 and FITC anti-mouse ICAM-1 or isotype control antibody). After incubation, cells were rinsed 3× in PBS and fixed in paraformaldehyde. Samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur cell sorter. Analyses were performed using a single FITC-labeled antibody per tube. Unstained and isotype control antibodies were included in analyses as controls. Human Endothelial Cell Culture—Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were obtained from aortic rings of explanted donor hearts (11Patricia M.K. Kim J.A. Harper C.M. Shih P.T. Berliner J.A. Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Hedrick C.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2615-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). HAECs were cultured for 7 days in Medium 199 containing 20% heat-inactivated FBS, 20 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, and 90 μg/ml heparin in the presence of 5.5 mm glucose (NG) or 25 mm glucose (HG) for 7 days. The 7-day, 25 mm HG incubation condition was chosen because monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells was maximal at this concentration of glucose and time of incubation (11Patricia M.K. Kim J.A. Harper C.M. Shih P.T. Berliner J.A. Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Hedrick C.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2615-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For studies using chemical uncouplers of mitochondrial function, HAECs were cultured as described above and treated for 7 days with 0.5 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone or 10 μm thenoyltrifluoroacetone. 12S-HETE Detection by Immunoassay—HAECs grown in 100-mm dishes in normal (5 mm) or high glucose (25 mm) media were incubated for 30 min in medium 199 with 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. The dishes were iced, and their media were collected, acidified, and extracted into ethanol. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS containing 100 μm EDTA and then scraped and pelleted. The cell pellets were deacylated with methanolic sodium hydroxide for 1 h and extracted on C18 Bond-Elut columns. 12S-HETE levels were quantitated by a specific immunoassay (Assay Designs, Inc.). The antibody in this kit is specific for 12S-HETE, with less than 0.1% cross-reactivity with other eicosanoids. Statistical Analyses—Data for all experiments were analyzed by ANOVA and Fisher's protected least significant difference test using the StatView 6.0 software program. Data are represented as the mean ± S.E. of eight mice per group unless otherwise noted in the figure legends. Monocyte adhesion data are represented as the mean ± S.E. of six experiments unless otherwise noted in the figure legends. Monocyte Adhesion to Endothelial Cells Is Increased in Diabetic Mice—db/db mice are hyperglycemic and insulin-resistant as early as 6 weeks of age (2Kobayashi K. Forte T.M. Taniguchi S. Ishida B.Y. Oka K. Chan L. Metabolism. 2000; 49: 22-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). At 6–12 weeks of age, these mice are used as a model of Type 2 diabetes (2Kobayashi K. Forte T.M. Taniguchi S. Ishida B.Y. Oka K. Chan L. Metabolism. 2000; 49: 22-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We recently have developed a technique for isolating primary endothelial cells from mouse aorta (36Srinivasan S. Yeh M. Danziger E.C. Hatley M.E. Riggan A.E. Leitinger N. Berliner J.A. Hedrick C.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we examined monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells from control (C57BLKS/J) and diabetic (db/db) mice. As shown in Fig. 1, we found that basal, unstimulated ECs isolated from db/db mice bound more monocytes than did control ECs in a static adhesion assay (p < 0.002). TNFα (10 units/ml) was added to C57BLKS/J ECs as a positive control to show maximal binding in the adhesion assays. These data suggest that db/db mouse endothelial cells are already pre-activated to bind monocytes and indicate that monocyte adhesion to endothelium is increased in the diabetic state. Adhesion Molecule Expression on db/db Mouse Endothelial Cells—We have previously shown in human ECs that glucose increases deposition of CS-1 fibronectin on the apical surface of human ECs (11Patricia M.K. Kim J.A. Harper C.M. Shih P.T. Berliner J.A. Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Hedrick C.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2615-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Currently there are no available reagents to measure CS-1 FN expression in the mouse. To indirectly examine the role of CS-1 FN in mediating monocyte adhesion to mouse aortic ECs, we used a peptide that specifically blocks CS-1-mediated monocyte adhesion (13Huo Y. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Ley K. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This peptide blocks the LDV binding site for CS-1 FN on VLA-4 (13Huo Y. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Ley K. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, monocyte adhesion to db/db ECs was decreased ∼70% in presence of CS-1 FN blocking peptide. TNFα (10 units/ml) was added to C57BLKS/J ECs as a positive control to show maximal binding in the adhesion assay. Blocking antibody to VCAM-1 (37Huo Y. Weber C. Forlow S.B. Sperandio M. Thatte J. Mack M. Jung S. Littman D.R. Ley K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1307-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) also significantly reduced adhesion to db/db ECs by 50%. We also examined the contributions of ICAM-1 and β2 integrins on mediating monocyte/endothelial interactions in db/db mice. As shown in Fig. 2, we found that blocking either β2 integrin or ICAM-1 reduced db/db-mediated monocyte adhesion by ∼50%. However, blocking antibody to α4 integrin (37Huo Y. Weber C. Forlow S.B. Sperandio M. Thatte J. Mack M. Jung S. Littman D.R. Ley K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1307-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) on monocytes completely prevented adhesion, suggesting that adhesion was primarily mediated through VLA-4 on monocytes. VLA-4 contains binding sites for both VCAM-1 and CS-1 FN (11Patricia M.K. Kim J.A. Harper C.M. Shih P.T. Berliner J.A. Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Hedrick C.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2615-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (38Guan J.L. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1990; 60: 53-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Thus, monocyte adhesion in db/db mice is primarily mediated through VLA-4 on monocytes and VCAM-1 and CS-1 fibronectin on the ECs surface, although ICAM-1 and β2 integrins also are involved in db/db-mediated adhesion. Diabetic db/db Mice Have Increased Production of 12/15LO Eicosanoid Products—We have previously shown that HAECs cultured chronically in elevated glucose show increased production of 12S-HETE and 15S-HETE, the primary products of the 12/15LO enzyme (11Patricia M.K. Kim J.A. Harper C.M. Shih P.T. Berliner J.A. Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Hedrick C.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2615-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We have also shown that exogenous addition of these eicosanoids to HAECs stimulated monocyte adhesion (11Patricia M.K. Kim J.A. Harper C.M. Shih P.T."
https://openalex.org/W2160361307,"Serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) is a serine kinase that has a catalytic domain homologous to that of Akt, but lacks the pleckstrin homology domain present in Akt. Akt reportedly plays a key role in various cellular actions, including glucose transport, glycogen synthesis, DNA synthesis, anti-apoptotic activity, and cell proliferation. In this study, we attempted to reveal the different roles of SGK and Akt by overexpressing active mutants of Akt and SGK. We found that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of myristoylated (myr-) forms of Akt resulted in high glucose transport activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and enhanced glycogen synthase activity in hepatocytes, and the promotion of DNA synthesis in interleukin-3-dependent 32D cells. In addition, stable transfection of myr-Akt in NIH3T3 cells induced an oncogenic transformation in soft agar assays. The active mutant of SGK (D-SGK, substitution of Ser422 with Asp) and myr-SGK were shown to phosphorylate GSK3 and to enhance glycogen synthase activity in hepatocytes in a manner very similar to that observed for myr-Akt. However, despite the comparable degree of GSK3 phosphorylation between myr-Akt and d-SGK or myr-SGK, d-SGK and myr-SGK failed to enhance glucose transport activity in 3T3-L1 cells, DNA synthesis in 32D cells, and oncogenic transformation in NIH3T3 cells. Therefore, the different roles of SGK and Akt cannot be attributed to ability or inability to translocate to the membrane thorough the pleckstrin homology domain, but rather must be attributable to differences in the relatively narrow substrate specificities of these kinases. In addition, our observations strongly suggest that phosphorylation of GSK3 is either not involved in or not sufficient for GLUT4 translocation, DNA synthesis, or oncogenic transformation. Thus, the identification of substrates selectively phosphorylated by Akt, but by not SGK, may provide clues to clarifying the pathway leading from Akt activation to these cellular activities.

Among these AGC kinases, Akt was found to mediate various insulin- and growth factor-induced cellular responses such as stimulation of GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (10Kohn A.D.

In addition, as shown by the v-Akt data, constitutively activated Akt has transforming activity (9Staal S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5034-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). These cellular activities have been shown to be induced by overexpression of constitutively activated Akt or its membrane-targeted mutant. For example, glucose uptake is reportedly increased in both constitutively activated Akt-overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes (10Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 11Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), whereas Akt2-deficient mice show impaired glucose tolerance due to decreased insulin-induced glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and increased hepatic glucose production (12Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). On the other hand, SGK, the expression level of which is increased by glucocorticoid and serum stimulation in cultured cells (13Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 48Mizuno H. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), is the one member of the AGC kinase family with a highly conserved kinase domain compared with that of Akt (54% identical amino acids) (14Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 15Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344 (Pt 1): 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Indeed, the substrate specificity of the kinase domain of SGK has been reported to be similar to that of Akt (16Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was also reported that the PI 3-kinase pathway activates SGK through PDK1/2, i.e. in the same manner as for Akt (17Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 49Virbasius J.V. Song X. Pomerleau D.P. Zhan Y. Zhou G.W. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12908-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the most apparent difference in the structures of SGK and Akt is that SGK lacks the PH domain that Akt has. Thus, SGK is considered to not be able to translocate to the membrane like Akt in response to growth factor stimulation. In fact, it was reported that insulin stimulation induces the translocation of Akt to the membrane fraction, but that this does not occur with mutant Akt lacking the PH domain or with SGK (18Sable C.L. Filippa N. Filloux C. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29600-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although recent studies revealed a possible role of SGK in aldosterone-induced apical translocation of the epithelial sodium channel in distal nephrons (19Bhargava A. Fullerton M.J. Myles K. Purdy T.M. Funder J.W. Pearce D. Cole T.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 20Chen S.Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P.

Physiol. 1999; 277: F319-F327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it seems that our understanding of the roles of SGK remains limited. In this study, we investigated whether SGK induces the cellular functions known to be induced by activated Akt. Akt activation reportedly plays a key role in glucose metabolism, including increased glycogen synthase and GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, as well as in inhibition of apoptosis and promotion of cell growth. The induction of these cellular functions by Akt has been well demonstrated, and they are also induced by overexpressing myr-Akt (10Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 11Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S.

Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). Thus, we constructed the active mutant of SGK and myr-SGK and investigated whether these SGK mutants can exert the same actions as myr-Akt. This is the first report clearly demonstrating the different roles of Akt and SGK. In addition, interestingly, these differences are attributable not to the presence or absence of the PH domain responsible for membrane targeting, but very possibly to differences in the substrate specificities of the kinase domains of SGK and Akt. Antibodies—Anti-Myc tag (clone 9E10), anti-phospho-Ser21 GSK3α, and anti-SGK antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-Akt and anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Cell Culture—Hepatocytes were isolated from fasted rats by collagenase perfusion as described previously (23Ogihara T. Asano T. Ando K. Chiba Y. Sakoda H. Anai M. Shojima N. Ono H. Onishi Y. Fujishiro M. Katagiri H. Fukushima Y. Kikuchi M. Noguchi N. Aburatani H. Komuro I. Fujita T.

After a 6-h attachment period, hepatocytes were transfected using adenoviral gene transfer. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% donor calf serum (Invitrogen) under a 10% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. 2 days after the fibroblasts reached confluence, differentiation was induced by incubating the cells for 48 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mmol/liter 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 4 mg/ml dexamethasone. Thereafter, the cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for an additional 4–10 days; once >90% of the cells expressed the adipocyte phenotype, the cells were used for experimentation. 32D cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FCS and 0.25 ng/ml murine IL-3 (24Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Imai Y. Ogawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1998; 92: 4003-4012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS. Each cDNA was transfected into NIH3T3 cells with an expression vector (pCAGGs), and the permanently expressing clones were selected in DMEM containing 500 mg/liter Geneticin. Construction of SGK Mutants and myr-Akt—3A-SGK, a dominant-negative form of SGK, was constructed by substituting lysine 127, threonine 256, and serine 422 with alanines. d-SGK was constructed by substituting serine 422 with aspartic acid. myr-SGK contains an src myristoylation signal sequence at the N terminus. MAA-Akt, a dominant-negative form of Akt, was constructed by substituting lysine 179, threonine 308, and serine 473 with alanines. myr-Akt, which contains an src myristoylation signal sequence, was described previously (25Sakoda H.

All the constructs were designed to contain a Myc tag at the C terminus, and their structures are shown in Fig. 1. Recombinant adenoviruses were generated, purified, and concentrated using cesium chloride ultracentrifugation as reported previously (26Katagiri H. Asano T. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Shibasaki Y.

Equal amounts of Akt and SGK were overexpressed throughout all of the experiments. Gene Transfer into Each Cell Type—For gene transfer into hepatocytes, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 1.0 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml recombinant adenovirus, after which the virus-containing medium was replaced with normal growth medium. Glycogen synthase assays were performed 36 h later. For gene transfer into 3T3-L1 adipocytes, cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing recombinant adenovirus. Experiments were performed 2 days later. 32D cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing recombinant adenovirus. 24 h after adenoviral gene transfer, the cells were IL-3-starved for an additional 24 h, and then DNA synthesis assays were performed. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes and 32D cells, all recombinant adenoviruses were used at a concentration of 3.0 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml. Under these conditions, none of the cells infected with LacZ exhibited significant differences in glycogen synthesis or glucose transport activity compared with non-infected cells, and 95∼100% of the cells were infected as judged by blue coloration after 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) incubation 36∼48 h after infection. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—The cells were collected and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mmol/liter dithiothreitol. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (27Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Anai M. Fujishiro M. Ono H. Onishi Y. Katagiri H. Abe M. Fukushima Y. Shojima N. Inukai K. Kikuchi M. Oka Y.

Glycogen Synthase Assay—After 3 h of serum starvation, cells in 25-cm2 flasks were stimulated with or without 100 nm insulin for 30 min. The cells were homogenized in homogenizing buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaF. 50 μg of liver samples were then assayed in glycogen synthase buffer containing 8.9 mm UDP-[6-3H]glucose (1 Ci/mmol) in the absence or presence of 10 mm Glu-6-P for 20 min at 30 °C. UDP-[6-3H]glucose incorporation into glycogen was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Glucose Transport Assay—3T3-L1 adipocytes in 24-well culture dishes were serum-starved for 3 h in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. They were next incubated for 45 min in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (137 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2) and then incubated with or without 100 nm insulin for 15 min. Basal and stimulated uptakes of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose were then measured as described previously (28Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Anai M. Funaki M. Inukai K. Katagiri H. Fukushima Y. Onishi Y. Ono H.

DNA Synthesis Assay—32D cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 0.25 ng/ml IL-3. After incubation in IL-3-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h, the cells were incubated with BrdUrd labeling solution for 6 h. BrdUrd incorporation was measured using the BrdUrd labeling and detection kit III (Roche Applied Science) (44Glowacki J. Mizuno S. Greenberger J.S.

Soft Agar Assays—For the soft agar assay, cells of each transfected derivative were trypsinized, suspended in DMEM containing 0.3% agar and 20% FCS, and plated onto a bottom layer containing 0.6% agar. Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/3.5-cm dish, and colonies >0.5 mm in diameter were counted after 14 days (29Kurokawa M. Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16870-16876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All procedures were performed in three independent experiments, and similar results were obtained. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Comparisons were made using unpaired Student's t test. Values of p <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Effect of SGK or Akt Overexpression on Glucose Transport— WT-Akt, MAA-Akt, myr-Akt, WT-SGK, 3A-SGK, and myr-SGK were overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Immunoblotting with anti-Myc tag antibody revealed the expression levels of Akt and SGK and their mutants to be comparable (Fig. 2A, first panel). In addition, the expression levels of WT-Akt, MAA-Akt, and myr-Akt were approximately five times those of endogenously expressed Akt judging from the immunoblotting results using anti-Akt antibody (Fig. 2A, second panel), and basal phosphorylation was observed in myr-Akt (third panel). On the other hand, endogenously expressed SGK was not detectable in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, whereas overexpressed WT-SGK, 3A-SGK, and myr-SGK were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A, fourth panel). Increased phosphorylation of GSK3 was observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing myr-Akt, d-SGK, and myr-SGK, whereas overexpression of wild-type and dominant-negative mutants of Akt and SGK did not increase GSK3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, fifth panel). Finally, interestingly, although 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose uptake into 3T3-L1 adipocytes was increased 8-fold by overexpression of myr-Akt compared with that of LacZ, d-SGK or myr-SGK overexpression had essentially no effect on 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose uptake (Fig. 2B). Effect of SGK or Akt Overexpression on Phosphorylation of GSK3 and Glycogen Synthesis—To confirm that phosphorylated GSK3 elevates glycogen synthesis irrespective of whether Akt or SGK phosphorylates GSK3, active mutants of Akt (myr-Akt) and SGK (d-SGK and myr-SGK) were overexpressed in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. The expression levels of myr-Akt, D-SGK, and myr-SGK were comparable, as shown by immunoblotting using anti-Myc tag antibody (Fig. 3A). Similar to the observations in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, overexpression of these active mutants of Akt and SGK induced an apparent increase in phosphorylation of GSK3, as did insulin stimulation (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3C, glycogen synthase activity was shown to be significantly increased (∼1.5-fold) either by 30 min of stimulation with insulin or by overexpression of myr-Akt, d-SGK, or myr-SGK compared with the control. Thus, it is clear that phosphorylation of GSK3 results in the elevation of glycogen synthesis irrespective of phosphorylation by either Akt or SGK. Effect of SGK or Akt Overexpression on DNA Synthesis—WT-Akt, MAA-Akt, myr-Akt, WT-SGK, 3A-SGK, and myr-SGK were overexpressed in 32D cells by adenoviral transfer so that their expression levels were similar (Fig. 4A), and the effects on DNA synthesis were examined by measuring BrdUrd incorporation. Because 32D is an IL-3-dependent cell line, removal of IL-3 from the medium reportedly induces apoptosis, which can be shown to be the result of suppressed DNA synthesis. Overexpression of myr-Akt, D-SGK, and myr-SGK induced GSK3 phosphorylation to a similar degree, whereas that of WT-Akt, MAA-Akt, WT-SGK, and 3A-SGK did not (Fig. 4B). However, interestingly, overexpression of only myr-Akt significantly enhanced the protection from apoptosis achieved by lack of IL-3 (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, overexpression of d-SGK or myr-SGK had no inhibitory effect on apoptosis, despite phosphorylation of GSK3. myr-Akt Overexpression Alone Can Transform NIH3T3 Cells—Finally, we analyzed the transforming ability of Akt and SGK by evaluating the capacity for anchorage-independent growth. NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with either Akt or SGK constructs were seeded in DMEM containing 0.3% agar and 20% FCS, and colony formation was estimated as a representative of anchorage-independent growth ability. Three independent experiments were performed using three different clones of each derivative, and a representative one is shown in Fig. 5 (A and B). Stable expression of Akt and SGK constructs was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc tag, anti-Akt, and anti-SGK antibodies (Fig. 5B). Similar to observations in cells transiently overexpressing Akt or SGK due to adenoviral transfer, stable overexpression of myr-Akt, D-SGK, and myr-SGK significantly increased the phosphorylation level of GSK3, whereas that of other constructs did not. These cells were subjected to soft agar assay to evaluate their transforming activity. As shown in Fig. 5B (middle panel), myr-Akt-expressing cells formed many macroscopic colonies within 14 days after being seeded. In contrast, although d-SGK- and myr-SGK-expressing cells showed phosphorylation of GSK3, they apparently could not make colonies (Fig. 5B, upper and lower panels). The colonies (counted from the three independent clones for each of the Akt and SGK constructs) are shown as bar graphs in Fig. 5C. Numerous serine/threonine kinases exist in the cell, and they play specific roles by inducing individual cellular functions. As to the molecular mechanisms underlying the various roles of each kinase protein, the substrate specificity of the kinase domain and subcellular distribution are considered to be major contributors. SGK and Akt are considered to be very similar kinase proteins, both of which belong to the AGC family. They are activated via phosphorylation by PDK1 and PDK2, located downstream from PI 3-kinase. However, the presence and absence of a PH domain in Akt and SGK, respectively, should result in different subcellular distributions of these two kinases. In the case of Akt, Akt translocates to the membrane fraction via binding of the PH domain with PI-3,4,5-P3 produced by PI 3-kinase, and phosphorylation of Thr306 and Ser473 of Akt by PDK1 and PDK2 takes place, thereby activating Akt kinase (30Burgering B.M.

Then, Akt phosphorylates several substrates that transmit signals (6Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). In this study, to investigate the different roles of Akt and SGK, active as well as membrane-targeted active mutants of these kinases were overexpressed. Previous studies have established the functions induced by and the roles of activated Akt, and all or most of these cellular actions, for which Akt is reportedly responsible, are indeed induced by overexpression of myr-Akt (33Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Thus, although this study was carried out employing an overexpression system, the cellular actions described herein are considered to be physiological functions induced by Akt. For example, it is well established that Akt plays a major role in glucose metabolism, including increased glycogen synthase and GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, functions that can be induced by overexpressing myr-Akt (10Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 11Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Indeed, translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane is suggested to be important for glucose transport. In addition, the oncogenic activity of Akt is also well known since v-Akt has been identified as an oncogenic protein, and this promotion of cell growth activity is similarly observed upon overexpression of myr-Akt (38Aoki M. Batista O. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14950-14955Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 39Sun M. Wang G. Paciga J.E. Feldman R.I. Yuan Z.Q.

We obtained two important conclusions from this comparative study of SGK and Akt mutants. The first is that SGK can mediate GSK3 phosphorylation and the resultant glycogen synthesis, but not other cellular functions induced by Akt such as increased glucose transport, inhibition of apoptosis, and oncogenic transformation. Thus, it is possible that increased expression of SGK inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt and the resultant cellular functions such as increased glucose transport, inhibition of apoptosis, and cell proliferation because these two kinases are similarly phosphorylated by PDK1 and PDK2. Conversely, an increase in SGK may contribute to increased glycogen synthesis by increasing the phosphorylation of GSK3. In addition, a previous report showed that overexpression of the myristoylated and PH domain-deleted form of Akt induces an increase in glucose transport activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (10Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Therefore, these different roles of the two kinases are apparently not attributable to membrane-targeting ability or an unidentified mechanism of signal transduction from the PH domain, caused by the presence or absence of the PH domain, because myristoylated and PH domain-deleted Akt, but not myr-SGK, enhanced glucose transport, inhibition of apoptosis, and cell proliferation. GSK3 is well established as a regulator of glycogen metabolism (22Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar, 40Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 41Cohen P. Frame S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27497-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Many proteins in this family are related to protein synthesis. Wnt signaling and transcription factors have been reported to be substrates of GSK3, and Somervaille et al. (43Somervaille T.C. Linch D.C. Khwaja A. Blood. 2001; 98: 1374-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) described GSK3 and Bax as being involved in the suppression of apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal. However, our results suggest that GSK3 is very likely to be independent of Akt-induced cellular actions such as increased glucose transport, inhibition of apoptosis, and cell proliferation. As discussed above, the different cellular functions induced by Akt and SGK cannot be attributed to the difference in membrane targeting through the PH domain. Although it has been reported that substrate specificities for synthetic peptides differ minimally between Akt and SGK based on an in vitro experiment using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and synthetic peptides (16Casamayor A. Torrance P.D. Kobayashi T. Thorner J. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 186-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we speculate that considerable differences in terms of in vivo substrate specificity exist between these kinases, which account for the apparent differences in the roles of Akt and SGK. In other words, there may be some unidentified proteins phosphorylated by Akt, but not by SGK, that play key roles in glucose transport and anti-apoptotic effects, whereas GSK3 plays only minor roles in these functions. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time an important difference between Akt and SGK and that this difference is not due to membrane localization, but rather possibly to the difference in their kinase activities. The identification of substrates selectively phosphorylated by Akt, but not by SGK, may provide clues to clarifying the pathway leading from Akt activation to the aforementioned cellular activities."

We optimized conditions of isolation and refolding of bacterially expressed uncoupling proteins and reexamined the transport properties and regulation of bacterially expressed UCP1, -2, and -3 reconstituted in liposomes. We show for the first time that ATP inhibits UCP1, -2, and -3 with similar affinities. The K i values for ATP inhibition were 50 μm (UCP1), 70 μm (UCP2), and 120 μm (UCP3) at pH 7.2. These affinities for ATP are similar to those obtained with native UCP1 isolated from brown adipose tissue mitochondria (K i = 65 μm at pH 7.2). The V max values for proton transport were also similar among the UCPs, ranging from 8 to 20 μmol·min–1·mg–1, depending on experimental conditions. We also examined the effect of coenzyme Q on fatty acid-catalyzed proton flux in liposomes containing recombinant UCP1, -2, and -3. We found that coenzyme Q had no effect on the fatty acid-dependent proton transport catalyzed by any of the UCPs nor did it affect nucleotide regulation of the UCPs. We conclude that coenzyme Q is not a cofactor of UCP-mediated proton transport.

The anionic detergent sarcosyl was used to extract the proteins from inclusion bodies, and reconstitutively active UCP2 and -3 were obtained by dialysis of the extract in the presence of non-ionic detergent (octylpentaoxyethylene) and phospholipids. We showed that UCP2 and -3 were qualitatively identical in their transport and regulatory behavior to native UCP1. We noted, however, that the affinities of UCP2 and -3 for ATP were 5–10-fold lower than those for reconstituted, native UCP1 (28Jabůrek M. Varecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Jezek P. Zhang M. Burn P.

This raised the question of whether our protocols were yielding UCPs with true native function. To address this question, we turned our attention to recombinant UCP1. The properties of native UCP1 are well established, and a successful reconstitution protocol for recombinant proteins should reproduce those properties. We now report conditions of isolation and refolding of bacterially expressed UCP1 that lead to reconstitutively active protein that behaves identically to native UCP1. Using these protocols, we show for the first time that ATP inhibits UCP1, -2, and -3 with similar affinities. These experiments were carried out in the absence of coenzyme Q 10, which has been reported to be “obligatory” for UCP function (29Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Frischmuth K. Klingenberg M. Proc. Natl.

We examined the effects of CoQ and its solvent, dichloromethane, on FA-catalyzed proton flux in liposomes containing UCP1, -2, and -3. We found that CoQ had no effect whatever on FA-dependent proton transport catalyzed by the UCPs or on ATP regulation of the UCPs. Dichloromethane, however, had profound effects on the liposomes, as is expected of such a strong solvent. 2A preliminary report of these results was presented in abstract form (41Jabůrek M. Jezek P.

Transformed cells were grown in the presence of carbenicillin (0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for several hours until A 600 reached 0.3–0.4. The expression of UCPs was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and incubation was continued at 30 °C for 3 h. Cells were lysed in a French press, and inclusion bodies were isolated and stored at –80 °C as previously described (28Jabůrek M. Varecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Jezek P. Zhang M. Burn P.

Extraction of UCP1, -2, and -3 from Inclusion Bodies—The pelleted inclusion bodies (about 2 mg of protein) were washed 2 times in sodium salts of 0.15 m phosphate, 25 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% sodium lauroylsarcosinate (sarcosyl), pH 7.8, and centrifuged 14,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of 50 mm CAPS, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 2% sarcosyl, pH 10.0, adjusted by Tris. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the extract was centrifuged 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove unsolubilized particles. The supernatant was diluted rapidly in 6 ml of 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-114, and 1 mm ATP. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. To remove sarcosyl, the extract was either dialyzed (see “Results”) or passed through a 2.5-ml Dowex 11A8 column (flow rate 0.5 ml/min). The collected protein was supplemented with 5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine and 1 mm ATP. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the extract was concentrated 2-fold in an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore). 1-ml aliquots were stored at –20 °C. Purification of Recombinant UCP1, -2, and -3 on Hydroxyapatite (HTP) Column—The extracted protein was dialyzed twice for 3 h and once overnight at 1:100 dilution against the internal medium (potassium salts of 50 mm TES, 80 mm SO42- ,2mm EDTA, pH 7.5). The dialyzed protein extract was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove any precipitate, and the supernatant was passed through 0.5 ml (0.12 g) of HTP (Bio-Gel column, Bio-Rad) that had been pre-equilibrated with internal medium. The flow-through was expected to contain properly folded uncoupling proteins. Isolation of UCP1 from Brown Adipose Tissue Mitochondria—UCP1 was purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes using previously described procedures (4Jabůrek M. Varecha M. Jezek P. Garlid K.D.

Briefly, frozen BAT mitochondria were first washed with additional bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml) and then extracted with octylpentaoxyethylene in the presence of phospholipids. UCP1 was purified on the HTP column in a medium composed of potassium salts of 50 mm TES, 25 mm SO42- , and 2 mm EDTA. The composition of phospholipids and internal medium were adjusted for subsequent reconstitution. Reconstitution of UCPs into Liposomes—Recombinant UCPs and native UCP1 were reconstituted in liposomes using previously described procedures (4Jabůrek M. Varecha M. Jezek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol.

Briefly, phospholipids (asolectin supplemented with 5% cardiolipin or 100% phosphatidylcholine) were dried under nitrogen and stored under vacuum overnight. The dried phospholipids were solubilized with detergent (C8E5), and protein and fluorescent probe were added. The protein/lipid mixture was incubated with Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) to remove detergent and form vesicles. The vesicles were passed through a Sephadex G-50–300 column to remove external probe. Protein-free liposomes were prepared using the same protocol. Fluorescence Measurements of Ion Fluxes—Ion fluxes in proteoliposomes were measured using an SLM Aminco 8000C spectrofluorometer. H+ ion fluxes were measured as changes in intraliposomal acid concentration, obtained from changes in SPQ fluorescence due to quenching by the anion of TES buffer (34Orosz D.E. Garlid K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Transport was driven by a K+ gradient initiated by the addition of 50 nm valinomycin. The proteoliposomes were studied at 0.5 mg/ml phospholipid in 2 ml of assay media at 25 °C. Each preparation was individually calibrated for fluorescence probe response, and the internal volume of vesicles was estimated from the volume of distribution of the fluorescent probe (33Garlid K.D. Sun X. Paucek P. Woldegiorgis G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 331-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The protein content in proteoliposomes was estimated by the Amido Black procedure (35Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Chemicals and Reagents—SPQ was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Asolectin (45% l-α-phosphatidylcholine) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Sulfuric acid was purchased from Fisher. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Optimizing Expression-Reconstitution Protocols for Recombinant UCPs—Our previous protocols enabled us to demonstrate that UCP2 and -3 catalyze FA-dependent, electrophoretic proton flux as well as electrophoretic flux of the FA analog, undecanesulfonate (28Jabůrek M. Varecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Jezek P. Zhang M. Burn P. Tartaglia L.A. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26003-26007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, ATP inhibition occurred with affinities that were10-fold lower than that for native UCP1 (28Jabůrek M. Varecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Jezek P. Zhang M. Burn P. Tartaglia L.A. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26003-26007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Because there are no standards of native activity for UCP2 and -3 in intact mitochondria, it was not possible to determine whether the altered affinities are due to biochemical differences in the protein or to artifacts arising from the method. We decided that the best way to address this question was to demonstrate that our protocols gave native function for recombinant UCP1, whose activities and regulation are well characterized. We expressed UCP1 in E. coli and carried out extraction-reconstitution using protocols adapted from those originally used for UCP2 and -3 (28Jabůrek M. Varecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Jezek P. Zhang M. Burn P. Tartaglia L.A. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26003-26007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 (squares) shows that this preparation also gave abnormally high K i values for ATP inhibition, about 480 μm. We therefore devoted our efforts to developing a protocol that would yield normal ATP affinity for bacterially expressed reconstituted UCP1. We found that the affinity for ATP improved with extended dialysis, the K i decreasing to 190 μm after a total of 44 h of dialysis (Fig. 1, circles). This finding suggested that sarcosyl may decrease the affinity of UCPs for nucleotides and that residual sarcosyl was being removed by prolonged dialysis, albeit with low efficiency. Therefore we introduced an additional treatment with a Dowex anion exchange column to improve sarcosyl removal. This approach was successful. The affinities for ATP of Dowex-treated, bacterially expressed UCP1 were nearly identical to those of native UCP1, with observed K i values of 50 μm (Fig. 1, triangles) and 65 μm (Fig. 1, crosses), respectively. We also added an HTP column purification step to meet recent criteria for isolation of bacterially expressed UCPs (36Jekabsons M.B. Echtay K.S. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 565-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the known behavior of native BAT UCP1, the properly folded UCPs were expected to pass through the HTP and collect in the flow-through. The recovery of protein after HTP treatment is summarized in Table I. The yield of the flow-through fraction after HTP treatment ranged from 40 to 60%. Our previous protocol (28Jabůrek M. Varecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Jezek P. Zhang M. Burn P. Tartaglia L.A. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26003-26007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) yielded about 20% recovery of UCP2 and UCP3 after the HTP treatment (not shown). The HTP treatment had no additional effect on the affinity of UCP1 for ATP, but it improved the apparent purity of all three UCPs, as judged by a 50% increase in the protein-specific transport rates (not shown).Table IProtein recovery after dialysis and HTP purificationStarting proteinDialyzed extractHTP flow-throughHTP recoveryμgμgμg%UCP1317 ± 54299 ± 55171 ± 4457UCP2318 ± 35279 ± 28114 ± 3441UCP3308 ± 34302 ± 34124 ± 1041 Open table in a new tab ATP Regulation of UCP1, -2, and -3—We next applied the new protocol to reconstitution of recombinant UCP2 and -3. We measured inhibition by ATP under the same conditions as those used for the UCP1 experiments of Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows that the protocol applied to UCP2 (Fig. 2, circles) and UCP3 (Fig. 2, triangles) now yields proteins with similar affinities for ATP. In three independent experiments, the K i values were 70 μm ± 8 μm (mean ± S.D.) for UCP2, 114 μm ± 17 μm for UCP3, and 56 μm ± 8 μm for bacterially expressed UCP1, respectively. This new result shows that UCP1, -2, and -3 have similar affinities for ATP. Fatty Acid-dependent Proton Transport Mediated by UCP1, -2, and -3—It is important to note that the new protocols had no effect on H+ flux catalyzed by UCP2 and -3, and we obtained the same results as were reported previously (28Jabůrek M. Varecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Jezek P. Zhang M. Burn P. Tartaglia L.A. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26003-26007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Our previous experiments were carried out at pH 7.2 in vesicles composed of soy bean phospholipids supplemented with 5% cardiolipin, which provide a complex lipid environment. Because we wished to evaluate the effects of CoQ, we also carried out experiments at pH 6.8 in phosphatidylcholine vesicles, conditions similar to those used by Echtay et al. (29Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Frischmuth K. Klingenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1416-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 30Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Nature. 2000; 408: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The representative ion flux traces in Fig. 3 show that bacterially expressed UCP1 catalyzes FA-dependent, electrophoretic proton flux in the absence of CoQ when reconstituted in the phosphatidylcholine vesicles. Laurate induces a strong H+ flux (Fig. 3, trace a) that is sensitive to ATP (trace b), being maximally inhibited by ATP on both sides of the membrane (trace c). The partial inhibition (about 50%) by external ATP demonstrates the random orientation of the nucleotide binding sites of reconstituted UCP1, which we always observe. The transport rates with 100 μm laurate in the absence of ATP were about 10 μmol·min–1·mg–1 protein. This rate was about half of that observed with native UCP1 when flux was measured in the opposite direction (2Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modrianský M. Vassanelli S. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This effect is due to a smaller gradient for K+ efflux than for K+ influx. Entirely similar results were obtained with UCP2 and -3 (not shown). Importantly, these experiments, like all our previous experiments, were carried out without added CoQ. They show that CoQ is not obligatory for UCP function and confirm our published finding that bacterially expressed uncoupling proteins catalyze FA-dependent, ATP-sensitive H+ transport in the absence of CoQ. Our flux measurements are supported by extensive control experiments. We routinely measured fluxes in pure liposomes (Fig. 3, trace d), and we observed that these fluxes were nearly identical with fluxes observed in proteoliposomes containing UCP with ATP present on both sides of the membrane (Fig. 3, trace c). We also controlled for valinomycin concentration by titrating valinomycin at constant concentrations of fatty acid in both liposomes and in proteoliposomes containing UCP. This allows us to quantitate nonspecific proton transport and to choose the correct amount of valinomycin that supports the maximal ATP-sensitive rate. We find this value to be 40–80 nm (80–160 pmol·mg–1 lipid). This value is more than 20 times lower than the valinomycin concentrations used by Echtay et al. (29Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Frischmuth K. Klingenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1416-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 30Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Klingenberg M. Nature. 2000; 408: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, concentrations of valinomycin above 200 pmol·mg–1 lipid resulted in massive protein-independent fluxes, which may be due to ion pair transport of the FA anion-K+-valinomycin complex. The ATP-sensitive proton flux rates observed in our laboratory had a V max for UCP1 up to 20 μmol of H+ min–1·mg–1 protein (4Jabůrek M. Varecha M. Jezek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31897-31905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a number that is in excellent agreement with observations in BAT mitochondria. Sundin et al. (37Sundin U. Moore G. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: R822-R832PubMed Google Scholar) measured 42 μg of UCP1/mg of hamster BAT mitochondria. The UCP1-dependent respiration when oxidizing FA was 85 ng atoms of O min–1·mg–1 protein, which converts to 850 nmol of H+ min–1·mg–1 protein. Thus, hamster BAT mitochondria also exhibit a V max of about 20 μmol of H+ min–1·mg–1 protein. The effects of Coenzyme Q 10 on UCP1, -2, and -3 Transport and Regulation—The traces in Fig. 4 show the effects of adding CoQ dissolved in dichloromethane to the assay, as was done by Echtay et al. (29Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Frischmuth K. Klingenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1416-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Trace a is from a control in the absence of CoQ or dichloromethane. Trace b shows the effect of CoQ addition, which indeed caused a large increase of H+ flux. Trace c shows that an identical increase in proton flux was caused by adding the solvent without CoQ. We obtained identical results with reconstituted recombinant UCP2 and -3 (not shown). Dichloromethane is very hydrophobic and almost insoluble in water. Most of the added solvent will go into the lipid bilayer, and it is not surprising that it has profound effects. It is surprising that Echtay et al. (29Echtay K.S. Winkler E. Frischmuth K. Klingenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1416-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) did not report any controls for solvent effects. To determine whether CoQ had any effects on UCP activity, we compared the ATP-sensitive FA-dependent H+ fluxes in the presence and absence of CoQ and dichloromethane. We varied the concentration of CoQ from 2.5 to 25 nmol·mg–1 lipid and the corresponding amount of solvent from 0.05 to 0.5% in the 2 ml of assay. As shown in Fig. 5, there was no difference between the presence (Fig. 5, filled symbols) and absence (Fig. 5, open symbols) of CoQ in these assays; all of the effect was caused by the solvent at all doses tested. Moreover, the results show that CoQ-dichloromethane caused a partial inhibition of ATP-sensitive proton flux at concentrations higher than 10 nmol CoQ·mg–1 lipid. These results show that the increased fluxes in the presence of CoQ or dichloromethane were not caused by an increased activity of the protein but most likely by a solvent-induced increase in the proton permeability of the vesicles. We further evaluated the effects of dichloromethane in the experiments of Fig. 6, which were carried out in protein-free liposomes. It can be seen that small amounts of the solvent caused large increases in the proton permeability of vesicles when FA and valinomycin were present. This liposome control of the effect of dichloromethane was also not reported in Echtay et"
https://openalex.org/W2004018202,"Abstract Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially fatal pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle that segregates with >60 mutations within the MHS-1 locus on chromosome 19 coding for ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1). Although some MHRyR1s have been shown to enhance sensitivity to caffeine and halothane when expressed in non-muscle cells, their influence on EC coupling can only be studied in skeletal myotubes. We therefore expressed WTRyR1, six of the most common human MHRyR1s (R163C, G341R, R614C, R2163C, V2168M, and R2458H), and a newly identified C-terminal mutation (T4826I) in dyspedic myotubes to study their functional defects and how they influence EC coupling. Myotubes expressing any MHRyR1 were significantly more sensitive to stimulation by caffeine and 4-CmC than those expressing WTRyR1. The hypersensitivity of MH myotubes extended to K+ depolarization. MH myotubes responded to direct channel activators with maximum Ca2+ amplitudes consistently smaller than WT myotubes, whereas the amplitude of their responses to depolarization were consistently larger than WT myotubes. The magnitudes of responses attainable from myotubes expressing MHRyR1s are therefore related to the nature of the stimulus rather than size of the Ca2+ store. The functional changes of MHRyR1s were directly analyzed using [3H]ryanodine binding analysis of isolated myotube membranes. Although none of the MHRyR1s examined significantly altered EC50 for Ca2+ activation, many failed to be completely inhibited by a low Ca2+ (≤100 nm), and all were significantly more responsive to caffeine than WTRyR1 at Ca2+ concentrations that approximate those in resting myotubes. All seven mutations had diminished sensitivity to inhibition by Ca2+ and Mg2+. Using a homologous expression system, our study demonstrates for the first time that these 7 MH mutations are all both necessary and sufficient to induce MH-related phenotypes. Decreased sensitivity to Ca2+ and Mg2+ inhibition and inability of MHRyR1s to be fully inactivated at [Ca2+]i typical of normal myotubes at rest are key defects that contribute to the initiation of MH episodes."

In addition, L-selectin interacts with the dimeric mucin P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) expressed on leukocytes. PSGL-1 lacks 6-sulfo-sLex but contains sulfated tyrosine residues (Tyr-SO3)at positions 46, 48, and 51 and sLex in a core 2-based O-glycan (C2-O-sLex) on Thr at position 57. The role of tyrosine sulfation and core 2 O-glycans in binding of PSGL-1 to L-selectin is not well defined. Here, we show that L-selectin binds to a glycosulfopeptide (GSP-6) modeled after the extreme N terminus of human PSGL-1, containing three Tyr-SO3 and a nearby Thr modified with C2-O-sLex. Leukocytes roll on immobilized GSP-6 in an L-selectin-dependent manner, and rolling is dependent on Tyr-SO3 and C2-O-sLex on GSP-6.

All three Tyr-SO3 residues of GSP-6 are required for high affinity binding to L-selectin. Low affinity binding to mono- and disulfated GSPs is largely independent of the position of the Tyr-SO3 residues, except for some binding preference for an isomer sulfated on both Tyr-48 and -51.

To date, however, detailed biochemical binding studies have only been carried out for P-selectin and PSGL-1. These studies have shown that P-selectin binds to the extreme N terminus of PSGL-1 by interacting stereospecifically with clustered tyrosine sulfates (Tyr-SO3- ) and a nearby core 2 O-glycan with a sialyl Lewis x (sLex; Siaα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1-R) epitope (C2-O-sLex) (17Leppanen A.

The use of synthetic glycosulfopeptides modeled after the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 was a key factor in elucidating the molecular requirements for P-selectin binding (17Leppanen A. White S.P.

By contrast, the interaction between L-selectin and PSGL-1 has been studied less directly with blocking monoclonal antibodies and site-directed mutagenesis of recombinant PSGL-1. Early studies with blocking monoclonal antibodies indicated that L-selectin, like P-selectin, bound to the extreme N terminus of PSGL-1 (10Walcheck B. Moore K.L. McEver R.P. Kishimoto T.K. J. Clin.

However, L-selectin does bind to sulfated carbohydrate ligands on various HEV mucins, such as 6-sulfo-sLex (Siaα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)(6-sulfo)GlcNAcβ1-R), an epitope recognized by the mAb MECA-79 (8Hemmerich S.

Surprisingly, a recent study of cells expressing recombinant PSGL-1 suggested that PSGL-1 requires 6-sulfo-sLex determinants rather than tyrosine sulfation to support L-selectin-dependent leukocyte rolling (24Kanamori A.

This contrasts with earlier observations that L-selectin binds poorly to recombinant PSGL-1 in which the tyrosines are replaced with phenylalanines (25Bernimoulin M.P. Zeng X.L. Abbal C. Giraud S.

It has also been proposed that L-selectin recognizes nonsulfated sLex on both core 2 and extended core 1 O-glycans (26Mitoma J. Petryniak B. Hiraoka N. Yeh J.C. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9953-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have suggested that Thr-57 is the key O-glycosylation site on PSGL-1 for binding to L-selectin (25Bernimoulin M.P. Zeng X.L. Abbal C. Giraud S. Martinez M. Michielin O.

McEver R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13771-13776Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to directly measure the importance of tyrosine sulfation and O-glycosylation at Thr-57 for binding of L-selectin to PSGL-1, utilizing synthetic glyco-(sulfo)peptides (GSPs) modeled after the N terminus of human PSGL-1, and to measure the binding affinity between the GSPs and L-selectin. To this end, we synthesized a set of GSPs containing one, two, three, or no sulfated tyrosine residues and C2-O-sLex at Thr-57. This approach not only allowed us to study the role of tyrosine sulfation but also the stereospecific contribution of individual Tyr-SO3- residues for binding to L-selectin. We also synthesized GSPs containing three Tyr-SO3- residues and a modified O-glycan at Thr-57 to study the role of specific monosaccharide residues of C2-O-sLex, of sialylated polyfucosylated polylactosamine O-glycan and of sialyl Lewis x on extended core 1 O-glycan (C1-O-sLex) for binding to L-selectin. The interaction of L-selectin with GSPs was studied using multiple approaches, including a fluorescence-based solid phase assay, equilibrium gel filtration, and in vitro rolling experiments. Our results demonstrate that L-selectin binds with relatively high affinity to GSPs that contain sulfate on all three tyrosines and that present sLex on a core 2 rather than on an extended core 1 O-glycan. Enzymatic Synthesis of Glycosulfopeptides—Glyco(sulfo)peptide precursors corresponding to amino acid residues 45–61 of human PSGL-1 with a GalNAcα residue at Thr-57 and no, one, two or three Tyr-SO3- residues (Tyr-46, -48, and 51) were synthesized on an automated peptide synthesizer as described (17Leppanen A.

Recombinant Selectin-Ig Chimeras—The vectors that were used to express soluble P- and L-selectin-Ig chimeric proteins were a gift from Dr. Ajit Varki (University of California, San Diego) (28Koenig A.

Some control peptides were not sulfated (GP-6 and GP-4). Incompletely glycosylated but fully sulfated GSPs were derivatives of GSP-6 (DS-GSP-6, GSP-5, and GSP-1). Fully sulfated C1-GSP-6 and nonsulfated C1-GP-6 were isomers of GSP-6 and GP-6, respectively, containing the sLex epitope on an extended core 1 branch instead of a core 2 branch. L-selectin Binds to Immobilized GSP-6 and Binding Affinity Is Dependent on the Ligand Density—We first used a newly developed and sensitive fluorescence-based solid phase assay to compare the relative binding affinities of L-selectin and P-selectin to GSP-6. Biotinylated GSP-6 (0.25–10 pmol/well) was first captured quantitatively on streptavidin-coated 96-well plates. Different amounts of L-sel-Ig or P-sel-Ig were incubated in the wells, and bound L-sel-Ig and P-sel-Ig were detected with fluorescently labeled anti-human IgG. At the highest GSP-6 coating density (10 pmol/well), binding of L-sel-Ig to GSP-6 increased linearly with increased concentration of L-sel-Ig, reaching a plateau at 10–30 μg/ml of L-sel-Ig (Fig. 2A). However, at lower GSP-6 densities, no plateau was observed even at the highest concentrations of L-sel-Ig. This shows that the affinity of L-sel-Ig for immobilized GSP-6 is dependent on the ligand density. By contrast, P-sel-Ig generated a saturated binding curve with all GSP-6 coating densities used (Fig. 2B), indicating that the affinity of P-sel-Ig for GSP-6 is less dependent on the density of the immobilized ligand. L-selectin Binds to Immobilized GSP-6 with ∼10-fold Reduced Affinity Compared with P-selectin at Physiological Salt Concentration—Binding affinities of L-sel-Ig and P-sel-Ig for immobilized GSP-6 were first compared using the fluorescence-based solid phase assay. Biotinylated GSP-6 was immobilized on streptavidin-coated plates at different densities, and fixed concentrations of L-sel-Ig (10 μg/ml) and P-sel-Ig (5 μg/ml) were incubated with wells containing varying amounts of GSP-6. Binding of L-sel-Ig to increasing densities of GSP-6 formed a semi-sigmoidal binding curve (Fig. 3A), suggesting that L-sel-Ig binding to immobilized GSP-6 may be cooperative. By contrast, P-sel-Ig bound to GSP-6 forming a typical rectangular hyperbola binding curve (Fig. 3B). Comparison of the GSP-6 densities that give half-maximal binding for L-sel-Ig (∼10 pmol) and P-sel-Ig (∼1 pmol) indicates that L-sel-Ig has ∼10-fold lower affinity for immobilized"

SK channels are voltage-independent and activated by elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels that occur during an action potential. In many neurons, SK channels remain open after the action potential and contribute to a post-hyperpolarization, thereby influencing interspike interval and burst duration (1Alger B.E. Nicoll R.A.

SK1, 2, and 3, are expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, whereas expression of the structurally and functionally similar intermediate conductance channel, IK1, is limited to peripheral tissues (10Kohler M.

SK and IK channel α subunits share the serpentine architecture of voltage-gated K+ channels, each bearing six transmembrane domains, with the N and C termini residing within the cell. The SK subunits are highly homologous but vary in their extreme N- and C-terminal domains. The only striking primary sequence homology between SK channel subunits and other K+ channels is in the pore region located between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains. Functional SK channels are heteromeric complexes of four pore-forming α subunits and calmodulin (CaM) that mediates Ca2+ gating. In inside-out patches containing cloned SK channels, Ca2+-dependent gating persists in the absence of applied CaM, suggesting that CaM is constitutively bound to the native complex (13Xia X.-M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies are consistent with this model and have shown that the interaction occurs at the CaM binding domain (CaMBD), a highly conserved stretch of 92 amino acids residing in the proximal region of the intracellular C terminus of the α subunits (14Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wissmann R. Bildl W. Neumann H.

The structure of the complex between the CaMBD and Ca2+-CaM partitions CaM into distinct functional domains. Through interactions with the CaMBD, CaM adopts an extended conformation with the globular N- and C-lobes that harbor the E-F hand motifs separated by an elongated linker region. Ca2+ binding to the N-lobe E-F hands 1 and 2 of CaM is necessary and sufficient for Ca2+ gating (14Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B.

Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Residues in the linker domain and the C-lobe maintain Ca2+-independent interactions, including salt bridges between Arg-464 and Lys-467 on the CaMBD and Glu-84 and Glu-87 on CaM. Indeed, the spatial orientation of the residues in E-F hands 3 and 4, usually the higher affinity Ca2+ binding sites, is disrupted by extensive interactions with CaMBD residues and cannot adopt a chelating configuration. Therefore, it is likely that these interactions account for the constitutive association between the proteins (16Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The constitutive association between the channel subunits and CaM permits rapid gating in response to Ca2+ (13Xia X.-M.

Physiol. 1998; 111: 565-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To determine whether the constitutive association between the CaMBD and CaM is required for SK channel gating, mutations that disrupt the constitutive interaction were introduced into SK2. Expression studies show that SK channels can undergo Ca2+-CaM-dependent gating in the absence of a constitutive association with CaM. Surprisingly, Ca2+-independent interactions with CaM are required for cell surface expression of SK channels. Molecular Biology—Proteins expressed in transfected cells were cloned in the cytomegalovirus-based vector, pJPA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The tandem triple myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) was inserted at the S3-S4 loop of rSK2 using complementary oligonucleotides cloned into a BamHI site that had been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at position 246 of rSK2. All sequences were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Electrophysiology—COSm6 or HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were transfected with pJPA expression plasmids encoding CD4, the indicated SK2 channel, and CaM (ratios of DNAs were 1:8:8, respectively) using calcium phosphate for HEK293 cells or lipofection (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for COSm6 cells. Recordings were performed at room temperature 1–3 days after transfection. Transfected cells were identified by CD4 antibody-coated micorspheres (Dynabeads, M-450 CD4, Dynal, Oslo, Norway). When filled, pipettes prepared from thin-walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) had resistances of 1.8–3 MΩ. Voltage-clamp recordings were performed with an Axopatch-1B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Currents were filtered at 5 kHz (–3 db). For whole-cell recordings pipettes were filled with (in mm) 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, with pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH, after adding CaCl2 to 100 μm. The bath solution was 30 KCl, 110 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2 (with pH adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH). For excised patch recordings, the pipette solution was (in mm) 30 KOH, 120 NaOH, 10 HEPES, and 1 MgCl2, with pH adjusted to 7.2 with methanesulfonic acid. Excised patches were superfused with an intracellular solution containing (in mm): 150 KOH, 10 HEPES, and 1 EGTA, supplemented with CaCl2, with pH adjusted to 7.2 with methanesulfonic acid; the amount of CaCl2 required to yield the indicated concentrations was calculated according to Fabiato and Fabiato (1979). Current amplitudes were measured at –80 mV unless otherwise indicated. Rat CaM and the indicated mutants were cloned into pET23b, expressed in BL21 (DE3), and purified on a low substitution phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). CaMs were added to the bath solution at 10 μm immediately prior to use. The SK-MLCK M13 peptide (KRRWKKNFIAVSAANRFKKISSSGAL) was synthesized by Genemed Synthesis (South San Francisco, CA). Immunocytochemistry—COSm6 cells were grown to ∼15% confluency in a 60-mm dish on microscope cover glasses and incubated for 5 h with the transfection mixture of 2.75 μg of DNA (ratio of GFP:SK2: CaM, 1:5:5) in 1 ml of DMEM and 8 μl of DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) in another 1 ml of DMEM. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min prior to cell treatment. After transfection, cells were washed and fed with complete medium and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2. Immunocytochemistry was performed 1–2 days post-transfection. Non-permeabilized immunostaining was performed by incubating the cells at 37 °C with 1:250 dilution of anti-myc monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) in complete medium for 1 h. After three washes in complete medium and two washes in PBS+ (1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. After quenching with two washes with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS+, cells were washed once with PBS+. Nonspecific binding was then blocked by incubating the cells with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS+ at room temperature for 30 min. The excess BSA was removed, and the secondary antibody (1:500 dilution of Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (H+L), Vector, Burlingame, CA) was applied at 4 °C overnight. Cells were then washed three times with PBS+ and mounted (ProLong Antifade Kit, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for imaging. For permeabilized labeling, cells were washed with PBS+ and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing three times with ice-cold PBS+, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS+ at room temperature for 15 min. To remove excess Triton X-100, cells were washed five times with PBS+ at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was then blocked by incubating the cells with 10% BSA in PBS+ at room temperature for 30 min, and primary antibody was then added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The next day, the cells were washed and incubated with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed again, and mounting was performed as described for non-permeabilized cells. Images were acquired with epifluorescence using an optical microscope (Axioplan2, Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and the program OpenLab (Improvision, Lexington, MA). SK2:64/67 Channels Require Cotransfected CaM for Function—The crystal structure of the CaMBD·Ca2+-CaM complex from SK2 revealed strong electrostatic contacts between the SK channel CaMBD residues Arg-464 and Lys-467 and CaM Glu-84 and Glu-87 in the CaM linker region close to the C-lobe implicated in constitutive CaM binding (16Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, the CaMBD peptide harboring the double charge reversal R464E/K467E did not retain CaM in Ca2+-free pull-down assays, whereas the Ca2+-dependent interaction was still detected (14Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of the constitutive interaction between SK channels and CaM, whole-cell recordings were performed from cells transiently transfected with SK2 wild type or SK2:64/67 mutant channels, with or without cotransfected CaM (Fig. 1). Five minutes after whole-cell patch formation with Ca2+ (100 μm) in the patch pipette, cells transfected with wild type SK2 and recorded in asymmetrical K+ showed large currents (–4.4 ± 0.5 nA, n = 5, Fig. 1A) that were reversed in response to voltage ramp commands close to the predicted K+ reversal potential (–40 mV). Cotransfection with CaM did not obviously affect current responses (–4.4 ± 1.0 nA, n = 5, Fig. 1B). Point mutation charge reversals at either of Arg-464 or Lys-467 resulted in functional channels that were not obviously different from wild type (not shown), whereas only small currents that were not different from mock transfected cells were recorded from cells transfected with SK2:64/67 (–30.0 ± 10.0 pA, n = 5, Fig. 1C). However, when SK2:64/67 was cotransfected with CaM, robust currents were recorded within 1 min of whole-cell patch formation and increased to a steady state by 5 min (–5.3 ± 1.0 nA, n = 5, Fig. 1D), indicating that SK2:64/67 channels retain an ability to interact with Ca2+-CaM. Exogenous CaM Rescues SK2:64/67 Activity in Excised Patches—To more closely examine the interaction between CaM and SK2:64/67, inside-out patches were excised from transiently transfected COS cells into Ca2+-containing solution (10 μm, E K = –40 mV). In the absence of cotransfected CaM, currents measured at –80 mV (–31.3 ± 5.7 pA, n = 13) were not different from mock transfected cells (–23.3 ± 6.8 pA, n = 4, p = 0.5, unpaired t test). In contrast, patches from cells cotransfected with SK2:64/67 and CaM yielded channel activity immediately after excision (–638.3 ± 109.3 pA, n = 19), but channel activity diminished even while maintaining the patches in Ca2+ solution such that within 3 min the current measured at –80 mV decayed to 40.2 ± 5.7% of the initial current amplitudes (–294.9 ± 81.8 pA, n = 19). If patches were excised into Ca2+ solution (–887.5 ± 214.7 pA, n = 10) and then exposed to Ca2+-free solution (0 Ca2+) for 1 min, SK currents disappeared (–38.4 ± 12.3 pA, n = 10), and, different from wild type, a return to Ca2+ solution did not re-evoke SK currents (–42.0 ± 9.9 pA, n = 10). One possible reason for the rapid decay of SK2:64/67 channel activity in patches and the inability to repeatedly activate the channels by exposure to Ca2+ is that the channels are weakly associated with CaM prior to and immediately after excision into Ca2+ solution, but channel activity is lost as CaM dissociates from the channels. To test this possibility, patches from cotransfected cells were excised into Ca2+ solution, and currents were evoked as described above. Ca2+-dependent channel activity was abolished by exposure to Ca2+-free solution. However, when exposed to Ca2+ solution additionally containing 10 μm CaM (Ca2+-CaM solution), 56.7 ± 12.8% of the initial channel activity was reconstituted (n = 10, Fig. 2, A and B). Upon re-exposure to 0 Ca2+ solution and return to Ca2+ solution, currents could not be evoked, nor were currents evoked by exposure to CaM solution in the absence of Ca2+. The time course of Ca2+-CaM binding and unbinding was examined by three sequential applications of Ca2+-CaM solution separated by exposure to Ca2+ solution lacking CaM (Fig. 2C). The amplitude of the currents sampled at –80 mV increased upon addition of Ca2+-CaM and decreased upon switching to Ca2+ solution without CaM. Fitting the data with single exponentials yielded time constants of 1.2 ± 0.2, 1.7 ± 0.3, and 1.8 ± 0.4 min for Ca2+-CaM association and 0.7 ± 0.1, 1.4 ± 0.4, and 2.1 ± 0.8 min for Ca2+-CaM dissociation (n = 7). The maximum current amplitudes decreased over the course of the experiment, consistent with channel rundown (18Khawaled R. Bruening-Wright A. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 438: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine whether CaM could associate with SK2:64/67 channels in the absence of Ca2+, patches were excised into Ca2+ solution, verifying functional channels, and then exposed to 0 Ca2+ solution during which time CaM dissociated as confirmed by subsequent exposure to Ca2+ solution. Patches were then exposed to Ca2+-free CaM (10 μm) for 5 min. Upon switching to Ca2+ solution lacking CaM, currents were rapidly evoked, indicating that CaM had assembled with the channels during the Ca2+-free incubation (Fig. 3A). After CaM dissociation and decay of the currents, reapplication of Ca2+-CaM for 5 min again rescued the currents (Fig. 3B). The percentage of the current evoked upon exposure to Ca2+ following Ca2+-free CaM compared with the current subsequently evoked by Ca2+ CaM was 29.7 ± 3.8% (n = 4). This result shows that Ca2+-free CaM can associate with SK2:64/67 channels and suggests that the CaM affinity is increased by the presence of Ca2+. CaM antagonists such as the M13 peptide (19Klevit R.E. Blumenthal D.K. Wemmer D.E. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8152-8157Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or calmidazolium (20Lamers J.M. Stinis J.T. Cell Calcium. 1983; 4: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) do not interfere with the Ca2+-dependent gating process of wild type SK2 (13Xia X.-M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). It is likely that the constitutive interaction of CaM with SK2 does not present an exposed hydrophobic domain on CaM for antagonist binding (16Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). However, the interaction between SK2:64/67 and CaM is less stable in the absence of Ca2+. Therefore, patches containing wild type SK2 or SK2:64/67 channels were exposed to Ca2+-CaM solution (1.2 ± 0.3 nA for wild type, n = 9; –486.0 ± 187.2 pA for SK2:64/67, n = 10) and then exposed to the same solution additionally containing the M13 peptide (100 μm). In contrast to wild type SK2 channels, the M13 peptide blocked the ability of Ca2+-CaM to activate SK2:64/67 channels (–1.1 ± 0.3 nA for wild type, n = 9; –32.4 ± 7.9 pA for SK2:64/67; n = 10). Interestingly, the rate of current inhibition (0.28 ± 0.04 min, n = 8) was greater than removal of CaM from the bath solution (see Fig. 2C) suggesting that the excess M13 peptide enhanced the dissociation of SK2:64/67-bound CaM. Compensatory Mutations in CaM Restore Association with SK2:64/67 Channels—To test whether the double charge reversal E84R/E87K in CaM (CaM:84/87) might compensate for the R464E/K467E double charge reversal in SK2, cells were cotransfected with SK2:64/67 and CaM:84/87. Inside-out patches exposed to Ca2+, displayed SK currents (–1.7 ± 0.6 nA, n = 8) that disappeared upon subsequent exposure to 0 Ca2+ solution (–43.3 ± 12.2 pA, n = 8). Distinctly different from cotransfection of SK2:64/67 with wild type CaM, returning the patch to Ca2+ solution reactivated the channels, rescuing 62.2 ± 12.0% of the initial current (Fig. 4). Cotransfection of wild type SK2 with CaM:84/87 resulted in channels that activated upon patch excision into Ca2+ solution (–594.2 ± 225.4 pA, n = 8) and rapidly decreased without CaM in the bath solution. Unlike coexpression of SK2:64/67 with wild type CaM, currents did not completely disappear, plateauing at 53.2 ± 6.4% of the initial current. This current may reflect channels that have assembled with wild type CaM. Following exposure to 0 Ca2+ solution, re-exposure to Ca2+ solution evoked 62.2 ± 5.3% of the initial current. Subsequent exposure to Ca2+-CaM solution rescued the currents (–740.7 ± 317.6, n = 8) (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the E84R/E87K charge reversals in CaM destabilize the interaction between SK2 and CaM, and that in patches, CaM:84/87 is lost and may be replaced by wild type CaM. Ca2+ Dependence—Coexpression studies with wild type SK2 and CaMs harboring point mutations in the E-F hand domains showed that E-F hands 1 and 2 are necessary and sufficient for Ca2+ gating. Mutations in E-F hands 3 and 4 (CaM3,4) that abolish Ca2+ binding do not alter Ca2+ sensitivity, whereas mutations in either E-F hands 1 or 2 (CaM1 or CaM2) shift the sensitivity from ∼0.5 to ∼1 μm, and the double mutant, CaM1,2, eliminated Ca2+ gating. Functional studies were confirmed by the crystal structure of the CaMBD·Ca2+-CaM complex that showed E-F hands 1 and 2 occupied by Ca2+ ions, whereas E-F hands 3 and 4 were uncalcified (14Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). To examine the Ca2+ dependence of SK2:64/67 channels, and whether exogenous application of Ca2+-CaM reconstituted SK channel gating similar to wild type, cells were cotransfected with either WT CaM, CaM1,2, CaM3,4, CaM1,2,3,4, or CaM:84/87. 1–3 days later, patches were excised into an internal solution containing the same purified recombinant CaM (10 μm), and Ca2+ dose responses were performed by changing between internal solutions containing CaM with varying concentrations of Ca2+ (Fig. 5). For either wild type or SK2:64/67, neither CaM1,2 nor CaM1,2,3,4 supported Ca2+ gating (not shown). The Ca2+ sensitivity of SK2:64/67 with wild type CaM was right-shifted (K d = 0.82 ± 0.07 μm, n = 5) compared with wild type channels (K d = 0.51 ± 0.02 μm, n = 7, p = 0.001, unpaired t test). Application of CaM:84/87 to wild type SK2 channels right-shifted the Ca2+ dose response (K d = 0.82 ± 0.06 μm, n = 9) to the same extent as SK2:64/67 was right-shifted in the presence of wild type CaM (p = 0.97, unpaired t test). Coexpression of SK2:64/67 with CaM:84/87 rescued stable currents patches (see above) but with reduced Ca2+ affinity (K d = 1.38 ± 0.06 μm, n = 8). Application of CaM3,4 to either wild type or SK2:64/67 slightly left-shifted the apparent affinity compared with wild type CaM (not shown). CaM Is Required for SK Channel Cell Surface Localization— Application of Ca2+ or Ca2+-CaM to patches from cells transfected with SK2:64/67 alone did not yield currents, whereas patches from cells cotransfected with CaM yielded robust channel activity. These results suggest that, in the absence of cotransfected CaM, SK2:64/67 channels may not be present on the cell surface. To test this possibility, three tandem copies of the myc epitope were inserted into the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 in SK2 and SK2:64/67. Cells were transfected with the channel alone or in combination with CaM and then examined by immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal anti-myc antibody, either with or without permeabilizing the cells; cotransfected GFP was used to identify transfected cells. For SK2 with or without cotransfected CaM, channel protein was detected on the cell surface when cells were not permeabilized as well as in intracellular organelles after permeabilization (not shown). In contrast, SK2: 64/67 protein was detected on the cell surface only when cotransfected with CaM, even though the protein was highly expressed as evidenced by the strong intracellular organelle staining in permeabilized cells (Fig. 6, top, middle panels). To determine whether requires Ca2+-CaM, cells were cotransfected with wild type SK2 or SK2:64/67 and CaM1,2,3,4, a Ca2+-independent form of CaM (13Xia X.-M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). When cotransfected with CaM1,2,3,4, SK2:64/67 subunits were detected in the plasma membrane, demonstrating that Ca2+ binding to CaM is not essential for cell surface expression (Fig. 6, lower panels). Patches from these cells were excised into Ca2+ solution but did not yield SK currents (–31.4 ± 4.5 pA, n = 9). However, application of exogenous wild type Ca2+-CaM resulted in channel activation (–488.8 ± 85.1 pA, n = 9) suggesting that the channels were in the plasma membrane and initially associated with non-functional CaM1,2,3,4, which was replaced by the exogenous functional Ca2+-CaM. Consistent with this idea, patches from cells cotransfected with wild type SK2 and CaM1,2,3,4 were detected in the plasma membrane, and excision into Ca2+ solution did not result in channel activation (–13.3 ± 4.4 pA, n = 4), nor could channel activity be restored by exogenous Ca2+-CaM (–11.1 ± 3.0 pA, n = 4). Therefore, wild type SK2 channels retain constitutively bound CaM1,2,3,4, which cannot bind Ca2+ and cannot be replaced by wild type CaM but are properly trafficked to the cell surface. The results presented here show that Ca2+-independent interactions between the CaMBD and CaM are essential for cell surface expression and that the constitutive binding between the pore-forming α subunits of SK channels and CaM is not required for channel gating. The crystal structure of the complex between the CaMBD and Ca2+-CaM showed strong interactions between Arg-464 and Lys-467 on the channel and Glu-84 and Glu-87 on CaM, in the region implicated in constitutive association (16Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This was supported by the lack of channel function when the double mutant was expressed. In addition, the purified CaMBD R464E/K467E peptide failed to retain purified CaM in pull-down assays in the absence of Ca2+ (14Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results show that the CaMBD R464E/K467E is different from wild type in its ability to retain CaM, but they do not distinguish between a complete lack of binding or a weakened affinity. The crystal structure of the CaMBD·Ca2+-CaM and functional studies with mutant CaMs (14Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) suggested a separation of function between the two lobes of CaM with the C-lobe mediating many of the Ca2+-independent interactions with CaMBD. Indeed, the shape of E-F hands 3 and 4 are altered through the multiple interactions with CaMBD residues and no longer coordinate Ca2+ ions. The N-lobe E-F hands 1 and 2 bound Ca2+ and were comparable to other Ca2+-CaM substrate structures (21Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 22Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 23Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the double mutation R464E/K467E eliminated all Ca2+-independent interactions, Ca2+ gating in this channel might be mediated solely by interactions with either Ca2+-loaded N- or C-lobes. However, application of mutant CaMs with different combinations of intact E-F hands to SK2:64/67 channels showed that, just as for wild type channels, E-F hands 1 and 2 are required, whereas E-F hands 3 and 4 are dispensable. This implies that the double mutation R464E/K467 weakens the Ca2+-independent interactions between the channel subunit and CaM and that the reconstituted channels interact with exogenously applied CaM similar to that of wild type but with a reduced Ca2+ sensitivity. Therefore, it is likely that overexpressed CaM rescues whole cell SK2:64/67 channels and surface expression by overcoming the weakened affinity. The compensatory mutations in CaM reconstituted tighter binding between the two double mutants, SK2:64/67 and CaM: 84/87, presumably by reinstating salt bridges between these positions. However, the reconstituted channels have reduced Ca2+ sensitivity, with apparent K d values even more right-shifted than SK2:64/67 with WT CaM suggesting that, although the complex is stabilized, the conformational changes that open the channel gate subsequent to Ca2+ binding are compromised. A role for CaM in SK channel trafficking was also found. Immunocytochemistry clearly demonstrated surface expression of SK2:64/67 only with cotransfected CaM, and functional studies showed that the channels carried associated CaM. Joiner et al. (24Joiner W.J. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37980-37985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had observed that overexpressing a part of the C-terminal domain of IK1 that included the CaMBD redistributed the channels to the intracellular compartments and overexpressing CaM redeposited them in the plasma membrane. The present results extend the implications for trafficking by showing that the Ca2+-independent interactions between the channel subunits and CaM are sufficient for cell surface expression. Patches from cells cotransfected with SK2:64/67 channels and CaM1,2,3,4 did not show channel activity when excised into Ca2+ solution, but channel activity was reconstituted upon subsequent application of Ca2+-CaM. Immunocytochemistry verified surface expression of SK2:64/67 channels when cotransfected with CaM1,2,3,4. This result is consistent with the ability of Ca2+-free CaM to associate with the channels in excised patches. Because the CaM-dependent gating mechanism was described for SK channels, a variety of other channels have been shown to undergo Ca2+-free and Ca2+-dependent CaM interactions that alter their functions. For example, Ca2+-free CaM binds to an I-Q motif in the intracellular C-terminal domains of L-, N-, and P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (25Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W.

Soong T.W. Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T. Nature. 2001; 411: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). CaM binds to and modulates specific isoforms of voltage-gated Na+ channels (30Mori M. Konno T. Ozawa T. Murata M. Imoto K. Nagayama K.

Science. 1997; 278: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Molday R.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and CaM is an auxiliary subunit of human gene transient receptor potential channels (34Wen H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7991-8001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Yus-Najera E. Santana-Castro I. Villarroel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28545-28553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). CaM also binds to and regulates the function of several ionotropic receptors, Ca2+ release channels, and TRP channels (see 36–38). CaM is not the only E-F hand Ca2+-binding protein that directly regulates ion channel function. Members of the Kv4 family of voltage-gated K+ channels interact with K-channel-interacting proteins that endow important biophysical properties as well as regulating trafficking to the plasma membrane (39An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). For SK channels, it remains to be determined just how the binding of CaM influences trafficking. However, the SK channels contain a conserved RKR motif in the intracellular N terminus, immediately preceding the first transmembrane domain. An analogous situation exists for functional KATP channels in which the channel forming Kir 6.2 subunits require association with SUR1 for surface expression. In this case, trafficking is regulated by the RKR endoplasmic reticulum retention signals present in each of the partner subunits that is exposed prior to co-assembly and buried once the two subunits form the macromolecular complex (40Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). However, mutagenesis of the RKR motif to AAR in SK2:64/67 did not result in surface expression in the absence of cotransfected CaM, although channel subunits were detected inside the cell (not shown). CaM is highly expressed in almost all cell types, yet the concentrations and subcellular localization of free CaM may vary dramatically depending upon the state of phosphorylation, anchoring to the plasma membrane, or association with CaM storage proteins such as GAP-43 (41Skene J.H.P. Neurosci Res. 1990; 13: S112-S125Google Scholar, 42Verkade P. Schrama L.H. Verkleij A.J. Gispen W.H. Oestreicher A.B.

Moreover, distinct CaM pools may be differentially mobilized, transiting long cellular distances, from dendrites to the nucleus (44Deisseroth K. Heist E.K. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). In addition, local CaM concentrations may also be translationally regulated as CaM mRNA is differentially distributed, a process that likely reflects the conservation of three non-allelic mammalian CaM genes encoding identical proteins but distinct 5′ and 3′ non-coding sequences. For example, one pool of CaM mRNA, derived from a specific CaM gene (CALM1) is abundant in the apical dendrites of cerebellar pyramidal cells and may give rise to local reservoirs of CaM; however, mRNAs derived from CALM1 and CALM2 genes are found in neurite outgrowths in nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells, and CALM3-derived transcripts reside within the cell body (45Toutenhoofd S.L. Strehler E.E. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 46Palfi A. Kortvely E. Fekete E. Kovacs B. Varszegi S. Gulya K.

Base upon these factors, and the number and concentrations of CaM-binding proteins, it is possible that CaM availability is rate-limiting for SK channel surface expression (43Persechini A. Stemmer P.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this case, metabolic processes that alter the concentrations of free CaM may dynamically regulate SK current density and cell excitability."

Three checkpoint proteins, hRad9, hRad1, and hHus1, form a proliferating cell nuclear antigen-like, heterotrimeric complex that has been proposed to function in the initial detection of DNA structural abnormalities. hRad9 is highly modified by phosphorylation, in a constitutive manner and in response to both DNA damage and cell cycle position. Here we present evidence that Thr292 of hRad9 is subject to Cdc2-dependent phosphorylation in mitosis. Furthermore, our data are also consistent with four other hRad9 phosphorylation sites (Ser277, Ser328, Ser336, and Thr355) being regulated in part by Cdc2. We also identify Ser387 as a novel site of hRad9 constitutive phosphorylation and show that phosphorylation at Ser387 is a prerequisite for one form of DNA damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of hRad9. Characterization of nonphosphorylatable mutants has revealed that hRad9 phosphorylation plays a critical role in checkpoint signaling. Overexpression of these mutants blocks the interaction between hRad9 and the DNA damage-responsive protein TopBP1 and impairs the cellular response to DNA damage during S phase.

Like its yeast counterpart, hRad9 forms a ring-shaped, heterotrimeric complex with the hRad1 and hHus1 proteins (16Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol.

Each member of the hRad9-hRad1-hHus1 complex (also known as the 9-1-1 complex), shares sequence homology with PCNA, 1The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HU, hydroxyurea; IR, ionizing radiation. a homotrimer that encircles DNA and tethers DNA polymerase δ during DNA synthesis (19Venclovas C. Thelen M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). PCNA is loaded onto DNA by the pentameric protein complex replication factor C (RFC), which is composed of one large subunit and four smaller subunits (20Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1961-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a manner analogous to PCNA and RFC, 9-1-1 is loaded onto DNA by a complex between hRad17 and the four smallest subunits of RFC (21Bermudez V.P. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Cesare A.J. Maniwa Y. Griffith J.D. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Since DNA damage induces hRad17-dependent association of 9-1-1 with chromatin, the 9-1-1 complex is believed to be involved in the direct recognition of DNA lesions during the initial stages of the checkpoint response (22Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Also involved in this recognition are two phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases, ATM and ATR, that regulate several cell cycle transitions and are central components of the cell checkpoint machinery (23Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Even though these kinases appear to respond to different types of DNA lesions, they share a long list of common checkpoint substrates, including hRad17 (24Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16580-16586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, Rad3 (which shares homology with both ATR and ATM) requires Rad9, Rad1, Hus1, and Rad17 to phosphorylate certain substrates (28O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Similarly, in human cells, phosphorylation of hRad17 by ATR requires hHus1 (22Zou L. Cortez D.

These findings support a model in which the 9-1-1 complex recruits substrates for ATM or ATR to sites of DNA damage or stalled replication forks (29Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In addition to interacting with hRad1 and hHus1, hRad9 also physically interacts with TopBP1, the human orthologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dpb11, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cut5 (30Makiniemi M. Hillukkala T. Tuusa J. Reini K. Vaara M. Huang D. Pospiech H. Majuri I. Westerling T. Makela T.P. Syvaoja J.E. J. Biol.

Each of these proteins contains multiple BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal (BRCT) domains, a putative protein-protein interaction motif common in cell cycle control and DNA repair. In addition to the checkpoint rad genes, cut5 + is also required for slowing S phase and delaying mitosis when DNA replication is challenged by DNA damage (13Marchetti M.A. Kumar S. Hartsuiker E.

Cell. 1993; 74: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A similar requirement also exists for DPB11 in budding yeast (32Araki H. Leem S.H. Phongdara A. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11791-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and a physical interaction between Dpb11 and Ddc1 (the budding yeast orthologue of hRad9) may play a role in this response (33Wang H. Elledge S.J. Genetics. 2002; 160: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). hRad9 is a unique member of the 9-1-1 complex in that it contains a C-terminal region (of about 110 amino acids) that does not share homology with PCNA and is not believed to be directly involved in association with hRad1 or hHus1. This region of the protein is both constitutively and transiently phosphorylated at several amino acid residues (34St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and hence represents a potential regulatory region for the effector functions of 9-1-1. We have characterized the extensive phosphorylation of hRad9 in this region and show that it is partially regulated by Cdc2. We also demonstrate that the C-terminal phosphorylation of hRad9 has roles in regulating both hRad9 interaction with TopBP1 and the cellular response to DNA damage in S phase. Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa cells, fibroblasts derived from an ataxia telangiectasia patient (ATM –/–) (CRL-7201; ATCC, Manassas, VA), and IMR90 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. hTERT-RPE1 cells, a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line that stably expresses the human telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Canada), were maintained as above, only in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were performed as described previously (34St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The development of the stable HeLa Tet-Off cell line was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). This cell line was maintained in 200 μg/ml of Geneticin (G418) (Invitrogen). Transgene expression was limited by the addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline to the culture medium. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfections were conducted using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, siRNA transfections were carried out in six-well plates using 4 μl of OligofectAMINE reagent and 0.1 nmol of siRNA duplex per well. siRNAs targeting hRad9 and luciferase (GL2) were purchased commercially (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO). The siRNA sequence targeting hRad9 was (5′-AACCCUUGGAGGACGGGCUCU-3′). Drugs and Irradiation—Cells were irradiated using a 137Cs γ-irradiator at 0.78 grays/min. Thymidine (Sigma), hydroxyurea (Sigma), and nocodazole (Sigma) were typically administered for 18 h at concentrations of 2 mm, 1 mm, and 0.1 μg/ml, respectively. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—All hRad9 point mutants were generated using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST expression plasmids were generated by PCR subcloning segments of the hRad9 cDNA (wild-type and point mutants) into the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the pGEX-2T vector. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal α-phospho-Ser272, α-phospho-Ser387, and α-phospho-Thr292 antibodies were raised against phospho-Ser272 (SDTDSHpSQDLGS; where pS represents phosphoserine), phospho-Ser387 (PVLAEDpSEGEG), and phospho-Thr292 (QLQAHSpTPHPDD; where pT represents phosphothreonine) hRad9 peptides, respectively (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX). Antisera were cleared of nonspecific binding activity by passage over immobilized, nonphosphorylated peptides and then affinity-purified with immobilized phosphorylated peptides. α-hRad9 polyclonal chicken antibodies have been described previously (17St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). α-hHus1 and α-hRad1 polyclonal chicken antibodies were generated against bacterially expressed and purified His-hHus1 and GST-hRad1, respectively (RCH Antibodies, Kingston, Canada). Antibodies were cleared of GST reactivity and then affinity-purified, as described previously (17St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used in this study were mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against TopBP1 (BD Biosciences), Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), PCNA (PC10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Cdc2 (17St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Flow Cytometry—HeLa cells were fixed in 50% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline for at least 30 min on ice. Cells were then collected by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 50 μg/ml PI and 0.1 mg/ml RNase A, and analyzed using a flow cytometer (Beckman/Coulter EPICS ALTRA, Mississauga, Canada). Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation reactions, cells were lysed in 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol, supplemented with 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.2 mm sodium fluoride. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000 × g. Supernatants were precleared with α-chicken IgY-agarose (Promega, Madison WI) or with protein G Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C prior to immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitation was performed with 1 μg of antibodies directed against the Myc epitope and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose or antibodies directed against hRad9 and α-chicken IgY-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Immunoblotting was performed essentially as previously described (17St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—GST and His-tagged protein expression was induced in logarithmically growing BL21 bacteria, with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. GST fusion proteins were batch-purified from bacterial lysates with glutathione-Sepharose (Promega) using standard techniques. Bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (final pH of 7.4). His-hHus1 was purified under denaturing conditions (6 m guanidine HCl) on a nickel column. Kinase Assays—HeLa cells, arrested in mitosis with nocodazole or in S phase with thymidine, were lysed in 1 ml each of kinase lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 25 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The Cdc2 kinase was immunoprecipitated from these extracts using 4 μg of mouse monoclonal antibody directed against Cdc2. Immune complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then two times with 1 ml of kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP) Reactions were carried out in 60 μl of kinase reaction buffer in the presence of 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 3 μg of GST fusion substrate for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. 20 μl from each reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE (12%), and proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Gels were then dried and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 24 h. hRad9 Is Phosphorylated at Thr292 during Mitosis—We had previously identified four amino acid residues in hRad9 that contribute to the constitutive phosphorylation of the protein (34St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Ser277, Ser328, Ser336, and Thr355 results in a significant reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of hRad9 derived from undamaged, asynchronous cells. We had also previously shown that a T292A mutation prevented hyperphosphorylation of hRad9 in mitosis (34St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To further characterize the nature of Thr292 phosphorylation, phosphospecific antibodies were raised against a phospho-Thr292 hRad9 peptide. As shown in Fig. 1A, these antibodies (α-p292) recognize wild-type (but not T292A) hRad9 from cells that were arrested in mitosis by treatment with the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole (+NOC). The α-p292 antibodies did not recognize hRad9 from asynchronous cultures (–NOC), indicating that hRad9 is indeed hyperphosphorylated at Thr292 in mitosis. We had also previously reported that mutation of Ser277 (a constitutively phosphorylated residue in hRad9) to an alanine reduced the efficiency of hRad9 hyperphosphorylation in mitosis (34St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine whether Thr292 phosphorylation required prior phosphorylation at Ser277 or any of the other constitutively phosphorylated residues above, the S277A, S328A, S336G, and T355A mutants were also immunoblotted with the α-p292 antibodies. We found that whereas Thr292 phosphorylation was readily detectable in S328A, S336G, and T355A mutants derived from mitotic extracts, it was severely reduced in the S277A mutant (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when hRad9 proteins harboring multiple mutations were analyzed (Fig. 1B). Whereas hRad9 protein containing the S328A, S336G, and T355A mutations was still efficiently phosphorylated at Thr292 in mitosis, the addition of one or both of the S277A and T292A mutations inhibited this phosphorylation. Hence, the mitotic phosphorylation of hRad9 at Thr292 requires prior phosphorylation at Ser277. hRad9 Phosphorylation Is Partially Dependent on Cdc2—To further characterize the mitotic phosphorylation of hRad9, we examined the mobility of endogenous hRad9 as cells entered and exited nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest. Consistent with our previous observations (34St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the predominant phospho form of hRad9 in asynchronous cultures (hRad9α) migrated at an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa. The discrepancy between the apparent molecular mass of hRad9 and its predicted molecular mass of 43 kDa is largely due to phosphorylation at Ser277, Ser328, Ser336, and Thr355. Several less abundant, faster migrating phosphorylation intermediates (hRad9β forms) represent hRad9 protein that is only partially phosphorylated at these sites. When cells were blocked in mitosis by treatment with nocodazole, the abundance of both hRad9α and hRad9β forms was reduced, and the majority of hRad9 existed as an even slower migrating species, hRad9μ (see Fig. 2A). When the mobility pattern of hRad9 was examined at increasing time points following the removal of nocodazole from the culture medium, the emergence of normal hRad9 mobility coincided with the exit of cells from mitosis, as defined by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A, 120 and 400 min). The observations made in Figs. 1 and 2A, are consistent with each of Ser277, Ser328, Ser336, Thr355, and Thr292 being quantitatively phosphorylated during mitosis, although the vast majority of hRad9 is already phosphorylated at the four former residues prior to mitosis. Each of these five amino acids share the common consensus sequence ((S/T)PX(R/P)) and are thus potential targets for cyclin-dependent kinases. For these reasons, we sought to determine whether Cdc2, the cyclin-dependent kinase that controls the G2/M transition, could phosphorylate Ser277, Thr292, Ser328, Ser336, and Thr355 in vitro. To this end, we purified a series of hRad9 C-terminal peptides as GST fusion proteins that encompassed the amino acids indicated above, either left intact or mutated to alanine or glycine residues. Peptides were used as substrates for Cdc2, which was purified by immunoprecipitation from HeLa cells arrested in mitosis or S phase. These analyses revealed that Cdc2 could phosphorylate each of the five (S/T)PX(R/P) sites in vitro, with the exception of Thr292 (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation of hRad9 and the histone-positive control was enhanced if Cdc2 was derived from mitotic rather than S phase extracts, illustrating the specificity of the α-Cdc2 antibody. Phosphorylation of Ser277 was demonstrated by introduction of the S277A mutation in GST-hRad9266–301, which abolished phosphorylation of this protein by Cdc2. Neither the S277A mutant nor the S277A/T292A double mutant were phosphorylated at levels significantly above background, indicating that Thr292 was not phosphorylated by Cdc2 in this assay. Phosphorylation of Ser328 and Ser336 was shown using GST-hRad9314–344. Whereas the S328A and S336G single mutants of GST-hRad9314–344 were still modestly phosphorylated, the S328A/S336G double mutant showed only background levels of 32P incorporation. Thr355 was more efficiently phosphorylated than any of the other hRad9 sites (see GST-hRad9348–391). There was no appreciable difference in phosphorylation of T355A and P3A (T355A/S375A/S380G), indicating that Ser375 and Ser380 are not phosphorylated by Cdc2 in vitro. This is consistent with our previous work in which we found no evidence for phosphorylation of these residues in vivo (34St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there did not appear to be any significant phosphorylation of non-Cdk consensus sites in hRad9, thus underscoring the specificity of Cdc2 toward Ser277, Ser328, Ser336, and Thr355 of hRad9 in this assay. To determine whether Cdc2 phosphorylates hRad9 in vivo, we employed the Cdk inhibitor roscovitine. Roscovitine is a selective inhibitor of both Cdc2 and Cdk2 (35De Azevedo W.F. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Kim S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). When HeLa cells were arrested in mitosis with nocodazole and then treated with roscovitine (Ros) for 2 h, a drastic reduction in hRad9 phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 2C). Roscovitine had no effect however, on hRad9 phosphorylation in asynchronous cultures (Fig. 2C). hRad9 Is Constitutively Phosphorylated at Ser387—Site-directed mutagenesis of potentially phosphorylated residues in the C terminus of hRad9 identified a mutant, S387A, which was not normally hyperphosphorylated in response to the DNA synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU). To characterize this residue, phosphospecific antibodies were raised against a phospho-Ser387 hRad9 peptide. The quality of these antibodies was determined by testing their reactivity toward phosphorylated and dephosphorylated wild-type and S387A hRad9. Although transiently expressed wild-type and S387A hRad9 were indistinguishable in terms of their SDS-PAGE mobility, they were clearly distinct with regard to their detection when immunoblotted with α-phospho-Ser387 (α-p387) antibodies (Fig. 3A). Whereas the α-p387 antibodies recognized all differentially migrating forms of wild-type hRad9, they were completely nonreactive toward the S387A mutant (Fig. 3A, right blot). In addition, the α-p387 antibodies did not detect wild type hRad9 that had been dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase. Thus, hRad9 is phosphorylated at Ser387, and the α-p387 antibodies are effective in specifically recognizing Ser387-phosphorylated hRad9. To determine whether phosphorylation at Ser387 of hRad9 was regulated in a cell cycle- or DNA damage-dependent manner, we collected HeLa cells that were in G1, S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle, as we have previously described (34St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were synchronized with a double thymidine block and then released and collected 2 h (S), 7 h (G2), and 11 h (G1) later. One hour prior to harvest, these cells were treated with 20 Gy of ionizing radiation (IR), as indicated. Cells were arrested in mitosis (M) by treating asynchronous cells with nocodazole. We also collected HeLa cells that were grown in the presence of HU for 18 h or were harvested 18 h after a 20-Gy dose of IR. At the time of harvest, these cells were arrested in early S phase and G2, respectively. In all cases, cell cycle position was confirmed using flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained nuclei. Soluble cell lysates from these cells were subjected to immunoblotting with α-hRad9, α-p387, and phosphospecific antibodies directed against phosphorylated Ser272 of hRad9 (α-p272), a site of DNA damage-dependent phosphorylation (27Chen M.J.

Most of the recent studies have suggested that TGF-β inhibits macrophage activation during infections with pathogens such as Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania, thereby favoring virulence. In certain situations, however, there is also evidence that TGF-β has been correlated with enhanced resistance to microbes such as Candida albicans, thus benefiting the host.

They protect the epithelial surface by binding and trapping inhaled infectious particles, including bacteria and viruses, for mucociliary clearance, at least in part because of the extraordinary diversity of their carbohydrate side chains (13Knowles M.R.

Therefore, up-regulation of mucin in infectious diseases represents an important host innate defensive response to microbes (13Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin.

We have demonstrated recently that TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway cooperates with NF-κB to mediate nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae-induced MUC2 mucin transcription (24Jono H. Shuto T. Xu H. Kai H.

Still unknown is whether or not the TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway regulates MUC5AC, another key member of the mucin superfamily, in a similar manner. Understanding how TGF-β signaling mediates up-regulation of MUC5AC mucin may not only bring new insights into the novel role of TGF-β signaling in attenuating host primary innate defensive responses and but may also open up novel therapeutic targets for these diseases. In addition to the TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway, p38 MAPK, consisting of four isoforms, α, β, γ and δ, together with its upstream MAPK kinases (MKK3/6), comprises another important signaling pathway mediating diverse cellular responses (25Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that p38 MAPK is not only regulated by its immediate upstream kinases such as MKK3/6 but is also regulated by other signaling pathways such as TGF-β signaling pathway (26Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 27Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In contrast to the relatively extensive studies on the positive regulation of p38 by TGF-β signaling, relatively little is known about the negative regulation of p38 MAPK by TGF-β signaling, especially in the pathogenesis of bacterial infectious diseases. Because of the important role of TGF-β signaling in mediating diverse cellular responses and our recent observations showing the activation of TGF-β and p38 signaling by nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) as well as the reported interaction between TGF-β and p38 pathways, we hypothesized that the TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway interacts with p38 to mediate up-regulation of MUC5AC mucin in response to NTHi in human epithelial cells. Here, we showed that NTHi, a major human bacterial pathogen of otitis media and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, strongly induces up-regulation of MUC5AC mucin (28Foxwell A.R. Kyd J.M.

The activation of the TLR2-MyD88-dependent p38 MAPK pathway is required for NTHi-induced MUC5AC transcription, whereas activation of TGF-β receptor-mediated signaling leads to down-regulation of p38 MAPK by inducing MAPK phophatase-1 (MKP-1) expression, thereby acting as a negative regulator for MUC5AC induction. These studies bring new insights into the novel role of TGF-β signaling in attenuating host primary innate defensive responses and enhance our understanding of the negative cross-talks between the TGF-β-Smad and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Reagents—SB203580, cycloheximide, and Ro-31-8220 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Recombinant human TGF-β1 and TGF-β neutralization antibody were purchased from R & D Systems. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—NTHi strain 12, a clinical isolate, was used in this study (21Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Li J.D. J. Biol.

For making NTHi crude extract, NTHi were harvested from a plate of chocolate agar after overnight incubation and incubated in 30 ml of brain heart infusion broth supplemented with NAD (3.5 μg/ml). After overnight incubation, NTHi were centrifuged at 10, 000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The resulting pellet of NTHi was suspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated. Subsequently, the lysate was collected and stored at –70 °C. NTHi lysates (5 μg/ml) were used in all the experiments. We chose to use NTHi lysates because of the following reasons. First, NTHi has been shown to be highly fragile and has the tendency to autolyze. Its autolysis can be triggered in vivo under various conditions including antibiotic treatment (21Wang B. Lim D.J.

Therefore, using lysates of NTHi represents a common clinical condition in vivo, especially after antibiotic treatment.

Primary human airway epithelial (NHBE) cells were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). NHBE cells were maintained in Clonetics' recommended bronchial epithelial growth medium, which includes supplements of bovine pituitary extract, hydro-cortisone, human recombinant epidermal growth factor, epinephrine, transferrin, insulin, retinoic acid, triiodothyronine, gentamicin, and amphotericin B (Clonetics), to a confluence of 60–80% (37 °C, 5% CO2). The media were replaced every other day. Only cells of passage 4 were used for experiments. Wild type mink Mv1Lu cells and mutant cell lines, DR26 that are derived from Mv1Lu and lack functional TGF-β receptor type II, were kindly provided by Dr. Joan Massague (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York), and were maintained as described previously (24Jono H.

Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis of MKP-1—Total RNA was isolated from human epithelial cells using a Qiagen kit (Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instruction. For the reverse transcription reaction, the Moloney murine leukemia virus preamplification system (Invitrogen) was used. PCR amplification was performed with Taq gold polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The oligonucleotide primers were: MKP-1, 5′-GCT GTG CAG CAA ACA GTC GA-3′ and 5′-CGA TTA GTC CTC ATA AGG TA-3′, and cyclophilin, 5′-CCG TGT TCT TCG ACA TTG CC-3′ and 5′-ACA CCA CAT GCT TGC CAT CC-3′. Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from human epithelial cells using TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. For the real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, Pre-Developed TaqMan Assay Reagents (Applied Biosystems) were used. Synthesis of cDNA from total RNA samples was performed with MultiScribe™ Reverse Transcriptase. To normalize MUC5AC expression relative to cDNA, we used primers and a TaqMan probe corresponding to cyclophilin. Expression of MUC5AC was measured relative to cyclophilin. Primers and the TaqMan probe for MUC5AC were designed by using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) and synthesized by Applied Biosystem Customer Oligo Synthesis Service (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan probes were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein on the 5′ end and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine on the 3′ end. The primers and probes for MUC5AC were: forward primer, 5′-GTTCTATGAGGGCTGCGTCTTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGCTGGAGCACACCACATC-3′; and TaqMan probe, 5′-FAM-ACCGGTGCCACATGACGGACCT-TAMARA-3′. The reactions were amplified and quantified using an ABI 7700 sequence detector and the manufacturer's software (Applied Biosystems). The relative quantity of MUC5AC mRNA was obtained using the comparative CT method (for details, see user Bulletin 2 for the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System under www.appliedbiosystems.com/support/tutorials) and was normalized using Pre-Developed TaqMan Assay Reagent Human Cyclophilin as an endogenous control (Applied Biosystems).

All of the transient transfections were carried out in triplicate using TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions, unless otherwise indicated. In all co-transfections, an empty vector was used as a control. The transfected cells were pretreated with or without chemical inhibitors including SB203580, cycloheximide, and Ro-31-8220 for 1 h. NTHi or recombinant TGF-β1 was then added to the transfected cells 42 h after transfection. After 5 h, the cells were harvested for luciferase assay. In experiments using neutralization TGF-β antibody, NTHi lysates were pretreated with either TGF-β neutralization antibody or control antibody for 1 h before being added to the transfected cells for 5 h. Western Blot Analysis—In all transfections with either a wild type or a dominant-negative mutant of signaling molecules, an empty vector was used as a control. Transfected cells were treated with or without NTHi 42 h after transfection. Antibodies against phospho-p38 (Thr-180/182) and p38 were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against phospho-TβRII (Tyr-336) and TβRII were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphorylation of p38 and TβRII were detected as described and following the manufacturer's instructions (24Jono H. Shuto T. Xu H. Kai H. Lim D.J. Gum Jr., J.R. Kim Y.S. Yamaoka S. Feng X.H. Li J.D.

After NTHi or TGF-β1 treatment, the cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde solution (4%) and incubated with mouse anti-Smad4 monoclonal antibody for 1 h (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Primary antibody was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The samples were viewed and photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. TLR2-MyD88-dependent Activation of p38 MAPK Is Required for NTHi-induced Up-regulation of MUC5AC Mucin, a Primary Innate Defensive Response for Mammalian Airways—We have recently demonstrated that NTHi up-regulates MUC5AC mucin transcription via p38 MAPK in human epithelial cells (21Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The signaling mechanisms underlying the NTHi-mediated activation of p38 MAPK that leads to up-regulation of MUC5AC, however, have yet to be defined. To investigate how p38 MAPK is regulated by NTHi, we first confirmed the effect of NTHi on MUC5AC transcription and the requirement for p38 MAPK in MUC5AC induction. As we showed previously, NTHi up-regulated MUC5AC expression at mRNA level in human epithelial HeLa and HM3 cells (Fig 1A) as assessed by performing real time quantitative PCR analysis. In addition, NTHi-induced MUC5AC expression was also observed in human middle ear epithelial HMEEC cells as well as in primary human bronchial epithelial NHBE cells. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1B, the pyridinyl imidazole SB203580, a highly specific inhibitor for p38 MAPK, greatly inhibited NTHi-induced MUC5AC expression. Consistent with this finding, SB203580 and overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38α or p38β also inhibited NTHi-induced MUC5AC transcription as assessed using a human MUC5AC promoter-luciferase reporter construct (Fig. 1C), thus confirming the requirement for p38 MAPK in MUC5AC induction. We next sought to determine the receptor-mediated signaling pathway upstream of p38 that mediates NTHi-induced MUC5AC transcription. Based on our recent finding that NTHi induces p38-dependent activation of NF-κB via TLR2 (24Jono H. Shuto T. Xu H. Kai H. Lim D.J. Gum Jr., J.R. Kim Y.S. Yamaoka S. Feng X.H. Li J.D. J. Biol.

Interestingly, co-transfection of HM3 cells with a dominant-negative mutant of TLR2 inhibited NTHi-induced MUC5AC transcription, whereas overexpression of a wild type TLR2 enhanced MUC5AC induction (Fig. 2A). Similarly, overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant MyD88, a key adapter protein downstream of TLR2 (38Horng T. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12654-12658Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), also inhibited MUC5AC induction. Concomitantly, overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of TLR2 and MyD88 also abrogated MUC5AC induction at the mRNA level as assessed by performing real time quantitative PCR analysis (Fig. 2B). To address whether the TLR2-MyD88 signaling pathway also mediates NTHi-induced MUC5AC in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, we next studied the effects of overexpressing dominant-negative mutants of TLR2 and MyD88 on MUC5AC induction in NHBE cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, NTHi-induced MUC5AC expression at mRNA level was also abolished by these treatments in primary NHBE cells. These data indicate that the TLR2-MyD88 signaling pathway is required for MUC5AC induction. To further determine whether TLR2-MyD88 acts upstream of p38 MAPK, we assessed the ef"
https://openalex.org/W2132811836,"Valacyclovir is the 5′-valyl ester prodrug of acyclovir, an effective anti-herpetic drug. Systemic availability of acyclovir in humans is three to five times higher when administered orally as the prodrug. The increased bioavailability of valacyclovir is attributed to carrier-mediated intestinal absorption, via the hPEPT1 peptide transporter, followed by the rapid and complete conversion to acyclovir. The one or more human enzymes responsible for in vivo activation of the prodrug to the active drug and its conversion sites, however, have not been identified. In this report, we describe the purification, identification, and characterization of a human enzyme that activates valacyclovir to acyclovir. A protein with significant hydrolytic activity toward valacyclovir, the 5′-glycyl ester of acyclovir, and the 5′-valyl ester of zidovudine (AZT), was purified from Caco-2 cells derived from human intestine. Using a non-redundant data base search, the N-terminal 19-amino acid sequence of the purified 27-kDa, basic protein revealed a perfect match within the N terminus of a serine hydrolase, Biphenyl hydrolase-like (BPHL, gi:4757862) protein, previously cloned from human breast carcinoma. Recombinant BPHL exhibited significant hydrolytic activity for both valacyclovir and valganciclovir with specificity constants (k cat/K m), 420 and 53.2 mm–1·s–1, respectively. We conclude that BPHL may be an important enzyme activating valacyclovir and valganciclovir in humans and an important new target for prodrug design. Valacyclovir is the 5′-valyl ester prodrug of acyclovir, an effective anti-herpetic drug. Systemic availability of acyclovir in humans is three to five times higher when administered orally as the prodrug. The increased bioavailability of valacyclovir is attributed to carrier-mediated intestinal absorption, via the hPEPT1 peptide transporter, followed by the rapid and complete conversion to acyclovir.

Prodrugs of therapeutically active agents have been used to improve pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, and pharmacokinetic properties of numerous active therapeutic agents. Prodrugs are designed to be inactive until in vivo activation to the parent drug, and hence reliable in vivo activation of the prodrug is considered critical for their pharmacological activity (1Han H.K. Amidon G.L. AAPS PharmSci. 2000; 2: E6Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Identification of the mechanism of in vivo activation of prodrugs is important for prodrug design and for investigating clinical applications. Furthermore, design and development of prodrugs for humans has been significantly hampered by the unknown species differences in the activating enzymes. Thus, identification of the one or more prodrug-activating enzymes will significantly aid in the selection of animal models for human drug development. The participation of peptidases or esterases in prodrug activation will depend on the pro-moiety, its linker to the parent drug, as well as the parent drug. For several prodrugs, their in vivo activation mechanism has been studied in more detail. For example, the anti-cancer prodrug, CPT-11 (irinotecan), a carbamate derivative of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, is converted to its active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin by human carboxylesterases. The efficiency of hydrolysis varies depending on isoforms such that carboxylesterase 2 (hCE2) 1The abbreviations used are: hCE, human liver carboxylesterase; hiCE, human intestinal carboxylesterase; hBr2, human brain carboxylesterase; BPHL, biphenyl hydrolase-like protein; hVACVase, human valacyclovir hydrolase; rVACVase, rat valacyclovir hydrolase; VACV, l-valyl ester of acyclovir; d-VACV, d-valyl ester of acyclovir; ACV, acyclovir; VGCV, valganciclovir; AZT, zidovudine; Gly-ACV, glycyl ester of acyclovir; Val-AZT, L-valyl ester of AZT; PCMB, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid; DFP, diisopropylfluorophosphate; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. and intestinal carboxylesterase (hiCE) are more efficient activators than human liver carboxylesterase 1 (hCE1) (2Satoh T.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor temocapril, an ester prodrug, is rapidly hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase to the active temocaprilat. Human brain carboxylesterase (hBr2) has been found to have the highest specific activity toward temocapril, whereas human intestinal carboxylesterase poorly catalyzes the hydrolysis of temocapril (4Satoh T.

Recently, amino acid ester prodrugs of nucleoside analogs such as valacyclovir (VACV) and valganciclovir (VGCV) have been shown to significantly increase their oral absorption (5Smiley M.L.

The valyl ester prodrug of acyclovir (ACV), valacyclovir, increases the oral bioavailability of ACV 3- to 5-fold (9Weller S. Blum M.R. Doucette M. Burnette T. Cederberg D.M. de Miranda P. Smiley M.L. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 54: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The improved oral bioavailability of ACV, when administered as its prodrug, VACV, has been shown to be due to carrier-mediated intestinal absorption of VACV via the human peptide transporter 1 and to the subsequent rapid in vivo conversion of VACV to ACV (10Han H. de Vrueh R.

Although the transport of VACV via the intestinal human peptide transporter 1 membrane transporter has been confirmed in several laboratories, the activation step in converting VACV to the active ACV has not been elucidated. Studies have shown that enzymatic hydrolysis of VACV is predominant in vivo in rats, primates, and humans (13Burnette T. de Miranda P. Drug Metab.

VACV was shown to be relatively stable in gut lumen while very susceptible to intracellular enzymatic hydrolysis (16Sinko P.J. Balimane P.V. Biopharm. Drug Dispos. 1998; 19: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify a VACV-hydrolyzing enzyme, Burnette et al. (17Burnette T.C. Harrington J.A. Reardon J.E. Merrill B.M. Miranda P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15827-15831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) purified and sequenced several peptide fragments of the major polypeptide from a purified preparation of rat VACV hydrolase, a putative novel protein from rat liver. VACV hydrolase in rat liver (rVACVase) was 29 kDa in size and a basic, monomeric protein that seemed to be associated with mitochondria. However, the identity of this protein was not further determined. Given the importance of nucleoside analogs in pharmacotherapy, the identification of enzymes responsible for activating this class of prodrugs, particularly in humans, can provide important new targets for the design of more effective therapeutic agents. In this report, we describe the identification of a valacyclovir-hydrolyzing enzyme, human valacyclovirase (hVACVase) from human Caco-2 cells, and identify this protein as being biphenyl hydrolase-like (BPHL, gi:4757862) protein. Materials—Valacyclovir and valganciclovir were provided by Glaxo-SmithKline, Inc. (Research Triangle Park, NC) and Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. (Nutley, NJ), respectively. Acyclovir (ACV), zidovudine (AZT), and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). The amino acid ester prodrugs, d-valyl, glycyl ester of ACV and l-valyl ester AZT were synthesized and identified as previously described (10Han H. de Vrueh R. Rhie J. Covitz K. Smith P. Lee C. Oh D. Sadee W. Amidon G. Pharm. Res. 1998; 15: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Bio-Scale DEAE5 column, Bio-Scale CHT2-I column, Bio-Scale S2 column, and Bio-Sil SEC 125–5 column were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). PD-10 columns were from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Porcine esterase (EC 3.1.1.1, liver), rabbit esterase (EC 3.1.1.1, liver), and chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.22.1, bovine pancreas) were purchased from Sigma. Pefabloc SC, leupeptin, and E-64 were from Roche Applied Science and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (PCMB), diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), dithiothreitol, aprotinin, and pepstatin A were from Sigma. Oligonucleotides for the cloning of BPHL were synthesized at the DNA Core Facility at the University of Michigan. DNA extraction and purification kits were purchased from Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). Enzymes for molecular cloning were from Roche Applied Science. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD), and culture supplies were from Corning (Corning, NY) and Falcon (Lincoln Park, NJ). Other chemicals were either analytical or HPLC grade. Cells—The human colon carcinoma cell line, Caco-2, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC HTB37, Passage numbers 44–52, Rockville, MD). The cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1% l-glutamine and penicillin (100 IU/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The cells grown in 150-mm tissue culture dishes were split every 5 days at a ratio of 1:5, and all cells were maintained in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity at 37 °C. Prodrug Hydrolysis Assay—The cell homogenates or subcellular fractions were preincubated with 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) for 3 min at 37 °C. Substrate was added at 200 μm final concentration to initiate the enzymatic reaction. The reaction was quenched by a volume of 10% ice-cold trifluoroacetic acid in 15 min, and the sample was centrifuged and filtered for HPLC analysis. The effects of enzyme inhibitors, PCMB (1 mm), DFP (0.2 mm), captopril (1 mm), bestatin (0.5 mm), eserine (1 mm), EDTA (5 mm), and paraoxon (1 mm) on VACV hydrolysis by Caco-2 cell were studied by preincubating the cell homogenates with an enzyme inhibitor for 15 min at 37 °C. The HPLC system consisted of a reversed-phase column (Ultrasphere, C-18, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Beckman), Waters 515 pump; 996 Photodiode Array UV detector; and WISP model 712 autosampler (Waters, Milford, MA). The remaining prodrugs d/l-valacyclovir (d-vacv, VACV), glycyl ester acyclovir (Gly-ACV), and l-valyl ester AZT (Val-AZT) and production of parent drugs were assayed by HPLC as previously described (10Han H. de Vrueh R. Rhie J. Covitz K. Smith P. Lee C. Oh D. Sadee W. Amidon G. Pharm. Res. 1998; 15: 1154-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Briefly, prodrugs and their parent drugs except VGCV were separated and eluted by 2–8% acetonitrile in 40 mm ammonium formate buffer, pH 3.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with detection at 254 nm. VGCV and ganciclovir were eluted in 1% trifluoroacetic acid in water with acetonitrile gradient of 2–16% over 7 min and detected at 254 nm. The enzyme activity was expressed as nanomoles/min/μg of protein based on the production of the parent drug after correcting for any hydrolysis observed with the control. Purification of Valacyclovir Hydrolase from Caco-2 Cells—The effect of culture time (days) on VACV hydrolysis by Caco-2 cell homogenates was studied with cells grown for 3, 8, 17, and 25 days following confluence. The purification strategy was based on the method described by Burnette et al. (17Burnette T.C. Harrington J.A. Reardon J.E. Merrill B.M. Miranda P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15827-15831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with some modifications. All buffers contained 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml E-64, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin; all procedures were performed at 4 °C; and all columns were run using the Biologic HR chromatography system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with automatic monitoring at A 280. For the purification, forty 150-mm culture plates of Caco-2 cells with 14 days culture after confluence were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times, harvested with a cell scraper on ice, and stored at –u80 °C until use. Caco-2 cell homogenate was prepared by homogenizing in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose (pH 7.4). The cell homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 25,000 × g to give a pellet (P1) and a supernatant (S1). S1 supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to give a pellet (Mp) containing the microsomal fraction and supernatant (Ms). The P1 pellet was resuspended in 3 volumes of homogenization buffer and frozen at –80 °C. After thawing at room temperature, 4 m NaCl in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was added into the suspension to make a final concentration of 0.5 m NaCl. The suspension was vortexed vigorously for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant containing solubilized membrane fraction (MEs) was decanted and kept on ice. An equal volume of 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 m NaCl was then added to the resulting pellet (MEp), and the mixture was again vortexed and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The obtained supernatant and pellet were combined with MEs and MEp, respectively. The MEs fraction was used for further purification. The MEs fraction was further filtered and concentrated using an Ultrafree-15 centrifuge filter device (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The concentrate was desalted by a PD-10 desalting column equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0 (buffer A), and then loaded to an anion exchange column, Bio-Scale DEAE5 column (10 × 64 mm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A. The sample was eluted with 15 ml of buffer A followed by a gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl (total 50 ml) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and desalted using a PD-10 equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (buffer B), as described above and loaded onto a Bio-Scale ceramic hydroxyapatite, Type I column (CHT2, 7 × 52 mm, Bio-Rad). The column was equilibrated in buffer B, and the protein was eluted with a 24-ml linear gradient from 10 to 250 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, passed through PD-10 column to exchange buffer B into 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8 (buffer C), and then loaded onto a cation exchange Bio-Scale S2 column (7 × 52 mm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer C. After washing with 6 ml of buffer C, the elution was performed with a salt gradient from 0 to 0.2 m NaCl at 1 ml/min for 10 min, followed by 6 ml of 0.2 m NaCl, and then a 0.2 to 0.5 m NaCl gradient (14 ml), followed by 6 ml of 0.5 m NaCl. To neutralize pH, 1-ml fractions were collected in tubes containing 40 μl of 1 m HEPES buffer (pH 8.0). The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and 100 μl of supernatant was loaded onto a column of Bio-Sil SEC 125-5 (300 × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad) for gel filtration chromatography in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl (buffer D) at 0.5 ml/min. Active fractions were stored at –80 °C until use. All purification steps were examined by 10% SDS-PAGE with Mark 12™ unstained protein standard marker (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for the estimation of the molecular weight as described by Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). The VACV hydrolytic activity in each fraction was measured as described above, and the protein concentration was determined based on the Bradford method (20Bradford M.M. Analyt. Biochem. 1966; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Characterization of Valacyclovir Hydrolase Purified from Caco-2 Cells (hVACVase)—Hydrolysis of prodrugs, VACV as well as d-vacv, Val-AZT, and Gly-ACV by the purified hVACVase, was studied as described above. Kinetic measurements were carried out in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C with 213 ng/ml of hVACVase within the linear hydrolysis range at various concentrations of VACV ranging from 0.01 to 5 mm. Kinetic parameters for hVACVase were determined by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the initial velocities by the non-linear least square regression module in Sigma Plot 8.0 software. N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence Analysis and Homology Search— The purified protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and then electrotransferred onto a Mini ProBlott™ membrane (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following standard methods (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the transferred protein was visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The band having an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa from the active fraction was excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing and analyzed by the Procise™ protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at the Protein Structure Core Facility, the University of Michigan. The obtained N-terminal 19-amino acid sequence was used as a query for the homology search by BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) against the non-redundant (nr) protein data base (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59926) Google Scholar). Expression of Biphenyl Hydrolase-like Protein in Escherichia coli— The N-terminal 19-amino acid sequence showed an exact match with the N-terminal region of biphenyl hydrolase-like protein (BPHL) (gi: 4757862) (23Puente X.S. López-Otín C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12926-12932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The 844-bp DNA fragment containing the complete coding sequence for BPHL (cDNA of BPHL was kindly provided by Dr. López-Otín) (23Puente X.S. López-Otín C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12926-12932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with NdeI and HindIII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CAT GTG TGC ATA TGC CCA GGA ATC-3′ and 5′-GAG TGA AGC TTT CCT TGT AGG AAG TCT TCT GCT AAC TTG TTG AAT TCA TCT GCA AAA CGC-3′. The PCR using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) was performed for 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing for 30 s at 53 °C, extension at 68 °C for 1 min, and final extension at 68 °C for 7 min. The PCR product was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, ligated into pBluescript-SK (+) (Stratagene), which was treated with SmaI (New England BioLabs) and shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and the resulting plasmid (pBS-BPHL) was transformed into E. coli strain, DH5α (Invitrogen). The BPHL cDNA was excised with NdeI and HindIII from a selected positive clone and ligated into pET29b (Invitrogen) to make pET-BPHL for recombinant protein expression. The positive clones of pET-BPHL were confirmed by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion and were subjected to DNA sequencing at the Protein Core Facility of the University of Michigan. The pET-BPHL vector was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and the transformants were grown overnight in LB broth containing 30 μg of kanamycin/ml. The culture was diluted to 1:20 with the same medium and grown to an A 600 of 0.8–1. BPHL protein expression was induced by 1 mm (final) isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 6 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 20 min, JA 10) and lysed with a 1/50 volume of B-PER II (Pierce, Rockford, IL) containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml E-64, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation (27,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C), BPHL was purified from the supernatant by anion exchange, hydroxyapatite, and gel filtration column chromatography, and the relative purity of the fractions containing BPHL was judged by 4–20% SDS-PAGE stained with Gelcode® blue stain reagent (Pierce). After filtration through 45 μm, the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE anion exchange column in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4 (buffer E), and the flow through was pooled, concentrated, and passed through a PD-10 column to exchange buffer to 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (buffer B). This concentrate was applied to a hydroxyapatite column and was eluted by a 10–250 mm potassium phosphate buffer gradient as for the purification of hVACVase. The BPHL-containing fractions were collected, concentrated, loaded onto a gel filtration column, and eluted by buffer B. The identity of BPHL was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of the first five residues. The purified BPHL was concentrated and stored at –80 °C until use. The polyclonal anti-serum against BPHL was produced according to the standard method (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) by immunizing rabbits with 500 μg of the purified recombinant BPHL (Rockland Inc., Gilbertsville, PA). Characterization of BPHL—The hydrolytic activity of BPHL on VACV, d-vacv, and VGCV was measured in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 37 °C. The effect of pH on BPHL activity against VACV was examined at from pH 5.8 to 8 using 10 mm phosphate buffer and from pH 8 to 9 using 50 mm Tris-HCl. The effect of enzyme inhibitors was investigated using Pefabloc SC, E-64, and PCMB by preincubating BPHL with an inhibitor at 3, 30, and 300 μm final concentrations for 5 min and with dithiothreitol at 300 μm. Determination of Kinetic Parameters of BPHL—The kinetic parameters of BPHL for VACV and VGCV hydrolysis were determined as follows. Kinetic measurements were carried out in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 37 ± 0.5 °C. Kinetic parameters were calculated from initial velocity data at substrate concentrations ranging from 0.04 to 6 mm. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 ng/ml recombinant BPHL to the preincubated substrate solution, with aliquots taken at 2 min intervals up to 10 min, after which the reaction was terminated by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5% (v/v). Initial velocities were calculated from the linear time course for the product formation. The Michaelis-Menten equation was fitted to the data by the non-linear least-square regression analysis in Sigma plot 8.0. The k cat value was calculated from V max = k cat·[enzyme] based on the 31-kDa molecular mass of BPHL. Western Blot Analysis of BPHL in Caco-2 Cells—The rabbit anti-BPHL serum was used for Western blot analysis of BPHL in Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 cell homogenate was prepared as for the protein purification. The cell homogenate was incubated with 2× loading buffer for 5 min at 90 °C, and then 10 μg of protein was subjected to 4–20% SDS-PAGE. The protein was transferred to Hybond-P polyvinylidene fluoride transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 100 V. The membrane was blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin Tris-buffered saline tween-20 (TBS-T) overnight at 4 °C and incubated with anti-BPHL polyclonal serum (1:5000) in 1% bovine serum albumin TBS-T for 1 h, washed five times with PBS for 5 min each, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed for 3 h with TBS-T exchanged every 30 min, and an enhanced chemiluminescence system ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect the expression of BPHL. Immunoblotting using secondary antibody only or pre-immune serum instead of anti-serum served as controls. Purification of Valacyclovir Hydrolase from Caco-2 Cells— Substantial hydrolysis of VACV was observed in Caco-2 cells. VACV hydrolysis was also detected in HeLa cell homogenate; however, Caco-2 cells exhibited about 2-fold higher VACV hydrolytic activity (data not shown). In both cell homogenates, the hydrolysis of d-vacv was not significant. The VACV hydrolysis by Caco-2 cell homogenate increased as the culture days increased until 14 days of culture. Therefore, Caco-2 cells were harvested after an additional 14–16 days of culture following confluence when the highest VACV hydrolysis by the cell homogenate was observed. The VACV hydrolysis in Caco-2 cell homogenate was higher at pH 7.4 and pH 8 than at pH 7 or below (data not shown). The hydrolysis of VACV was not inhibited by 5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml E-64, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, nor was it inhibited by the peptidase inhibitors captopril (1 mm) and bestatin (0.5 mm) or the esterase inhibitors eserine (1 mm) and paraoxon (1 mm). This indicates that VACV hydrolysis by typical peptidases and esterases may not be significant. VACV hydrolysis was significantly inhibited by irreversible serine hydrolase inhibitors, DFP (0.2 mm) and Pefabloc SC (1 mg/ml), and almost completely inhibited by a free thiol group modifier, PCMB (1 mm) (Fig. 2). Similar to the previous report (17Burnette T.C. Harrington J.A. Reardon J.E. Merrill B.M. Miranda P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15827-15831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), VACV hydrolytic activity was enriched in the solubilized membrane fraction (MEs), and specific VACV hydrolysis activity was significantly less in other subcellular fractions (data not shown). Therefore, the MEs fraction was used for further biochemical purification. Valacyclovir hydrolase was enriched from Caco-2 cell homogenate 2917-fold (Table I) through successive purification steps. Following the last purification step a major band with a molecular mass of 27 kDa (determined by gel filtration chromatography) was present in the active fractions (Fig. 3, lane 6), whereas it was absent in inactive fractions (lanes 7 and 8). This 27-kDa band was tentatively named human valacyclovirase, hVACVase, to distinguish it from rat liver valacyclovirase (rVACVase). This hVACVase did not bind to a DEAE anion exchange column at pH 8, suggesting that hVACVase remains positively charged at pH 8. The enrichment of VACV hydrolytic activity in the solubilized membrane fraction and a high pI value are consistent with those observed for rVACVase (17Burnette T.C. Harrington J.A. Reardon J.E.

https://openalex.org/W2081514970,"Alterations of 19q13 are frequently observed in glial neoplasms, suggesting that this region harbors at least one gene involved in gliomagenesis. Following our previous studies on structural 19q chromosome rearrangements in gliomas, we have undertaken a detailed FISH analysis of the breakpoints and identified a 19q13.2 intrachromosomal amplification of the MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) gene in three primary glioblastoma cell lines. Recent data suggest that this gene is involved in the Wnt-signaling pathway. We observed that the expression of the alternatively spliced MARK4L isoform is upregulated in both fresh and cultured gliomas and overexpressed in all of the above three glioblastoma cell lines. Interestingly, we also found that MARK4L expression is restricted to undifferentiated neural progenitor cells or proliferating glial precursor cells, whereas its expression is downregulated during glial differentiation. Perturbation of expression using antisense oligonucleotides against MARK4 in glioblastoma cell lines, consistently induced a decreased proliferation of tumor cells. Taken together, these data show that MARK4, which is normally expressed in neural progenitors, is re-expressed in gliomas and may become a key target of intrachromosomal amplification upon 19q rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W1990432209,"A lethal form of nemaline myopathy, named “Amish Nemaline Myopathy” (ANM), is linked to a nonsense mutation at codon Glu180 in the slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TnT) gene. We found that neither the intact nor the truncated slow TnT protein was present in the muscle of patients with ANM. The complete loss of slow TnT is consistent with the observed recessive pattern of inheritance of the disease and indicates a critical role of the COOH-terminal T2 domain in the integration of TnT into myofibrils. Expression of slow and fast isoforms of TnT is fiber-type specific. The lack of slow TnT results in selective atrophy of type 1 fibers. Slow TnT confers a higher Ca2+ sensitivity than does fast TnT in single fiber contractility assays. Despite the lack of slow TnT, individuals with ANM have normal muscle power at birth. The postnatal onset and infantile progression of ANM correspond to a down-regulation of cardiac and embryonic splice variants of fast TnT in normal developing human skeletal muscle, suggesting that the fetal TnT isoforms complement slow TnT. These results lay the foundation for understanding the molecular pathophysiology and the potential targeted therapy of ANM.

Nemaline myopathies are neuromuscular disorders characterized by muscle weakness and rod-shaped or “nemaline” inclusions in skeletal muscle fibers (1North K.N. Laing N.G. Wallgren-Pettersson C. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 34: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recently a new recessively inherited nemaline myopathy, named “Amish Nemaline Myopathy” (ANM), 1The abbreviations used are: ANM, Amish nemaline myopathy; Ca50, Ca2+ concentration producing 50% of maximum force; EDL, extensor digitorum longus; F max, maximum calcium-activated force; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MHC, myosin heavy chain; pCa, log of Ca2+ concentration; RATnT, rabbit polyclonal TnT; TnC, troponin C; TnI, troponin I; TnT, troponin T. was identified among the Old Order Amish in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. ANM is a severe progressive disorder, with affected children dying of respiratory insufficiency resulting from muscle weakness and stiffness, usually in the second or third year of life. No effective treatment is available. Genetic linkage and DNA sequence analyzes have identified a nonsense mutation within exon 11 of the slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TnT) gene (TNNT1) as a potential genetic cause of ANM (2Johnston J.J. Kelley R.I. Crawford T.O. Morton D.H. Agarwala R. Koch T. Schaffer A.A. Francomano C.A. Biesecker L.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 814-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The mutation converted codon Glu180 into a stop codon that is predicted to truncate the slow TnT polypeptide chain with loss of the COOH-terminal 83 amino acids. Vertebrate skeletal muscle contraction is regulated by the troponin complex and tropomyosin, which are associated with actin thin filament in the sarcomere. With depolarization of the muscle cell membrane, Ca2+ released into the cytoplasm binds to troponin C (TnC), inducing a series of allosteric changes in TnC, troponin I (TnI), TnT, and tropomyosin that activate actomyosin ATPase, powering myofilament sliding and shortening of the sarcomere (3Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). The ANM mutant slow TnT lacks the COOH-terminal T2 domain that binds TnC, TnI, and tropomyosin to form the core of the Ca2+-regulatory system (Fig. 1A) (4Leavis P.C. Gergely J. CRC Crit. Rev.

Three homologous genes have evolved in vertebrates to encode isoforms of TnT, i.e. slow skeletal muscle TnT (TNNT1), fast skeletal muscle TnT (TNNT3), and cardiac TnT (TNNT2) (8Huang Q.-Q. Chen A. Jin J.-P. Gene. 1999; 229: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Barton P.J. Cullen M.E. Townsend P.J. Brand N.J. Mullen A.J. Norman D.A. Bhavsar P.K. Yacoub M.H.

Each of these is expressed specifically in differentiated adult slow skeletal, fast skeletal, and cardiac muscles, respectively, with a fiber type-based structural conservation (Fig. 1B). From the pre-mRNA transcripts of these muscle fiber type-specific TnT genes, alternative splicing produces additional isoform variations (8Huang Q.-Q. Chen A. Jin J.-P. Gene. 1999; 229: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Breitbart R.E. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Jin J.-P. Huang Q.-Q.

Gene. 1998; 214: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The large number of TnT isoforms with complex variations in structure can be classified into acidic and basic isoforms according to their isoelectric points (pI) (Fig. 1C) (13Wang J. Jin J.-P. Gene. 1997; 193: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). TnT isoform expression is developmentally regulated. The cardiac TnT gene is transiently expressed in embryonic skeletal muscle (14Jin J.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and alternative RNA splicing generates embryonic to adult isoform transitions of cardiac TnT (15Jin J.-P. Wang J. Zhang J. Gene. 1996; 168: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and fast skeletal muscle TnT (13Wang J. Jin J.-P. Gene. 1997; 193: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27858-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Normal adult skeletal muscle expresses both slow skeletal muscle TnT and the alternative RNA splicing-generated adult isoforms of fast skeletal muscle TnT (12Jin J.-P. Chen A. Huang Q.-Q. Gene. 1998; 214: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Wang J. Jin J.-P. Gene. 1997; 193: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Most vertebrate skeletal muscles are made up of a combination of both fast and slow fibers (muscle cells). The finding that the loss of only one isoform of TnT may cause a lethal myopathy establishes the importance of these functionally differentiated fiber type-specific TnT isoforms. The present study investigates the fate of the truncated slow TnT and the functional significance and developmental regulation of TnT isoforms. The results lay the foundation for understanding the molecular pathology and pathophysiology of ANM and for further studies on a targeted therapy of this devastating disease. Muscle Biopsy Samples from ANM Patients—Diagnostic muscle biopsy samples were obtained from the quadriceps muscle of two 7-week-old ANM patients. This investigation was determined to be exempted research under section IV C criteria by the Johns Hopkins Hospital Institutional Review Board. In addition to clinical diagnosis and family history, genetic analysis of both subjects confirmed a homozygous Glu180 nonsense mutation of TNNT1 (2Johnston J.J. Kelley R.I. Crawford T.O. Morton D.H. Agarwala R. Koch T. Schaffer A.A. Francomano C.A. Biesecker L.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 814-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The muscle biopsies were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. For SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, the muscle tissues were thawed on ice and immediately homogenized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1% SDS. The high concentration of SDS inactivates protease activity and effectively extracts myofilament proteins from the tissue. Human quadriceps muscle biopsy or autopsy samples from control (non-ANM) subjects were prepared by the same procedure. Specific Anti-TnT Antibodies—A monoclonal antibody (mAb) CT3 that recognizes cardiac and slow skeletal muscle TnT, but not fast skeletal muscle TnT, was described previously (17Jin J.-P. Chen A. Ogut O. Huang Q.-Q. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1067-C1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using human cardiac TnT expressed from cloned cDNA and purified from Escherichia coli culture as an immunogen, we developed a new mAb, 2C8, that recognizes cardiac, slow, and fast TnTs almost equally in Western blots (Fig. 2A). Mouse hybridomas were produced by previously described methods (18Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (17Jin J.-P. Chen A. Ogut O. Huang Q.-Q. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1067-C1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) located the 2C8 mAb epitope in the NH2-terminal chymotryptic T1 fragment of TnT (19Heeley D.H. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9971-9978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). A mAb T12 raised against rabbit fast TnT (Ref. 20Lin J.J.-C. Feramisco J.R. Blose S.H. Matsumura F. Kennett R.H. Bechtol K.B. McKearn T.J. Monoclonal Antibodies and Functional Cell Lines. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1984: 119-151Crossref Google Scholar; a gift from Prof. Jim Lin, University of Iowa) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-TnT serum, RATnT (18Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), were also used in the present study for Western blot analysis. Although mAb T12 binds weakly to cardiac TnT and slow TnT at high concentrations, we have established a Western blot working concentration at which T12 specifically recognizes only fast skeletal muscle TnT (Fig. 5B). Immunohistochemistry and Stereomicroscopy—Thin frozen sections of muscle biopsy samples were fixed in cold acetone. As described (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Brooklyn, NY2001: 14.6.1-14.6.13Google Scholar), cross sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining using the anti-TnT isoform mAbs CT3 and T12 and an anti-cardiac β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC; which is the same as MHC I in skeletal muscles; Ref. 22Baldwin K.M. Haddad F. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) monoclonal antibody, FA2 (23Jin J.-P. Malik M.L. Lin J.J.-C. Hybridoma. 1990; 9: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin second antibody (Sigma) and an H2O2-diaminobenzidine substrate reaction to examine the expression of slow TnT, fast TnT, and MHC I, respectively. Morphometric assessment of type 1 and type 2 muscle fibers was carried out on sections stained by standard histochemical techniques for myosin ATPase at pH 9.4 (24Dubowitz V. Dubowitz V. Muscle Biopsy, A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Bailliere Tindall, London1985: 19-40Google Scholar). Measured muscle fibers were selected by unbiased sampling techniques (25Mayhew T.M. J. Neurocytol. 1992; 21: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) from regions of the muscle biopsy slide predetermined to have good cross-sectional orientation. Because anatomic boundaries are not defined in biopsy and autopsy specimens, measurement of fiber number is expressed as a ratio between fiber types. Examination of Myofilament Protein Isoform Content within Single Muscle Fibers—Single muscle fibers were isolated as described previously (26Brotto M.A. Nosek T.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 81: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Each fiber was dissolved in 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. The resulting gels were processed for silver staining as described (27Ogut O. Hossain M.M. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3089-3097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To identify the expression of several specific myofibril protein isoforms in a single muscle fiber, Western blots of duplicate gels were carried out using a mixture of the anti-slow TnT mAb CT3, an anti-TnI mAb, TnI-1 (28Jin J.-P. Yang F.-W. Yu Z.-B. Ruse C.I. Bond M. Chen A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the anti-cardiac β-MHC/skeletal MHC I mAb, FA2 (23Jin J.-P. Malik M.L. Lin J.J.-C. Hybridoma. 1990; 9: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), as described above. After recording the expression patterns for slow TnT, slow and fast TnI isoforms, and MHC I, the nitrocellulose membranes were reprobed with T12 mAb to examine the expression of fast TnT isoforms. Contractility Analysis on Single Muscle Fibers—The experimental protocol and calculation of solution compositions were similar to those described previously (26Brotto M.A. Nosek T.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 81: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Single fibers were skinned by Triton X-100 in the present of protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 1.0 mm benzamidine, and 10 μm aprotinin). The sarcomere length of the mounted muscle fiber was adjusted to ∼2.6 μm by monitoring its laser diffraction pattern (26Brotto M.A. Nosek T.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 81: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Muscle fibers were permitted to relax in pCa 8.5 and then exposed to solutions of varying Ca2+ concentrations to determine the force versus pCa relationship as described (29Brotto M.P. van Leyen S.A. Brotto L.S. Jin J.-P. Nosek C.M. Nosek T.M. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 442: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Maximum calcium-activated force (F max) was recorded and normalized to the cross-sectional area of each fiber. The force versus pCa curve was constructed for each fiber by using F max at pCa 4.0 as 100%. Sigmaplot 5.0 and Origin 6.0 computer programs (Jandel Scientific) were used to fit the force versus pCa curve for each fiber to the Hill equation. Each fiber used for the contractility assays was examined by Western blotting as described above for troponin and myosin isoform contents to classify its fiber type. Data Analysis—Densitometric analysis of the SDS-PAGE and Western blots used the NIH Image program, version 1.61, on images scanned at 600 dpi. The TnT molecular weight and pI were calculated from amino acid sequences by using programs from DNAStar. Statistical analysis for the protein quantification was done by Student's t test. Contractility data were analyzed by the SigmaStat (Jandel Corp.) program for statistical significance. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test normally distributed data, and the Wilcoxon sign rank test was applied for non-normally distributed data. Neither Intact nor Truncated Slow TnT Was Found in the Muscle of ANM Patients—The fate of the truncated slow TnT in ANM muscle is important for understanding the molecular pathophysiology of the disease. The predicted truncation after Arg179 deletes most of the COOH-terminal T2 domain of TnT that interacts with TnI, TnC, and tropomyosin, but the central tropomyosin-binding site in the NH2-termial T1 region is retained (Fig. 1A). Residual truncated TnT might interact with tropomyosin through the single binding site, disturbing the troponin-tropomyosin complex in a dominant negative manner. Western blots obtained with mAb 2C8, recognizing both fast and slow TnT (Fig. 2A) and the TnT NH2-terminal T1 fragment (Fig. 2B), showed that multiple fast TnT isoforms were expressed in ANM muscle; but, in comparison to control muscle, no additional low molecular weight TnT bands were detected (Fig. 3A). The absence of truncated slow TnT was confirmed by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-TnT antibody, RATnT, that recognizes multiple epitopes (Fig. 3A). Fast and Slow TnT Isoforms Are Expressed in a Fiber-specific Manner—Why fast TnT does not compensate for the loss of slow TnT in ANM muscle is unknown. Quantitative densitometry analysis of Western blots of control and the two ANM muscle samples in multiple loadings, using the anti-all TnT mAb 2C8 (normalized by densitometry of the actin band on parallel SDS gels), detected no difference in the stoichiometry of total TnT of ANM relative to control (Fig. 3B). Combined with the selective atrophy but normal number of muscle fibers expressing slow myosin (Fig. 4) and a diminished abundance of slow TnI (28.2 ± 4.3% of total TnI versus 43.2 ± 5.7% in the control muscles, p < 0.001, Fig. 3C), the unchanged TnT to actin ratio suggests that, in ANM, there is selective loss of slow thin filaments. We have shown previously that most skeletal muscles of large mammals contain both slow and fast isoforms of TnT (12Jin J.-P. Chen A. Huang Q.-Q. Gene. 1998; 214: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fast TnTs are found in ANM, normal human infant and adult quadriceps muscle (Figs. 3A and 6A), and the predominantly slow fiber adult rat soleus muscle (Fig. 5A). To investigate whether TnT isoform expression is evenly mixed in all fibers of the muscle or, instead, is specific to individual fibers, we examined the expression of TnT isoforms at the single fiber level. Expression of slow isoforms of myosin (MHC I) and troponin subunits is highly fiber type-specific (Fig. 5B). In a typical fast muscle, e.g. the rat extensor digitorum longus, EDL, all fibers express only fast TnT, fast TnI, and no MHC I. In contrast, all of the rat soleus fibers examined express MHC I. 50% of the soleus fibers studied express slow TnT, 26.5% express fast TnT, and only 23.5% express a mixture of slow and fast isoforms of TnT. Slow and fast TnI isoforms that are distinguished by mobility in SDS-PAGE are co-expressed with slow and fast TnT, respectively. The results demonstrate that regulation of troponin isoforms is specific to the type of individual muscle fiber. These data suggest that fast TnT in slow muscles is unable to compensate for the loss of slow TnT, because it is only expressed in a small fraction of the fibers. The unchanged ratio of total TnT to actin in ANM muscle further supports the hypothesis that slow thin filaments are lost selectively. Slow TnT Confers Higher Ca2 + Sensitivity and Lower Cooperativity of the Muscle Fiber—To investigate the relationship between TnT isoform content and muscle fiber contractility, we measured the Ca2+-activated development of force in Triton X-100-skinned rat single muscle fibers. Fibers were sorted according to myosin and TnT isoform content into one of three groups (Fig. 5) as follows: (a) EDL fibers containing only fast myosin (MHC I-negative) and fast TnT; (b) soleus fibers (MHC I-positive) containing slow TnT; and (c) soleus fibers (MHC I-positive) containing fast TnT. Muscle fibers expressing slow or fast TnT differ in calcium sensitivity without respect to myosin type (Fig. 5C). Slow TnT-containing fibers produce 50% F max (Ca50) at a lower Ca2+ concentration, reflecting higher Ca2+ sensitivity. In contrast, fibers expressing fast TnT show a higher cooperativity during the Ca2+ activation of contraction. Fibers with fast TnT but differing in myosin type are indistinguishable with respect to Ca50 and cooperativity, indicating a determining role of the thin filament. Previous experiments in chicken skeletal muscle demonstrate that alterations of Ca2+ sensitivity correlate with the TnT isoform but not with the TnI or the TnC isoform (30Ogut O. Granzier H. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1999; 276: C1162-C1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic expression of fast skeletal muscle TnT in mouse cardiac muscle increases cooperativity of the Ca2+-activated contraction (31Huang Q.-Q. Brozovich F.V. Jin J.-P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 231-242Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, the TnT isoform appears to be a major determinant of the role of slow and fast troponins in the modulation of Ca2+ sensitivity and cooperativity of muscle contraction. Although troponin isoforms determine Ca2+ responsiveness, myosin isoform expression determines the F max (Fig. 5C). Expression of the slow muscle-specific myosin heavy chain, MHC I, correlates with the lower F max without respect to the TnT isoform. These results are consistent with the fact that slow myosin has a lower ATPase activity than that of the fast myosin isoenzyme (22Baldwin K.M. Haddad F. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Developmental Switching of TnT Isoform Expression in Human Skeletal Muscles—Protein extracts from normal human quadriceps muscle at 16 weeks of gestation, term, 6 months, and adult were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western blots using the anti-cardiac/slow TnT mAb CT3 and the anti-fast TnT mAb T12. As observed in other vertebrates (14Jin J.-P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), cardiac TnT is expressed in fetal skeletal muscle with minimal expression by term. In comparison to adult muscle, fetal skeletal muscle expresses embryonic isoforms of fast TnT with higher molecular weight than the adult isoforms, which in agreement with previous observations in mouse (13Wang J. Jin J.-P. Gene. 1997; 193: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Slow TnT is also developmentally regulated in normal human muscle, increasing in abundance with maturation (Fig. 6A). Slow TnT and Myopathy—A number of codon deletion, splice site, and missense dominant mutations of TNNT2 (cardiac TnT) have been found in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (32Knollmann B.C. Potter J.D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 11: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The TNNT1 ANM mutation represents the first recessive TnT mutation found in human diseases. Truncation and null recessive mutations in the Caenorhabditis elegans TnT gene (mup-2) produce abnormal body wall muscle twitching and hypercontraction (33Myers C.D. Goh P.Y. Allen T.S. Bucher E.A. Bogaert T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1061-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This loss of slow TnT produces a characteristic phenotype in ANM and provides novel evidence for the critical function of TnT in the regulation of muscle contraction and the importance of the muscle fiber type-specific TnT isoforms.

Genet. 2000; 67: 814-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), have been found in different forms of hereditary nemaline myopathy. All five nemaline myopathy-related genes encode thin filament-associated proteins that relate to the Z disk of the sarcomere, from which nemaline bodies appear to be derived. Thus, the genetic forms of nemaline myopathy likely represent a class of sarcomeric thin filament diseases. Complete Loss of Slow TnT as the Molecular Basis of ANM—The absence of detectable truncated slow TnT is consistent with the observed recessive inheritance of the disease. This result provides the first direct evidence that the loss of slow skeletal muscle TnT is the molecular cause of ANM and establishes an important foundation for understanding that the molecular pathology of the disease is caused by loss of the TnT protein rather than by a dominant negative effect caused by a TnT NH2-terminal fragment. This finding shifts the focus of pathophysiologic inquiry to the functional role of slow TnT in slow muscle fibers. The significant atrophy of slow fibers in ANM muscle indicates that the lack of slow TnT results in either decreased formation or decreased stability of myofibrils. Amish nemaline myopathy thus highlights a critical role for fiber type-specific TnT isoforms in skeletal muscle function. The slow TnT defect-based loss of myofibrils in ANM muscle indicates that TnT is not only required for the Ca2+ regulation of contraction but is also critical for muscle development and growth. Although the slow TnT-(1–179) fragment retains one tropomyosin-binding site, deletion of the COOH-terminal T2 region should abolish the binding to TnI and TnC (Fig. 1A). The complete loss of slow TnT in ANM muscle indicates a critical role of the COOH-terminal T2 domain in the integration of TnT into myofibrils. The results suggest that the two sites binding to tropomyosin (19Heeley D.H. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9971-9978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and/or the formation of troponin complex is essential for incorporation of TnT into the muscle thin filament. The mechanism for the absence of the truncated slow TnT-(1–179) protein fragment remains to be investigated. It may result from either accelerated nonsense-mediated decay of the mutant mRNA (38Maquat L.E. RNA. 1995; 1: 453-465PubMed Google Scholar) or decreased stability of the protein fragment. The clear recessive inheritance of ANM (2Johnston J.J. Kelley R.I. Crawford T.O. Morton D.H. Agarwala R. Koch T. Schaffer A.A. Francomano C.A. Biesecker L.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 814-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) suggests that truncated TnT is not incorporated into the troponin-tropomyosin complex and, therefore, is not accumulated. Otherwise, truncated TnT expressed in the muscle of ANM heterozygotes would likely result in a phenotype. Precedent for this phenomenon is provided by the dominantly inherited cardiomyopathy caused by a truncated cardiac TnT due to a splice-site mutation in intron 16 of TNNT2 (39Watkins H. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Feng H.S. Sweeney H.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2456-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Troponin Isoforms as Novel Markers for Skeletal Muscle Fiber Classification—TnT isoform expression in post-natal muscle is specific to the muscle fiber type and influences contractile properties of the fiber. Myosin isoforms have been widely used in the typing of skeletal muscle fibers (22Baldwin K.M. Haddad F. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The relationship between myosin isoform and muscle fiber type is complex, i.e. MHC I and MHC IIa are associated with slow fibers, whereas MHC IIb and IIx are specific to fast fibers at various relative amounts. In contrast, most muscle fibers express only one isoform of TnT and TnI. The well characterized fast fiber EDL muscle demonstrated exclusive expression of fast TnT and fast TnI and no MHC I. Although both slow and fast TnT are detected in the homogenate of whole soleus muscle (Fig. 5A), most soleus fibers express either slow TnT and TnI or fast TnT and TnI (Fig. 5). The matched expression of TnT and TnI isoforms in fast and slow muscle fibers is in agreement with their closely related function and co-evolutionary relationship (40Huang Q.-Q. Jin J.-P. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 780-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the troponin isoform provides a novel and, possibly, a more specific marker for the functional classification of skeletal muscle fiber type. Functional Difference between Slow and Fast TnT Isoforms— Slow fibers are important in the sustained contraction of muscle (41Fitts R.H. Riley D.R. Widrick J.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 3201-3208PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of fast TnT in a limited number of MHC I-positive fibers (Fig. 4B) does not compensate for the absence of slow TnT in ANM. Therefore, the Ca2+ regulatory functions of the slow thin filament rather than the distinctive contractile force determined by myosin type determines the function of slow fibers that is critical to the molecular pathology of ANM. The primary structure of slow TnT is better conserved across species than those of fast and cardiac TnTs (12Jin J.-P. Chen A. Huang Q.-Q. Gene. 1998; 214: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Slow TnT may thus play a more fundamental role in vertebrate muscle function. Our finding that slow TnT confers a higher sensitivity but lower cooperativity to Ca2+ activation compared with fast TnT (Fig. 5C) suggests that thin filament responsiveness to Ca2+ is a major factor determining the function of fast and slow fibers. The hypothesis that differential Ca2+ sensitivity and cooperativity of slow versus fast fibers has a critical role in the normal function of skeletal muscle deserves further investigation. Significance of the Developmental Regulation of TnT Isoforms—Newborn babies with ANM have normal muscle power but quickly develop tremors, followed by progressive weakness with muscle rigidity or contracture (2Johnston J.J. Kelley R.I. Crawford T.O. Morton D.H. Agarwala R. Koch T. Schaffer A.A. Francomano C.A. Biesecker L.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 814-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This postnatal onset and infantile progression of the ANM phenotype corresponds to the time course of developmental down-regulation of cardiac TnT and the alternative splicing-generated embryonic isoforms of fast TnT in skeletal muscle (Fig. 6). Slow, fast, and cardiac TnTs are conserved in their COOH-terminal and central regions, reflecting a conserved core function among the three muscle type-specific TnTs. The highly variable NH2-terminal region is responsible for the distinct overall charge of TnT isoforms. Cardiac and embryonic fast, and slow TnTs are all acidic isoforms, whereas only the adult fast TnT is basic (Fig. 1C). Charge characteristics are likely a major functional determinant of TnT isoforms (13Wang J. Jin J.-P. Gene. 1997; 193: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27858-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The normal developmental coupling of decreased expression of cardiac and embryonic fast TnT to increased expression of slow TnT suggests that these acidic isoforms complement one another in slow muscle fibers. The cardiac TnT and embryonic fast TnT expressed in fetal skeletal muscles may compensate sufficiently for the loss of slow TnT to produce the normal muscle function of ANM neonates (Fig. 6B). Their postnatal down-regulation removes this compensation and corresponds to the progression of myopathy phenotype. This observation suggests a potential specific therapy for ANM directed toward increasing the slow fiber expression of these embryonic TnT isoforms. We thank Dr. Jim J.-C. Lin for providing the T12 mAb."

After centrifugation (14 h; 50,000 rpm; 210,000 × g; TLS-55 rotor), fractions (100 μl) were collected.

Images were recorded on Eastman Kodak Co. SO-163 film (nominal magnification × 50,000), using a Hitachi H-8000 transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV and employing low dose conditions (5 electrons/A2 per image).

Expression and Purification of HisHrcN—The gene for P. syringae phaseolicola HrcN was identified after systematic sequencing of the Hrp/Hrc regulon that encodes the TTS components. 2A. P. Tampakaki and N. J. Panopoulos, unpublished results. Translation is predicted to initiate with a valine codon (Fig. 1A). HrcNPsph carries characteristic Walker box A and B sequences (Fig. 1A) required for ATP hydrolysis and is homologous to other putative TTS ATPases (34Lidell M.C. Hutcheson S.W. Mol.

The protein is devoid of a Sec-system signal peptide and of extensive hydrophobic patches (Fig. 1B). HrcN synthesized with an amino-terminal decahistidinyl tag in E. coli was purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1C, lane 5), and a polyclonal antiserum was raised against it (see “Experimental Procedures”). HisHrcN yield was poor (1 mg/liter); an expressed band of the expected molecular weight (48 kDa) was clearly detectable by α-HisHrcN immunostaining (lanes 8 and 10) and poorly by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (lane 2). A unique band of 48 kDa was also detected by α-HisHrcN immunostaining in extracts from P. syringae phaseolicola cells that had been induced for TTS expression (Fig. 2D, lane 6) (25Huynh T.V. Dahlbeck D. Staskawitz B.J. Science. 1989; 245: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) but not in extracts from uninduced cells (lane 5). The α-HrcN antiserum was used to subcellularly localize HrcN. HrcN Associates with Membranes—To determine the subcellular localization of HrcN, we produced cytosolic extracts of P. syringae phaseolicola (Fig. 2A) grown under TTS regulon-inducing (lanes 2–4) or noninducing (lane 1) conditions and examined them by immunostaining. HrcN was only detected after growth under inducing conditions (lane 2), whereas two control proteins, DnaK and SecY, were expressed under both conditions. TTS-expressing cells were disrupted, and polypeptides were separated into soluble (lane 4) and membrane-associated (lane 3) material by ultracentrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Most of HrcN (∼90%) was detected in the membrane-containing fraction that also contains the polytopic membrane protein SecY (37Economou A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As expected, the cytoplasmic DnaK protein was almost exclusively detected in the soluble fraction. Similar results were obtained with E. coli MC4100 harboring the complete P. syringae phaseolicola TTS regulon on the low copy number cosmid pPPY430 and the hrpL σ factor under lac control on a separate plasmid (23Mansfield J. Jenner C. Hockenhull R. Bennett M.A. Stewart R. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1994; 7: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 38Puri N. Jenner C. Bennett M. Stewart R. Mansfield J. Lyons N. Taylor J. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1997; 10: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MC4100/pPPY430/pHrpL grown in the presence (Fig. 2B, lane 2) but not in the absence (lane 1) of IPTG expressed HrcN. Intracellular HrcN production is coincident with biosynthesis of the extracellular TTS pilus (Fig. 2E, arrows) (9Jin Q. He S.Y. Science. 2001; 294: 2556-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and with the acquisition of pathogenic potential (data not shown) (23Mansfield J. Jenner C. Hockenhull R. Bennett M.A. Stewart R. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1994; 7: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). TTS pili were not present in noninduced cells (Fig. 2D). As expected, expression of control proteins DnaK and SecY remained largely unaltered under both conditions (Fig. 2B). Fractionation of cellular material from induced cells revealed that HrcN is found predominantly in the insoluble membrane fraction together with SecY (lane 3), whereas DnaK is found in the soluble fraction (lane 4). To exclude the possibility that HrcN co-sediments with membranes through nonspecific aggregation, MC4100/pPPY430/pHrpL was grown in the presence (Fig. 2C, lane 2) and in the absence (lane 1) of IPTG, and inner membrane vesicles were prepared (32Chang C.N. Model P. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20106-20111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). HrcN was isolated bound to inner membrane vesicles from cells expressing the TTS regulon (lane 2) but not from the nonexpressing cells (lane 1), whereas the inner membrane protein SecY was present on both vesicle preparations. In summary, our data indicate that HrcN appears to specifically associate with the inner membrane of the cell. To further study HrcN membrane association, we performed α-HrcN immunogold labeling (Fig. 2, F and G). On whole cell thin sections, most (16-fold more) gold particles were localized specifically to the inner face of the cell envelope of E. coli MC4100 expressing the P. syringae phaseolicola TTS (Fig. 2G) rather than to the cytosol. Interestingly, most of the gold particles were clustered (Fig. 2F). Labeling was largely specific to HrcN, since 5-fold fewer gold particles localized to the cell envelope of cells that did not express the TTS regulon (Fig. 2F). Immunogold labeling of the major outer membrane protein A (OmpA) revealed a similar distribution of gold particles (95% of total label) to the cell periphery of both induced (Fig. 2I) and uninduced cells (Fig. 2H). 75–80% of the label localized specifically to the outer membrane leaflet. We conclude that HrcN associates with the inner membrane. HrcN Is a Peripheral Membrane Protein—To examine the nature of HrcN association with the membrane, we employed a number of reagents used routinely to differentiate integral membrane proteins from peripherally associated polypeptides (Fig. 3). Even at modest concentrations, the chaotropes urea (Fig. 3A) and guanidine (Fig. 3B), efficiently removed HrcN (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 6), indicating that the protein is only peripherally associated with the membrane. Other agents removed membrane-bound HrcN less efficiently (Na2CO3; Fig. 3C, lane 8) or not at all (NaCl; lanes 4 and 6), suggesting that HrcN interaction with the membrane is strong. All of the detergents tested extracted and solubilized significant amounts of HrcN from the membrane (Fig. 3, D (lanes 4 and 6) and E (lanes 4, 6, and 8)), although dodecyl maltoside was less efficient (Fig. 3D, lane 8). Finally, trypsinolysis was used to probe accessibility of HrcN at the membrane. Soluble HrcN is particularly sensitive to even low amounts of trypsin and appears by immunostaining with the polyclonal α-HrcN antiserum to be completely digested at trypsin concentrations above 0.1 μg/ml (Fig. 3F, lanes 3 and 4). Protease resistance of an equivalent amount of membrane-bound HrcN (Fig. 3G, lane 1) was significantly enhanced (compare lanes 2–4 of G with lanes 2–4 of F). Nevertheless, no immunostaining of the membrane-bound protein was detectable at trypsin concentrations above 3 μg/ml (Fig. 3G, lane 5), suggesting extensive degradation. Therefore, HrcN bound to the membrane is only partially protected and remains largely protease-accessible. We conclude that HrcN is a peripheral membrane protein that tightly associates with an unknown membrane component(s). HisHrcN Is a Functional ATPase—Is HisHrcN a structurally intact and enzymatically active ATPase? Far UV CD showed that recombinant HisHrcN is folded and extensively α-helical (>40%; Fig. 4A) and melts in three distinct transitions (Tm1 app = 41.3, Tm2 app = 46, and Tm3 app = 62.7 °C; Fig. 4B). This indicated that HisHrcN is structurally intact, and its ATPase function was tested below. HisHrcN hydrolyzes ATP in a linear time-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Increasing the ATP concentration reveals that HisHrcN displays apparent Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics (Fig. 4D and see below), yielding a V max of 40 (μmol of Pi/mg of HisHrcN/min) and an apparent K m of 1.3 mm. HisHrcN ATP hydrolysis was optimal in the presence of Mg2+ but not of other divalent metal ions (Fig. 4E), at pH 8 (Fig. 4F), and at 28 °C (Fig. 4G). Interestingly, HisHrcN ATPase activity was stimulated by increased protein concentration in a nonlinear fashion (Fig. 4H), suggesting that the enzyme may be cooperatively activated by self-association (see below). We conclude that HisHrcN is a highly active ATPase that may be activated by homo-oligomerization. HisHrcN Oligomerization—F1- and V1-ATPases are hexameric (39Kane P.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 40Yoshida M. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). To examine whether HisHrcN also oligomerizes, we investigated its hydrodynamic behavior using size exclusion chromatography (SEC; Fig. 5A) and rate zonal centrifugation (RZC; Fig. 5B). SEC analysis on a Superose 6 resin (exclusion limit >5 MDa; Fig. 5C) revealed four HisHrcN populations with distinct Stokes radii (Table I): Form I (fractions 39–48) presumably monomeric and the most prominent species (∼82%); Form II (fractions 36–39); Form III (fractions 26–34); and Form IV (fractions 19–21). Form II (see Fig. 5A; 150 mm elution) was not always detectable and could not be studied further. Form III, the second most prominent (∼13%), migrated as a broad peak, suggesting a dynamic assembly state. We next examined HisHrcN quaternary organization using RZC (Fig. 5B; see “Experimental Procedures”) (28Tanese N. Methods. 1997; 12: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HisHrcN Form IV and a mixture of Forms I–III were analyzed separately in 20–40% sucrose gradients. The four forms migrated as distinct species with defined sedimentation coefficients (Table I). Sedimentation coefficients (determined by RZC) were combined with Stokes radii (determined by SEC) to provide molecular weights irrespective of shape (Table I; see “Experimental Procedures”) (27Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). These indicate that Form I corresponds to a HisHrcN monomer (M r(app) = 46,700). Form II (M r(app) = ∼300,000) could represent hexamers, and Form III (M r(app) = 570,000–714,000) could represent dodedamers or slightly larger homo-oligomers (Table I). Form IV is a very large species (M r(app) ∼3.8 MDa). To accurately measure the masses of the HisHrcN forms, we employed sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. Scaling up of HisHrcN purification yielded amounts sufficient for analytical ultracentrifugation analysis only of Forms I and III (Fig. 5C; Table I). A single exponential curve optimally fitted to the available data revealed calculated masses for Form I and III of 43.5 kDa (monomer) and 575.8 kDa (11.9 subunits), respectively. HisHrcN Form III from the peak SEC fraction of Fig. 5A was also examined by negative stain transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 5D). Peak fraction 30 contained a distribution of fairly uniform particles (white arrows). Image averaging (inset) reveals a round particle with 13 ± 1-nm outer diameter. Additional less uniform particles are also seen in the micrograph (black arrows). These particles are very large and presumably represent material aggregated during adsorption on the grid. We conclude that HisHrcN oligomerizes into homo-hexa- and dodecameric assemblies in solution in the absence of ligands or other TTS proteins. HisHrcN Form III Is a Highly Active ATPase—To determine whether all forms of HisHrcN were active in ATP hydrolysis, SEC fractions of HisHrcN were assayed for ATPase activity (Fig. 6A). Strikingly, the bulk of the high level ATPase activity was associated with Form III despite the fact that Form III represents only a minor physical population of the enzyme. In contrast, the activity of Form I, the major HisHrcN population, was measurable albeit low. ATPase activities of Forms II and IV were very low and were not studied further. To compare the activities of Forms I and III, we characterized the chromatographic peak fractions by detailed kinetics (Table II). Form I had a K m of 0.1 mm, whereas that of Form III was 10-fold higher. Form I had a low ATP turnover similar to that of other TTS ATPases (15Eichelberg K. Ginocchio C.C. Galan J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4501-4510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fan F. Macnab R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31981-31988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the specific activity (i.e. ATP turnover per protomer) of Form III was more than 700 times that of Form I (Table II).Table IISteady state ATPase kinetics of HisHrcN Forms I (monomer) and III (dodecamer) determined as described (30Sianidis G.

https://openalex.org/W2060904964,"The biological actions of insulin are associated with a rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton within cells in culture. Even though this event requires the participation of actin-binding proteins, the effect of filamin A (FLNa) on insulin-mediated signaling events is still unknown. We report here that human melanoma M2 cells lacking FLNa expression exhibited normal insulin receptor (IR) signaling, whereas FLNa-expressing A7 cells were unable to elicit insulin-dependent Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and p42/44 MAPK activation despite no significant defect in IR-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 or activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT cascade. Insulin-dependent translocation of Shc, SOS1, and MAPK to lipid raft microdomains was markedly attenuated by FLNa expression. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and in vitro binding assays demonstrated that FLNa binds constitutively to IR and that neither insulin nor depolymerization of actin by cytochalasin D affected this interaction. The colocalization of endogenous FLNa with IR was detected at the surface of HepG2 cells. Ectopic expression of a C-terminal fragment of FLNa (FLNaCT) in HepG2 cells blocked the endogenous IR-FLNa interaction and potentiated insulin-stimulated MAPK phosphorylation and transactivation of Elk-1 compared with vector-transfected cells. Expression of FLNaCT had no major effect on insulin-induced phosphorylation of the IR, insulin receptor substrate-1, or AKT, but it elicited changes in actin cytoskeletal structure and ruffle formation in HepG2 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that FLNa interacts constitutively with the IR to exert an inhibitory tone along the MAPK activation pathway.

Insulin is a pleiotropic hormone with multiple integrated metabolic and mitogenic signaling pathways. Upon binding of insulin, the cell surface insulin receptor (IR) 1The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; FLNa, filamin A; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate 1; SH2, Src homology 2 domain; PI3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; MEM, minimum essential medium; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. undergoes autophosphorylation on several tyrosine residues located in the cytoplasmic portion of the β-subunit, with subsequent increase in its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. A number of adaptor proteins, including insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1/2, the Src and collagen homologous (Shc) molecules, Cbl, Gab1, p60Dok, and APS, are recruited to the activated IR through their Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains and become tyrosine-phosphorylated, thus allowing formation of signaling competent complexes subjacent to the inner wall of the plasma membrane (1Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Specificity in signaling is achieved through differences in the ability of IR to interact with these adaptor molecules. The submembranous actin microfilament network links various signaling proteins (e.g. phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Rho family of proteins) that play an important role in membrane trafficking, cellular integrity, and homeostasis (2Okkenhaug K. Vanhaesebroeck B. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2001/65/pe1)PubMed Google Scholar, 3Takenawa T. Itoh T. Biochim. Biophys.

Incidentally, insulin is known to induce rapid dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton to generate the forces necessary for plasma membrane ruffling formation and a host of other cellular processes, including proper insertion of insulin-regulatable glucose transporter 4 in the cell surface (5Khayat Z.A. Tong P. Yaworsky K. Bloch R.J. Klip A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 279-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stabilization of actin network at the periphery of the cytoplasm and its attachment to cellular membranes are orchestrated by actin-binding proteins. The filamin family of actin-binding proteins bind to actin filaments and to a number of macromolecules (reviewed by Stossel et al. (6Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar)), notably small GTPases (7Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) (8Vadlamudi R.K. Li F. Adam L. Nguyen D. Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Filamins are rod-shaped proteins of ∼280 kDa that contain an N-terminal actin-binding domain followed by 24 repeats each of 96 amino acids. Repeat 24 contains the dimerization domain of filamin. Significantly, most of the interactions between filamin and its binding partners occur through the C-terminal end of filamins, thus allowing the interwebbing of actin scaffolds with membrane-bound proteins (6Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Several proteins involved in signal transduction events are partitioned in lipid rafts, a process that allows proper compartmentalization and spatial/temporal organization of functionally competent signaling complexes (9Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 737-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The IR segregates to glycolipid-enriched raft domains of the plasma membrane in a variety of cell types (10Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K.E. Stralfors P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1961-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 11Vainio S. Heino S. Mansson J.E. Fredman P. Kuismanen E. Vaarala O. Ikonen E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Of interest, inducible association of signaling proteins with lipid rafts has been shown to depend on the actin cytoskeleton through a mechanism involving raft coalescence (12Rodgers W. Zavzavadjian J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Valensin S. Paccani S.R. Ulivieri C. Mercati D. Pacini S. Patrussi L. Hirst T. Lupetti P. Baldari C.T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, colocalization of filamin and resident raft proteins, including the scaffolding protein caveolin-1 (14Stahlhut M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), is likely to be of physiological importance in the clustering of lipid rafts and organization of multiple signaling pathways by the actin cytoskeleton. Until now, however, little is known about a role that filamins would play in the transmission of the diverse effects of insulin. In this study, we have investigated the relative contribution of filamin A (FLNa) to the regulation of insulin signaling in human melanoma cell lines (M2 cells) that have spontaneously lost expression of FLNa, and a subline with stable expression of recombinant FLNa (A7 cells) (15Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). By using this cell model, we have found that FLNa expression attenuated insulin mitogenic signaling by selectively inhibiting the recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and subsequent activation of p42/44 MAPK. Of interest, neither early steps in insulin signaling (e.g. IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation) nor the activation of the IRS-1/PI3-kinase/AKT pathway were affected by FLNa. MAPKs transduce a mitogenic signal by phosphorylating transcription factors such as Elk-1, which leads to regulation of critical genes (16Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Our results have indicated also that FLNa binds directly to IR and that ectopic expression of a C-terminal fragment of FLNa disrupts constitutive IR-FLNa interaction in HepG2 cells, thereby inducing a marked increase in insulin-stimulated MAPK phosphorylation and Elk-1 transactivation. These results indicate that FLNa has a negative role in MAPK-mediated Elk-1 transcriptional activation in response to insulin, in part, by interacting directly with the IR.

The resulting 1206-bp BamHI-EcoRI cDNA fragment was inserted into pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST and GST-IR fusion protein were expressed in BL21, induced by 0.5 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The resulting eluates were concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at -70 °C. Translation and product size were verified by analyzing an aliquot of the samples by SDS-PAGE and Colloidal blue staining of the gel, as well as by immunoblot analysis. The integrity of the GST-IR construct was verified by automated sequencing. Cell Treatment—M2 and A7 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.25% sodium bicarbonate, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 8% newborn calf serum, and 2% fetal calf serum and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Before treatment, cells were serum-starved for 18 h in MEM supplemented with 0.1% FBS, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then incubated in Krebs-Ringer phosphate (KRP) buffer. Cells were treated in the absence or the presence of 200 μm orthovanadate for 30 min followed by the addition of 100 nm insulin for periods up to 10 min. In some experiments, cells were stimulated with either 25 nm insulin, 20 nm EGF, 14 nm IGF-1, or 20% FBS for 15 min. These cells were washed in PBS and immersed in liquid nitrogen. The human HepG2 hepatoma cells and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and McCoy's 5A medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient Transfection Assays—HepG2 cells were cultured for 24 h until 60–80% confluence was reached. Transient transfection was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol for the use of LipofectAMINE 2000. In brief, empty expression vector (pcDNA3.1) or expression plasmid encoding HA-FLNaCT was mixed with the transfection reagent and directly added to the culture plates at a ratio of 6 μg/60-mm dish. Twenty four to 48 h later, cells were used for various experiments. Expression of HA-FLNaCT was analyzed in total cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Cells were serum-starved for 18 h and incubated for 30 min with 200 μm orthovanadate prior to 100 nm insulin treatment for 10 min. Elk-1 Transactivation Assay—Transactivation of Elk-1 was examined by the PathDetect Elk-1 trans-Reporting System (Stratagene). In brief, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with pFR-Luc, pFA-Elk-1 and 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase and either 3 μg of pcDNA3.1 or 3 μg of HA-FLNaCT as indicated. Serum-starved cells were left untreated or were stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 24 h. Elk-1 luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured using assay system kits from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase. Detergent-free Isolation of Lipid Rafts—Isolation of lipid rafts was accomplished using a detergent-free sucrose gradient centrifugation method as described previously (19Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Myers Jr., M.G. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In brief, cells from 150-mm culture dishes were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.5 m sodium carbonate, pH 11, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and homogenized by passing cells 15 times through a 23-gauge needle and two 10-s bursts of a sonicator probe on ice. The sucrose concentration in cell extracts was adjusted to 45% (w/w) by the addition of 1.8 volume of 70% (w/w) sucrose prepared in MBS (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl). At the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube, 2 ml of the extracts were placed, followed by the addition of 5 ml of 35% (w/w) and 4 ml of 5% (w/w) sucrose prepared in MBS containing 0.25 m sodium carbonate. After centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor, a total of 11 fractions (1 ml each) were collected from the top of each gradient and used for immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Unless otherwise indicated, cells were scraped in a lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). After 30 min on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the resulting clarified supernatants were collected. Equal amounts of solubilized proteins were incubated with anti-IR (1 μg of each clone), IRS-1 (5 μg), Shc (5 μg), or phosphotyrosine (5 μg) antibody at 4 °C overnight. Alternatively, to detect FLNa-IR association, cells were solubilized in TLB buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture), and the clarified supernatants were incubated with IR antibodies. Then, protein A/G-agarose (Oncogene Science) beads were added, and the incubation was continued at 4 °C for 4 h. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 before solubilization in Laemmli sample buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. In some experiments, cells were lysed directly in Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm orthovanadate. After heating at 70 °C for 10 min, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Detection of individual proteins was carried out by immunoblotting with specific primary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Signals were quantitated by densitometry using the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Thymidine Incorporation—M2 and A7 cells were grown to 75% confluence in 6-well cluster plates. The growth medium was replaced with serum-free MEM for 18 h. Cells were stimulated with insulin at the indicated concentrations (0, 1, 10, and 100 nm) for 18 h and then pulsed with [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 2 μCi/ml, for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS, and DNA was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. After a rapid wash, trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1 m NaOH and then neutralized with HCl. Levels of [3H]thymidine incorporated into DNA were measured in a scintillation counter and expressed as counts/min. Values obtained without insulin stimulation were subtracted from the corresponding values obtained after treatment. GST Pull-down Experiments—HepG2 cell lysates (endogenous FLNa) or 5 μg of purified chicken gizzard FLNa (Research Diagnostics Inc.) were either incubated with anti-FLNa antibodies for 4 h followed by precipitation of the immune complexes with protein A/G-Sepharose beads or incubated for 16 h with 5 μg of GST or 5 μg of GST-IR β-subunit protein preimmobilized onto glutathione-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C in TLB buffer. After a series of washes in TLB buffer, the bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using anti-FLNa antibody. Fluorescence Microscopy—HepG2 cells grown on coverslips were fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with blocking buffer (8% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature, washed in PBS supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with anti-IR β-subunit (1:100), FLNa (1:100), or HA (1:166) antibody for 16 h at 4 °C. After washing, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor secondary antibody (1:1000). For immunolocalization of F-actin, fixed cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated phalloidin (1:20). Nuclear counterstaining was performed by incubating coverslips with Topro-3 in PBS for 5 min prior to mounting slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM-410 inverted confocal microscope with a 63× oil-immersed objective and processed by using the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). No fluorescent staining was observed when the primary antibody was omitted. Statistical Analysis—Quantitative data are presented as mean ± S.E., and differences between the means were determined by analysis of variance coupled to Fisher's least significance difference for multiple mean comparisons. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed with the StatView statistical software program (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Selective Impairment in Insulin Signaling in FLNa-expressing Cells —Insulin elicits rapid autophosphorylation of the IR and tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates, including IRS-1 and Shc proteins, in a number of cell lines. We examined FLNa-deficient M2 cells and FLNa-expressing subline A7 cells for their insulin responsiveness, and we found that both cell lines exhibited a comparable increase in insulin-induced IR autophosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Under basal conditions, cells that were pretreated with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate had very low levels of IRS-1 and Shc tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1, B and C). Addition of insulin elicited a significant increase in IRS-1 phosphorylation in vanadate-pretreated M2 and A7 cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the combination of insulin and vanadate strongly stimulated the levels of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation in M2 cells, while being rather ineffective in the FLNa-expressing A7 cells (Fig. 1C). PI3-kinase is an important enzyme implicated in insulin signal transduction through its interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins (21White M.F. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 119-138PubMed Google Scholar). It is a heterodimeric enzyme encompassing a p85 regulatory subunit and a catalytic subunit (p110). We therefore examined the cosedimentation of p85 in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates to determine whether p85 association to IRS-1 might be affected by FLNa expression. As shown in Fig. 1B, insulin was able to stimulate recruitment of PI3-kinase to IRS-1 both in vanadate-pretreated M2 and A7 cells. Two of the major insulin signaling events initiated downstream of the IR is activation of the PI3-kinase/AKT pathway and Ras/MAPK cascade. To evaluate the involvement of FLNa expression on the regulation of these pathways, we examined the ability of insulin to activate AKT and p42/44 MAPK (also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase, ERK 1/2) by immunoblotting cell lysates with phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 2). The levels of phosphorylation of AKT at Ser-473, a modification required for its activation (22Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), were increased upon stimulation of M2 and A7 cells with insulin. In contrast to AKT, there was a marked attenuation in insulin-induced ERK phosphorylation in FLNa-expressing A7 cells (Fig. 2 upper panel, 9th versus 2nd lane). We then investigated whether the lack of FLNa plays a role in the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in response to other stimuli. Both cell lines were equally responsive to EGF and serum; however, the increase in ERK phosphorylation levels induced by IGF-1 in M2 cells was blocked in FLNa-expressing A7 cells (Fig. 2, upper panel). Similar amounts of ERK protein were present in either cell line (Fig. 2, lower panel). Thus, expression of FLNa differentially affects ERK regulation in response to various stimuli. These results are consistent with a selective effect of FLNa in the signaling pathway used by insulin and IGF-1 to regulate p42/44 MAPK cascade. It is well recognized that phosphorylation of Shc by IR is necessary for activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway and mitogenesis (23Sasaoka T. Rose D.W. Jhun B.H. Saltiel A.R. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13689-13694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to investigate the ability of FLNa to modulate mitogenic responses of insulin, we incubated M2 and A7 cells with increasing concentrations of the hormone for 18 h and measured DNA synthesis. FLNa-depleted M2 cells displayed an enhanced sensitivity to insulin when compared with FLNa-expressing A7 cells (Fig. 3). Both cell lines responded to serum (10%) stimulation by increasing thymidine incorporation to the same levels. The sensitivity of insulin-dependent activation of the Shc/MAPK cascade and the subsequent mitogenic responses to FLNa expression suggest specific perturbation of the signaling pathway proximal to the IR. Effect of FLNa Expression on Cellular Redistribution of Signaling Intermediates—Translocation of the Shc adaptor from the cytosol to lipid raft microdomains leads to MAPK activation (24Plyte S. Majolini M.B. Pacini S. Scarpini F. Bianchini C. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P. Baldari C.T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS1 is prevalently cytosolic and must be brought to the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane in close juxtaposition to Ras to allow GDP/GTP exchange and Ras activation (25Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). To establish whether expression of FLNa could influence the ability of signaling intermediates to be redistributed upon insulin stimulation, lipid rafts were isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation from lysates of M2 and A7 cells and immunoblotted with specific antibodies. Preliminary studies showed that both cell types contained similar levels of signaling molecules, such as Shc, SOS1, ERK, and c-Src (Fig. 4A). Light fractions, enriched in rafts, and heavy fractions, containing most soluble proteins, were first tested by immunoblot with anti-SOS1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4B (panels I and III), endogenous SOS1 was found only in the heavy fractions of unstimulated cells, demonstrating that SOS1 is predominantly in the cytosol. However, addition of insulin resulted in inducible localization of SOS1 in the light fractions of FLNa-depleted M2 cells but not from FLNa-expressing A7 cells (Fig. 4B, panel II versus IV). The latter cells were found to have also impaired translocation of Shc, ERK, and phosphoactive ERK to the membrane rafts following insulin treatment (Fig. 4C). Of importance, FLNa expression did not abrogate the levels of c-Src, and presumably of other raft-associated proteins, in these specialized membrane microdomains (Fig. 4C, bottom panel). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that FLNa plays an important role in insulin-dependent Shc/MAPK cascade signaling at a step proximal to the IR. The IR Is an FLNa-interacting Protein—FLNa interacts with a number of cell surface proteins and intracellular signaling molecules (6Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). We examined whether IR could form a complex with FLNa in intact cells. Our data demonstrated that IR was associated constitutively with FLNa in A7 cells but not in M2 cells that lack FLNa (Fig. 5A, right panels). Insulin treatment did not cause a significant change in the formation of the IR-FLNa complex in A7 cells. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells and HepG2 hepatoma whereby IR-FLNa association was detected under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions (Fig. 5A, left panels). In light of previous evidence supporting the actin-binding properties of FLNa, we sought to examine the role of cytoskeletal organization in the regulation of IR-FLNa association. To this end, HepG2 hepatoma were treated with cytochalasin D, an agent that causes depolymerization of actin (26Tsakiridis"

Originally found in the bacterium Clostridium sticklandii, it contains cysteine residues in the active site and does not require co-factors or other known coenzymes. We recently described the first eukaryotic amino acid (proline) racemase, after isolation and cloning of a gene from the pathogenic human parasiteTrypanosoma cruzi. Although this enzyme is intracellularly located in replicative non-infective forms of T. cruzi, membrane-bound and secreted forms of the enzyme are present upon differentiation of the parasite into non-dividing infective forms. The secreted form of proline racemase is a potent host B-cell mitogen supporting parasite evasion of specific immune responses. Here we describe that the TcPRAC genes in T. cruzi encode functional intracellular or secreted versions of the enzyme exhibiting distinct kinetic properties that may be relevant for their relative catalytic efficiency.

Studies with the enzyme-specific inhibitor and abrogation of enzymatic activity by site-directed mutagenesis of the active site Cys330 residue reinforced the potential of proline racemase as a critical target for drug development against Chagas' disease. Finally, we propose a protein signature for proline racemases and suggest that the enzyme is present in several other pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial genomes of medical and agricultural interest, yet absent in mammalian host, suggesting that inhibition of proline racemases may have therapeutic potential.

Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, various types ofd-amino acids were discovered in a number of small peptides made by a variety of microorganisms through non-ribosomal protein synthesis (2Kleinkauf H. von Dohren H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 259-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that function mainly as antibiotic agents. However, these examples were considered exceptions to the rule of homochirality, and a dogma persisted that only l-amino acid enantiomers were present in eukaryotes, apart from a very low level ofd-amino acids from spontaneous racemization because of aging (3Fisher G.H. Exper. Suppl. 1998; 85: 109-118PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an increasing number of studies have reported the presence of various d-amino acids either as protein-bound (4Nagata Y. Fujiwara T. Kawaguchi-Nagata K. Fukumori Y. Yamanaka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1379: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or under free forms (5Nagata Y. Tanaka K. Iida T. Kera Y. Yamada R. Nakajima Y. Fujiwara T. Fukumori Y. Yamanaka T. Koga Y. Tsuji S. Kawaguchi- Nagata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) in a wide variety of organisms, including mammals. The origin of free d-amino acids is less clear than that of protein bound d-amino acids. For instance, in mammals, free d-amino acids may originate from exogenous sources (as described in Ref. 6Oguri S. Kumazaki M. Kitou R. Nonoyama H. Tooda N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1472: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but the recent discovery of amino acid racemases in eukaryotes has also uncovered an endogenous production of d-amino acids, questioning their specific functions. Thus, the level ofd-aspartate is developmentally regulated in rat embryos (7Neidle A. Dunlop D.S. Life Sci. 1990; 46: 1512-1522Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar); the binding of d-serine toN-methyl-d-aspartate mouse brain receptors promotes neuromodulation (8Schell M.J. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 3948-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 9Wolosker H. Blackshaw S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13409-13414Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) and d-aspartate appears to be involved in hormonal regulation in endocrine tissues (10Nagata Y. Homma H. Matsumoto M. Imai K. FEBS. 1999; 454: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All amino acid racemases require pyridoxal phosphate as a co-factor except proline and hydroxyproline racemases, which are co-factor-independent enzymes. Two reports have been published addressing the biochemical and enzymatic characteristics of the proline racemase from the Gram-positive bacteriumClostridium sticklandii (11Cardinale G.J. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3970-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Rudnick G. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4515-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A reaction mechanism was proposed whereby the active site Cys256 forms a half-reaction site with the corresponding cysteine of the other monomer in the active, homodimeric enzyme.Although a variety of racemases and epimerases has been demonstrated in bacteria and fungi, we recently described the first eukaryotic amino acid (proline) racemase isolated from the infective metacyclic forms of the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease in humans (13Reina-San-Martin B. Degrave W. Rougeot C. Cosson A. Chamond N. Cordeiro-da-Silva A. Arala-Chaves M. Minoprio P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This parasite-secreted proline racemase (TcPRAC) was shown to be a potent mitogen for host B cells and plays an important role inT. cruzi immune evasion and persistence through polyclonal lymphocyte activation (13Reina-San-Martin B. Degrave W. Rougeot C. Cosson A. Chamond N. Cordeiro-da-Silva A. Arala-Chaves M. Minoprio P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This protein, previously annotated as TcPA45, with monomer size of 45 kDa, is only expressed and released by infective metacyclic forms of the parasite. The genomic organization and transcription of TcPRAC proline racemase gene indicated the presence of two homologous genes per haploid genome (TcPRACA and TcPRACB). Furthermore, localization studies using specific antibodies directed to 45-kDa TcPRACprotein revealed that an intracellular and/or membrane-associated isoform, with monomer size of 39 kDa, is expressed in non-infective epimastigote forms of the parasite. Computer-assisted analysis of theTcPRACA gene sequence suggested that it could give rise to both isoforms (45 and 39 kDa) of parasite proline racemases through a mechanism of alternative trans-splicing, one of which would contain a signal peptide (13Reina-San-Martin B. Degrave W. Rougeot C. Cosson A. Chamond N. Cordeiro-da-Silva A. Arala-Chaves M. Minoprio P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, preliminary analysis of putative TcPRACB gene sequences had revealed several differences that include point mutations as compared withTcPRACA but that also suggest that TcPRACB gene could only encode an intracellular isoform of the enzyme as the gene lacks the export signal sequence. Any of these molecular mechanismsper se would ensure the differential expression of intracellular and extracellular isoforms of proline racemases produced in different T. cruzi developmental stages.Primarily it was essential to elucidate whether TcPRACB gene could encode a functional proline racemase. To answer this question we have expressed TcPRACA and TcPRACB paralogue genes in Escherichia coli and performed detailed studies on biochemical and enzymatic characteristics of the recombinant proteins. We show here that TcPRACB indeed encodes a functional proline racemase that exhibits slightly different kinetic parameters and biochemical characteristics when compared with TcPRACA enzyme. Enzymatic activities of the respective recombinant proteins showed that the 39-kDa intracellular isoform of proline racemase produced by TcPRACB construct is more stable and has a higher rate of d-/l-proline interconversion than the 45-kDa isoform produced by TcPRACA. Additionally, the dissociation constant of the enzyme-inhibitor complex (K i ) obtained with pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid, the specific inhibitor of proline racemases, is lower for the recombinantTcPRACB enzyme. Moreover, we show that Cys330 is a key amino acid of the proline racemase active site, because the activity of the enzyme is totally abolished by site-directed mutagenesis of this residue. Finally, multiple alignment of proline racemase amino acid sequences allowed the definition of protein signatures that can be used to identify putative proline racemases in other microorganisms. The significance of the presence of proline racemase in eukaryotes, particularly in T. cruzi, is discussed, as well as the putative consequences of this enzymatic activity in the biology and infectivity of the parasite.DISCUSSIONProline racemase, an enzyme previously only described in protobacterium C. sticklandii (11Cardinale G.J. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3970-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), was shown to be encoded also by the eukaryote T. cruzi, a highly pathogenic protozoan parasite (13Reina-San-Martin B. Degrave W. Rougeot C. Cosson A. Chamond N. Cordeiro-da-Silva A. Arala-Chaves M. Minoprio P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The TcPRAC (T. cruzi proline racemase), formerly called TcPA45, is an efficient mitogen for host B cells and is secreted by the metacyclic forms of the parasite upon infection, contributing to its immune evasion and persistence through nonspecific polyclonal lymphocyte activation (13Reina-San-Martin B. Degrave W. Rougeot C. Cosson A. Chamond N. Cordeiro-da-Silva A. Arala-Chaves M. Minoprio P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Our previous results (13Reina-San-Martin B. Degrave W. Rougeot C. Cosson A. Chamond N. Cordeiro-da-Silva A. Arala-Chaves M. Minoprio P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) suggested thatTcPRAC is encoded by two paralogous genes per haploid genome. Protein localization studies have also indicated that T. cruzi can differentially express intracellular and secreted versions of TcPRAC during cell cycle and differentiation, as the protein is found in the cytoplasm of non-infective replicative (epimastigote) forms of the parasite, and bound to the membrane or secreted in the infective, non-replicative (metacyclic trypomastigote) parasites (13Reina-San-Martin B. Degrave W. Rougeot C. Cosson A. Chamond N. Cordeiro-da-Silva A. Arala-Chaves M. Minoprio P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here we have characterized the two TcPRACparalogs and demonstrated that both TcPRACA andTcPRACB give rise to functional isoforms of co-factor-independent proline racemases, which display different biochemical properties that may well have important implications in the efficiency of the respective enzymatic activities. As suggested previously (11Cardinale G.J. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3970-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 17Fisher L.M. Albery W.J. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Albery W.J. Knowled J.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2572-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) by biochemical and theoretical studies for the bacterial proline racemase, our studies reveal that TcPRAC activities rely on two monomeric enzyme subunits that perform interconversion of l- and/or d-proline enantiomers by a two-base mechanism reaction in which the enzyme removes an α-hydrogen from the substrate and donates a proton to the opposite side of the α-carbon. It has been predicted that each subunit of the homodimer furnishes one of the sulfhydryl groups (18Albery W.J. Knowled J.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2572-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the present work we showed that TcPRAC enzymatic activities are bona fide dependent on the Cys330residue of the active site, as site-specific C330S mutation totally abrogates l- and d-proline racemization, in agreement with our previous demonstration (13Reina-San-Martin B. Degrave W. Rougeot C. Cosson A. Chamond N. Cordeiro-da-Silva A. Arala-Chaves M. Minoprio P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) that TcPRAC enzymatic activity is abolished through alkylation with iodoacetate or iodoacetamine, similarly to the Clostridium proline racemase, where carboxymethylation was shown to occur specifically with the two cysteines of the reactive site leading to enzyme inactivation (12Rudnick G. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4515-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although gene sequence analysis predicted that by a mechanism of alternative splicing TcPRACA could generate both intracellular and secreted versions of parasite proline racemase, our present studies demonstrate that TcPRACB gene sequenceper se codes for a protein lacking the amino acids involved in peptide signal formation and an extra N-terminal domain present in TcPRACA protein, resembling more closely the CsPR. Thus,TcPRACB can only generate an intracellular version ofTcPRAC proline racemase.Interestingly, the presence of two homologous copies ofTcPRAC genes in the T. cruzi genome, coding for two similar but with distinct specific biochemical properties, could reflect an evolutionary mechanism of gene duplication and a parasite strategy to ensure a better environmental flexibility. This assumption is comforted by the potential of TcPRACA gene to generate two related protein isoforms by alternative splicing, a mechanism that is particularly adept for cells that must respond rapidly to environmental stimuli. Primarily, trans-splicing appears indeed to be an ancient process that may constitute a selective advantage for split genes in higher organisms (19Breitbart R.E. Andreadis A. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 467-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and alternativetrans-splicing was only proven to occur in T. cruzi recently (20Manning-Cela R. Gonzalez A. Swindle J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4726-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As an alternative for promoter selection, the regulated production of intracellular and/or secreted isoforms of proline racemase in T. cruzi by alternativetrans-splicing of TcPRACA gene would allow the stringent conservation of a constant protein domain and/or the possibility of acquisition of an additional secretory region domain. As a matter of fact, our recent investigations using RT-PCR based strategy and a common 3′ probe to TcPRACA and TcPRACBsequences combined to a 5′ spliced leader oligonucleotide followed by cloning and sequencing of the resulting fragments have indeed proved that an intracellular version of TcPRAC may also originate from the TcPRACA gene, corroborating this hypothesis. 2N. Chamond, N. Coatnoan, J. C. Barale, A. Cosson, A. Berneman, W. Degrave, and P. Minoprio, manuscript in preparation., 3The proline racemase/B-cell mitogen of T. cruzi is a virulence factor whose mRNA is regulated differentially through development by alternative splicing.Gene duplication is a relatively common event in T. cruzi that adds complexity to parasite genomic studies. Moreover, TcPRAC chromosomal mapping revealed two chromosomal bands that possess more than three chromosomes each and that may indicate that proline racemase genes are mapped in size-polymorphic homologous chromosomes, an important finding for proline racemase gene family characterization. Preliminary results in this laboratory have, for instance, revealed that T. cruziDM28c type I strain maps proline racemase genes to the same chromoblot regions identified with T. cruzi CL type II strain used in the present work. Other isolates of the parasites are presently under investigation (data not shown).It is well known that proline constitutes an important source of energy for several organisms, such as several hemoflagellates (21Krassner S.M. Flory B. J. Protozool. 1972; 19: 917-920Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Bowman I.B.R. Srivastava H.K. Flynn I.W. Van den Bossche H. Comparative Biochemistry of Parasites. Academic Press, New York1972Google Scholar, 23Evans D.A. Brown R.C. J. Protozool. 1972; 19: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and for flight muscles in insects (24Auerswald L. Schneider P. Gade G. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 2333-2342PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a proline oxidase system was suggested in trypanosomes (25Sylvester D. Krassner S.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1976; 55: 443-447Google Scholar), and the studies reporting the abundance of proline in triatominae guts (26de Isola E.L. Lammel E.M. Katzin V.J. Gonzalez Cappa S.M. J. Parasitol. 1981; 67: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have implicated proline in metabolic pathways of T. cruzi parasites, as well as in its differentiation in the digestive tract of the insect vector (27Contreras V.T. Salles J.M. Thomas N. Morel C.M. Goldenberg S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Thus, it is well accepted that T. cruzi can usel-proline as a principal source of carbon (25Sylvester D. Krassner S.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1976; 55: 443-447Google Scholar). Moreover, our preliminary results using parasites cultured in defined media indicate that both epimastigotes, found in the vector, and infective metacyclic trypomastigote forms can efficiently metabolizel- or d-proline as the sole source of carbon (not shown). Although certain reports indicate that biosynthesis of proline occurs in trypanosomes, i.e. via reduction of glutamate carbon chains or transamination reactions, our results reveal that an additional and direct physiological regulation of proline might exist in the parasite to control amino acid oxidation and its subsequent degradation or yet to allow proline utilization. In fact, a recent report (28Silber A.M. Tonelli R.R. Martinelli M. Colli W. Alves M.J. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2002; 49: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) showed two active proline transporter systems inT. cruzi. We suggest that T. cruzi proline racemase may possibly play a consequential role in the regulation of intracellular proline metabolic pathways, or else it could participate in mechanisms of post-translational addition of d-amino acid to polypeptide chains. On one hand, these hypotheses would allow for an energy gain and, on the other hand, would permit the parasite to evade host responses. In this respect, it was reported that a singled-amino acid addition in the N terminus of a protein is sufficient to confer general resistance to lytic reactions involving host proteolytic enzymes (29Janeway C.A. Humphrey J.H. Folia Biol. (Prague). 1970; 16: 156-172PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of proteins containingd-amino acids in the parasite membrane would benefit the parasite inside host cell lysosomes, in addition to the contribution to the initiation of polyclonal activation, as described previously (30Mozes E. Kohn L.D. Hakim F. Singer D.S. Science. 1993; 261: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,31Sela M. Zisman E. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) for polymers composed of d-enantiomers. Althoughd-amino acid inclusion in T. cruzi proteins would benefit the parasite, this hypothesis remains to be proven, and direct evidences are technically difficult to obtain.It is worth noting that metacyclogenesis of epimastigotes into infective metacyclic forms involves parasite morphologic changes that include the migration of the kinetoplast, a structure that is physically linked to the parasite flagellum, and many other significant metabolic alterations that combine to confer infectivity/virulence to the parasite (13Reina-San-Martin B. Degrave W. Rougeot C. Cosson A. Chamond N. Cordeiro-da-Silva A. Arala-Chaves M. Minoprio P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 32Contreras V.T. Morel C.M. Goldenberg S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 14: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Proline racemase was shown to be preferentially localized in the flagellar pocket of infective parasite forms after metacyclogenesis (13Reina-San-Martin B. Degrave W. Rougeot C. Cosson A. Chamond N. Cordeiro-da-Silva A. Arala-Chaves M. Minoprio P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), as are many other known proteins secreted and involved in early infection (33Souto-Padron T. Reyes M.B. Leguizamon S. Campetella O.E. Frash A.C. de Souza W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 272-278PubMed Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that parasite proline racemase may function as an early mediator for T. cruzi differentiation through intracellular modification of internalized environmental free proline, as suggested above and already observed in some bacterial systems. As an illustration, exogenous alanine has been described as playing an important role in bacterial transcriptional regulation by controlling an operon formed by genes coding for alanine racemase and a smaller subunit of bacterial dehydrogenase (34Janes B.K. Bender R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 563-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In bacteria, membrane alanine receptors are responsible for alanine and proline entry into the bacterial cell (35de Jong M.H. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 824-827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We can then hypothesize that the availability of proline in the insect gut milieu associated to a mechanism of environmental sensing by specific receptors in the parasite membrane would stand for parasite proline uptake and its further intracellular racemization. Proline racemase would then play a fundamental role in the regulation of parasite growth and differentiation by its participation in both metabolic energetic pathways and the expression of proteins containingd-proline, as described above, consequently conferring parasite infectivity and its ability to escape host-specific responses.Thus far, and contrasting to the intracellular isoform ofTcPRAC found in epimastigote forms of T. cruzi, the ability of metacyclic and bloodstream forms of the parasite to express and secrete proline racemase may have further implications in host/parasite interaction. In fact, the parasite-secreted isoform of proline racemase participates actively in the induction of nonspecific polyclonal B-cell responses upon host infection (13Reina-San-Martin B. Degrave W. Rougeot C. Cosson A. Chamond N. Cordeiro-da-Silva A. Arala-Chaves M. Minoprio P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and favors parasite evasion, thus ensuring its persistence in the host. As described for other mitogens and parasite antigens (36Shakibaei M. Frevert U. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 37Burleigh B.A. Andrews N.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 38Gao W. Wortis H.H. Pereira M.A. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and in addition to its mitogenic property, TcPRAC could also be involved in modifications of host cell targets enabling better parasite attachment to host cell membranes, in turn assuring improved infectivity. Because several reports associate accumulation ofl-proline with muscular dysfunction (39Martin D. Ault B. Nadler J.V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 219: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and inhibition of muscle contraction (40Van Harreveld A. J. Neurobiol. 1980; 11: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the release of proline racemase by intracellular parasites could alternatively contribute to the maintenance of infection through regulation of l-proline concentration inside host cells, as proline was described as essential for the integrity of muscular cell targets. Therefore, we have demonstrated recently that transgenic parasites hyperexpressingTcPRACA or TcPRACB genes, but not functional knock-outs, are five to ten times more infective to host target cells, pointing to a critical role of proline racemases in the ongoing of the infectious process.2,3 Likewise, previous reports (41Thompson R.J. Bouwer H.G. Portnoy D.A. Frankel F.R. Infect. Immunol. 1998; 66: 3552-3561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that genetic inactivation of Lysteria monocytogenes alanine racemase and d-amino acid oxidase genes abolishes bacterial pathogenicity, because the presence of d-alanine is required for the synthesis of the mucopeptide component of the cell wall that protects virtually all bacteria from the external milieu.Present analysis using identified critical conserved residues inTcPRAC and C. sticklandii proline racemase genes and the screening of SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL databases led us to define of a minimal signature for proline racemases, DRSPXGX[GA]XXAXXA, and to confirm the presence of putative proteins in at least ten distinct organisms. Screening of unfinished genome sequences showed highly homologous proline racemase candidate genes in an additional 9 organisms, among which are the fungus A. fumigatus and the bacteria B. anthracis and C. botulinum. This is of particular interest, because racemases, but not proline racemases, are widespread in bacteria and only recently described in more complex organisms such as T. cruzi (42Wolosker H. Sheth K.N. Takahashi M. Mothet J.P. Brady Jr., R.O. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 43Watanabe T. Shibata K. Kera Y. Yamada R. Amino Acids. 1998; 14: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These findings may possibly reflect cell adaptative responses to extracellular stimuli and uncover more general mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression by d-amino acids in eukaryotes. Our finding of similar genes in human and mouse genome databases when we used less stringent signatures for proline racemase is striking. However, the absence of the crucial amino acid cysteine in the putative active site of those predicted proteins suggests a different functionality than that of a proline racemase.Finally, we described here that TcPRAC isoforms are highly stable and have the capacity to perform their activities across a large spectrum of pH. In addition, the affinity of pyrrol-carboxylic acid, a specific inhibitor of proline racemase, is higher for TcPRAC enzymes than for CsPR. Because proline racemase is a protein involved in the mechanisms leading to T. cruzi immune evasion, our work should stimulate further studies on biochemical and molecular characterization of putative proline racemases in other microorganisms and draw attention to their importance as potential targets for drug development. d-Amino acids have long been described in the cell wall of Gram-positive and especially Gram-negative bacteria, where they constitute essential elements of the peptidoglycan and as substitutes of cell wall techoic acids (1Lamzin V.S. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, various types ofd-amino acids were discovered in a number of small peptides made by a variety of microorganisms through non-ribosomal protein synthesis (2Kleinkauf H. von Dohren H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 259-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that function mainly as antibiotic agents. However, these examples were considered exceptions to the rule of homochirality, and a dogma persisted that only l-ami"
https://openalex.org/W2087858299,"The mechanisms underlying the anti-tumorigenic properties of cyclooxygenase inhibitors are not well understood. One novel hypothesis is alterations in gene expression. To test this hypothesis sulindac sulfide, which is used to treat familial adenomatous polyposis, was selected to detect gene modulation in human colorectal cells at physiological concentrations with microarray analysis. At micromolar concentrations, sulindac sulfide stimulated apoptosis and inhibited the growth of colorectal cancer cells on soft agar. Sulindac sulfide (10 μm) altered the expression of 65 genes in SW-480 colorectal cancer cells, which express cyclooxygenase-1 but little cyclooxygenase-2. A more detailed study of 11 genes revealed that their expression was altered in a time- and dose-dependent manner as measured by real-time RT-PCR. Northern analysis confirmed the expression of 9 of these genes, and Western analysis supported the conclusion that sulindac sulfide altered the expression of these proteins. Cyclooxygenase-deficient HCT-116 cells were more responsive to sulindac sulfide-induced gene expression than SW-480 cells. However, this response was diminished in HCT-116 cells overexpressing cyclooxygenase-1 compared with normal HCT-116 cells suggesting the presence of cyclooxygenase attenuates this response. However, prostaglandin E2, the main product of cyclooxygenase, only suppressed the sulindac sulfide-induced expression of two genes, with little known biological function while it modulated the expression of two more. The most likely explanation for this finding is the metabolism of sulindac sulfide to inactive metabolites by the peroxidase activity of cyclooxygenase. In conclusion, this is the first report showing sulindac sulfide, independent of cyclooxygenase, altered the expression of several genes possibly linked to its anti-tumorigenic and pro-apoptotic activity.

Colorectal cancer is the third leading cancer in the United States. Numerous review articles of population-based studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies with human colorectal carcinoma cells indicate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 1The abbreviations used are: NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; Cox, cyclooxygenase; RT, reverse transcription; NAG-1, NSAID-activated gene-1; DIM, diindoylmethane; pDNA, plasmid DNA; cDNA, complimentary DNA; mRNA, messenger RNA; UNG, uracil-N-glycosylase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FBS, fetal bovine serum; SFM, serum-free medium; EST, expressed sequence tag; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; ATF3, activating transcription factor 3; C/EBPβ, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-β; INSIG1, insulin-induced gene 1; MSX1, Msh homeo box homolog 1; MAD2, mitotic arrest deficient-like 1; NRG-1, NSAID regulated gene-1.1The abbreviations used are: NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; Cox, cyclooxygenase; RT, reverse transcription; NAG-1, NSAID-activated gene-1; DIM, diindoylmethane; pDNA, plasmid DNA; cDNA, complimentary DNA; mRNA, messenger RNA; UNG, uracil-N-glycosylase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; FBS, fetal bovine serum; SFM, serum-free medium; EST, expressed sequence tag; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; ATF3, activating transcription factor 3; C/EBPβ, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-β; INSIG1, insulin-induced gene 1; MSX1, Msh homeo box homolog 1; MAD2, mitotic arrest deficient-like 1; NRG-1, NSAID regulated gene-1. such as sulindac have anti-tumorigenic activity directed against colorectal cancer (1Taketo M.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1529-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 2Taketo M.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 3Gwyn K.

NSAIDs are known for their anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of cyclooxygenase (Cox), which is responsible for the formation of prostaglandins (5Hinz B. Brune K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). There are at least two distinct forms of Cox, the constitutively expressed Cox-1 and the inducible Cox-2. Most of the studies demonstrating that Cox inhibitors have anti-cancer activity used classic NSAIDs that inhibit both Cox-1 and Cox-2. Moreover, classic Cox inhibitors such as sulindac sulfide and indomethacin are more potent inhibitors of Cox-1. However, more recent studies in animal models initiated in part due to the toxicity of non-selective Cox inhibitors suggest that specific Cox-2 inhibitors also inhibit the development of cancer. The anti-tumorigenic activity of NSAIDs may be dependent on the inhibition of Cox activity (6Boolbol S.K. Dannenberg A.J. Chadburn A. Martucci C. Guo X.J. Ramonetti J.T. Abreu-Goris M. Newmark H.L. Lipkin M.L. DeCosse J.J. Bertagnolli M.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2556-2560PubMed Google Scholar), but other results suggest that the anti-cancer activity of NSAIDs might be independent of Cox inhibition (7Yamazaki R. Kusunoki N. Matsuzaki T. Hashimoto S. Kawai S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Richter M. Weiss M. Weinberger I. Furstenberger G. Marian B.

Melanoma Res. 2001; 11: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that both Cox-dependent and Cox-independent mechanisms could contribute to the anti-cancer effect of NSAIDs (12Levy G.N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).Of all the various NSAIDs reported to inhibit the development of tumors, sulindac appears to be very effective at inhibiting tumor development in experimental animals. Sulindac is not an inhibitor of Cox, but its metabolite sulindac sulfide is a potent non-selective inhibitor of Cox. Sulindac sulfide inhibits the growth of tumor cells in soft agar (13Zhang X.

In addition, sulindac and, hence, its metabolite, sulindac sulfide, are currently used to suppress the development of adenomatous polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (23Winde G. Gumbinger H.G. Osswald H. Kemper F. Bunte H. Int. J. Colorectal Dis. 1993; 8: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, understanding the mechanisms responsible for the anti-tumorigenic activity of sulindac sulfide and other NSAIDs is lacking.This laboratory has proposed the hypothesis that the anti-tumorigenic activity of Cox inhibitors is mediated, in part, by altering gene expression either dependent or independent of Cox inhibition. Previously, our laboratory utilized subtractive hybridization to study changes in gene expression by NSAIDs and identified a novel member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily with several names, including NAG-1 (NSAIDs-activated gene-1), PLAB, PTGFB, PDF, MIC-1, and HP00269 (24Baek S.J.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Sulindac sulfide is one of the most potent NSAIDs both in terms of its ability to induce NAG-1 expression and its ability to induce apoptosis in Cox-deficient HCT-116 cells (25Baek S.J. Kim K.S. Nixon J.B. Wilson L.C. Eling T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Although NAG-1 has potent anti-tumorigenic activity as overexpression of NAG-1 induces apoptosis in cultured cells and suppresses xenograft growth in nude mice (25Baek S.J. Kim K.S. Nixon J.B.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), it is likely only one of several genes involved in the pro-apoptotic and anti-tumorigenic effects of sulindac sulfide. In this report, we ask the following: Does sulindac sulfide alter the expression of other genes involved in either apoptosis, cell proliferation, and/or anti-tumorigenicity, and are these changes in gene expression dependent on Cox? We report here that sulindac sulfide increases and represses the expression of a number of genes with potential responsibility for the pro-apoptotic, anti-tumorigenic activity of sulindac sulfide. This is the first report showing alterations in gene expression in colorectal cancer cells at physiological concentrations of NSAIDs using microarray technology.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted. Indomethacin was from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). NSAIDs were dissolved in Me2SO and prepared fresh weekly. Prostaglandin E2 was dissolved in ethanol.Cell Lines and Reagents—Cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and were maintained at 37 °C/5%CO2. Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD). Human colorectal carcinoma SW-480 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mg/liter gentamicin, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Human colorectal carcinoma HCT-116 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 mg/liter gentamicin.Cell Culture Treatments—Cells were plated at 50% confluency in complete media for 24 h and treated in serum-free media containing vehicle or drug unless otherwise indicated for 0, 4, 8, or 24 h as indicated.Cell Proliferation—Cell proliferation was measured using the MTS colorimetric assay by Promega (Madison, WI) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were treated with various concentrations of vehicle or sulindac sulfide in complete media containing 10% (HCT-116) or 15% (SW-480) FBS. Each experiment was carried out in quintuplet and repeated two times. Percent viability was calculated from mean OD of 490 ± S.E. A representative experiment is shown.Measurement of DNA Content and Apoptosis—The DNA contents for vehicle or sulindac sulfide-treated SW-480 and HCT-116 cells were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cells were plated at 50% confluency in 6-well plates overnight then treated in SFM or media containing 2% FBS in the presence of various concentrations of sulindac sulfide or vehicle for various time points in triplicate repeated two or more times. Cells fixed in ethanol were stained with propidium iodine as previously reported (26Bottone Jr., F.G. Baek S.J. Nixon J.B. Eling T.E. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), whereas living cells were stained with Annexin V and propidium iodine (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both assays were analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACSort sorter equipped with CellQuest™ software according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurements are -fold increases over vehicle-treated time-matched controls.Soft Agar Cloning Assay in the Presence of NSAIDs—Soft agar assays were performed to compare the clonogenic potential of colorectal cancer cells in semisolid medium. HCT-116 and SW-480 cells were resuspended at 6000 cells in 2 ml of warm media containing 0.35% agarose, and the final concentration of sulindac sulfide or vehicle was tested in appropriate media and plated on top of 1 ml of 0.5% agarose in six-well plates. Plates were incubated for 3 weeks at 37 °C/5% CO2. Cell colonies were visualized following an overnight stain with 0.5 ml of p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet at room temperature then image-captured using a color charge-coupled device camera equipped with a personal computer loaded with Adobe® Photoshop® (San Jose, CA).RNA Isolation—Following treatments, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, then RNA was isolated using the Qiagen (Valencia, CA) RNeasy MIDI or MINI kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysis was performed using an electric homogenizer for microarray or by centrifugation through a Qia-shredder (Qiagen) for real-time RT-PCR.Microarray Hybridization and Analysis—A cDNA Human 12K Chip, developed in-house at the NIEHS Microarray Group, was used for gene expression profiling experiments. A complete listing of the genes on this chip is available at dir.niehs.nih.gov/microarray/chips.htm. cDNA microarray chips were prepared according to DeRisi et al. (27DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The spotted cDNAs were derived from a collection of sequence-verified IMAGE clones that covered the 3′-end of the gene and ranged in size from 500 to 2000 bp (Research Genetics, Birmingham, AL). M13 primers were used to amplify insert cDNAs from purified plasmid DNA (pDNA) in a 100-μl PCR reaction mixture. A sample of the PCR products (10 μl) was separated on 2% agarose gels to ensure quality of the amplifications. The remaining PCR products were purified by ethanol precipitation, resuspended in ArrayIt buffer (Telechem, San Jose, CA), and spotted onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides using a modified, robotic DNA arrayer (Beecher Instruments, Bethesda, MD). Each total RNA sample (35 μg) was labeled with cyanine 3 (Cy3) or cyanine 5 (Cy5)-conjugated dUTP (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) by a reverse transcription reaction using the reverse transcriptase, SuperScript (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the primer, oligo(dT) (Amersham Biosciences). The fluorescent-labeled cDNAs were mixed and hybridized simultaneously to the cDNA microarray chip. Each RNA pair was hybridized to a total of four arrays employing a fluor reversal accomplished by labeling the control sample with Cy3 in two hybridizations and with Cy5 in the other two hybridizations. The cDNA chips were scanned with an Axon Scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) using independent laser excitation of the two fluors at 532- and 635-nm wavelengths for the Cy3 and Cy5 labels, respectively. The raw pixel intensity images were analyzed using the ArraySuite v1.3 extensions of the IPLab image processing software package (Scanalytics, Inc., Fairfax, VA). This program uses methods that were developed to locate targets on the array, to measure local background for each target and subtract it from the target intensity value, and to identify differentially expressed genes using a probability-based method. We measured the pixel intensity level of “blank” spots comprised of spotting solution. The data were then filtered to provide a cut-off at the intensity level just above the blank measurement values to remove from further analyses those genes having one or more intensity values in the background range. After pixel intensity determination and background subtraction, the ratio of the intensity of the treated cells to the intensity of the control was calculated following normalization. A probability distribution was fit to the data and used to calculate a 99% confidence interval for the ratio intensity values. Genes having normalized ratio intensity values outside of this interval were considered significantly differentially expressed.For each of the four replicate arrays for each sample, lists of differentially expressed genes at the 99% confidence levels were created and deposited into the NIEHS MAPS data base (28Bushel P.R. Hamadeh H. Bennett L. Sieber S. Martin K. Nuwaysir E.F. Johnson K. Reynolds K. Paules R.S. Afshari C.A. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 564-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For each time point, a query of the data base yielded a list of genes that were differentially expressed in at least three of the four replicate experiments. Any of these genes that indicated fluor bias or high variation were not considered for further analysis. Mean values are from all valid replicates. Assuming that the replicate hybridizations are independent, a calculation using the binomial probability distribution indicated that the probability of a single gene appearing on this list when there was no real differential expression is negligible. The entire dataset is available at dir.niehs.nih.gov/microarray/datasets.Reverse Transcription—For real-time RT-PCR assays, the RNA was treated with 1 unit of amplification grade deoxyribonuclease I (Life Technologies) per microgram of RNA to remove genomic DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2 μg of the RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase then treated with RNase H according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT was performed using Qiagen's Omniscript reverse transcription kit (for realtime RT-PCR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A negative control containing all of the RT reagents in the absence of RT enzyme (no RT control) was also routinely performed.Primer Design—Primers were designed using PrimerExpress Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers were from Invitrogen and dissolved in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0. Primers are listed as follows: accession number (common name): forward primer, reverse primer (base pairs). For real-time RT-PCR: H26183 (C/EBPβ): CGCAACCCACGTGTAACTGT, CAAAAAGCCCGTAGGAACATCT (68); H59620 (INSIG1): CCTTTGGTGGACATTTGATCGT, GCGTAGCTAGAAAAGCTATGGTGAT (72); AA064973 (myozenin): AGCTTAAAGTAGGACAACCATGGA, GACACTTCTCTTGACCTTAGGATAATAGC (84); T78868 (nucleoporin): ACGCGATCAGTGGGTTCTG, GGTGATCCCCTGGTGTATGG (74); R34224 (EST): CATGCATACATTTTTACAGAGTTGTGA, CAATGTTACTTGGAAAACTAGATGTCAAT (83); R20886 (stanniocalcin 2): GCTCCTGGACTGGATGTGTGA, TCAGTAGGCGAACACATAAAACATTT (77); H21041 (ATF3): AAGAACGAGAAGCAGCATTTGAT, TTCTGAGCCCGGACAATACAC (71); AA682897 (RAP1, GTPase-activating protein 1): CCAAGTGCCGGACATACCAT, CCATCTGGACAACATTAGGGAACT (72); AA598794 (connective tissue growth factor): GCTACCACATTTCCTACCTAGAAATCAG, GACAGTCCGTCAAAACAGATTGTT (84); AA427688 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory subunit A): GACCAGGATGTGGACGTCAAA, TCCAGCATCAGGCGAGAGA (70); AA187351 (ribonucleotide reductase M2 polypeptide): GCAGCAAGCGATGGCATAGT, GGGCTTCTGTAATCTGAACTTC (74); AA045226 (MSX1): GGATCAGACTTCGGAGAGTGAACT, GCCTTCCCTTTAACCCTCACA (75); AA481076 (MAD2): ACTTAAATATCTCCCTACCTATACTGAGTCAA, TAGTAACTGTAGATGGAAAAACTTGTGCTA (107); R33154 (EST): GTACACACAATCCCTTCCAAAGG, TGTTGCAAGGGTGGGTTGA (141); AA040248 (dynein, cytoplasmic, light polypeptide): TCATGTGTCACATAACTACCGAAGTTC, TTGCCAGGGAGGTACAATCC (71); W31629 (interferon-related developmental regulator 1): CAGATGTTAAGGTTAGCAACCTTTCTG, GTACTTAAAAGCCGATTCGA (88); AA450062 (NAG-1): TGCCCGCCAGCTACAATC, TCTTTGGCTAACAAGTCATCATAGGT (88); W68220 (NRG-1/KIAA0101): GCTCGAGCCCCCAGAAAG, CCTCGATGAAACTGATGTCGAA (69); actin: CCTGGCACCCAGCACAAT, GCCGATCCACACGGAGTACT (70). For traditional RT-PCR: Cox-1: CCTCATGTTTGCCTTCTTTGC, GGCGGGTACATTTCTCCATC (207); Cox-2: CTTTGCCCAGACCTTCA, CTAGCCAGAGTTTCACCGTAA (120); actin: CGGGGACCTGACTGACTACC, AGGAAGGCTGGAAGAGTGC (248).Traditional and Real-time RT-PCR with SYBR Green Detection— Traditional and real-time RT-PCR were performed as previously described (29Rajeevan M.S. Vernon S.D. Taysavang N. Unger E.R. J. Mol. Diagn. 2001; 3: 26-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) using an ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems). Real-time RT-PCR fluorescence detection was performed in 96-well plates using Quantitect SYBR Green buffer (Qiagen). Each 50-μl PCR reaction contained cDNA, 0.5 unit of Amp Erase uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), forward and reverse primers, and the Passive Reference dye (ROX) to normalize the SYBR Green/double-stranded DNA complex signal during analysis to correct for well-to-well variations. Primer concentrations were optimized to yield the lowest concentration of primers that yielded the same C t values as recommended by Applied Biosystems. A no RT control RNA sample was used with each real-time RT-PCR experiment containing human actin primers to verify no genomic DNA contamination. Amplification parameters were UNG incubation, for one cycle at 50 °C for 2 min to prevent amplification of carryover DNA; denaturation/UNG inactivation at 94 °C for 10 min; amplification, 40 cycles of 95 °C/15 s and 60 °C/30 s. Amplification products using SYBR Green detection were routinely checked using dissociation curve software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel then visualized under UV light following staining with 0.05% ethidium bromide to confirm the size of the DNA fragment and that only one product was formed. Samples were compared using the relative (comparative) C t method to validate microarray results. The C t value, which is inversely proportional to the initial template copy number, is the calculated cycle number where the fluorescence signal emitted is significantly above background levels. The -fold induction or repression by real-time RT-PCR was measured in triplicate relative to time-matched vehicle-treated controls and calculated after adjusting for actin using 2–ΔΔCt, where Δ C t = target gene C t – actin C t, and ΔΔ C t = Δ C t control – Δ C t treatment.Sequence Confirmation—One microliter of a PCR reaction generated from each primer pair was cloned into Escherichia coli using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) in duplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cloned cDNA inserts were then sequenced by dRhodamine and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were determined following gel electrophoresis by the DNA sequencing facility at NIEHS (Research Triangle Park, NC). Results were verified using a nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST search on the NCBI website.Northern Blot Detection—Sequence-verified clones provided by the NIEHS microarray group and purchased from Research Genetics (Invitrogen) were used to generate cDNA probes for Northern blots. They were grown on LB agar plus 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and individual colonies were selected and grown in LB broth at 37 °C for 16 h. The pDNA was isolated using the QIAprep Miniprep kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of pDNA was digested to release the cDNA insert using the appropriate restriction enzymes (Promega) according to the gene accession number online at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Following electrophoresis, cDNA inserts were excised and column-purified using a QIAquick Spin kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a DECA-prime II kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Probes were column-purified using a G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences). 20 μg of RNA from vehicle or sulindac sulfide-treated SW-480 cells was subjected to Northern blots analysis as previously described (30Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Lee C.H. Eling T.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 1126-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The signal was detected by autoradiography using Biomax MS film and an intensifying screen for several hours as appropriate (Kodak, Rochester, NY). Each membrane was also hybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (Ambion) to verify equal loading.Tissue Collection and Sample Preparation—Surgically resected colorectal tumor samples (adenocarcinomas) and matched adjacent normal tissues were obtained from the University of North Carolina at the Chapel Hill Comprehensive Cancer Center. Tissue was obtained with the approval of the University of North Carolina and NIEHS/National Institutes of Health, and local boards governing research on human subjects as previously described by our laboratory (31Kim K.S.

Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1388-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Western Blotting—Proteins from tissue culture cells (20 μg) were isolated as previously described (26Bottone Jr., F.G. Baek S.J. Nixon J.B. Eling T.E. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and human tissues (50 μg) also isolated as previously described (31Kim K.S. Baek S.J.

Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1388-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and stained with Ponceau S to verify equal loading. Blots were blocked overnight with 10% skim milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and probed for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T with 5% milk containing Cox-1, Cox-2 (Cayman), ATF3, MAD2, C/EBPβ, MSX1, or actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA). Blots were washed in TBS-T then treated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T containing 5% milk and washed several times in TBS-T. The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence purchased from (Amersham Biosciences) and followed by autoradiography. Where necessary, blots were stripped of antibody before reuse while sealed in a plastic bag containing a solution of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min with constant agitation in a 50 °C water bath followed by washing in TBS-T.Statistical Analyses—Real-time RT-PCR was performed in triplicate with individual time-matched vehicle-treated controls for each gene tested. Statistical significance was determined according to a one-sided t test with a 0.025 level of significance on C t values following adjustment for actin, because only gene modulation in the same direction as the microarray data were considered significant.Densitometry Measurements—Autoradiograms from Western blots were scanned using a Umax™ Powerlook III™ scanner equipped with a transparency adapter and scanning software. Bands were quantitated using Scion Image™ beta version 4.0.2 and cut to size for publication without modification and labeled using Adobe® Photoshop® version 5.0.RESULTSSulindac"
https://openalex.org/W1975793508,"Cell growth control by interferons (IFNs) involves up-regulation of the tumor suppressor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). To exert its anti-proliferative effects, this factor must ultimately control transcription of several key genes that regulate cell cycle progression. Here we show that the G1/S phase-related cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) gene is a novel proliferation-related downstream target of IRF1. We find that IRF1, but not IRF2, IRF3, or IRF7, selectively represses CDK2 gene transcription in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We delineate the IRF1-responsive repressor element between nt –68 to –31 of the CDK2 promoter. For comparison, the tumor suppressor p53 represses CDK2 promoter activity independently of IRF1 through sequences upstream of nt –68, and the CDP/cut/Cux1 homeodomain protein represses transcription down-stream of –31. Thus, IRF1 repression represents one of three distinct mechanisms to attenuate CDK2 levels. The –68/–31 segment lacks a canonical IRF responsive element but contains a single SP1 binding site. Mutation of this element abrogates SP1-dependent enhancement of CDK2 promoter activity as expected but also abolishes IRF1-mediated repression. Forced elevation of SP1 levels increases endogenous CDK2 levels, whereas IRF1 reduces both endogenous SP1 and CDK2 protein levels. Hence, IRF1 represses CDK2 gene expression by interfering with SP1-dependent transcriptional activation. Our findings establish a causal series of events that functionally connect the anti-proliferative effects of interferons with the IRF1-dependent suppression of the CDK2 gene, which encodes a key regulator of the G1/S phase transition.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar, 38Harper J.W. Adams P.D. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2511-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). CDK2 is the critical enzyme controlling the G1/S phase transition and is required throughout S phase. Its serine/threonine kinase activity is activated by cyclins E and A and inhibited by the CDIs p21Waf1/Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2. The cyclin E and cyclin A promoters are controlled by E2F factors (39Botz J. Zerfass-Thome K. Spitkovsky D. Delius H. Vogt B. Eilers M. Hatzigeorgiou A. Jansen-Durr P. Mol. Cell.

The CDK2 promoter is seruminducible and is known to contain two SP1 binding sites that control basal transcription (41Shiffman D. Brooks E.E. Brooks A.R. Chan C.S. Milner P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12199-12204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, after this initial characterization, the CDK2 promoter has remained unexplored. Because CDK2 activity is required at multiple cell cycle stages, the protein is stringently maintained at constitutive levels throughout the cell cycle. Consequently, the question arises whether control of cell growth may be influenced by anti-proliferative cell-signaling mechanisms that can suppress the basal expression of the CDK2 gene. The principal finding of this study is that the interferon-inducible transcription factor IRF1 interferes with CDK2 gene expression by decreasing the activity of SP1, which is critical for the basal activation of the CDK2 gene. We propose that IRF1 may be a key regulatory node in an IFN-responsive molecular network with positive and negative feedback loops to control cell proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Reporter Gene Constructs and Expression Vectors—A panel of constructs containing deletions of the CDK2 promoter fused to the luciferase (LUC) reporter gene has been described previously (41Shiffman D.

Construct –2400CDK2/LUC (DSC37) contains the –2.4-kbp promoter region of the human CDK2 gene up to nucleotide +58 bp (i.e. down-stream from the CDK2 mRNA capsite) inserted into the pGL2-basic plasmid (Promega). Additional constructs used in our studies are –683CDK2/LUC (DSC40), –440CDK2/LUC (DSC40Δ4–1), –101CDK2/LUC (DSC40Δ9–17), and –15CDK2/LUC (DSC40Δ10–10) with the first numbers of each construct indicating the retained amount of the CDK2 promoter in base pairs (41Shiffman D.

To assess the contribution of SP1 to IRF1 responsiveness, we mutated the SP1 site in the –68 CDK2 promoter to yield construct –68(mtSP1) CDK2/LUC. The following forward primers were used to prepare the new constructs: (–68 forward/NheI primer, 5′-atg cta gcC AGG GCG GGG CCT C-3′; –31 forward/NheI primer, 5′-atg cta gcG GAG GCG GCA ACA TT-3′; –68(mtSP1) forward/NheI primer, 5′-tgc tag cCA GGC TCG AGC CTC TGG-3′ (mutated nucleotides are underlined). A single reverse BglII primer was used with the above forward primers: 5′-ata gat ctG AAG GCG GAC CCT GGC-3′. The 4xIRF/H4-Site II/CAT plasmid was constructed by inserting an oligonucleotide cassette containing a tandemly repeated IRF binding site (5′-gat ccG CTT TCG GTT TTC AGC TTT CGG TTT CCA GCT TTC GGT TTT CAG CTT TCG GTT TTC a-3′; 5′-gat ctG AAA ACC GAA AGC TGA AAA CCG AAA GCT GGA AAC CGA AAG CTG AAA ACC GAA AGC g-3′; BamHI/BglII overhangs) into the BamHI site of pFP201/CAT (10Xie R. van Wijnen A.J. van der Meijden C.M.J.

Cells were seeded in six-well culture plates (Greiner) at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well, and transient transfections were performed 24 h later when cells were ∼70% confluent using the SuperFect transfection method (Qiagen). We co-transfected 0.4 μg of each CDK2/LUC reporter gene construct with different amounts of expression gene vectors. The amount of DNA in each well was kept constant by supplementing the transfection mixture with the empty expression vector. Lysates were prepared from cells harvested at different time points after transfection for use in luciferase assays, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assays and/or for Western blot analysis. Experiments using recombinant mouse interferon γ (IFNγ) were carried out by incubating cells with 0–1.0 ng/ml IFNγ (Sigma) beginning 12 h post-transfection. Luciferase activity was analyzed 12–15 h after IFNγ treatment. Each transfection experiment was performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times.Luciferase and CAT Reporter Assays—Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS buffer at the time of harvest, and lysed with 1× lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were carried out according to the specifications of the manufacturer using a standard luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), and luminometric units were determined by using the Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). CAT assays were performed according to standard procedures (47Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of total cellular protein were mixed with loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8,10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were saturated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (1× PBS-T buffer) and 5% fat-free dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies using the indicated dilutions (α-IRF1 at 1:1,000, α-SP1 at 1:2,000, α-CDK2 at 1;5,000, and β-actin at 1:2,500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in 1% fat-free dry milk in 1× PBS-T buffer (milk-PBS-T buffer). After rinsing in milk-PBS-T buffer, blots were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the same buffer containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted to 1:8,000–10,000. Blots were then washed three to five times in PBS-T buffer before visualization. The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for the detection of immunoreactive protein bands. To quantitate the endogenous levels of CDK2 in response to forced expression of IRF1, densitometry was performed using the Alpha Imager 2000 densitometer (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA).RESULTSIRF1 Represses CDK2 Gene Expression by a Transcriptional Mechanism—The tumor suppressor IRF1 is a principal target of interferon signaling through JAK/STAT to inhibit cell growth. CDK2 activity is one of the major kinases that regulate cell cycle progression at the G1/S phase transition, and the protein is stringently maintained at constitutive levels throughout the cell cycle. We addressed whether IRF1 may transduce the anti-proliferative signals of IFNs by suppressing the basal expression of the CDK2 gene. We expressed IRF1 above its normal levels in fibroblasts and observed a dose-dependent inhibition of endogenous CDK2 gene expression at the protein level (Fig. 1A). Semi-quantitative analysis of our data reveals that the maximal effect of IRF1 on endogenous CDK2 protein levels ranges from 2- to 5-fold in four independent transient transfection experiments (Fig. 1B). This range represents a conservative estimate of the IRF1-dependent reduction of CDK2 levels, because untransfected cells, which continue to express the CDK2 protein unabatedly, generate background signals. Differences in the percentage of untransfected cells in each of the four experiments cause variations in this background level that can account for the range of values in the -fold response. More importantly, in a qualitative sense we observe that IRF1 reproducibly reduces CDK2 protein levels in multiple experiments. For comparison, forced expression of the IRF1-related protein IRF2 does not cause a reduction in the endogenous expression of CDK2 protein (35Xie R.L. van Wijnen A.J. van der Meijden C.M. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2510-2515PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, CDK2 levels are selectively decreased in response to forced expression of IRF1.To address whether IRF1 influences the levels of CDK2 by a transcriptional mechanism, we co-transfected an IRF1 expression plasmid and a luciferase reporter gene construct under control of the CDK2 promoter. Transfections were performed with different amounts of expression vector, and cells were harvested at various times after transfection (Figs. 2 and 3, as well as data not shown). Our results show that IRF1 reduces CDK2 promoter activity in a manner that is proportional to time after transfection (Fig. 2) and the amount of expression construct (Fig. 3). We conclude that IRF1 inhibits the CDK2 promoter activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner.Fig. 2Down-regulation of CDK2 transcription in response to IRF1 occurs concomitant with enhancement of H4 promoter activity. NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with the –683 CDK2/LUC (0.4 μg/well) and 4xIRF/H4-Site II/CAT (0.4 μg/well) reporter gene constructs in the presence of increasing amounts (0–1.0 μg/well) of an IRF1 expression vector. Luciferase and CAT assays were performed at multiple time points after transfection, as indicated. A shows a representative experiment plotted as -fold response upon elevating relative IRF1 levels that reveals the IRF1-mediated down-regulation of CDK2 promoter activity. B presents results from CAT assays with the same cell lysates used in A to show the IRF1-dependent up-regulation of H4 promoter activity. Forced expression of IRF factors does not affect cell viability or growth during the first 24 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3IRF1, but not IRF2, IRF3, or IRF7, selectively inhibits CDK2 gene transcription. NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with the –683 CDK2/LUC reporter gene (0.4 μg/well) in the presence of increasing amounts of expression vectors for IRF1, IRF2, IRF3, or IRF7. The data show that IRF1 but not IRF2, -3, or -7 reduces LUC activity driven by the CDK2 promoter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We note that, although our data indicate that IRF1 regulates CDK2 transcription, we can not exclude the possibility that CDK2 protein expression may be additionally regulated at post-transcriptional levels in response to IRF1. In addition, it is not possible to directly compare the quantitative effects of IRF1 on endogenous CDK2 protein levels (Fig. 1) with those on transfected reporter genes (Fig. 2) due to the intrinsic differences in the experimental approaches. The main finding of Figs. 1 and 2 is that both CDK2 protein levels and CDK2 promoter activity decline in tandem. This finding indicates that down-regulation of CDK2 protein levels is mediated at least in part by a transcriptional mechanism.IRF1 is an activator of many genes (1Mamane Y. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Algarte M. Servant M.J. LePage C. DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Hiscott J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and we have previously shown that IRF1 activates the cell cycle-regulated histone H4 gene (9Vaughan P.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18624-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the inhibition of the CDK2 promoter by IRF1 suggests that it may function as a repressor. To demonstrate directly that IRF1 can exert bifunctional effects on transcription, it is necessary to establish that IRF1 can mediate both activation and repression under identical biological conditions. Therefore, we co-transfected an IRF1 expression plasmid together with the CDK2 promoter and a histone H4-related promoter each fused to distinct reporter genes (i.e. CDK2/LUC and 4xIRF/H4-Site II/CAT constructs) into the same NIH3T3 cells. Because both reporter gene constructs are present in the same cells, modulations in LUC and CAT activities can be directly compared as a function of elevations in IRF1. Our data show that IRF1 inhibits the CDK2 promoter while simultaneously activating the H4-related promoter in the same population of cells (Fig. 2). These results establish that IRF1 is capable of selectively increasing or decreasing transcription depending on promoter context.We note that, apa"

In Escherichia coli, part of this amplification occurs at the flagellar switch. However, it is not known whether the amplification results from cooperativity of CheY binding to the switch or from a post-binding step. To address this question, we purified the intact switch complex (constituting the switch proteins FliG, FliM, and FliN and the scaffolding protein FliF) in quantities sufficient for biochemical work and used it to investigate whether the binding of CheY to the switch complex is cooperative. As a negative control, we used complexes of switchless basal bodies, formed from the proteins FliF and FliG and similarly isolated. Using double-labeling centrifugation assays for binding, we found that CheY binds to the isolated, intact switch complex in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. We observed no significant phosphorylation-dependent binding to the negative control of the switchless basal body. The dissociation constant for the binding between the switch complex and phosphorylated CheY (CheY∼P) was 4.0 ± 1.1 μm, well in line with the published range of CheY∼P concentrations to which the flagellar motor is responsive. Furthermore, the binding was not cooperative (Hill coefficient ≈ 1). This lack of CheY∼P-switch complex binding cooperativity, taken together with earlier in vivo studies suggesting that the dependence of the rotational state of the motor on the fraction of occupied sites at the switch is sigmoidal and very steep (Bren, A., and Eisenbach, M. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 312, 699–709), indicates that the chemotactic signal is amplified within the switch, subsequent to the CheY∼P binding.

The motility of bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium derives from the rotation of their flagella (for reviews, see Refs. 1Macnab R.M. Neidhardt F.C.

Each flagellum is driven by a bidirectional rotary motor embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane. The direction of flagellar rotation determines the swimming behavior of the cells, enabling bacteria to approach beneficial environments and escape hostile ones. Thus, the essence of bacterial chemotaxis is modulation of the direction of flagellar rotation (3Larsen S.H. Reader R.W. Kort E.N. Tso W.-W. Adler J.

Aizawa S.-I. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 813-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signals from the chemotaxis receptors to the switch are transduced by the response regulator CheY. The activity of this protein is modulated by phosphorylation. When phosphorylated in response to chemotactic stimulation, the protein is detached from the histidine kinase CheA, which is a part of the receptor supramolecular complex, and acquires an elevated affinity for the switch protein FliM (13Welch M.

The outcome is an increased probability of shifting the direction of flagellar rotation from the default direction, counterclockwise, to clockwise (for recent reviews, see Refs. 17Bren A. Eisenbach M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6865-6873Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar and 18Bourret R.B. Stock A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9625-9628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella sense stimuli over a wide concentration range and, despite the wide range, do so with very high sensitivity, suggesting high amplification of the chemotactic signal (19Segall J.E. Block S.M. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8987-8991Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 20Jasuja R. Yu-Lin T rentham D.R. Khan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11346-11351Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One of the major questions in bacterial chemotaxis is which of the signal transduction steps amplify the chemotactic signal. One amplification step likely occurs at the receptor level, the amplification being provided by propagation of the excitation signal from the stimulated receptor molecule to neighboring receptor molecules within the receptor cluster (21Bray D. Levin M.D. Morton-Firth C.J. Nature. 1998; 393: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 22Duke T.A.J. Bray D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In view of recent findings that switching from counterclockwise to clockwise upon an increase in the intracellular level of CheY∼P 1The abbreviations used are: CheY∼P, phosphorylated CheY; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid.1The abbreviations used are: CheY∼P, phosphorylated CheY; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. is highly cooperative (a Hill coefficient of ∼10 (25Cluzel P. Surette M. Leibler S. Science. 2000; 287: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar)), another amplification step probably occurs at the switch level (for a review, see Ref. 26Bray D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether this high amplification reflects cooperativity of CheY∼P binding to FliM (4Macnab R.M. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1995: 181-199Google Scholar, 25Cluzel P. Surette M. Leibler S. Science. 2000; 287: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 27Kuo S.C.

A. 1997; 94: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) or amplification of post-binding events at the switch (28Spiro P.A. Parkinson J.S. Othmer H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This question cannot be addressed by direct in vitro assays of CheY binding to purified FliM because it is not known whether purified FliM in solution truly represents the native protein within the switch complex and because the inter-FliM interactions, which normally occur within the switch (29Marykwas D.L. Schmidt S.A. Berg H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 564-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), probably do not occur with soluble FliM molecules. Recently, Lux et al. (30Lux R. Kar N. Khan S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) overexpressed, in a non-flagellated strain, all three switch proteins together with FliF and purified the resulting membrane-associated structure. These structures have now been identified on the basis of immunochemical (30Lux R. Kar N. Khan S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), morphological (31Young H.S. Dang H. Lai Y. DeRosier D.J. Khan S. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and in vivo CheY-binding criteria (32Khan S. Pierce D. Vale R.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 927-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as intact functional switch complexes mounted on the transmembrane MS ring. These advances open up the possibility of detailed mechanistic analysis of the cooperative motor response upon binding CheY. Here, we have used this preparation to characterize the phosphorylation-dependent binding of CheY to the intact switch complex in vitro. Preparation of Switch Complex—For the preparation of switch complexes, we overproduced FliG and FliF from the overproducing plasmid pKOT107 and overproduced FliM and FliN from the overproducing plasmid pKLR2 in the nonflagellated E. coli strain BL21 (λDE3) (33Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar). The overproduced switch complex, found at the cytoplasmic membrane, was purified according to the procedure of Francis et al. (34Francis N.R. Sosinsky G.E. Thomas D. DeRosier D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1261-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) for isolating extended basal bodies with several modifications. Cells (21 liters) of strain BL21 (λDE3) containing the plasmids pKOT107 and pKLR2 were grown in Luria broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml). The overproduction of the proteins was induced at OD600 = 0.4 by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm). The cells were grown for an additional 3 h and harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 250 ml of ice-cold sucrose solution (0.5 m sucrose, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), and then lysozyme (final concentration, 1 mg/ml, from a freshly prepared stock solution) and EDTA (final concentration, 10 mm) were added. The mixture was gently stirred at 4 °C for about 11 h. The resulting spheroplasts were lysed by two-step addition of Triton X-100: first to a final concentration of 1% in the presence of MgSO4 (10 mm); then, following gentle stirring at 4 °C for 3 h, to a final concentration of 2% in the presence of MgSO4 (10 mm). The suspension was further gently stirred at 4 °C for 0.5 h. EDTA (20 mm) was added, and the suspension was stirred for 60 min. Unlysed cells and inclusion bodies were removed by centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 30 min, and the pH of the supernatant was raised with NaOH to pH 10 to disintegrate the outer membrane structures. The lysate was spun at 123,000 × g for 60 min, and the pellet was resuspended in a solution containing Tris-HCl (10 mm, pH 7.9), KCl (100 mm), sucrose (10% w/v), and Triton X-100 (0.1%). The suspension was recentrifuged at 23,000 × g for 30 min, and then the supernatant was spun at 200,000 × g for 40 min. The pellet was resuspended in a solution containing Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.9) and Triton X-100 (0.1%). To get rid of residual inclusion bodies that potentially remained in the suspension, the suspension was centrifuged again at 23,000 × g for 10 min. The purified switch complex was stored at 4 °C with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Preparation of Switchless Basal Body—For the preparation of a switchless basal body, we used the same procedure used for the preparation of the switch complex, with the exception that the cells contained only one plasmid, the plasmid pKOT107 for the overproduction of FliG and FliF alone. Labeling of CheY—Initially we radiolabeled CheY in vitro by methylating the ∈-amine of its lysine residues and the N terminus with formaldehyde and NaB[3H]4, as described previously (35Blat Y. Eisenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1232-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The experiments shown in Fig. 2 were carried out with CheY labeled in this way. However, subsequently we found that high levels of labeling (higher than those used in Fig. 2) inhibited the ability of CheY to undergo in vitro phosphorylation by the phosphodonor acetyl phosphate. We, therefore, switched to in vivo labeling, which does not involve chemical modification of CheY. E. coli strain M15 (36Zamenhof P.J. Villarejo M. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 110: 171-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), carrying the plasmid pQE12-CheY-His-tag for the overproduction of His6-CheY (received from A. Wolfe, Loyola University), was grown to OD590 = 0.5 in H1 minimal medium of Kaiser and Hogness (37Kaiser A.D. Hogness D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1960; 2: 392-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) supplemented with histidine, methionine, and threonine (1 mm each), as well as with leucine (200 μm), thiamin (5 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and glucose (0.3%, w/v). The overproduction of CheY was induced at OD590 = 0.5 by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm). For labeling, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was supplemented with [14C]leucine (final concentration, 0.17 μCi/ml). The cells were grown for an additional 4 h, harvested by centrifugation, and sonicated. Non-soluble material (inclusion bodies and cell debris) was removed by centrifugation at 123,000 × g for 30 min. The His6-tagged CheY protein was purified from the supernatant by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with some modifications. We followed protocol 11 (batch purification of His6-tagged proteins under native conditions) with the exception that, following the collection of the flow-through, the washing of the lysate-Ni-NTA column was with 80–90 ml of washing buffer (until no protein was eluted) rather than 4 ml, and the elution of CheY from the Ni-NTA column was with 20–30 ml of elution buffer instead of 2 ml. We concentrated CheY by ultrafiltration through a 10 kDa cut-off membrane in an Amicon chamber (model 52). CheY was stored at –80 °C. We verified that the His6-tag at the C terminus of CheY did not interfere with the function of the protein according to two criteria: (a) we expressed His6-tagged CheY in the non-chemotactic strain AW546 eda + cheY201 (received from J. Adler) and found that His6-tagged CheY restored chemotactic responsiveness to this strain, judged by its ability to form typical chemotactic rings on a semisolid agar (0.3% agar) plate containing Tryptone (38Adler J. Science. 1966; 153: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar); and (b) we measured the ability of His6-tagged CheY to undergo acetyl phosphate-mediated in vitro phosphorylation by measuring the changes in the fluorescence of Trp58, known to be strongly reduced upon CheY phosphorylation (39Lukat G.S. McCleary W.R. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of CheY was determined using a fluorimeter with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 295 and 345 nm, respectively. Tag-free CheY or His6-tagged CheY was diluted to a final concentration of 10 μm into 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.9) containing 5 mm MgSO4, and its fluorescence was recorded. Subsequently, acetyl phosphate (final concentration, 20 mm) was added, and the fluorescence was again recorded. Both His6-tagged CheY and tag-free CheY were similarly quenched (by ∼60%) upon the addition of acetyl phosphate. Binding of CheY to the Switch Complex and to the Switchless Basal Body—The switch complex or the switchless basal body, at the amount indicated in the figure legends, was incubated with [3H]CheY (2000–7000 dpm/pmol) and [14C]glucose (final concentration, 3500 dpm/μl) or [14C]CheY (His6-tagged; 13–17 dpm/pmol) and [3H]glycine (600 dpm/pmol) in a solution of Tris-HCl (50 mm; pH 7.9), MgSO4 (5 mm), and where indicated, bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml). For phosphorylating conditions, acetyl phosphate (25 mm) was added to the reaction mixture. After a 5-min incubation at room temperature (24 °C), the switch complex or the switchless basal body was pelleted by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.9). Aliquots of the reaction mixture prior to centrifugation and of the supernatant and pellet subsequent to centrifugation were counted for 14C and 3H by a β counter (Tri-Carb liquid scintillation analyzers). Isolation of the Switch Complex for Biochemical Studies—To produce an intact switch complex in quantities sufficient for biochemical work, we overproduced the three switch proteins (FliG, FliM, and FliN) along with FliF from two plasmids as done by Lux et al. (30Lux R. Kar N. Khan S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and then purified the overproduced switch complex from the cytoplasmic membrane as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In electron micrographs, the purified switch complex (Fig. 1) appeared similar to that obtained by Lux et al. (30Lux R. Kar N. Khan S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As a negative control, we used the host BL21 cells, lacking the overproducing plasmids. These cells, following the same isolation procedure, did not yield the structures shown in Fig. 1. Demonstration of Specific CheY∼P Binding to the Switch Complex—To measure the binding between CheY and the purified switch complex, we equilibrated the complex with [3H]CheY and then separated switch-bound CheY from free CheY by centrifugation. To be able to measure the volume of medium entrapped within the pellet, we also included in the medium an inert radiolabeled compound, [14C]glucose. The 3H/14C ratio in the pellet was higher in the presence of the phosphodonor acetyl phosphate than in its absence (Fig. 2A), suggesting the occurrence of phosphorylation-dependent binding of CheY to the switch complex. Because CheY binds to FliM, we used, as a negative control, a switchless basal body. We isolated it from cells overexpressing FliF and FliG only, using the same isolation procedure as for the intact switch complex. Unlike the case of the intact switch complex, we did not observe a phosphorylation-dependent increase in CheY binding to the switchless basal body (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that the phosphorylation-dependent binding to the intact switch complex is specific and that the isolated switch complex is functional with respect to CheY binding. A potential source of concern in the above experiments was that traces of FliM-containing inclusion bodies might have remained in the preparation of the switch complex and might have contributed to the observed binding of CheY∼P. We verified that this was not the case by the following measures: (a) we did not observe a white fluffy precipitate, typical of inclusion bodies, on top of the precipitate of the switch complex; (b) before precipitating the switch complex at 200,000 × g, we got rid of FliM-containing inclusion bodies by spinning the preparation at 23,000 × g, which is above the force required for their full precipitation (12,500 × g (40Zhao R.B. Schuster S.C. Khan S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 400-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)); and (c) we carried out control experiments in which we equilibrated the switch complex with [3H]CheY and then separated switch-bound CheY from free CheY by centrifugation either at 23,000 × g or at 200,000 × g. We observed only a phosphorylation-dependent increase in the 3H/14C ratio in the pellet at 200,000 × g (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the preparation of isolated switch complex did not contain inclusion bodies and that the observed binding of CheY∼P was to the switch complex alone. Quantification of the CheY-Switch Binding—To quantify the binding between CheY and the switch complex, we titrated the complex with increasing amounts of radiolabeled CheY under phosphorylating and nonphosphorylating conditions (presence and absence of acetyl phosphate, respectively). As a control for nonspecific binding, we used the switchless basal body at equal total-protein concentrations. Under nonphosphorylating conditions, CheY bound to the switch complex only slightly better than to the negative control of switchless basal body (Fig. 3). Under phosphorylating conditions, CheY selectively bound to the switch complex. To quantify the binding, we had to estimate the total amount of FliM within the switch complex. We did this by two independent means: according to the number of CheY molecules bound to the switch complex at saturation and according to a Western blot analysis of the switch complex with anti-FliM antibodies (Fig. 4). Both methods yielded a similar estimate of the FliM amount, 0.95 and 1.1 nmol FliM/mg of total protein, respectively. These values were measured with the same preparation of switch complex used for the results shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The average ratio between these estimations for three different preparations of the switch complex was 0.9 ± 0.2 (mean ± S.D.), suggesting that the stoichiometry between CheY and FliM is 1:1. Quantitative analysis of the data of this representative experiment revealed a dissociation constant of 3.6 and 120 μm for phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated CheY, respectively (Fig. 3, insets). Correcting the CheY∼P concentration in the experiment according to the estimate that CheY is 85.5% phosphorylated in vitro under these conditions (41Blat Y. Gillespie B. Bren A. Dahlquist F.W. Eisenbach M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we calculated that the dissociation constant for the CheY∼P-switch complex is 2.9 μm. A Hill fit to the binding data yielded a Hill coefficient of 1.0 (r 2 = 0.99), suggesting that, within the uncertainties of the experimental error, the binding of CheY∼P to the isolated switch complex is not cooperative. This apparent lack of cooperativity was observed in each of the three batches of isolated switch complex assayed for cooperativity (average Hill coefficient = 1.3 ± 0.2 (± S.D.)). The dissociation constant varied in the range of 2.9–5.6 μm between different batches of the isolated switch complex, yielding a mean of 4 ± 1 μm (± S.D.).Fig. 4FliM quantification by Western blots. Aliquots of purified switch complex and of purified FliM (15 ng/μl) were mixed with sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (46Bren A. Eisenbach M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The blots were probed with anti-FliM antibody (a gift from S. I. Aizawa) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma). Films were scanned with an imaging densitometer (model GS-690; Bio-Rad). The intensities of the bands were quantified by Multi-Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Calculation of the amount of FliM in each preparation of the purified switch complex was made on the basis of a calibration curve prepared according to the band intensities of increasing concentrations of FliM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study we isolated, in quantities sufficient for biochemical work, the flagellar switch complex of E. coli and demonstrated that it is functional, at least with respect to CheY binding. We found that this binding (K d = 4 ± 1 μm) is phosphorylation-dependent, is specific, has a CheY:FliM stoichiometry of 1:1, and is not cooperative. The significance of these findings is discussed below. Earlier in vivo studies found a steep dependence of the probability of clockwise rotation on the intracellular concentration of active CheY (25Cluzel P. Surette M. Leibler S. Science. 2000; 287: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 27Kuo S.C. Koshland D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6279-6287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Scharf B.E. Fahrner K.A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4238-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Carrying out the measurements in single cells, Cluzel et al. (25Cluzel P. Surette M. Leibler S. Science. 2000; 287: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) found that the increase was over a narrow range of CheY∼P concentrations and highly cooperative (Hill coefficient ≈ 10). These observations suggested that the switch acts as some sort of amplifier, translating small changes in the concentration of CheY∼P into large changes in clockwise probability. However, these observations could not distinguish between amplification caused by cooperativity of CheY binding to the switch (4Macnab R.M. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1995: 181-199Google Scholar, 25Cluzel P. Surette M. Leibler S. Science. 2000; 287: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 27Kuo S.C.

A. 1997; 94: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and amplification evolved within the switch (28Spiro P.A. Parkinson J.S. Othmer H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Earlier studies, which used in vitro binding assays with purified soluble proteins (or peptides thereof), could not address this question either (13Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S.-I. Eisenbach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8787-8791Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 16McEvoy M. Bren A. Eisenbach M. Dahlquist F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 44Welch M. Oosawa K. Aizawa S.-I. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10470-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 45Bren A. Eisenbach M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A distinction between both possibilities, although indirect, was later made by Bren and Eisenbach (46Bren A. Eisenbach M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), who used FliM proteins almost locked in their clockwise or counterclockwise states as representatives of CheY-bound and CheY-free FliM, respectively. By expressing these FliM proteins to different levels, they found that the dependence of the clockwise probability on the relative level of FliM in the clockwise state is very steep. Because that study bypassed the CheY∼P-FliM binding step, it suggested that at least part of the signal amplification occurs at a post-binding step. In the current study, we found no cooperativity of CheY∼P binding to the switch, endorsing the notion that the chemotactic signal is amplified within the switch rather than at the preceding binding step of CheY∼P to the switch. While preparing this manuscript for publication, a study by Sourjik and Berg (47Sourjik V. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12669-12674Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) was published in which resonance energy transfer was used for in vivo measurements of CheY binding to the switch. Sourjik and Berg (47Sourjik V. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12669-12674Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) found essentially no cooperativity of binding and a dissociation constant of ∼3.7 μm, very similar to the value measured by us in this study. The similarity between the in vivo results of Sourjik and Berg (47Sourjik V. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12669-12674Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and the in vitro results with purified intact switch complex obtained in our current study suggests that the isolated switch complex is functional and reliably represents the function of the switch within the cell. Furthermore, our measured dissociation constant for CheY∼P (4 ± 1 μm) is well in line with the range of CheY∼P concentrations over which the motor changes its bias from counterclockwise to clockwise (2–6 μm) (25Cluzel P. Surette M. Leibler S. Science. 2000; 287: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). As might be expected, it is lower than the dissociation constant measured for the binding of an N terminus-containing peptide of FliM (45Bren A. Eisenbach M. J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 289: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The current study, taken together with the studies of Sourjik and Berg (47Sourjik V. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12669-12674Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), Cluzel et al. (25Cluzel P. Surette M. Leibler S.

Biol. 2001; 312: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), strongly argues that the chemotactic signal is amplified within the switch, subsequent to the CheY∼P binding. Such amplification suggests that the switching process can be described as an allosteric transition between the rotational states of the switch, with CheY∼P as an allosteric activator. A model for an allosteric transition of switching was recently proposed by Duke et al. (48Duke T.A.J. Le Novère N. Bray D. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2105449265,"The presence of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formed because of hyperglycemia in diabetic patients has been strongly linked to the development of diabetic complications and disturbances in cellular function. In this report, we describe the isolation and identification of novel AGE-binding proteins from diabetic rat kidneys. The proteins were purified by cation exchange and AGE-modified bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA) affinity chromatography. NH2-terminal and internal sequencing identified the proteins as the NH2-terminal domains of ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM proteins). Using BIAcore biosensor analysis, human N-ezrin-(1–324) bound to immobilized AGE-BSA with a K D of 5.3 ± 2.1 × 10 –7m, whereas full-length ezrin-(1–586) and C-ezrin-(323–586) did not bind. Other glycated proteins such as AGE-RNase, N ∈-carboxymethyllysine (CML)-BSA, and glycated human serum albumin isolated from hyperglycemic diabetic sera competed with the immobilized AGE-BSA for binding to N-ezrin, but non-glycated BSA and RNase did not. Thus N-ezrin binds to AGEs in a glycation- and concentration-dependent manner. Phosphorylated ezrin plays a crucial role in cell shape changes, cell attachment, and cell adhesion. The effect of AGE-BSA on ezrin function was studied in a tubulogenesis model in which LLC-PK1 cell tubule formation is dependent on phosphorylated ezrin. Addition of AGE-BSA completely inhibited the ability of the cells to produce tubules. Furthermore, in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of N-ezrin and ezrin was also inhibited by AGE-BSA. These proteins represent a novel family of intracellular binding molecules for glycated proteins and provide a potential new target for therapeutic intervention in the prevention or treatment of diabetic complications.

These proteins represent a novel family of intracellular binding molecules for glycated proteins and provide a potential new target for therapeutic intervention in the prevention or treatment of diabetic complications. Diabetes mellitus is associated with very significant morbidity as a result of long-term complications, including nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and macrovascular disease. Diabetes is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, which leads to an acceleration of the Maillard reaction. This is a spontaneous reaction between glucose and proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids, particularly on long-lived proteins such as the collagens (1Brownlee M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). A sequence of biochemical reactions, many of which are still poorly defined, leads to the formation of a range of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). 1The abbreviations used are: AGE, advanced glycation end products; RAGE, receptor for AGE; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ERM, ezrin, radixin, and moesin; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; CML, N ∈-carboxymethyllysine; HSA, human serum albumin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; aa, amino acid(s); HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; NHERF, sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor. Although research interest has focused predominantly on the measurement and binding interactions of extracellular AGEs, recent studies have indicated that intracellular AGEs are also extremely important (2Du X.L. Edelstein D. Rossetti L. Fantus I.G. Goldberg H. Ziyadeh F. Wu J. Brownlee M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12222-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). There is substantial evidence for a link between hyperglycemia/AGEs and the pathogenesis of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and vasculopathy (3Ulrich P. Cerami A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). First, levels of AGEs are correlated with the severity of these complications (4Beisswenger P.J. Makita Z. Curphey T.J. Moore L.L. Jean S. Brinckjohnsen T. Bucala R. Vlassara H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 824-829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, in the non-diabetic mouse, injection of AGEs prepared in vitro leads to histological changes resembling diabetic nephropathy, including mesangial expansion and glomerulosclerosis (5Vlassara H. Striker L.J. Teichberg S. Fuh H. Li Y.M. Steffes M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11704-11708Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Finally, pharmacological inhibitors of AGE-dependent pathways retard diabetic complications. Aminoguanidine and related compounds prevent AGE formation (6Brownlee M. Vlassara H. Kooney A. Ulrich P. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 1629-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) and have been shown in experimental models of diabetes to reduce tissue AGE levels and retard the development of neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy (7Kihara M. Schmelzer J.D. Poduslo J.F. Curran G.L. Nicklander K. Low P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6107-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 8Hammes H. Martin S. Federlin K.

Wagle D. Jerums G. Cooper M.E. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although it is well established that hyperglycemia and the presence of AGEs on proteins contribute to complications, the pathways for this process have not been clearly determined. Previous studies have shown that AGEs prepared in vitro bind to cultured cells via cell surface receptors or binding proteins (10Thornalley P.J. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 44: 1013-1023PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in binding and internalization of AGE-receptor complexes and proteolytic processing of the AGE ligand. Binding of AGE ligands to cells can also modulate cell function. For instance, cell activation with increased expression of extracellular matrix proteins, adhesion molecules, cytokines, and growth factors has been described (10Thornalley P.J. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 44: 1013-1023PubMed Google Scholar). Several AGE-binding proteins have been identified, including RAGE, AGE-R1, AGE-R2, AGE-R3, and macrophage scavenger receptors 1 and 2 (11Neeper M. Schmidt A.-M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Elliston K. Stern D. Shaw A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14998-15004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yang C.-W. Makita Z. Horii Y.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Whether all these proteins bind AGE-modified proteins in vivo is not yet clear. We have observed increased binding of AGEs to diabetic rat kidney sections, which are reduced in animals treated with aminoguanidine (15Youssef S. Nguyen D.T. Soulis T. Panagiotopoulos S. Jerums G. Cooper M.E. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 907-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The major binding site did not appear to be any of the known AGE receptors. These findings led us to undertake the isolation and characterization of novel binding sites for AGE-modified proteins present in the diabetic rat kidney. We report the purification from diabetic rat kidneys of three proteins, i.e. truncated forms of ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM). Members of the ERM family of proteins are structurally very similar and are present on cell surface protrusions. They link the actin cytoskeleton of the cell to the plasma membrane and are thought to play a role in cell shape change, motility, and adhesion (16Tsukita S. Yonemura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34507-34510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Our studies identify ERM proteins as novel binding proteins for AGEs, and we hypothesize that the interaction between ERMs and AGEs may play a role in the development of diabetic complications. With the exception of calpain inhibitor I, which was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, protease inhibitors and actin were purchased from Sigma. Protein concentrations were determined by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Restriction enzymes, DNA grade agarose, and reagents for reverse transcription and PCR were from Promega, Melbourne, Australia. The pProEX-HT prokaryotic expression system was from Invitrogen, and Ni-NTA-agarose was from Qiagen. Oligonucleotides were prepared to PCR grade by Geneworks, Thebarton, Australia. Preparation and Radiolabeling of AGE-BSA—AGE-modified bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA), AGE-RNase, and N ∈-carboxymethyllysine (CML)-BSA were prepared as described previously (17Oldfield M.D. Bach L.A. Forbes J.M. McRobert A. Thallas V. Osicka T. Nikolic-Paterson D. Atkins R.C. Jerums G. Cooper M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The extent of chemical modification of lysine residues was determined using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid by the method described (18Cayot P. Tainturier G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 184-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The extent of modification was 17% for CML-BSA and 77% for AGE-modified proteins. AGE-BSA iodination was performed using the chloramine T method (19Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6742) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of ∼10,000 cpm/ng protein. 125I-AGE-BSA was separated from unbound 125I with a P6DG desalting gel column (Bio-Rad). Preparation of AGE-BSA Affinity Column—An AGE-BSA affinity column was prepared by coupling AGE-BSA (5 mg/ml) to Affi-Gel 15 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The concentration of ligand bound was ∼5 mg/ml resin, and a 1.7 ml column was prepared. Purification of AGE-BSA-binding Proteins from Diabetic Kidneys— Kidneys from streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats (11.4 g total) were homogenized in solubilization buffer (5 ml/g tissue of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10 units/ml Trasylol) for 2 × 10 s at 18,000 rpm with a Dounce homogenizer and mixed end-to-end for 16 h at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (soluble kidney extract) was collected and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 16 h at 4 °C. Fresh protease inhibitors were added, and the soluble kidney extract (48 ml) was applied to a BioRex-70 cation-exchange column (55 ml) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed extensively with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 until the absorbance at 280 nm was less than 0.02. Bound protein was eluted with a salt gradient from 200 mm to 1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Fractions were analyzed for AGE-BSA binding activity by slot blotting (see below). The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors and applied to the AGE-BSA affinity column. The column was extensively washed and the proteins eluted with a salt gradient. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and absorbance at 280 nm, salt concentration (osmolarity), and AGE-BSA binding activity were measured. SDS-PAGE—Purified AGE-BSA binding proteins were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-12.5% PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. Molecular masses were estimated from semilogarithmic plots of the migration of standard proteins under reducing conditions run simultaneously. Ligand and Slot Blotting—Proteins in gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Osmonics, Westborough, MA) at 20 V for 16 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by a 1 h incubation with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween, and 1% BSA (blocking buffer). The nitrocellulose membrane was probed with 125I-AGE-BSA (1 × 106 cpm/ml) for 2 h at room temperature in blocking buffer in the presence or absence of unlabeled AGE-BSA. The membrane was washed thoroughly and exposed to Kodak BioMax MS film. Slot blotting was performed similarly to ligand blotting, except the proteins were immobilized directly onto nitrocellulose membranes under vacuum and incubated with 125I-AGE-BSA (1 × 106 cpm/ml) for 2 h at room temperature in blocking buffer in the presence or absence of unlabeled AGE-BSA. Individual slots were counted in a γ-counter for quantitation of bound radioactivity. Western Blotting—Proteins in non-reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer were separated by SDS-12.5% PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with ezrin monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories). Reactive proteins were visualized using Super Signal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Preparative Electrophoresis for Amino Acid Sequencing—AGE-binding fractions eluted from the AGE-BSA affinity column were pooled and concentrated 5-fold (Centricon, Millipore). Protein (50 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in reducing buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, glycerol, 0.015% bromphenol blue, and 0.2 m 2-mercaptoethanol), subjected to SDS-12.5% PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 16 h at 20 V at 4 °C, and stained with 0.025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R in 40% methanol. Bands were excised and subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing of the first 15 amino acids. Sequences obtained were compared with the Swiss-PROT data base using the basic BLAST software program. To obtain internal sequences, concentrated AGE-BSA binding proteins were reduced with 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol for 2 h at 37 °C, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70% formic acid. Reduced proteins were cleaved by the addition of cyanogen bromide (CNBr) crystals and incubation under nitrogen in the dark for 18 h. The cleaved proteins were lyophilized to remove CNBr and formic acid residues prior to preparative electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and sequenced as above, using low molecular mass markers to identify the desired bands in the 5–10 kDa range. Cloning of ERM Constructs—Total RNA was extracted from LIM 2405 human colon cancer cells and reverse transcribed using Super Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The resultant cDNA mix was used as template for PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase to prepare cDNAs for ezrin (1–1758 bp), N-ezrin (1–971 bp), and C-ezrin (952–1758 bp). Primers additionally encoded a 5′ EcoR1 site and a 3′ HindIII restriction site. The PCR products were doubly digested with EcoR1/HindIII, isolated from 1% agarose gels, and cloned into the corresponding restriction sites in the expression vector pProEXHTa to express the protein fused to an amino-terminal six-histidine sequence (His6). DNA sequencing confirmed the correct sequences of the inserts. Expression and Purification of Recombinant ERM Proteins—Competent Escherichia coli (JM109) was transformed with the ezrin, N-ezrin, or C-ezrin expression vectors, and expression was induced with 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h at 37 °C. Each recombinant protein was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. Cleared cell lysate was prepared as described (Qiagen) and applied to a 1-ml Ni-NTA-agarose column, washed thoroughly with high salt wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween, 20 mm imidazole, and inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, calpain inhibitor 1, leupeptin, and Trasylol)) and also with low salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween, 20 mm imidazole, and inhibitors) before eluting with low salt buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Isolated recombinant proteins were dialyzed to remove imidazole prior to further studies. Preparation of Human Serum Albumin (HSA) from Diabetic Patient Serum—HSA was isolated from sera of two hyperglycemic patients with HbA1C values >9.5% (normal ≤ 6%) using a 1-ml Affi-Gel Blue affinity column. HSA was eluted with 1 m NaCl, concentrated, and dialyzed against Hepes-buffered saline (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.005% P20) before biosensor experiments. BIAcore Biosensor Analysis—AGE-BSA binding studies were carried out on each of the isolated recombinant full-length and truncated ezrin proteins using surface plasmon resonance on a BIAcore 2000 biosensor (BIAcore AB). A CM5 research grade sensor chip was activated with N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimidehydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS), and AGE-BSA was injected in coupling buffer over the active surface until a suitable resonance unit (RU = 650) value was obtained (1 RU equates to 1 pg of protein bound/mm2 of sensor surface). Remaining activated groups were deactivated by injection of ethanolamine. BSA was immobilized onto another channel of the same chip (RU = 1895) to subtract background binding and identify specific binding to glycated moieties in AGE-BSA. Ezrin, N-ezrin, and C-ezrin (150 nm–2.4 μm in Hepes-buffered saline) were passed over immobilized AGE-BSA for 240 s at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The infusion was stopped and dissociation was observed over 200 s, during which time Hepes-buffered saline alone was passed over the chip. The binding curves were analyzed using BIA Evaluation 3.0 software. For competition experiments, mixtures of proteins were applied to the chip. In these experiments, varying concentrations of glycated proteins (AGE-BSA, HSA isolated from diabetic sera, AGE-RNase, and CML-BSA) and non-glycated proteins (BSA, RNase, or C-ezrin) were mixed with N-ezrin for at least 30 min before passing over the chip. In other experiments, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6, (IGFBP-6) (21Neumann G.M. Bach L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14587-14594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), an unrelated protein of similar size to the truncated ezrin proteins, was used as a further control for possible nonspecific binding or steric hindrance effects. Tubulogenesis—Cells from the porcine kidney epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 were cultured in 24-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Confluent LLC-PK1 cells were stimulated to form tubules by the addition of DMEM/10% FCS containing 50% fibroblast 3T3 spent conditioned medium and type I collagen (120 μg/ml). Fibroblast 3T3 spent conditioned medium was harvested from subconfluent 3T3 cultures grown for 3 days. Tubules formed were counted in each well at 24 and 48 h at 40× magnification (22Crepaldi T. Gautreau A. Comoglio P.M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) (23Sakurai H. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F139-F146PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation—N-ezrin (2.5 μg) or ezrin (15 μg) were phosphorylated by epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR (1.62 units), in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm MnCl2) in the presence of BSA or AGE-BSA (30 μm) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylated ezrin substrates were detected by Western blotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP, BD Transduction Laboratories) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Stripping and reprobing with an anti-ezrin antibody verified equal loading of N-ezrin and ezrin. Band intensities were quantitated by densitometry using a microcomputer imaging device (MCID) and software (Imaging Research Inc., St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada). Results were corrected for any differences in loading and expressed as a percentage of control BSA sample (n = 3). To purify and identify the AGE binding sites in the diabetic kidney, a kidney extract was prepared and chromatographed on a cation exchange BioRex-70 column. A broad peak of AGE-BSA binding activity eluted between 0.2 and 1.0 m NaCl (Fig. 1A). The active fractions (21Neumann G.M. Bach L.A. J. Biol.

One major peak of AGE-BSA binding activity was eluted with 200 mm NaCl (Fig. 1B, 17–25). SDS-PAGE of this peak demonstrated a triplet of bands sized at 38–45 kDa (Fig. 1C). When the electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to ligand blotting, all three bands bound 125I-AGE-BSA (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The binding of 125I-AGE-BSA to the triplet was completely inhibited by 300-fold excess unlabeled AGE-BSA (Fig. 2A, lane 2) but not by 300-fold excess unmodified BSA (Fig. 2A, lane 3), showing that the binding was specific for glycated BSA. The binding affinity of the isolated proteins for AGE-BSA was assessed by a slot blot competition experiment. With a constant protein amount (10 μg) bound to nitrocellulose membranes and nonspecific binding blocked with BSA, slots were incubated with 125I-AGE-BSA alone (2 nm) or in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled AGE-BSA (10 nm–10 μm). Half-maximal binding was observed at a concentration of 3 × 10–8m (Fig. 2B), which is similar to binding affinities described for other AGE receptors (11Neeper M. Schmidt A.-M. Brett J. Yan S.D.

The amino acid sequences were PK(T/P)I(S/N)VRVTTMDAEL. Comparison with rodent sequences on the Swiss-PROT data base using a basic BLAST software program revealed that these sequences were 100% homologous to the NH2-terminal region of each of the ERM family of proteins, i.e. ezrin, radixin and moesin. Because full-length ERM proteins have molecular masses of 75–82 kDa and the isolated kidney AGE-BSA-binding proteins have molecular masses in the range of 38–45 kDa, further experiments were performed to obtain internal sequence information. CNBr cleavage of the isolated ERM proteins yielded several fragments. NH2-terminal sequencing of bands of 5–10 kDa molecular mass confirmed the presence of all three ERM proteins and identified sequences up to amino acid 318 of the rat moesin sequence and up to amino acid 321 of the mouse ezrin/radixin sequence. (The most COOH-terminal sequences identified were KAQAREEKHQKQLER, KAQAREVLHQKQLER, and KAQAREEKHQKQ). However, no evidence was obtained for the presence of the next CNBr fragment (aa 319/322 onwards). Thus, the isolated proteins that bind AGE-BSA are the NH2-terminal ∼320 amino acids of the ERM proteins, which is consistent with the size of the proteins seen by SDS-PAGE. To define regions of ERM proteins involved in binding AGEs, the human cDNA for ezrin was cloned into the expression vector pPROEX-HTa. Three constructs with NH2-terminal His6 tags were produced, i.e. full-length ezrin (aa 1–586), N-ezrin (aa 1–324), and C-ezrin (aa 323–586). All three constructs were expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography. The isolated recombinant proteins were characterized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A), Western blotting with an anti-ezrin antibody, which recognizes an epitope in the aa 391–515 region of the protein (Fig. 3B), and ligand blotting with 125I-AGE-BSA (Fig. 3C).

The absolute requirement of BH4 for such enzymatic functions is reflected by severe disturbances or even lethality in the case of cofactor limitation due to mutations in BH4-metabolic genes. Patients with cofactor deficiency may exhibit severe dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitter deficiency, hyperphenylalaninemia, and reduced NO production (1Blau N. Thöny B. Cotton R.G.H. Hyland K.

GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), the first enzyme in BH4 biosynthesis, catalyzes the formation of dihydroneopterin triphosphate from GTP (3Thöny B. Auerbach G. Blau N. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). GTPCH activity is regulated by its substrate GTP, BH4, and phenylalanine. A physiological mechanism for post-translational control of GTPCH activity involves feedback inhibition by BH4. Notably, feedback inhibition results from BH4-induced complex formation of GTPCH with a regulatory protein known as GTPCH feedback regulatory protein (GFRP) (4Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K.

In the second step, the 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) catalyzes the conversion of dihydroneopterin triphosphate to 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin.

Sepiapterin reductase (SR) is required for the final step reductions of the diketo intermediate, 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin to BH4.BH4 is required as cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), tyrosine hydroxylase, and tryptophan hydroxylase. The latter two are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin (9Fitzpatrick P.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 355-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The complete hydroxylating system of aromatic amino acids consists of the two additional BH4-regenerating enzymes: pterin 4α-carbinolamine dehydratase and dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) (10Scriver C.R. Eisensmith R.C. Woo S.L.C. Kaufman S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 141-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BH4 is also required for the nitric oxide synthase enzymes (11Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E.

Whereas severe HPA, leading to classic phenylketonuria, can only be treated with a low phenylalanine diet, patients with BH4-responsive PAH deficiency can be treated with BH4 alone (17Trefz F.K. Aulela-Scholz C. Blau N. Eur. J. Pediatr. 2001; 160: 315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Two disorders of BH4 metabolism may present without HPA. These are dopa-responsive dystonia (Segawa disease) (18Bonafe L. Thony B. Leimbacher W. Kierat L. Blau N. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and sepiapterin reductase deficiency (19Blau N. Niederwieser A. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1985; 23: 169-176PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bonafe L. Thony B. Penzien J.M. Czarnecki B. Blau N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although dopa-responsive dystonia is caused by a mutation in the GTPCH gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, SR deficiency is an autosomal recessive trait. Both diseases manifest severe biogenic amine deficiencies.To diagnose BH4 deficiencies and follow-up of the resulting pathologies, only limited possibilities are available, including measurements of metabolites in body fluids, and follow-up of the disease development almost exclusively under treated conditions. Diagnosis starts in most cases with screening of HPA with the Guthrie card and determination of plasma phenylalanine levels as an indirect measurement of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity. Analysis of phenylalanine and tyrosine in serum or plasma before and after a BH4 challenge are often applied as an additional diagnostic tool for differentiation between classic phenylketonuria and biopterin variants. Furthermore, urinary pterin analysis and enzymatic measurements in erythrocytes or skin fibroblasts are carried out to gather information on biopterin-metabolizing enzymes. These data are then combined with a neurotransmitter status. For neurotransmitters, the dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitter degradation products homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), respectively, are measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), thus following the activities of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases. Furthermore, NO metabolites at least for brain nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) isoenzyme activity are determined in CSF.Symptoms of BH4 deficiency include a vast range of abnormalities of the central nervous system, including microcephaly, seizures, hypertonia, hypersalivation, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, and mental retardation. The goals of treatment are to control HPA by dietary restriction of phenylalanine (in PAH deficiency) or BH4 administration (in GTPCH and PTPS deficiency) and to restore neurotransmitter homeostasis by oral administration of the dopamine and serotonin precursors l-dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan, respectively, in BH4 deficiencies. Late detection and introduction of treatment leads to irreversible brain damage. For patients with BH4 deficiency, HPA is controllable with oral doses of 2–10 mg of synthetic BH4/kg/day. However, such relatively low doses of BH4 do not allow the cofactor to penetrate the blood-brain barrier efficiently (21Brand M.P. Hyland K. Engle T. Smith I. Heales S.J.R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Pardridge W.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1781-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). To some extent, this problem can be overcome by administering higher doses of BH4, up to 20 mg/kg/day, together with corresponding neurotransmitter precursors (23Blau N. Duran M. Blaskovics M.E. Gibson K.M. The Physicians's Guide to the Laboratory Diagnosis of Metabolic Diseases. Springer, New York, NY2002: 89-106Google Scholar). The combined therapy is mandatory to avoid neurological damage; however, this treatment is not sufficient in every case (24Blau N. Thöny B. Heizmann C.W. Dhondt J.-L. Pteridines. 1993; 4: 1-10Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar).To analyze in more detail the consequences of BH4 deficiency and its treatment, and to study pathologies in the organism, the use of animal models is required. Here we report on the generation of an animal model for PTPS deficiency by knocking out the Pts gene in the mouse. This led to perinatal lethality of otherwise normal born animals. Treatment studies with daily oral administration of different concentrations of BH4, l-dopa, and 5-hydroxytryptophan for BH4 led to the observation that mice can be rescued but exhibit severe growth deficiency leading to dwarfism due to low serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPts Gene TargetingA genomic clone containing the Pts gene encoding the mouse PTPS was isolated from a 129/Sv-λ phage library and characterized previously (25Turri M.O. Ilg E.C. Thony B. Blau N. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1441-1447PubMed Google Scholar). To construct a targeting vector, a KpnI-NcoI fragment, generated by PCR and spanning exon 1, and the first nine codons from exon 2 were used for the short arm of homology (Fig. 1A). Exon 2 of this fragment was ligated in-frame with an NcoI-BamHI fragment containing the prokaryotic lacZ gene, followed by a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (Pgk)-neo cassette. A Pgk-tk cassette was added 5′ to this short arm of homology. The long arm of homology was a 5.4-kb HindIII fragment containing exons 5 and 6 of the Pts gene. The final targeting vector, plasmid pMSY23, was linearized, electroporated into 129/Sv embryonic stem (ES) cells, and selected for G418 and FIAU (1(1,2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil) resistance as described previously (26Ramirez-Solis R. Davis A.C. Bradley A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 855-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). For PCR screening of ES clones, a nested PCR with two rounds of 40 cycles under standard amplification conditions with an annealing temperature of 55 °C was applied. For the first PCR, the 5′ primer MSY69 annealed outside (upstream) of the short arm of homology, and the 3′ primer PLACZ6 matched to the lacZ gene. For the second round of amplification, the 5′ primer MSY70 was upstream of exon 1, and the 3′ primer PLACZ7 again in the lacZ gene (MSY69: 5′-TATATGCCATCTCTGACTGACAACA-3′; MSY70: 5′-CTGTCTCTGGTTTGAGGAAGTCTCT-3′; PLACZ6: 5′-CAGTTTGAGGGGACGACGACAGTAT-3′; PLACZ7: 5′-TGCTGTTTCTGGTCTTCACCCACCG-3′). Upon additional confirmation of correct double cross-over by Southern blot analyses with an outside probe A (see Fig. 1C) or an internal probe B (not shown), positive Pts +/– ES cell sub-clones were used for injection into C57BL/6 blastocysts, generation of chimeras (derivatives of ES cell-subclone 7-E3), and breeding of homozygous Pts –/– 129/Sv-C-57BL/6 hybrid mice. Screening of mouse tissue material (tail biopsies) was performed by a complex PCR with 40 cycles, 3 primers, and an annealing temperature of 53 °C. Primers were MSY107 (a), 5′-TGACTATGGGCAGAGTTGTT-3′; MSY108 (b), 5′-GATTGTTGCATTTCCCAAAC-3′; and PLACZ8 (c), 5′-GGCTCAGTTCGAGGTGCT-3′ (see also Fig. 1B). β-Galactosidase activity was determined with extracts from ES cells according to a published protocol (27Shaper N.L. Harduin-Lepers A. Shaper J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25165-25171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Replacement TherapyFor an overview of concentrations of drugs used for treatments, see Table I. For the “low” treatment, tablets from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland) containing 50 mg of BH4, 50 mg of ascorbic acid, and 25 mg of N-acetyl-l-cysteine were dissolved in 10 ml of H2O. For l-dopa, tablets containing 100 mg of levodopa and 25 mg of carbidopa (Sinemet MSD, Glattbrugg, Switzerland), and for 5-hydroxytryptophan, tablets containing 100 mg of oxitriptanum (Sigma-tau) were each dissolved in 20 ml of H2O. For the medium treatment, the following stock solution was prepared: 65 mg of BH4-2HCl, 50 mg of ascorbic acid, 10 mg of l-dopa, 6 mg of 5-hydroxytryptophan, 2.5 mg of carbidopa and 25 mg of n-acetyl-l-cysteine dissolved in 1 ml of H2O. For the high treatment, the following stock solution was prepared: 130 mg of BH4-2HCl, 100 mg of ascorbic acid, 10 mg of l-dopa, 6 mg of 5-hydroxytryptophan, 2.5 mg of carbidopa, and 50 mg of N-acetyl-l-cysteine dissolved in 1 ml of H2O. To determine the actual concentrations of BH4, l-dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan, the dissolved compounds were analyzed by standard HPLC (see below). Aliquots were kept frozen, thawed before used, and buffered with sodium citrate to pH 5. The solutions were diluted with water and 10–20 μl were orally administered using yellow tips and a Gilson pipette. For the medium and high treatment protocols, the daily aliquots were divided into two daily doses.Table ITreatment protocol for oral application of BH 4 and neurotransmitter precursorsCompoundaThe daily doses for the medium and high treatments were given in two applications, one in the morning, and one in the late afternoon.TreatmentLowbThe low treatment corresponds to the recommended standard concentrations for treatment of human patients (23).MediumHighμg/g body weight/dayBH41060122L-Dopa510.613.55-Hydroxytryptophan37.49.5CarbidopacDecarboxylase inhibitor.2.52.52.5Ascorbic aciddAntioxidant.1050100N-Acetyl-L-cysteinedAntioxidant.52550a The daily doses for the medium and high treatments were given in two applications, one in the morning, and one in the late afternoon.b The low treatment corresponds to the recommended standard concentrations for treatment of human patients (23Blau N.

Tissues were blended at 4 °C with an electric homogenizer (Kinematic GmbH, Littau-Luzern, Switzerland) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were kept frozen at –80 °C.Neopterin, Biopterin, and Neurotransmitter MeasurementsA volume of 50 μl of liver or 50 μl of brain tissue homogenates were adjusted to 100 μl and oxidized with 10 μl of oxidizing solution (5 g/liter iodine and 10 g/liter potassium iodide in 1 m HCl). After oxidation in the dark for 60 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of freshly prepared ascorbic acid (20 g/liter). A total of 14 μl of 1 m NaOH was added to adjust the mixture to pH 8.5, followed by incubating with 20 μl of an alkaline phosphatase solution at 37 °C for 1 h (300 units/ml calf intestine alkaline phosphatase from Roche Applied Science in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2). The mixture was adjusted to pH 2 by adding 5 μl of 2 m HCl and deproteinized through an Ultrafree-MC filter (Millipore).

This mixture was divided into two 100-μl portions. One portion was immediately oxidized as blank with cell extract, and the second portion was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by cooling the sample on ice and adding 10 μl of oxidizing solution (5 g/liter iodine and 10 g/liter potassium iodide in 1 m HCl). After oxidation in the dark for 60 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 20 g/liter ascorbic acid (freshly prepared). The mixture was adjusted to pH 8.5 by adding 14 μl of 1 m NaOH, and the sample was incubated with 20 μl of alkaline phosphatase solution at 37 °C for 1 h (300 units/ml calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science); see above).

One unit of GTPCH produces 1 μmol of neopterin per minute at 37 °C.PTPS Assay—A final volume of filtrate was adjusted to 50 μl and was added to 60 μl of reaction mixture (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NADPH, 1 mm NADH, 3 milliunits of SR, 140 milliunit of DHPR from Roche Applied Science, and 60 μmol/liter dihydroneopterin triphosphate) in a final volume of 110 μl. This mixture was divided into two portions, one 50-μl aliquot was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and another 50 μl was used as a blank. A blank without cell extract was incubated at the same time; it contained 50 μl of reaction buffer and 60 μl of reaction mixture. The reaction was stopped by adding 15 μl of 300 g/liter trichloroacetic acid for protein precipitation, and cooling on ice for at least 10 min, followed by oxidation with 10 μl of oxidizing solution (10 g/liter iodine and 10 g/liter potassium iodide in H2O) for 60 min in the dark. Excess iodine is destroyed by adding 15 μl of ascorbic acid (10 g/liter ascorbic acid in H2O). For the blanks, the same procedure was used. After 2 min of centrifugation at 15,000 × g, the supernatant was deproteinized through an Ultrafree-MC filter (Millipore) and analyzed by HPLC. One unit of PTPS produces 1 μmol of biopterin per minute at 37 °C.NO Assay—The NO, which is the product of NOS, is extremely reactive and undergoes a series of reaction. Nitrite (NO2- ) and nitrate (NO3- ) are the final products. The sum of these two products (nitrite plus nitrate) was measured using a commercial Colorimetric assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). During this assay, nitrate was converted to nitrite utilizing nitrate reductase and measured by using the Griess reagent. Absorbance was read at 570/620 nm in a Micro-ELISA autoreader MR 530 (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA).Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Assay—This assay was adapted from Ledley et al. (29Ledley F.D. Grenett H.E. Woo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2228-2233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liver homogenate containing 50–100 μg of total protein was used for PAH assay. For the blank, the appropriate amount of liver homogenate was adjusted to a final volume of 104 μl with water and incubated for 5 min in a 96 °C heating block. For the sample, the appropriate amount of liver homogenate was adjusted to a final volume of 77.5 μl with water. A volume of 22 μl of master mixture was added to each sample. The master mixture contained 0.6 mm phenylalanine, 3.6 units of catalase (Sigma), 0.15 m KCl in a 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. After preincubation at room temperature, the reaction was started by adding 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol and 2 μl of 4.5 mm 6-methyltetrahydropterin (Schircks Laboratories) to the samples and incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by incubation for 5 min in a 96 °C heating block and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant was filtrated in an Ultrafree-MC filter device and centrifuged again at 5000 × g for 15 min. Phenylalanine and tyrosine were quantified with a standard amino acid analyzer (Biochrom 20 Plus, Amersham Biosciences).Phenylalanine Concentration in the BloodThe blood from the mice was collected on filter paper cards (Guthrie card). Phenylalanine (and tyrosine) concentrations were measured using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.Protein MeasurementProtein concentrations in homogenized tissues were determined by the spectrophotometric method described by Bradford, using γ-globulin as a calibrator (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar). The activities of the various enzymes are expressed as units per milligram of protein.ImmunoassaysBlood was collected from 35- and 44-day-old mice at the time animals were sacrificed.Insulin-like Growth Factor-1—Serum IGF-1 was separated from clotted blood by centrifugation. It was measured after extraction with acid-ethanol (40 μl of serum and 160 μl of acid-ethanol). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged, and 100 μl of supernatant was diluted 1:6 before analysis. Serum IGF-1 was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) using a rat IGF-1 RIA kit (DSL-2900, Bühlmann Laboratories AG, Switzerland).Growth Hormone—Serum GH was measured by RIA using a specific rabbit anti-rat antiserum and rat GH as standard. The rat GH RIA kit (AH R012) was obtained from Bühlmann Laboratories AG.Blood Thyroxin—T4 was measured by fluoroimmunoassay using the mouse anti-thyroxine IgG as first antibody and the anti-mouse IgG as second antibody. The blood was dried on filter paper cards (Guthrie card). The total amount of T4 was determined in the test. The AutoDELFIA™ neonatal thyroxine (T4) kit was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wallac-ADL AG (Switzerland).RESULTSTargeted Deletion of the Mouse Pts Leads to Perinatal Death—A targeting construct was generated based on the previously isolated and characterized mouse gene structure Pts, encoding the 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (25Turri M.O. Ilg E.C. Thony B. Blau N. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1441-1447PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the pMSY32-targeting vector contained an in-frame lacZ gene fusion at exon 2 of the Pts gene, expressing a putative PTPS-β-galactosidase fusion with 35 N-terminal amino acids from PTPS. Downstream of the lacZ gene, a Pgk-neo cassette was inserted in the opposite direction. Upon correct homologous recombination in ES cells, a putative mutant allele was generated with the lacZ and Pgk-neo inserted, and a deletion of exons 3 and 4, plus most of exon 2. The targeting frequency for correct double cross-over in the 129/Sv ES cells, as verified by PCR, was approximately 5% (not shown). These ES cells had a β-galactosidase activity of 0.05–0.12 OD/mg (wild-type activity < 0.001 OD/mg) and a PTPS activity indistinguishable from wild-type (5.4–6.5 microunits/mg).Upon PCR and Southern blot analyses (Fig. 1, B and C), a few Pts +/– ES cell clones were used for blastocyst injection and subsequent generation of PTPS-null mice. Homozygous mice developed with normal morphology in utero and were born at the expected Mendelian ratio (25% wild-type, 48% heterozygotes, 27% Pts-null mice; n = 159). However, most of the Pts –/– mice died within the first hours after birth; at maximum we found 4 mice out of 26 surviving for 7 days. A more detailed analysis of brain development and fine structure of Pts –/– mice is now in preparation. 2L. Elzaouk, W. Leimbacher, M. Turri, B. Ledermann, K. Bürki, N. Blau, and B. Thöny, manuscript in preparation. Southern blot analyses with genomic mouse tail DNA and a 5′-external probe (Fig. 1C), or an internal neo-probe (Probe B in Fig. 1A; results not shown) revealed correct homologous recombination at the single mouse Pts gene locus. As compiled in Table II, newborn knockout mice at day 1 had no PTPS (<0.05 microunit/mg) and normal GTPCH activity (0.1–0.3 microunit/mg). Heterozygous animals showed intermediate PTPS activity (1.5 microunit/mg) compared with normal activity in wild-type mice (8.0 microunits/mg). Liver neopterin was almost 200-fold higher than normal (59.0 pmol/mg in Pts –/–), and biopterin was only 4% of wild-type (0.9 pmol/mg). Furthermore, the Pts –/– animals had hyperphenylalaninemia with blood values of 1352 μmol/liter phenylalanine (normal control levels were between 34 and 85 μmol/liter), and no detectable or very low brain dopamine and serotonin levels. Expression of β-galactosidase was observed in heterozygous and homozygous Pts mutants (not shown). A more detailed study on developmental expression of the PTPS-LacZ fusion is now in preparation.2Table IIMouse liver values for GTPCH and PTPS enzymes and their metabolites neopterin and biopterinAge (days after birth)GenotypeTreatmentaSee Table I and “Experimental Procedures” for treatment conditions.GTPCHbIndicated are mean values and ranges (in parentheses); for each age group 3-7 animals were tested, except only 2 k.o.-animals for none and low treatments.PTPSbIndicated are mean values and ranges (in parentheses); for each age group 3-7 animals were tested, except only 2 k.o.-animals for none and low treatments.NeopterinbIndicated are mean values and ranges (in parentheses); for each age group 3-7 animals were tested, except only 2 k.o.-animals for none and low treatments.BiopterinbIndicated are mean values and ranges (in parentheses); for each age group 3-7 animals were tested, except only 2 k.o.-animals for none and low treatments.PhenylalaninecPhenylalanine was measured by Tandem-MS in blood spots (Guthrie cards).

Full activation of Rap1 and Rap2 by GH necessitated the combined activity of both JAK2 and c-Src kinases, although c-Src was predominantly required. GH-stimulated Rap1 and Rap2 activity was also demonstrated to be CrkII-C3G-dependent. GH stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G, which again required the combined activity of JAK2 and c-Src. C3G tyrosine residue 504 was required for GH-stimulated Rap activation. Activated Rap1 inhibited GH-stimulated activation of RalA and subsequent GH-stimulated p44/42 MAP kinase activity and Elk-1-mediated transcription. In addition, we demonstrated that C3G-Rap1 mediated CrkII enhancement of GH-stimulated JNK/SAPK activity. We have therefore identified a linear JAK2-independent pathway switching GH-stimulated p44/42 MAP kinase and JNK/SAPK activities.

The Rap proteins (Rap1 and Rap2) belong to the Ras-like small GTPase superfamily, which consists of at least 13 members (1Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In this family, Ras has been extensively studied and was originally regarded as a transforming oncogene since Ras genes have been found mutated in about 15% of all human tumors (2Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). It possesses an important role in cell growth and differentiation as it has been demonstrated to be required for activation of p44/42 MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; GEFs, guanine nucleotide exchange factors; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; JAK, Janus kinase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GH, growth hormone; GST, glutathione S-transferase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; ECM, extracellular matrix; IL, interleukin; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase. kinase activity by a number of growth factors including growth hormone (GH) (3Winston L.A.

Rap1 is closely related to Ras and was initially identified as a suppressor of the K-ras transformed phenotype (6Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Structurally, Rap1 shares striking similarity with Ras in the effector domain. It has been suggested that Rap1 antagonizes Ras activity by sequestration of its target, Raf-1, in the inactive form (7Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In addition, several studies have demonstrated that both Rap1 and Ras can bind the same effectors, such as Raf-1 and RalGDS (8Okada S. Matsuda M. Anafi M. Pawson T. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2554-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Rap2 exhibits 60% identity to Rap1 and shares most of the effector proteins with Ras and Rap1 (9Nancy V. Wolthuis R.M. de Tand M.F. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Bos J.L. de Gunzburg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8737-8745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The function of Rap2 is more limited compared with Rap1, although an antagonistic effect of Rap2 on Ras-mediated transcription has been reported (10Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Matsuo K. Yamashita S. Nakaya M. Hashimoto Y. Hamaguchi M. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6074-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One common mechanism utilized by small GTPases to regulate cellular function is to cycle between the inactive GDP-bound state and the active GTP-bound state. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) facilitate GDP dissociation and allow the more abundant GTP to rebind, while GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) accelerate GTP hydrolysis to complete the cycle (1Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 7Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). C3G is a Rap-specific GEF since it predominantly catalyzes the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction for Rap1 and Rap2 (10Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Matsuo K. Yamashita S. Nakaya M. Hashimoto Y. Hamaguchi M. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6074-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). C3G was originally identified as a major protein bound to the SH3 domain of c-Crk (12Zhai B. Huo H. Liao K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). There are three proline-rich sequences that bind to the SH3 domain of c-Crk in the central region of C3G and one C-terminal CDC25 homology domain catalyzing the GEF reaction of Rap (13Matsuda M. Ota S. Tanimura R. Nakamura H. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Nagashima K. Kurata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14468-14472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The function of the C3G N terminus remains unknown but recent studies have reported the association of p130cas to this region (14Kirsch K.H. Georgescu M.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25673-25679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). C3G is activated by c-Crk-mediated membrane recruitment. Two isoforms of c-Crk protein are generated by alternative mRNA splicing. The larger form is CrkII, containing one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, while the smaller form is CrkI, which lacks the C-terminal SH3 domain and one negative regulatory tyrosine residue compared with CrkII. CrkII is more abundant than CrkI in normal cells; therefore, CrkII is the major adaptor for C3G (15Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A number of growth factors and cytokines stimulate the recruitment of the Crk-C3G complex to the membrane where tyrosine kinases are located such that C3G tyrosine residue 504 is phosphorylated with a resultant increase in its GEF activity (16Kiyokawa E. Mochizuki N. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Ichiba T. Hashimoto Y. Nakaya M. Kuraishi Y. Tanaka S. Kurata T. Mochizuki N.

It utilizes special groups of signaling molecules to regulate the transcription of specific genes required for the above processes. These signaling molecules include: 1) receptor-tyrosine kinases (EGF receptor) (20Yamauchi T. Ueki K. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Sekine N. Wada M. Honjo M. Takahashi M. Takahashi T. Hirai H. Tushima T.

Although JAK2 is postulated to be required for GH signal transduction, our group has recently identified a JAK2-independent pathway regulating GH-stimulated p44/42 MAP kinase activity (29Zhu T. Ling L. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45592-45603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). GH stimulated the formation of GTP-bound RalA and subsequent phospholipase D activation, required for the activation of p44/42 MAP kinase by GH in a c-Src-dependent manner. Here we have demonstrated that cellular stimulation with GH results in the activation of both Rap1 and Rap2 in NIH-3T3 cells. The activation of Rap by GH was achieved by the combined JAK2- and c-Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G. GH-stimulated Rap1 activation was utilized to negatively modulate GH-stimulated p44/42 MAP kinase activity and subsequent Elk-1-mediated transcription through inhibition of RalA activity. Concomitantly, GH stimulated C3G-dependent activation of Rap1-enhanced JNK/SAPK activity and subsequent c-Jun-mediated transcription in response to GH. Rap1 is therefore a GH effector molecule activated in a JAK2-independent manner. Materials—Recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) was a generous gift of Novo Nordisk (Singapore).

The dominant-negative Ras plasmid was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The fusion trans-activator plasmid (pFA-Elk-1) consisting of the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (residues 1–147) and the transactivation domain of Elk-1 were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All plasmids were prepared with the plasmid maxiprep kit from Qiagen. Cell Culture and Treatment—NIH-3T3 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Prior to treatment, cells were deprived for 20–24 h in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Unless otherwise indicated, the concentration of hGH was 50 nm. This concentration of GH is within the physiological range for circulating rodent GH (32Gaur S. Yamaguchi H. Goodman H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1485-C1492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rap, Ral, and Ras Activation Assays—Serum-deprived cells were stimulated with hGH as indicated and then lysed on ice for 15 min in Ral buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 tablet complete protease inhibitor mixture per 50 ml). After lysis samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the protein concentrations of the lysates were measured. 500 μg of cell lysates were immediately affinity-precipitated at 4 °C for 1 h with 50 μg of GST-RalGDS-RBD or 15 μg of GST-RalBP1-RBD or GST-Raf1-RBD fusion proteins that had been freshly precoupled to glutathioneagarose beads. The precipitates were washed three times with Ral buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were separated by 12% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation—After treatment as indicated, cells were lysed at 4 °C for 20 min in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 tablet complete protease inhibitor mixture per 50 ml). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were precleared by protein A/G plus agarose chromatography. The agarose beads were removed by centrifugation, and then the protein concentrations of the resulting supernatants were determined. For each immunoprecipitation, 500–1000 μg of protein was incubated with 4–8 μg of corresponding antibody for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected by incubating with 40 μl of protein A/G plus agarose for 1 h or overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with IP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 tablet complete protease inhibitor mixture per 50 ml). The bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and then resolved by 8–10% SDS-PAGE. Western Blot Analysis—After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 h at 22 °C. Blots were then immunolabeled with the desired antibodies for 1 h at 22 °C. For reblotting, membranes were stripped at 50 °C for 30 min in the solution containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 0.7% mercaptoethanol. Blots were then washed for 30 min with several changes of PBST at 22 °C. Efficacy of stripping was determined by re-exposure of the membranes to ECL. Thereafter, membranes were reblocked and immunolabeled as described above. p44/42 MAP Kinase Assay—p44/42 MAPK kinase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer provided, and the cell extract containing 200 μg of protein per sample was incubated for 4 h or overnight with 15 μl of immobilized phosphospecific p44/42 MAP kinase (Tyr-202/Tyr-204) monoclonal antibody. The pellets were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer and twice with 500 μl of kinase assay buffer provided. The kinase reactions were performed in the presence of 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein and 200 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Elk-1 phosphorylation was detected by use of a specific phospho-Elk1 (Ser-383) antibody. SAPK/JNK Assay—SAPK/JNK assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer provided and the cell extract containing 250 μg of total protein per sample was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of c-Jun fusion protein beads. The pellets were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer and twice with 500 μl of kinase assay buffer provided. The kinase assay was performed in the presence of 100 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. c-Jun phosphorylation was detected by use of a specific phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) antibody. Elk-1 Reporter Assay—Cells were cultured to 60–80% confluence in 6-well plates and transfected with 0.4 μg of the reporter plasmid pFR-Luc, 8 ng of the fusion trans-activator plasmid pFA-Elk1, and 1 μg of the expression plasmid as indicated or empty vector in each well. 25 μl of Effectene was used for each microgram of DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA-lipid complex was diluted in medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 16–20 h. 50 nm hGH was added for an additional 24 h. The cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and then lysed with 150 μl of 1× lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) for 20 min, and supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The luciferase activity was detected and normalized by protein content. c-Jun Reporter Assay—Cells were cultured to 60–80% confluence in 6-well plates and transfected with 0.2 μg of the reporter plasmid pFR-Luc, 4 ng of the fusion trans-activator plasmid pFA-cJun, and 1 μg of the expression plasmid as indicated or empty vector in each well. 25 μl of Effectene was used for each microgram of DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA-lipid complex was diluted in medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 12 h. 50 nm hGH was added for an additional 18 h. The cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and then lysed with 150 μl of 1× lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) for 20 min, and supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The luciferase activity was detected and normalized by protein content. Statistical Analysis and Presentation of Data—All experiments were performed at least three times. Numerical data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed using the two-tailed t test or analysis of variance. GH Stimulation of NIH-3T3 Cells Increases the Level of GTP-bound Rap1 and Rap2—We utilized the GST fused Ral-GDS-RBD (33Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) as a specific probe to determine Rap1 and Rap2 activation in lysates of NIH-3T3 cells stimulated by GH. The GST-fused Ral-GDS-RBD protein recognizes only the active GTP-bound form of Rap1 and Rap2 but not the inactive GDP-bound form of these molecules (33Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). We observed an increased level of GTP-bound Rap1 upon cellular stimulation with GH, first at 2 min after GH addition, sustained to 15 min, and followed by a decline from 30 to 60 min (Fig. 1A). GH stimulation of NIH-3T3 cells also resulted in the formation of GTP-bound Rap2 within 2 min. However, GH-stimulated formation of GTP-bound Rap2 was not sustained, as observed for Rap1, and the level of GTP-bound Rap2 decreased immediately after 5 min (Fig. 1C). GH stimulation of NIH-3T3 cells did not alter Rap1 or Rap2 protein levels over the examined time period of stimulation (Fig. 1, B and D). The GH-stimulated formation of Rap1-GTP and Rap2-GTP was also dose-dependent with the enhancement of Rap1-GTP and Rap2-GTP levels first observed at 0.5 nm GH. The maximal stimulation of Rap1-GTP was from 5 to 50 nm GH (Fig. 1E) while that of Rap2-GTP was at 5 nm GH (Fig. 1G). Thus Rap1 and Rap2 are two signaling molecules utilized by GH to exert its effect on cellular function. GH-stimulated Activation of Rap1 and Rap2 Are Cell Density-dependent—During the course of experimentation, an effect of cell density in monolayer culture on the ability of GH to stimulate Rap1 and Rap2 activity was noticed. We therefore compared Rap activity under conditions of increasing cell density that approximated 40, 70, and 100% cell confluence, respectively. A decrease of both basal and GH-stimulated Rap1 and Rap2 activity was observed with increasing cell density. Thus, GH stimulation of NIH-3T3 cells at 100% confluence failed to stimulate the formation of GTP-bound Rap1 and only minimal activation of Rap2 by GH under these conditions was observed (Fig. 2, A and C). This effect of cell density on the ability of GH to stimulate the formation of Rap1-GTP and Rap2-GTP was not due to decreased Rap protein as the total cellular level of both Rap1 and Rap2 was equivalent at different cell densities (Fig. 2, B and D). GH activation of Rap1 and Rap2 was therefore cell density-dependent. Full Activation of Rap1 and Rap2 by GH Requires both JAK2 and c-Src—GH activates both JAK2 and c-Src kinases independent of the other (29Zhu T. Ling L. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45592-45603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that two other small Ras-like GTPases, RalA and RalB, require the activity of both c-Src and JAK2 to be fully activated by GH (29Zhu T. Ling L. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45592-45603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We therefore next examined the requirement of JAK2 and c-Src for GH-stimulated activation of Rap1 and Rap2. Upon forced expression of the JAK2 kinase-deficient mutant (K882E) (34Rui L. Gunter D.R. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3168-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), both the basal and GH-stimulated formation of Rap1-GTP and Rap2-GTP were diminished, but GH stimulation of cells still resulted in increased Rap1 and Rap2 activity (Fig. 3, A and C). We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of forced expression of JAK2-K882E to prevent GH-stimulated activation of JAK2- and JAK2-dependent signal transduction (29Zhu T. Ling L. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45592-45603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Forced expression of the c-Src kinase inactive mutant (K295R/Y527F) (35Rahimi N. Hung W. Tremblay E. Saulnier R. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) also abrogated the ability of GH to stimulate the formation of GTP bound Rap1 and Rap2 (Fig. 3, A and C) to a greater extent than that observed with JAK2-K882E. Co-transfection of cDNA for both JAK2-K882E and c-Src-K295R/Y527F completely prevented the ability of GH to stimulate the formation of GTP-bound Rap1 and Rap2 (Fig. 3, A and C). Forced expression of either JAK2-K882E or c-Src-K295R/Y527F or both did not alter the total cellular level of Rap1 or Rap2 (Fig. 3, B and D). Forced expression of the kinase-deficient JAK2 and c-Src mutants were verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3, E and F). Therefore, we conclude that although the combined activities of both JAK2 and c-Src kinases are required for full activation of Rap1 and Rap2 by GH, c-Src is predominantly utilized by GH to activate these molecules. Overexpression of CrkII and C3G Enhances GH-stimulated Rap1 and Rap2 Activity—We have previously demonstrated that GH stimulates the formation of a multiprotein signaling complex centered around CrkII (21Zhu T. Goh E.L. LeRoith D. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33864-33875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CrkII and C3G are constitutively associated within this complex although hGH stimulation of cells results in tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII (21Zhu T. Goh E.L. LeRoith D. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33864-33875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CrkII is an adaptor protein and has been reported to recruit C3G to the vicinity of kinase molecules (17Ichiba T. Hashimoto Y. Nakaya M. Kuraishi Y. Tanaka S. Kurata T. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14376-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). C3G is a Rap-specific GEF that accelerates the replacement of GDP by GTP so as to increase Rap activity (11Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We therefore proceeded to examine the involvement of CrkII and C3G in the GH stimulated formation of GTP-bound Rap1 and Rap2. Forced expression of CrkII enhanced the ability of GH to activate both Rap1 and Rap2 (Fig. 4, A and C). Forced expression of C3G, or CrkII together with C3G, resulted in a dramatic enhancement of GH-stimulated formation of GTP-bound Rap1 and Rap2 (Fig. 4, A and C). Forced expression of CrkII and C3G was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4, E and F) and expression of these proteins did not alter the total cellular level of either Rap1 or Rap2 (Fig. 4, B and D). Thus, GH activation of Rap1 and Rap2 is CrkII-C3G-dependent. C3G Tyrosine Phosphorylation Is Required for GH-stimulated Rap1 and Rap2 Activation—Tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G has been reported to be required for the GEF activity necessary for Rap1 activation (17Ichiba T. Hashimoto Y. Nakaya M. Kuraishi Y. Tanaka S. Kurata T. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14376-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We therefore first examined whether GH stimulation of NIH-3T3 cells resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G. As observed in Fig. 5A, GH indeed stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G. GH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G was first observed at 1 min, persisted to 15 min, and then declined at 30–60 min after stimulation with GH. Equivalent loading of immunoprecipitated C3G was demonstrated by reprobing of the membrane for C3G (Fig. 5B). To determine the kinases responsible for hGH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G we utilized the kinase-deficient mutants of both JAK2 (JAK2-K882E) and c-Src (c-Src-K295R/Y527F). Similar to the pattern observed with GH-stimulated formation of GTP-bound Rap1 and Rap2 (above), removal of the activities of both kinases was required for complete prevention of GH-stimulated C3G tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5C). Equivalent loading of immunoprecipitated C3G was demonstrated by reprobing of the membrane for C3G (Fig. 5D). Forced expression of the kinase-deficient mutants of both JAK2 and c-Src was demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5, E and F). Thus GH-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G required the combined activities of both JAK2 and c-Src. We next examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G was required for GH stimulated Rap1 and Rap2 activation. It has been reported that tyrosine 504 of C3G is the critical tyrosine residue required for guanine nucleotide exchange activity for Rap1 (17Ichiba T. Hashimoto Y. Nakaya M. Kuraishi Y. Tanaka S. Kurata T. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14376-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).

Troponin C is associated with various other proteins including troponin I and troponin T. The interaction between the subunits within the troponin complex is of critical importance in understanding contractility. Following a Ca2+ signal to begin contraction, the inhibitory region of troponin I comprising residues Thr128–Arg147 relocates from its binding surface on actin to troponin C, triggering movement of troponin-tropomyosin within the thin filament and thereby freeing actin-binding site(s) for interactions with the myosin ATPase of the thick filament to generate the power stroke. The structure of calcium-saturated cardiac troponin C (C-domain) in complex with the inhibitory region of troponin I was determined using multinuclear and multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structure of this complex reveals that the inhibitory region adopts a helical conformation spanning residues Leu134–Lys139, with a novel orientation between the E- and H-helices of troponin C, which is largely stabilized by electrostatic interactions.

The three subunits of the troponin complex are necessary for Ca2+-induced regulation of cardiac muscle contractility. TnC, the Ca2+-sensitive component of the complex, is a member of the EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding proteins and contains two high affinity Ca2+/Mg2+-binding sites (sites III and IV) in the C-terminal domain and one low affinity Ca2+-binding site (site II) in the N-terminal domain (7Sia S.K.

Biol. 1997; 273: 238-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). At physiological conditions during muscle relaxation, the two C-terminal Ca2+/Mg2+-binding sites are occupied, and the N-terminal Ca2+-binding site is unoccupied. During the onset of muscle contraction, a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations allows the low affinity N-terminal domain to bind Ca2+, resulting in the initiation of heart contraction (10Johnson J.D. Charlton S.C. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3497-3502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TnI is the subunit that in the presence of tropomyosin inhibits myosin Mg2+-ATPase activity. TnI inhibition is removed by the binding of Ca2+ to the N-terminal domain of the TnC subunit (11Farah C.S.

TnI-TnC interactions have been studied extensively for over 3 decades. The functionality of domains of TnC was determined early by Head and Perry (27Head J.F. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1974; 137: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) by using various proteolytic/ cleavage techniques. These studies of rabbit skeletal muscle yielded a region of TnI that has been referred to as the “inhibitory region.” Subsequent work by Talbot and Hodges (28Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3720-3723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified a refined inhibitory region, which has been mapped to a central region of its primary amino acid sequence, corresponding to residues Thr128–Arg147 in the cardiac system (cIp). The inhibitory region contains the minimum sequence required to fully inhibit the myosin ATPase activity on the thin filament (29Syska H. Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Interactions of the cardiac TnI inhibitory region are of key importance in complete understanding of muscle regulation. It has been shown that the inhibitory region interacts with the protein actin on the thin filament during muscle relaxation and that movement of cIp off actin interacts with TnC upon Ca2+-induced muscle contraction. Previously, it has been shown that the inhibitory region of TnI binds to the C-domain of TnC and the central linker region of the N- and C-terminal domains of TnC (30Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Beier N. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8782-8790Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Additional interactions of TnC with other regions of TnI have been elucidated (31Ngai S.-M.

Whereas elucidation of the structure of the inhibitory region of TnI in complex with the troponin complex is of key importance in the understanding of muscle contraction, the structure has remained elusive, and consequently many models have been proposed.

Acta. 1992; 1160: 35-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) led to the proposal that the inhibitory region, sTnI-(104–115) (cTnI-(136–147)), adopts a short helix, distorted around two central proline residues, and this structure was subsequently docked within the hydrophobic cleft on sCTnC (35Ngai S.-M. Sönnichsen F.D. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2165-2172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of sTnC in complex with the N-terminal regulatory peptide of sTnI-(1–47) (Rp40) presented by Vassylyev et al. (21Vassylyev D.G. Takeda S. Wakatsuki S. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) showed that Rp40 adopts a helical structure and binds in the hydrophobic cleft of sCTnC, and these workers modeled the inhibitory region as adopting a helical conformation away from the hydrophobic cleft. The helical conformation of the inhibitory region was directly challenged by Hernandez et al. (36Hernandez G. Blumenthal D.K. Kennedy M.A. Unkefer C.J. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6911-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), who proposed an extended conformation of the inhibitory region, with a two-stranded β-hairpin away from the hydrophobic cleft of the C-domain (37Tung C.S. Wall M.E. Gallagher S.C. Trewhella J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Electron spin labeling work by Brown et al. (38Brown L.J. Sale K.L. Hills R. Rouviere C. Song L. Zhang X. Fajer P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12765-12770Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) has shown that a section of the inhibitory region of the cardiac isoform (cTnI-(129–137)) displays a helical profile, with the C-terminal residues 139–145 displaying no discernible secondary structural characteristics. The inhibitory region possesses a large number of basic residues, and Tripet et al. (39Tripet B. De Crescenzo G. Grothe S. O'Connor-McCourt M. Hodges R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 345-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) predicted that this highly basic region of cTnI makes numerous electrostatic interactions with the acidic TnC in the troponin complex. Recent work on the cardiac isoform using residual dipolar coupling by Dvoretsky et al. (19Dvoretsky A. Abusamhadneh E.M. Howarth J.W. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38565-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) determined the orientations of the domains of cTnC within a cTnI·cTnC complex, and a small angle scattering study by Heller et al. (40Heller W.T. Abusamhadneh E. Finley N. Rosevear P.R. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15654-15663Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) has determined relative domain orientation within a cTnI·cTnC·cTnT-(198–298) complex, which suggests that interactions between TnC and the TnI·TnT components differ significantly between the skeletal and cardiac isoforms. A preliminary crystallographic structure of a TnT·TnC·TnI ternary complex by Takeda et al. (41Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 170AAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) indicated a coiled-coil region of cTnI·cTnT with multiple interactions with cTnC; however, the inhibitory region spanning cIp was not visualized within the structure. We have been successful in elucidating the NMR solution structure of the cardiac isoform of the inhibitory region of TnI (cTnI-(128–147)) in complex with the Ca2+-saturated C-terminal domain of TnC. The inhibitory region displays a helical secondary structure from residues Leu134–Lys139, with several stabilizing electrostatic interactions with cCTnC. The structure correlates well with previous NMR chemical shift mapping of the interactions of the inhibitory region with TnC (22Mercier P. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2902-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Beier N. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7267-7274Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The ability to isotopically label the inhibitory region has given us the unique ability to utilize 15N NMR relaxation to study dynamics of the bound inhibitory region. NMR relaxation indicates that the central core of cIp is rigid when bound to cCTnC, giving validation to the structure. This is the first high resolution structure determined for the inhibitory region of TnI in complex with TnC and provides a framework for understanding interactions within the troponin complex during heart contraction. Preparation of cCTnC Protein—The engineering of the expression vector for the cCTnC-(90–161) protein was as described by Chandra et al. (43Chandra M. Dong W.J. Pan B.S. Cheung H.C. Solaro R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13305-13311Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of cCTnC, 15N-cCTnC, and 13C/15N-cCTnC proteins in Escherichia coli followed the procedure as described previously (44Li M.X. Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8330-8340Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) for sNTnC. CCTnC-labeled proteins were further purified using a gravity flow Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (42Lindhout D.A. Li M.X. Schieve D. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7267-7274Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for cCTnC. Preparation of cIp Protein—cIp-s peptide acetyl-TQKIFDLRGKFKRPTLRRVR-amide was prepared as described for the sIp peptide in Tripet et al. (32Tripet B. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 728-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The engineering of the expression vector for expression and purification of cIp-r, 15N-cIp-r, and 13C/15N-cIp-r via a fusion protein approach has been described previously (42Lindhout D.A. Li M.X. Schieve D. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7267-7274Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 45Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The procedure for purification of the GB-1-cIp-His fusion protein was modified as follows. Fusion proteins were eluted in 100 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. Eluted proteins were then desalted by loading on a Sephadex G-25 medium (Amersham Biosciences) column in 10 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and lyophilized to dryness. Titration of 15N-cCTnC·2Ca2 + with cIp—The titration is as described previously (42Lindhout D.A. Li M.X. Schieve D. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7267-7274Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional {1H, 15N}-HSQC spectra were acquired at every titration point. In order to check if the cIp-s and cIp-r peptides bind the same way to cCTnC·2Ca2+, 8.1 mg of solid cIp-r was added to a 0.92 mm15N-cCTnC·2Ca2+ in NMR buffer (NMR buffer: solution containing 100 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 90% H2O, 10% D2O, 0.01% NaN3. Buffer has been treated with Chelex 100 to remove all residual metal ions prior to sample preparation) with 5 μl of 1 m CaCl2 to generate a complex cCTnC·2Ca2+·cIp-r, in which the [cIp-r]total/[cCTnC·2Ca2+]total is ∼5:1, corresponding to the final ratio for the [cIp-s]total/[cCTnC·2Ca2+]total complex. The two-dimensional {1H, 15N}-HSQC spectrum was acquired and superimposed with that of the cCTnC·2Ca2+·cIp complex. Titration of 15N-cIp-r with cCTnC·2Ca2 + —5.11 mg of recombinant 15N-cIp-r was dissolved in 550 μl of NMR buffer, pH 6.7, containing 25 μl of 1 m CaCl2, and 500 μl was transferred to an NMR tube. Solid cCTnC was added in 1.2-mg additions, with thorough mixing after each addition. Both one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional {1H, 15N}-HSQC spectra were acquired at every titration point. After every titration point, 1 μl of the resulting titrated solution was removed and used for amino acid analysis. Solid cCTnC was added until no further changes were observed in the HSQC spectra, ensuring complete cIp-r saturation. The change in cIp-r concentration due to changes in volume during the titration was taken into account for data analysis, and the change in pH for cCTnC addition was corrected by addition of NaOH during each addition. A small amount of white precipitate accumulated as increasing amounts of solid cCTnC was added. Structural Studies on cCTnC·2Ca2+ ·cIp Complex—Three samples were prepared for structural studies on the complex, with subsequent structural determination carried out using the NMR experiments listed in Table I. 10.13 mg of 13C/15N-cCTnC was dissolved in 600 μl of NMR buffer, pH 6.7, containing 5 μlof1 m CaCl2 to which 6.23 mg of cIp-s was added, and 500 μl was added to an NMR tube. 3.34 mg of 13C/15N-cIp-r was dissolved in 600 μl of NMR buffer, pH 6.7, containing 5 μl of 1 m CaCl2 to which 25.5 mg of cCTnC was added to ensure complete cIp-r saturation, and 500 μl was added to an NMR tube. 5.06 mg of 13C/15N-cIp-r was dissolved with 16.44 mg of 13C/15N-cCTnC to ensure a 1:1 molar ratio in 575 μl of NMR buffer (100% D2O, pH 6.7) containing 5 μl of 1 m CaCl2, and 500 μl was added to an NMR tube.Table INMR spectra acquired and experimental conditions used to obtain assignments and NOE restraintsExperiment nameNucleiaThe nucleus acquired in each dimension (i.e. 1H, 15N indicates 1H in x-dimension and 15N in y-dimension).1H freqbThe frequency (freq) of 1H in MHz.ntcThe number of transients acquired for each FID.x-ptsdx-, y-, z- pts, and sw are the number of complex points and sweep width in each respective dimension (x is the directly detected dimension).y-ptsz-ptsx-swy-swz-swMixeMixing times are given in milliseconds.

All three spectrometers are equipped with triple resonance probes and z axis pulsed field gradients (xyz gradients for the 800 MHz). For the cCTnC·cIp complex, the chemical shift assignments of the backbone and the side chain atoms and NOE interproton distance restraints were determined using the two-dimensional and three-dimensional NMR experiments described in Table I. Data Processing and Peak Calibration—All two-dimensional and three-dimensional NMR data were processed using NMRPipe (46Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Structural Calculations for Binary Complex cCTnC·2Ca2+ ·cIp—NOE contacts between protein-protein, peptide-peptide, and protein-peptide were derived from various three-dimensional 13C/15N-NOESY experiments. The three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY experiment performed on 13C/15N-cCTnC complexed with 13C/15N-cIp-r was used to define protein-peptide contacts with use of symmetrical peaks within the three-dimensional planes for use in unambiguous NOE assignments. All protein-peptide NOEs were calibrated to 4 ± 2 Å. An initial set of 100 structures of both cCTnC and cIp was first generated separately using NOE distance restraints only. NOEs with a distance violation of 0.2 Å or greater were closely examined prior to further rounds of structure refinements.

GRTH gene transcription is stimulated by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) via cyclic AMP-induced androgen formation in testicular Leydig cells. In this study, immunocytochemical and Western analyses identified GRTH as a developmentally regulated protein in Leydig cells and in germ cells (pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids) of the rat testis. Three ATGs with the potential for generation of multiple protein species were identified. Germ cells primarily utilized the 1st ATG codon (+1) and contained major proteins of 61/56 kDa, whereas Leydig cells utilized preferentially the 2nd ATG codon (+ 343) with expression of 48/43 kDa species. A 3rd ATG was weakly utilized and yielded a 33-kDa protein only in germ cells. The increase in GRTH 43-kDa protein in Leydig cells caused by hCG treatment was prevented by the androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide. In round spermatids, hCG caused a significant decrease of 61 kDa species and an induction 48/43 kDa species, whereas no changes were observed in pachytene spermatocytes. Reversal of this hormone-induced switch of expression by flutamide indicated a role of androgen in utilization of the 2nd ATG. These studies have demonstrated a cell-specific and hormone-dependent alternative usage of ATG codons in the testis. They have also revealed that the androgen-dependent transcription of GRTH expression in Leydig cells is accompanied by a marked increase of 43-kDa species. The findings indicate that expression of GRTH proteins is regulated by gonadotropin/androgen at the translational level.

RNA helicases are ribonucleic acid-binding proteins that regulate RNA structure, possess ATPase activity, and unwind double-stranded RNA in an ATP-dependent manner (1Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol.

A large number of RNA helicases have been identified, and these were classified into superfamilies based on specific amino acid sequences in the conserved motifs common to all family members. Among these proteins, DEAD-box proteins were grouped in a family of RNA helicases; that is, the DEAD-box family (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp), whose members exert regulatory roles in various aspects of RNA metabolism including translation, nuclear transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export, and ribosome biogenesis (1Schmid S.R.

In vivo/in vitro studies demonstrated that GRTH is transcriptionally up-regulated by human chorionic gonadotropin at doses that cause down-regulation of luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) receptors, steroidogenic enzymes, and androgen formation (4Dufau M.L. Tsai-Morris C. Tang P. Khanum A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 76: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies revealed that induction of GRTH mRNA by hCG is mediated via second messenger and androgen in Leydig cells. Inhibition of androgen production by inhibitors of steroidogenic enzymes or blockade of androgen action by a receptor antagonist abrogated the stimulation of GRTH mRNA by gonadotropin or cAMP. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that GRTH is predominantly expressed in the testis in both somatic Leydig cells and meiotic spermatocytes and haploid germinal cells of the seminiferous epithelium and is developmentally regulated. In the present study, we identified GRTH protein species, evaluated their protein levels, and studied their cellular distribution within the testicular compartments and their hormonal regulation in the adult rats testis. The regulation of this enzyme by gonadotropin and androgen and its stage-specific localization in germ cells indicate that GRTH could participate in the regulation of androgen-dependent steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal Treatment—Adult and 21-day old male rats (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA) were housed in pathogen-free, temperature- and light-controlled conditions (20 °C; alternating light-dark cycle with 14 h of light and 10 h of darkness). All animal studies were approved by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development animal and care and use committee (protocol 00-044). Adult male rats were given subcutaneous injections of 2.5 μg of hCG (Pregnyl, Organon pharmaceuticals, The Netherlands) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. For in vivo studies to explore gonadotropin-mediated androgen effect on GRTH expression in Leydig cells, adult male rats were injected with the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (2-methyl-N-[4-nitro-3-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]propanamide, Sigma) (5 mg, 2 times a day for 3 days) followed by 2 injections of flutamide with a 12-h interval and a single subcutaneous 2.5-μg dose of hCG 24 h before sacrifice. Animals were killed by asphyxiation with CO2 and decapitated 24 h after hCG or vehicle (controls) treatment unless otherwise indicated. Leydig cells (interstitium) and germinal cells (seminiferous tubule) were prepared from decapsulated testes and further purified for protein extraction, to be analyzed by Western blots.Testicular Leydig and Germ Cells Preparation—Leydig cells were prepared by collagenase dispersion and purified by centrifugal elutriation (5Aquilano D.R. Dufau M.L. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After collagenase dispersion, seminiferous tubules were minced and incubated in Medium 199 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% trypsin (Sigma), and 17 μg/ml DNase (Sigma) for 30 min in a rotary water bath (80 rpm, 35° C). After the addition of soybean 0.04% trypsin inhibitor, the sample was filtered through a 300-, 90-, 40-μm mesh screen, and glass wool and cells were pelleted and resuspended in elutriation buffer containing 2 μg/ml DNase. The relevant types of germ cells were subsequently separated and purified by centrifugal elutriation using Beckman Avanti 21B centrifuge with elutriator rotor model J 5.0 as described previously (6Bucci L.R. Brock W.A. Johnson T.S. Meistrich M.L. Biol. Reprod. 1986; 34: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The first 2 fractions (1 and 2) were collected with flow rates of 31.5 and 41.4 ml/min at 3000 rpm, and 2 additional fractions (3 and 4) were obtained with flow rates of 23.2 and 40 ml/min at 2000 rpm. Cells were identified on air-dried smears, fixed in Bouin's fixative, and stained with hematoxylin and periodic acid-Schiff. Fractions 2 and 4 containing round spermatids and pachytene spermatocytes at a purity of 84 and 86%, respectively, were used for Western blot analyses.Western Blot and Immunohistochemistry Analysis—A polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against a GRTH peptide (amino acids 465–477) and purified by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Protein extracts from testicular Leydig, germ cells, and various tissues including adrenal, ovary, pancreas, brain, and pituitary were assessed by Western blot analysis using the purified GRTH antibody (1/400 dilution, 1 μg of IgG/μl). The specificity of the antibody-GRTH interaction was evaluated in the presence of 60 μm GRTH peptide 465–477. Immunosignals were detected by a super-signal chemiluminescent system (Pierce). GRTH values were normalized by the corresponding β-actin signals. For immunochemistry analysis, testes from adult rats were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections were incubated with GRTH antiserum at a 1/500 dilution (1 μg IgG/μl) and developed with a peroxidase-labeled avidin biotin detection system. Sections of seminiferous tubules were staged according to the method of Leblond and Clermont (7Leblond C.P. Clermont Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1952; 55: 548-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Quantitation of relative immunostaining intensity was performed by three independent observers using scores 0–5 assigned for the signal varying from absent, weak, medium, high, to maximum by vision inspection. At least 50 pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids per stage in 10 different seminiferous tubules were evaluated by two observers. Maximum intensity observed at the stage IX pachytene spermatocyte was defined as score 5.Overexpression of GRTH-GFP and GRTH-PBK Protein in COS-1 Cells—The full length of the GRTH cDNA-coding region including the first ATG codon (newly identified) or from the second ATG codon (first ATG in our previous report (3Tang P.Z. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37932-37940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) were subcloned into the pEGFP-N2 (GRTH-GFP) or pBK (GRTH-PBK) (2 μg) and transfected into COS-1 cells with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). After 36 h, cells were harvested for Western blot analyses by using a GFP monoclonal antibody (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) or purified GRTH antibody.RESULTSWestern Analysis of GRTH Gene Expression—In the process of cloning and analyzing the promoter domain of GRTH gene, we encountered a single nucleotide (G) deletion at nt–272 bp in our previous reported cDNA sequence (3Tang P.Z. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37932-37940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This was verified at the cDNA level by sequencing clones isolated from a rat testis library. With this single-base pair addition, the GRTH cDNA contains 357 additional base pair and an ATG codon (+1) 5′ in-frame to the original cDNA ATG codon (earlier defined as +1 bp, now revised as +343 bp). This sequence of 1630 bp contains an open reading frame encoding 483 amino acids, with the additional 114 amino acids resulting from 5′ sequences of our earlier reported clone (Fig. 1B). A motif search by the GCG program of the 114-amino acid N-terminal sequence identified a consensus leucine zipper pattern (LX 6LX 6LX 6L) with the last leucine missing (amino acid 18–32) in rat, mouse, and human species. A data base search revealed high amino acid sequence homology of GRTH in rat, mouse, and human species (93–98%). Four regions (amino acids 65–71, 82–86, 91–97, and 99–105) within the N-terminal sequences are conserved between GRTH of rat, mouse, and human and DBP5 of mouse and human (8Gee S.L. Conboy J.G. Gene. 1994; 140: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Schmitt C. von Kobbe C. Bachi A. Pante N. Rodrigues J.P. Boscheron C. Rigaut G. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4332-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our recent studies demonstrated that the TATA-less GRTH gene contains multiple transcriptional start sites located within 80 bp 5′ to the first ATG codon (+1). 2C. H. Tsai-Morris, Y. Sheng, and M. L. Dufau, unpublished information.To further analyze the expression of this full-length cDNA we performed Western analysis using either specific GRTH antiserum or GFP monoclonal antibody for GRTH-GFP fusion protein overexpressed in COS-1 cells. Western blot analyses using a GFP monoclonal antibody showed expression of GRTH-GFP fusion proteins with construct A, which contains both first and second ATG (new clone), and construct B, our previous clone with only the 2nd ATG (Fig. 1A, left-most panel, lanes A and B). Expression of construct A revealed a predominant 83-kDa band (56-kDa GRTH, 27-kDa GFP) and a weak 70-kDa protein band (43-kDa GRTH, 27-kDa GFP) and that of construct B, a 70-kDa band. This indicated utilization of both ATGs in the translation process. A 27-kDa GFP band was detected in cells transfected with the GFP construct without the GRTH insert (Fig. 1A, left-most panel, lane GFP). An additional 88-kDa species (61-kDa GRTH, 27-kDa GFP) was also observed. All protein species corresponding to the overexpressed GRTH-GFP fusion protein were also detected with a specific GRTH polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1A, second panel, lanes A and B). In addition to the predominant band of 88/83 kDa, a second less prominent protein band of 70 kDa was detectable by the GRTH antibody from the expression of the full-length GRTH-GFP fusion construct A (Fig. 1A, second panel, lane A). This corresponded to the deduced protein size derived from the amino acid sequence reported in our early studies (3Tang P.Z. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37932-37940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (construct B, lane B), suggesting that the 2nd ATG in the coding region can also function in the translation process.Also, the expressed protein species resulting from transfecting the construct containing full-length GRTH in PBK vector (construct C) were evaluated. We observed 61/56-kDa (predominant) and 43-kDa (minor) bands of size comparable with that calculated from the expressed GRTH-GFP construct (A) that corresponded to usage of the 1st and 2nd ATG codons, respectively (Fig. 1A, second panel, lane C).These findings demonstrate that newly identified ATG is the major translation initiation codon in overexpression studies in COS1 cells. However, the 2nd ATG codon appears to function in a cell-specific manner in Leydig cells (Fig. 1A, fourth panel), and it may also play a significant role under hormonal stimulation (see Fig. 6). There are specific endogenous 56 – 61-kDa protein complexes detected in the whole testis (third panel) and purified adult rat testicular germ cells (round spermatids and pachytene spermatocytes) (Fig. 1A, fourth panel, lanes RS and P), whereas the 43-kDa protein is the major protein species in Leydig cells. Other minor protein bands of 48 and 56 kDa are also expressed in Leydig cells (Fig. 1A, fourth panel, lane LC). An additional minor protein band 33 kDa was also noted in germ cells (Fig. 1A, fourth panel, lanes RS and P). The later may result from utilization of ATG codons at +568 or +598. The specificity of the endogenous GRTH protein bands was confirmed by inhibition of the antibody-GRTH complex by the peptide used to prepare the antibody (Fig. 1A, right-most panel).Fig. 6Western analysis of GRTH expression in germ cells of adult rats. Adult rats were treated with flutamide (Flut.) or/and hCG as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein samples from purified germ cells of adult rats (RS, round spermatids; P., pachytene spermatocytes) were analyzed by Western blot.

This is reasonable because Leydig cells, which are the major source of the 43-kDa species, represent about 4% of the total testis cell volume (10Ichihara I. Kawamura H. Pelliniemi L.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 271: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GRTH was not observed in other organs examined including adrenal, ovary, heart, hypothalamus, or pituitary (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Developmental analysis and tissue distribution of GRTH protein in the rat.

Subsequent studies revealed that the intensity of positively stained germ cells varied during the spermatogenic cycle (see Figs. 3B and 4).Fig. 3A, immunohistochemical localization of GRTH in interstitial Leydig cells of adult testes. a, immunostaining signals are significantly stronger in interstitial Leydig cells (LC) compared with seminiferous tubules (ST). b, purified rabbit IgG was used as the negative control.

Both pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids expressed GRTH protein, and the intensity of staining in the individual cell types varied at different stages of the spermatogenic cycle. GRTH immunoreactive protein staining was significantly higher in round spermatids when compared with pachytene spermatocytes only at early stages (I-III). GRTH levels in round spermatids reached peak levels at stages VIII and IX and were diminished in late stages of elongating spermatids. In pachytene spermatocytes, signals were minimally detectable in stage I and gradually increasing at stages II through IX. The strongest immunoreactive signals were observed in stage VIII and IX, where levels were significantly higher compared with round spermatids. GRTH immunoreactivity in pachytene spermatocytes was gradually decreased from stages X through stage XIII. It was noted that immunoreactive signals were prominent in stage XIV of spermatocytes when cells entered the metaphase of meiotic division. GRTH was not expressed in Sertoli cells or other types of germ cells.Analysis of the intensity of GRTH immunoreactive signals at different stages of round spermatids and pachytene spermatocytes during the spermatogenic cycle and the corresponding pattern of individual cell types are shown in Fig. 4, A and B. The specific cell and stages of GRTH protein expression during germ cells development suggests that GRTH may play an important role in spermatogenesis.Gonadotropin Up-regulation of GRTH Expression in Adult Rat Testes—The GRTH protein levels were significantly increased in adult rat Leydig cells (43 kDa) at 12 h after gonadotropin treatment of adult rats, further increased at 24 h, and returned to near control level at 96 h (Fig. 5A). The weaker 48- and 56-kDa species were unchanged at 12 h but were not detectable at 24 h and were again observed 96 h after treatment (Fig. 5B). The increase of the 43-kDa GRTH species in Leydig cells caused by gonadotropin was prevented by flutamide treatment (Fig. 5C). Flutamide treatment per se also reduced GRTH protein to 56% that of controls (p < 0.01). These findings indicated that GRTH protein expression is up-regulated by the action of androgen induced by gonadotropin stimulation in the Leydig cells.Fig. 5A, time course studies of GRTH protein level regulated by hCG in rat Leydig cells. Western blot analysis of GRTH proteins from Leydig cells of adult male rats injected with 2.5 μg of hCG or vehicle (control) 24 h before sacrifice.

B, Western blot showing changes induced by hCG in all protein species in Leydig cells. In addition to major increases of the predominant 43-kDa band induced by hormone treatment, note the disappearance of the minor bands of 48 and 56 kDa at 24 h and return at 96 h. C, in vivo study of hormone effects on GRTH protein level in Leydig cells. Adult rats were treated with flutamide or/and hCG as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein samples from Leydig cells of adult rats were analyzed by Western blot. Results were recorded by autoradiography (upper) and quantified by densitometry (lower). Counts were normalized by β-actin and presented as percent mean ± S.E. relative to controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In germ cells the GRTH protein (61/56 kDa) were markedly affected by gonadotropin stimulation in a cell-specific manner (Fig. 6). Although there were no changes observed in pachytene spermatocytes, gonadotropin treatment significantly altered the pattern of protein expression in round spermatids. In these cells the 61-kDa species was significantly decreased to barely detectable levels, whereas only minor reduction in the 56-kDa species were observed. Most notably was the marked induction of the 48/43-kDa species that were undetectable in round spermatids of control animals. Moreover, treatment with flutamide prevented the induction of these species by hCG in the round spermatids. This indicated alternative utilization of GRTH translation initiation codon governed by direct or indirect action of androgen in these cells.DISCUSSIONThis study has identified GRTH cDNA clones that contain an in-frame ATG codon 5′ upstream to the translation initiation codon present in the cDNA previously cloned in our laboratory. This additional codon extends the open reading frame of GRTH by 114 amino acids. Both ATG codons are actively translated in the adult rat testis, and the GRTH protein is expressed in both Leydig cells and germinal cells. Also, there is a cell-specific and hormone-dependent usage of ATG codons in the testis. Our findings revealed up-regulation of GRTH in the Leydig cells and a switch of GRTH protein species expressed in round spermatids induced by gonadotropin treatment and a direct or indirect involvement of androgen in this regulation. These results support the notion that androgen exerts regulatory function in GRTH gene expression.The primary antibody used in this study is a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the unique C-terminal amino acid sequence (amino acids 465–477), with no similarity to any other member of RNA helicase gene family or known proteins. Western blot analyses of transiently transfected COS-1 cells with various constructs (Fig. 1) confirmed the antibody specificity since both GRTH and GFP antibodies revealed major 88/83-kDa species and a minor 70-kDa protein band from expression of GRTH-GFP fusion construct A. Moreover, the 70-kDa species was detected from expression of the 5′-truncated GRTH-GFP, construct B. In cells transfected with construct C, both the 61/56- and 43-kDa species were present. The observed sizes of the endogenous proteins (61/56- and 43-kDa species) were consistent with those derived from the deduced amino acid sequences and the expressed GRTH-GFP fusion proteins corrected for the GFP contribution. The ∼5-kDa difference observed in the 61 versus 56-kDa and 48 versus 43-kDa species may result from post-translational modification (i.e. N-glycosylation at amino acid site 426 or 472). The difference of the 61/56- and 48/43-kDa species can be accounted for by codon usage at ATG +1 and +343 nt, respectively. The intensity of the 61-kDa species is stronger than the 56-kDa species in the testis and round spermatids, whereas the pachytene spermatocytes do not the contain 56-kDa species. In Leydig cells, the 43-kDa protein is the dominant species. The mechanism involved in the formation of these various GRTH protein species and the significance of their respective function in specific cell types remain to be resolved. GRTH was present in testis and not detected in other tissues examined, including ovary, hypothalamus, and pituitary. The lack of detectable protein expression in these tissues is of interest since our previous study demonstrated mRNA expression at these sites (3Tang P.Z. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37932-37940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and indicates a lack of translatability or very low levels of the protein, undetectable by the method employed.Production of multiple protein isoforms could result from transcripti"
https://openalex.org/W1984374041,"Selective inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) results in radiosensitization of cancer cells. One potential mechanism involves cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, which is activated by radiation via the epidermal growth factor receptor/MAPK pathway and which regulates synthesis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a protein involved in repair of ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage. To test for a role of CREB in cellular radiosensitivity, CHO cells were transfected with plasmids expressing dominant-negative CREB mutants (CR133 or KCREB), and various end-points were measured 48 h later. Basal levels of PCNA-CAT reporter construct activity were reduced by 60 and 40% following expression of CR133 and KCREB, respectively; similar decreases were observed in PCNA protein levels. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis measurements showed that CR133 inhibited the repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks, and this effect was reversed by over-expression of PCNA; dominant-negative CREB also significantly inhibited split-dose recovery. Clonogenic assays were used to determine surviving fraction; the dose enhancement ratios for dominant-negative CREB-expressing cells compared with control (vector alone) were 1.5 and 1.3 for CR133 and KCREB, respectively. Importantly, co-transfection of mutant CREB and a construct constitutively expressing PCNA protein restored radiosensitivity of CHO cells back to wild-type levels. Moreover, cells expressing either CREB mutant showed no significant cell cycle redistribution. These data demonstrate that genetic disruption of CREB results in radiosensitization, and that this effect can be explained by a mechanism involving decreased PCNA expression and inhibition of DNA repair.

Cell. 1992; 69: 367-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) and is involved in the repair of ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage (14Karmakar P. Balajee A.S. Matarajan A.T.

Biol. 1999; 19: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have been observed between 15 min and 2 h after irradiation. Because PCNA also functions in the replication of DNA (and thus, progression through the S-phase of the cell cycle) (19Zuber M. Tan E.M. Ryoji M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Prelich G. Kostura M. Marshak D.R. Mathews M.B. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), depletion of PCNA could potentially modify cellular radiosensitivity through both repair inhibition and cell cycle redistribution mechanisms. The radiation effects on CREB and PCNA support their role as determinants of cellular radiosensitivity. We have, therefore, investigated the mechanism of DN-CREB-mediated radiosensitization by defining the effects of CREB on PCNA function and expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Unless specified otherwise, all reagents were obtained from Sigma. RPMI 1640 medium and LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent were obtained from Invitrogen, and fetal bovine serum was purchased from HyClone (Logan, UT). The DN-CREB constructs, pCMV-CREB133 (CR133) and pCMV-KCREB (KCREB), and pCRE-Luc reporter plasmids were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Luciferase assay kits and the empty vector, pCMV (which carries the CMV promoter without any downstream gene) were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Bradford protein assay reagents and broad-range molecular weight markers were obtained from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Primary antibodies against PCNA and β-actin and horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Cell Treatments and Irradiation—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO.K1) cells from American Type Tissue Collection (Rockville, MD) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium + 5% fetal bovine serum + penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were plated for 2 days in 10- or 3.5-cm dishes to achieve 50–90% confluency the day of transfection. Two days after transfection, cells were exposed to ionizing radiation at a dose rate of 1.4–1.6 Gy/min (depending on the month of calibration) using a 60Co source, and incubated for colony formation. Alternatively, cells were lysed 2 days after transfection for reporter gene assays or fixed in ethanol for flow cytometry.DNA Transfections—Plasmid DNA containing the wild-type PCNA promoter with a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene (PCNA-87 CAT) was generously provided by Dr. Michael Mathews (10Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); PCNA-87 CAT is simply referred to as PCNA-CAT throughout this paper. A construct expressing the human PCNA gene, pCMV-PCNA, was obtained from ATTC. The β-galactosidase reporter plasmid, RSVβgalBSH, was described previously (21Valerie K. Delers A. Bruck C. Thiriart C. Rosenberg H. Debouck C. Rosenburg M. Nature. 1988; 333: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Plasmids were co-transfected using optimum LipofectAMINE PLUS conditions described by the manufacturer. When two plasmids were co-transfected and compared with data with only one active construct, vector DNA was co-transfected in equal amounts such that the total amount of DNA was the same for all transfections. Three hours after transfection in serum-free, antibiotic-free medium, complete medium was added, and dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h.Reporter Gene Assays—CAT and β-galactosidase assays were performed as previously described (21Valerie K. Delers A. Bruck C. Thiriart C. Rosenberg H. Debouck C. Rosenburg M. Nature. 1988; 333: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of whole-cell lysates (without protease inhibitors) were incubated with CAT mixture containing 125 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 nCi/μl 14C-chloramphenicol, and 670 μm Acetyl-CoA. Reactions were extracted with ethyl acetate and spotted onto TLC plates. Chromatograms were developed with 95% chloroform-5% methanol for 45 min, and exposed overnight to x-ray film. For β-galactosidase assays, equal amounts of protein and 150 μm resorufin in PBS + 1 mm MgCl2 were added to wells, and β-galactosidase activity was measured using a fluorimeter. CAT activity, calculated by densitometry as % (converted)/(converted + unconverted), was then normalized for transfection efficiency based on β-galactosidase assays.Luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pCRE-Luc and 0.5 μg of DN-CREB (or vector control), and cells were lysed 48 h later. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were added to tubes, and a luciferin substrate was injected. The luminescence of the product, oxyluciferin, was monitored using a Berthold luminometer.Western Blot Analyses—Two days after transfection, cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and snap-frozen on dry ice. Cells were scraped into a lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton-X) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and passed 5 times through a 20-gauge needle and syringe. Samples were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatant proteins were determined by the Bradford assay. For Western blotting, 5× loading buffer (50 mm NaPO4, 5% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 12.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) was added to samples. Equal amounts of protein were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and protein transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with primary antibodies against PCNA or β-actin and horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were analyzed by chemiluminescence detection and densitometry.DNA Double-strand Break Measurements—Cells were transfected with CR133, vector, and/or pCMV-PCNA as described above. After 48 h, log-phase cells were trypsinized and resuspended in PBS at 4 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were mixed with an equal volume of 1% InCert Agarose/PBS and plugs were cast. Plugs were then equilibrated in growth medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Plugs were irradiated at 20 Gy, and repair processes were terminated at various timepoints by submersion of plugs into ice-cold digestion buffer (0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Sarkosyl, 1 mg/ml proteinase K) for 2 h. Plugs were incubated in digestion buffer overnight at 50 °C, rinsed 3 times with 0.5× Tris/EDTA buffer for 1 h, and stored in 0.5 m EDTA at 4 °C. Plugs were inserted into the wells of a 0.5% agarose, 0.5× Tris/boric acid/EDTA gel and electrophoresed for 16 h using a BioRad CHEF DRII pulsed-field gel electrophoresis system, according to manufacturer's specifications. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and inverted ultraviolet images were acquired and analyzed using densitometry. The fraction of DNA released from plugs was calculated from densitometry using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager as DNA released/(DNA in plug + DNA released), and normalized by defining the ratio at t = 0 as unity.Clonogenic Assay—Cells were trypsinized, counted, diluted, and plated at numbers appropriate for each treatment, then incubated at 37 °C for 8 days after plating. Colonies were fixed with methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Colonies were counted by eye, with a cut-off of 50 viable cells. Surviving fractions for transfected cells were normalized to the respective plating efficiencies for transfection alone. The dose enhancement ratio was calculated as the dose (Gy) for radiation alone divided by the dose (Gy) for radiation plus transfection (normalized for transfection toxicity), at a surviving fraction of 0.37. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean for three independent experiments, each plated in quadruplicate. Survival curve parameters D0 and n were fitted to the multi-target single hit equation: S = 1 – (1 – e–D/D0)n. The survival curve parameters α and β were fitted to the α-β model: S = exp(–αd – βD2).Cell Cycle Analysis—Two days after transfection, cells were trypsinized and 2 × 106 cells were fixed by slowly adding ice-cold 70% ethanol in PBS while vortexing. Fixed cells were stained overnight at 4 °C with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide + 40 units RNase in PBS, and analyzed using a Coulter flow cytometer. Cell cycle analysis was performed using ModFit software.Statistical Analysis—A two-tailed Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance for n = 3 independent experiments. p values of less than 0.05, as calculated using Sigma-Plot software, were considered statistically significant.RESULTSDominant-negative CREB Constructs and Their Effect on CREB Transcriptional Activity—We have shown that transfection or adenoviral transduction of a DN EGFR mutant results in radiosensitization of human cancer cells (2Lammering G.

Similarly, we have demonstrated that selective inhibition of the MAPK pathway potentiates cell killing by ionizing radiation (4Carter S. Auer K.L. Reardon D.B. Birrer M. Fisher P.B. Valerie K.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic inhibition of CREB, which is activated by the same pathways (6De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

For these initial studies we used CHO cells because they are well defined radiobiologically and are readily manipulated genetically by transfection (efficiency > 90%). DN-CREB constructs were utilized to inhibit the transcriptional activity of CREB in this cellular system. Two DN-CREB mutants with different mechanisms of CREB inactivation were used: CR133, which expresses a CREB protein with a mutation in the Ser-133 phosphorylation site; and KCREB, encoding a CREB protein with a mutation in the DNA binding domain. To verify inactivation of basal CREB-induced transcription, a luciferase-based CREB reporter system was used (Fig. 1). When cells were co-transfected with pCRE-Luc and CR133 or KCREB, 5.6- and 2.6-fold decreases in luciferase activity were observed within 48 h, respectively.Reduction of PCNA Reporter Activity and PCNA Protein Levels by DN-CREB—Because the PCNA gene is transcriptionally activated by CREB (10Lee B.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9454-9458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we tested whether inhibition of CREB would reduce PCNA promoter activity. When CHO cells were co-transfected with CR133 and PCNA-CAT reporter (10Lee B.H. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and assayed 48 h later (same protocol as with pCRE-Luc), a 60% decrease in basal PCNA-CAT activity was observed (Fig. 2). Co-transfection of PCNA-CAT and KCREB resulted in a modest but still significant (p < 0.05) 41% decrease in basal PCNA-CAT levels. Co-transfection with the empty vector (pCMV) did not change PCNA-CAT activity. A plasmid encoding an unrelated downstream gene (β-galactosidase) was co-transfected instead of vector DNA, and this also had no effect on PCNA-CAT promoter activity (data not shown).Fig. 2Effect of DN-CREB expression on basal levels of PCNA-CAT reporter activity. Cells were co-transfected with either CR133 or KCREB and the PCNA-CAT reporter construct. Total cellular protein was isolated after 48 h, and CAT assays were performed. Normalized CAT activity represents the percent conversion from CAT assays, normalized by the β-galactosidase transfection efficiency (n = 3 independent experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the effects of DN-CREB on PCNA promoter activity were accompanied by a corresponding change in PCNA protein levels, the same protocol was followed except that Western blotting was used as an end point. As was found with PCNA promoter activity, expression of CR133 or KCREB resulted in 62 and 38% decreases, respectively, in PCNA protein levels (Fig. 3). To test whether over-expression of PCNA could modulate this effect, a plasmid was used that expresses the human PCNA gene (pCMV-PCNA). Transfection of pCMV-PCNA resulted in a 2-fold increase (p < 0.05) in PCNA expression above basal levels of vector control cells, and recovery of PCNA protein levels to near normal in CR133-expressing cells.Fig. 3Effect of DN-CREB expression and PCNA over-expression on PCNA protein levels. Cells were transfected with either CR133, KCREB, or pCMV-PCNA + CR133. Total cellular protein was isolated 48 h after transfection and subjected to Western blot analysis against PCNA. Equal amounts of DNA were transfected by using vector DNA. Fold-changes represent the mean of n = 3 independent experiments. Equal protein loading was verified by stripping and re-probing for β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Modulation of DNA Double-strand Break Repair and Split-dose Recovery by DN-CREB—Because PCNA is required for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair (22Henderson D.S.

Cell. 1999; 96: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to measure the induction and repair of DSBs. A dose of 20 Gy was used to induce double-strand breaks, because repair kinetics could not be adequately resolved with lower doses (data not shown). When cells were transfected with CR133 and irradiated 48 h later, a statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the rate of DSB repair was observed at each time point, compared with cells transfected with the pCMV vector (Fig. 4). The repair half-times of vector-transfected and CR133-transfected cells were 38 min and 60 min, respectively. Cells transfected with CR133 and pCMV-PCNA exhibited repair kinetics nearly that of control levels. Transfection of pCMV-PCNA alone did not influence repair kinetics.Fig. 4Repair kinetics of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks after expression of CR133 and/or pCMV-PCNA.

Cells were transfected with DN-CREB mutants and irradiated as described above, except that two separate doses of 2 Gy were delivered to cells with varied time intervals (0–5 h) between doses. Clonogenic assays were then performed. Transfection of CR133 resulted in almost complete inhibition of split-dose recovery, and KCREB expression caused intermediate but still significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of split-dose recovery (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Effect of DN-CREB expression on split-dose recovery.

Cells were transfected with either construct, irradiated 48 h later, and cell survival was determined using a clonogenic assay. The mean surviving fraction for cells transfected with DN-CREB constructs (without radiation) are 0.60 and 0.77 for CR133 and KCREB, respectively. Survival curves (Fig. 6) are normalized for this transfection-derived toxicity. Transfection of the empty vector (pCMV) did not cause any significant toxicity or changes in radiation survival (p > 0.05). The dose enhancement ratios (dose enhancement ratio at surviving fraction = 0.37) for the curves shown in Fig. 6 were 1.5 and 1.3 for CR133 and KCREB, respectively.

Single nucleotide BER requires several enzymatic activities, including DNA polymerase and 5′,2′-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase. Both activities are intrinsic to four human DNA polymerases whose base substitution error rate during gap-filling DNA synthesis varies by more than 10,000-fold. This suggests that BER fidelity could vary over a wide range in an enzyme dependent manner. To investigate this possibility, here we describe an assay to measure the fidelity of BER reactions reconstituted with purified enzymes. When human uracil DNA glycosylase, AP endonuclease, DNA polymerase β, and DNA ligase 1 replace uracil opposite template A or G, base substitution error rates are ≤0.3 to ≤2.8 × 10–4. BER error rates are higher when excess incorrect dNTPs are included in the reaction or when wild type DNA polymerase β is replaced by DNA polymerase β variants that fill single nucleotide gaps with lower fidelity. Under these conditions, the base substitution fidelity of polymerase β-dependent BER is 3–8-fold higher than is single nucleotide gap filling by polymerase β alone. Thus other proteins in the BER reaction may enhance the base substitution fidelity of DNA polymerase β during single nucleotide BER.

Mammalian cells harbor more than one BER pathway (1Wilson S.H. Sobol R.W. Beard W.A. Horton J.K. Prasad R. Vande Berg B.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). One way to distinguish these is by the number of nucleotides replaced, which can be from one to more than 10. Single nucleotide BER is initiated upon recognition of an altered base by a monofunctional DNA glycosylase that cleaves the glycosylic bond to release the base and produce an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site. The DNA backbone is cleaved 5′ to the AP site by a class II AP endonuclease (APE), producing a 5′,2′-deoxyribose-5-phosphate (dRP) and a 3′-hydroxyl terminus. The missing base is replaced by polymerization, the displaced dRP group is excised, and the resulting nick is ligated to complete repair. Multiple proteins exist in mammalian cells that theoretically could participate in each step in BER. By virtue of its DNA polymerase and dRP lyase activities (2Matsumoto Y. Kim K.

Moreover, while the latter three polymerases lack intrinsic exonuclease activity, human APE is reported to have 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity that can excise nucleotides misinserted by pol β (16Chou K.M. Cheng Y.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus APE or a exonuclease such as TREX 1 (17Höss M. Robins P. Naven T.J.P. Pappin D.J.C. Sgouros J. Lindahl T.

The number of DNA bases subject to BER due to modification by normal cellular processes like depurination, deamination, oxidation, and alkylation has been estimated to exceed 10,000 per day (19Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to physical and chemical agents in the environment can further increase the number of modified bases. Thus errors arising during BER could give rise to one or more mismatches per day that, if uncorrected, could result in base substitutions. For example, uracil-initiated BER in mammalian cell-free extracts involving replacing one to eight nucleotides generated substitution error frequencies ranging from 5.2 to 7.2 × 10–4 (20Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24822-24831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Sanderson R.J. Bennett S.E. Sung J.-S. Mosbaugh D.W. Prog.

That more than one DNA polymerase can generate BER errors in cell-free extracts was demonstrated by differences in BER error specificity in extracts of pol β (+/+) and (–/–) mouse cells (22Bennett S.E. Sung J.-S. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42588-42600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To investigate the enzymes and mechanisms responsible for determining the fidelity of BER pathways, here we describe an assay to determine error rates during BER reactions reconstituted with purified proteins. We measure base substitution error rates for repair of uracil opposite adenine or guanine, in single nucleotide BER reactions reconstituted with purified proteins, one of which is human pol β. The results establish the minimum fidelity of this single nucleotide BER reaction and indicate that BER fidelity is at least severalfold higher than is the fidelity of single nucleotide gap filling DNA synthesis by pol β alone. Materials—Materials for the fidelity assaya were from previously described sources (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases EcoRI, PstI, and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs. [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]dTTP, and dNTP were from Amersham Biosciences. High performance liquid chromatography-purified or gel-purified oligonucleotides were obtained from Oligos Etc., Inc. (Wilsonville, OR). Recombinant human uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) with 84 amino acids deleted from the amino terminus, APE, pol β, and DNA ligase I were purified as described previously (24Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Preparing Gapped DNA—Duplex DNA was formed by annealing two oligonucleotides (5′-AATTCCAGCTCGGTACCGGGCTAGCCTTTGGAGTCGACCTGCAGA-3′) and (5′-AATTTCTGCAGGTCGACTCCAAAGGCTAGCCCGGTACCGAGCTGG-3′). This duplex was inserted into the EcoRI site of M13mp2. The resulting modified M13mp2 phage was used to prepare single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA as described previously (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Gapped DNA was prepared by hybridizing circular plus strand phage DNA to the minus strand of the large duplex fragment produced by an EcoRI/PstI double digestion of the double-stranded DNA, as described previously (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The gapped DNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified from gel slices by electroelution using an Elutrap (Schleicher and Schuell). Substrates for BER—For experiments with a G:U substrate, a duplex was formed by annealing a 45-mer (5′-CCAGCTCGGTACCGGGCTAGCCTTTGGAGTCGACCTGCAGAAATT-3′) and a 45-mer (3′-GGTCGAGCCATGGCCCGATUGGAAACCTCAGCTGGACGTCTTTAA-5′). For experiments with the A: U substrate, a duplex was prepared by annealing a 45-mer (5′-CCAGCTCGGTACCGGGCTAGCCTTTGGAGTCGACCTGCAGAAATT-3′) and a 45-mer (3′-GGTCGAGCCATGGCCCGAUCGGAAACCTCAGCTGGACGTCTTTAA-5′). In Vitro Base Excision Repair Assays—BER reactions were performed according to a previously described procedure (24Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) with modifications. The reaction mixture contained 4 pmol of uracil containing substrate, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. Reactions (12 μl) were initiated by adding 400 fmol of UDG and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction (40 μl) was then supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mM ATP, 10 nm APE, 10 nm pol β, 100 nm DNA ligase I or T4 DNA ligase (20 units/μl), 10 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and either 0.3 μm [α-32P]dCTP (for G·U substrate) or 0.3 μm [α-32P]dTTP (for A·U substrate) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 4 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Molar ratios of pol β to substrate were as follows: 1:1 for wild type pol β, 4:1 for R283K pol β, and 16:1 for R283A pol β. Preparation of Repaired DNA—The repaired duplex DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Precipitated DNA was dissolved and the DNA was digested with PstI, followed by heat inactivation of PstI for 20 min at 80 °C. After adding an equal volume of gel loading buffer and incubating for 2 min at 95 °C, the DNA were separated by electrophoresis in a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.8. The repaired 35-mer oligonucleotide was located by autoradiography and excised, the gel slice was crushed and soaked in water, and the single-stranded oligonucleotide was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The amount of repaired DNA recovered was calculated from the radioactivity recovered, with estimated yields of about 50%. Hybridizing the Repaired Oligonucleotide to Gapped DNA—The repaired (or unrepaired control) oligonucleotide was incubated for 3 min at 75 °C and then mixed in 10-fold molar excess with the gapped DNA in a buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate. This mixture was incubated at 48 °C for 3 min, 42 °C for 10 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Measurement of Reversion Frequency—DNA samples were introduced into Escherichia coli MC1061 by electroporation, cells were plated, M13 plaque colors were scored, and reversion frequencies were calculated as described previously (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DNA was isolated from collections of independent revertants to define the sequence change responsible for the dark blue plaque phenotype. Strategy to Measure BER Fidelity—The assay (Fig. 1A) monitors the fidelity of BER reactions that repair damage (e.g. uracil) present in a 45-base pair duplex DNA oligonucleotide. The DNA sequence (Fig. 1B) is a modified NH2-terminal coding sequence of the lacZ α-complementation gene of bacteriophage M13mp2. Here we study incorporation of the correct base following removal of uracil paired with adenine (Fig. 1) or mispaired with guanine. The adenine and guanine are located within a TAG codon. BER is performed with radiolabeled dNTP precursors, and a small amount of the reaction product is analyzed by electrophoresis to detect the 45-base pair product expected for complete single nucleotide BER. The remaining product is digested with PstI to generate a repaired, radiolabeled, 35-base pair minus strand and an unlabeled, 39-base pair, plus strand template. The minus and plus strands are separated by denaturing PAGE, and the repaired 35-base pair minus strand DNA is isolated free of its complementary strand. The repaired minus strand DNA is hybridized to circular, plus strand M13 DNA containing a 35-nucleotide single-stranded gap. This generates circular M13 molecules that express the repaired DNA strand when introduced into E. coli cells and plated to score M13 plaque colors. Correct incorporation of dTMP opposite A or of dCMP opposite G during BER maintains the TAG codon. Although a TAG stop codon in the NH2 terminus of lacZ usually yields colorless M13 plaques (23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), this particular TAG codon encodes a light blue plaque phenotype, presumably due to partial read through of the stop codon. Eight different base substitutions resulting from BER errors are detected as dark blue plaques (Fig. 1B). Incorporation of dTTP opposite G results in a TAA codon whose light blue phenotype is indistinguishable from that of the original TAG codon. Uracil that escapes BER will not increase the reversion frequency because it will yield a light blue plaque when paired with either the A or the G of the TAG codon. When 35-base pair oligonucleotides with substitutions at the adenine or guanine were hybridized to gapped circles containing the TAG codon and then introduced into E. coli cells, ∼60% of the plaques arising from these mismatched heteroduplexes were dark blue. This is similar to previous studies showing an average of 60% expression of the minus strand in mismatched heteroduplexes (Ref. 23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar and references therein) and indicates that errors made in vitro are expressed with high efficiency when introduced into E. coli cells. Measurements of Single Nucleotide BER Fidelity—A BER reaction was performed with human UDG, APE, DNA pol β, and DNA ligase I. Reaction conditions were similar to those previously demonstrated to replace uracil paired opposite A or G with a single correct nucleotide (24Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Control experiments (not shown) demonstrated that UDG removed >95% of the uracil present in the duplex substrate in the reaction. The DNA products of complete BER reactions included the expected 45 base pair ligated DNA characteristic of complete BER (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). Shorter chain length products were also observed that result from uracil removal, APE incision of the DNA backbone, and incorporation of the radiolabeled dNTP but without ligation. The 27-base pair product (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 2, and 4) results from incorporation of one dNTP, while the slightly longer products result from limited strand displacement. Following digestion of the duplex products of BER with PstI, repaired 35-mer minus strand products (e.g. Fig. 1C, lane 5) were isolated and hybridized in 10-fold molar excess to gapped M13 DNA, and the reversion frequency of these circular M13 genomes was determined. Repair of uracil opposite template A in reactions containing correct dTTP but no incorrect nucleotides resulted in products whose reversion frequency was 3.4 × 10–4 (Table I, Experiment 1). The products of a BER reaction containing an equimolar concentration of all four dNTPs, thus providing the opportunity to misincorporate nucleotides, yielded a similar reversion frequency of 5.6 × 10–4. Both values are similar to the reversion frequency of 3.9 × 10–4 observed when an unrepaired uracil containing 35-mer was hybridized to the gap (Table I, line 2). Thus, pre-existing errors introduced during chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides contribute significantly to reversion frequencies in this range. Similar results were obtained for BER reactions that replaced uracil with dCTP opposite template G (Table I, Experiment 2).Table IReversion frequency of BER reaction productsDNA substrateReaction conditionPlaquesReversion frequency (×10-4BlueTotalGapped DNANone3250,0000.04Gap + oligoNone43109,0003.9Experiment 1. wild type DNA polymerase βA—UCorrect dTTP only48143,0003.4Equimolar dNTPs (10 μM)65117,0005.650 × dCTP, dGTP, dATP7266,00011.0Experiment 2. wild type DNA polymerase βG—UCorrect dCTP only1261,0002.0Equimolar dNTPs (10 μM)4555,0008.250 × dATP, dGTP2133,0006.4Experiment 3.

Among 24 revertants from reactions containing A-U duplex and only dTTP (Table II, Experiment 1), 19 contained a TGG codon consistent with misincorporation of dCTP opposite A. Since no dCTP was present in the reaction, these data represent the background noise in the assay. Among 24 revertants recovered from BER reactions containing equal amounts of all four dNTPs, 17 contained a TGG codon consistent with misincorporation of dCTP opposite A, 4 contained a TTG codon consistent with misincorporation of dATP, and no revertant contained a TCG codon reflecting dGTP misincorporation. This allows calculation of mismatch specific reversion frequencies (second number in columns 4–8 in Table II), as well as “less than or equal to” error rates for the mismatches scored at the A and G of the TAG codon (third number in columns 4–8). For wild type pol β-dependent single nucleotide BER performed with equimolar concentrations of all four dNTPs, these rates range from ≤0.3 to ≤2.8 × 10–4. Error rates could be even lower, with these data establishing the minimum base substitution fidelity of base excision repair conducted by UDG, APE, DNA ligase 1, and wild type DNA polymerase β.Table IIRevertant sequences, revertant frequencies, and error rates for BERDNA substratedNTPs or polRevertants/revertant frequency (×10-4)/error rate (×10-4)TotalTGG (A-dCTP)TTG (A-dATP)TCG (A-dGTP)TAT (G-dATP)TAC (G-dGTP)Experiment 1. wild type DNA polymerase βA—UdTTP2419/2.7/-0/≤0.1/-0/≤0.1/-——Equal2417/3.9/≤24/0.9/1.50/≤0.2/≤0.3——Biased2422/10/121/0.4/0.70/≤0.4/≤0.7——Experiment 2. wild type DNA polymerase βG—UEqual24———0/≤0.3/≤0.55/1.7/≤2.8Biased14———6/2.7/4.57/3.2/5.3Experiment 3.

One approach employed reactions containing a 50-fold excess of incorrect dNTPs. With the A-U substrate, dCTP, dGTP, and dATP were present at 500 μm, and correct dTTP was present at 10 μm. This reaction generated products with a reversion frequency of 11 × 10–4 (Table I, Experiment 1). Sequence analysis revealed no increase in rate for the A-dATP or A-dGTP mismatches, but the error rate for A-dCTP was 12 × 10–4, well above the background value for this mismatch (Table II). A reaction with the G-U substrate and a 50-fold molar excess of dATP and dGTP over dCTP (to force the two transversions than can be scored) resulted in error rates for the G-dATP and G-dGTP mismatches of 4.5 × 10–4 and 5.3 × 10–4, respectively (Table II). Both values are higher than those observed for these mismatches in parallel reactions performed with equimolar dNTPs. The second approach to increase error rates employed variants of DNA polymerase β containing lysine or alanine in place of arginine 283. In comparison to wild type pol β, these polymerases were previously shown to have reduced base substitution fidelity during gap-filling synthesis (12Beard W.A. Osheroff W.A. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1100-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), with the fidelity of the R283A variant being lower than that of R283K. A BER reaction containing equimolar dNTPs and the R283K variant repaired the A-U substrate with rates for the A-dATP and A-dGTP mismatches that were not substantially different from the values observed with wild type pol β for these same mismatches (Table II, compare Experiments 1 and 3). This is consistent with the observation that the R283K replacement did not strongly increase error rates for these mismatches during gap filling (14Osheroff W.P. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20749-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, for the A-dCTP mismatch, the BER error rate with R283K was higher (4.5 × 10–4) than that observed with wild type pol β (≤2 × 10–4), consistent with the lower fidelity of R283K for the A-dCTP mismatch during gap filling (14Osheroff W.P. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20749-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A BER reaction containing equimolar dNTPs and the R283A variant repaired the A-U substrate with error rates for the A-dCTP and A-dATP mismatches that were both more than 10-fold higher than observed with wild type pol β (Table II). Comparison of Error Rates for BER and Gap Filling by pol β Alone—We previously determined error rates for wild type pol β and the R283K/A variants during synthesis to fill a gap containing a single template adenine (13Osheroff W.P. Jung H.J. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3642-3650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 14Osheroff W.P. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20749-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Those studies employed equal concentrations of the four dNTPs and T4 DNA ligase to seal the nick following gap filling. To compare those results to BER fidelity, BER fidelity measurements were also performed with the R283K and R283A variants in reactions containing T4 DNA ligase rather than DNA ligase 1. The results were similar (Tables I and II, Experiment 4), suggesting that the ligase was not a critical determinant of fidelity under these conditions. We also measured error rates for wild type pol β during single base (adenine) gap-filling synthesis (14Osheroff W.P. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20749-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in the presence of a 50-fold excess of dCTP, dATP, and dGTP over dTTP. The data allow comparison of the fidelity of pol β gap filling to the fidelity of pol β-dependent BER, under conditions in which BER generates one or more of the three possible substitution errors at rates above the background noise of the assay. The results show that BER error rates (Fig. 2, gray bars) are severalfold lower than error rates for gap filling by pol β alone (black bars). The differences suggest that the nucleotide selectivity of pol β may be enhanced during BER by the other proteins in the reaction, or perhaps by the presence of the 5′ dRP group, which is not excised until after polymerization has occurred. This could result from increased efficiency of correct nucleotide incorporation to enhance fidelity (26Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Vande Berg B.J. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47393-47398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Another possibility for the higher apparent fidelity of BER is proofreading by the reported 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of APE (16Chou K.M. Cheng Y.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The 3–8-fold differences observed (Fig. 2) are consistent with removal of 67–87% of misinsertions. If this is due to APE proofreading, this efficiency is modest compared with the 90 to >99% efficiency of editing by most DNA polymerases with intrinsic exonucleases. In the latter cases, the contribution of proofreading to fidelity depends on the rate of excision of the misinserted nucleotide relative to the rate of extension of the mismatched primer terminus. For enzymes like pol δ and pol ϵ, the polymerase-exonuclease competition for the DNA substrate is between two active sites present in the same protein. Excision is usually strongly preferred over mismatch extension, whose rate is normally low and highly sensitive to the concentration of the next correct dNTP to be incorporated. However, proofreading of errors made by exonuclease-deficient polymerases like pol β during single nucleotide BER could differ in at least two ways. Since only a single nucleotide is incorporated, there is no need for further extension, so proofreading efficiency during single nucleotide BER may not depend on the concentration of the next correct nucleotide. This could be advantageous for BER reactions that need to occur throughout the cell cycle regardless of whether dNTP concentrations are as high as in the S phase or following DNA damage (27Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) or as low as in the G1 phase. Also, once the mismatched DNA is generated, the competition for this nicked, mismatched DNA substrate is between the ligase active site and the exonuclease active site in two proteins separated in the single nucleotide BER reaction pathway by pol β. Substrate partitioning between proteins normally separated by two other enzymatic steps (polymerase and dRP lyase) represents a novel extension of the general idea that the product of one enzymatic step in BER is directly handed off to the next enzyme in the pathway (28Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 29Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). That idea was put forth to explain how coordinating the BER step could avoid generating cytotoxic BER intermediates, whereas the current refinement would avoid not the cytotoxic but rather the mutagenic consequences of aberrant BER. Moreover, proofreading by a separate exonuclease may allow regulation of BER fidelity. For example, proofreading may suppress mutagenesis resulting from environmental stress, but it may be counterproductive for putative uracil-initiated BER reactions that could promote somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes (reviewed in Ref. 30Kunkel T.A. Pavlov Y.I. Benenek K. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W1981691393,"p116Rip is a ubiquitously expressed protein that was originally identified as a putative binding partner of RhoA in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Overexpression of p116Rip in neuroblastoma cells inhibits RhoA-mediated cell contraction induced by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA); so far, however, the function of p116Rip is unknown. Here we report that p116Rip localizes to filamentous actin (F-actin)-rich structures, including stress fibers and cortical microfilaments, in both serum-deprived and LPA-stimulated cells, with the N terminus (residues 1–382) dictating cytoskeletal localization. In addition, p116Rip is found in the nucleus. Direct interaction or colocalization with RhoA was not detected. We find that p116Rip binds tightly to F-actin (K d ∼ 0.5 μm) via its N-terminal region, while immunoprecipitation assays show that p116Rip is complexed to both F-actin and myosin-II. Purified p116Rip and the F-actin-binding region can bundle F-actin in vitro, as shown by electron microscopy. When overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells, p116Rip disrupts stress fibers and promotes formation of dendrite-like extensions through its N-terminal actin-binding domain; furthermore, overexpressed p116Rip inhibits growth factor-induced lamellipodia formation. Our results indicate that p116Rip is an F-actin-binding protein with in vitro bundling activity and in vivo capability of disassembling the actomyosin-based cytoskeleton. p116Rip is a ubiquitously expressed protein that was originally identified as a putative binding partner of RhoA in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Overexpression of p116Rip in neuroblastoma cells inhibits RhoA-mediated cell contraction induced by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA); so far, however, the function of p116Rip is unknown. Here we report that p116Rip localizes to filamentous actin (F-actin)-rich structures, including stress fibers and cortical microfilaments, in both serum-deprived and LPA-stimulated cells, with the N terminus (residues 1–382) dictating cytoskeletal localization. In addition, p116Rip is found in the nucleus. Direct interaction or colocalization with RhoA was not detected. We find that p116Rip binds tightly to F-actin (K d ∼ 0.5 μm) via its N-terminal region, while immunoprecipitation assays show that p116Rip is complexed to both F-actin and myosin-II. Purified p116Rip and the F-actin-binding region can bundle F-actin in vitro, as shown by electron microscopy.

Our results indicate that p116Rip is an F-actin-binding protein with in vitro bundling activity and in vivo capability of disassembling the actomyosin-based cytoskeleton. Dynamic remodeling of the actin-based cytoskeleton drives cell shape changes, cell division, and motility. Cytoskeletal remodeling involves the assembly and disassembly of filamentous actin (F-actin) 1The abbreviations used are: F-actin, filamentous actin; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PH, pleckstrin homology; aa, amino acids; HA, hemagglutinin; FL, full-length; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NT, N terminus; CT, C terminus; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RBD, RhoA-binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor.1The abbreviations used are: F-actin, filamentous actin; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PH, pleckstrin homology; aa, amino acids; HA, hemagglutinin; FL, full-length; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NT, N terminus; CT, C terminus; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RBD, RhoA-binding domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor. and is effectuated by cell-surface receptors that signal through small GTPases of the Rho family, notably RhoA, Rac and Cdc42 (1Ridley A.J.

Some actin-binding proteins promote organization of actin into higher-order structures, whereas others control actin remodeling in response to extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, hormones, or cell adhesion cues. Although only few proteins bind actin monomers, there are more than 100 that bind polymeric F-actin, and many of them induce cross-linking or bundling of F-actin (10dos Remedios C.G. Thomas D.D. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2001; 32: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In our ongoing studies to delineate Rho signaling by the lipid growth factor lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (11Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 12Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), we previously identified a ubiquitously expressed protein of 116 kDa, provisionally named p116Rip, which binds relatively weakly to activated RhoA in a yeast two-hybrid assay (13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The p116Rip sequence predicts several protein interaction domains, including at least one PH domain, two proline-rich stretches, and a C-terminal region predicted to form a coiled-coil domain. This suggests that p116Rip may have a scaffolding role recruiting different proteins into a RhoA-regulated macromolecular complex. When overexpressed in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, p116Rip promotes cell flattening and process extension and inhibits cytoskeletal contraction in response to LPA (13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The p116Rip phenotype was reminiscent of what is observed after RhoA inactivation (using dominant-negative RhoA or C3 toxin), which led to the suggestion that p116Rip may negatively regulate RhoA signaling (13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the function of p116Rip remains unknown; importantly, no evidence that p116Rip binds directly to RhoA in mammalian cells has been discovered (13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the present study, we set out to characterize p116Rip in further detail. We find that p116Rip, rather than directly binding to RhoA, interacts with F-actin via its N-terminal region and colocalizes with dynamic F-actin structures such as stress fibers, cortical microfilaments, filopodia, and lamellipodial ruffles. Furthermore, we show that p116Rip induces bundling of F-actin in vitro, with the bundling activity residing in the N-terminal region. Yet overexpression of p116Rip or its N-terminal actin-binding domain disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and thereby interferes with growth factor-induced contractility and lamellipodia formation. Our studies specify p116Rip as a novel F-actin-binding protein and demonstrate that p116Rip can affect, either directly or indirectly, the integrity of the actomyosin-based cytoskeleton. Cell Culture and Transfection—N1E-115 and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7.5% fetal calf serum. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum. N1E-115 cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method described previously (14Kranenburg O. Scharnhorst V. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were transfected using Lipo-fectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen), and serum was added to the cells after the transfection procedure as described by the manufacturer. COS-7 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (15Zondag G.C. Moolenaar W.H. Gebbink M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1513-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression Constructs—Generation of full-length (FL) pcDNA3-p116Rip (aa 1–1024), pcDNA3-HA-CTp116Rip (aa 545–1024), pcDNA3-HA-RBDp116Rip (aa 545–823), and prp261-RBDp116Rip (aa 545–823) has been described previously (13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-HA-FLp116Rip was engineered by use of a polylinker created by annealing primers 5′-ggatggcttacccatacgatgttccagattacgcgtgc-3′ and 5′-acgcgtaatctggaacatcgtatgggtaagccatccgc-3′ encoding the HA-tag sequence and a SacII restriction site. The polylinker was ligated into pcDNA3-FLp116Rip via the SacII site. pcDNA3-HA-NTp116Rip (aa 1–382) and GST-NT were generated by PCR using primers 5′-cggggtaccacatgtcggcggccaaggaa-3′ (forward) and 5′-cggaattccggcgtcatggaggattctgt-3′ (reverse) for NT. GST-CT was generated from pcDNA3-HA-CTp116Rip. GST-Δ5 (aa 1–152), GST-Δ6 (aa 1–212), GST-Δ7 (aa 43–152), GST-Δ8 (aa 43–212); GST-Δ9 (aa 212–390) were generated similarly by PCR using specific primers. The PCR products were digested with KpNI-EcoRI and ligated into pcDNA3-HA and pRP265, a derivative of pGEX-1N. FLp116Rip-peGFPN1-was constructed by ligation of a HindIII-ScaI fragment out of pcDNA3-FLp116Rip and a PCR fragment using primers 5′-cagagcagtactcccaaaagtgcctgg-3′ (forward) and 5′-cgcggtaccagtcgacagaattcgttatcccatgagac-3′ (reverse), encoding ScaI and Asp718 restriction sites, into peGFPN1 (Clontech). pMT2sm-FLp116Rip-GST was generated by ligation of a NotI-ScaI fragment of pcDNA3-FLp116Rip and a PCR fragment using primers 5′-cagagcagtactcccaaaagtgcctgg-3′ (forward) and 5′-cggggtaccggaattcgttatcccatgagacctg-3′ (reverse), encoding ScaI and Asp718 restriction sites, into pMT2sm-GST. pMT2sm-FLp116Rip-myc was generated by cloning FLp116Rip-myc into pMT2sm. Sequence of all constructs was verified by automated sequencing. Solubility Assay—Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, supplemented with protease inhibitors) and were left on ice for 15 min. Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min (13,000 rpm; Eppendorf table centrifuge, 4 °C). Pellet and supernatant fractions were collected, dissolved in sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by Western blotting using the polyclonal anti-p116Rip antibody (1:1000 dilution). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Fusion Proteins—The E. coli strains BL21 or DH5α were transformed with plasmids encoding GST-NT, GST-CT, GST-Δ5, GST-Δ6, GSTΔ7, GSTΔ8, GSTΔ9, or GST, respectively. Colonies were obtained and used to inoculate Luria broth/ampicillin. Cultures were grown and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added overnight to induce expression of the fusion proteins when the cultures reached an OD between 0.4 and 0.6. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g, resuspended in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by sonification followed by the addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4000 × g, and resulting supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads with affinity-bound proteins were washed five times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. In some cases, GST was cleaved off by incubating beads with affinity-bound proteins with thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's protocol. Purified full-length p116Rip fused to GST or purified full-length p116Rip fused to Myc were obtained by transfection of COS-7 cells with the constructs pMT2sm-FLp116Rip-GST and pMT2sm-FLp116Rip-myc, respectively. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, supplemented with protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (13,000 rpm; 10 min). Further purification of the full-length GST fusion proteins occurred in the same manner as the purification of GST fusion proteins produced in bacteria. FLp116Rip-myc fusion protein was purified using a column of monoclonal myc antibodies (9E10) chemically cross-linked to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted off with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and fractions were collected in tubes containing 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to make an end pH of 7.0. Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by protein staining with Coomassie Blue to estimate the purity and concentration of the proteins in the fractions. Some of the proteins were concentrated using Centricon 10-kDa cutoff devices (Millipore). Protein concentration was also determined by the Bradford method using BSA as a standard. Purified proteins were stored in aliquots at -80 °C in 10% glycerol. F-actin Cosedimentation Assay—COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors and lysed for 48 h after transfection in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, supplemented with protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (13,000 rpm; 10 min) and supernatant aliquots were run out on SDS-PAGE gels to check for expression (data not shown). 10-μl aliquots were used in the in vitro actin-binding assay. F-actin cosedimentation assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Briefly, prespun aliquots of COS-7 cell lysates (100,000 × g, 30 min) or purified proteins GST-NTp116Rip, GST, FLp116Rip-GST, BSA, α-actinin (Cytoskeleton), or GST-Δ5p116Rip; GST-Δ6p116Rip; GST-Δ7p116Rip; GST-Δ8p116Rip; GST-Δ9p116Rip were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 40 μg of pure actin filaments. The final concentration of F-actin was 18 μm. Filaments were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation 100,000 × g (Beckman airfuge). As a control for actin-independent sedimentation, the various proteins were also centrifuged under conditions in which filamentous actin was omitted from the mix. Cosedimenting proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by either Coomassie Blue staining or by Western blot analysis using anti-p116Rip antibodies, anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibodies (16van Ham S.M. Tjin E.P. Lillemeier B.F. Gruneberg U. van Meijgaarden K.E. Pastoors L. Verwoerd D. Tulp A. Canas B. Rahman D. Ottenhoff T.H. Pappin D.J. Trowsdale J. Neefjes J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 950-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), or an anti-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (Mab 1501R; Chemicon). For quantitative analysis, a fixed concentration of FLp116Rip-GST (1 μm) was mixed with increasing amounts of F-actin (0–3.5 μm) in polymerization buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Proteins were centrifuged as above and total pellets and supernatants were loaded separately on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein bands were detected by Coomassie Blue staining and were scanned and quantified using the software program TINA. The amount of p116Rip bound to different concentrations of F-actin was fit to a single rectangular hyperbola using Prism (ver. 3; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). In all cases, entire pellet and supernatant fractions were loaded separately on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected by either Coomassie Blue staining or by Western blot (above). Electron Microscopy—To test for bundling activity, actin filaments (5 μm) were incubated for 30 min with purified proteins GST, α-actinin (both 2 μm), FL-p116Rip (0.5 μm), NT-p116Rip (0.5 μm), and CT-p116Rip (0.5 μm) at room temperature. Samples were absorbed on to glow-discharged carbon-coated formvar film on a copper grid and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate and examined with a Philips CM10 electron microscope. Metabolic Labeling—N1E-115 cells were incubated in methionine/cysteine-free media for 30 min and labeled for 4 h with medium containing [35S]methionine/cysteine (200 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences). Labeled medium was aspirated and cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS. Cells were scraped in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, supplemented with protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (13,000 rpm; 10 min) and supernatants were tumbled with protein A-Sepharose beads precoupled to either preimmune rabbit serum, anti-p116Rip antibodies (13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), or anti-myosin IIA antibodies (BTI, Oklahoma City, OK) for1hat4 °C. GST pull-down assays were performed with 20 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads loaded with 20 μg of either GST alone or the GST-NT-fusion protein containing the isolated actin-binding domain. Beads were washed five times in ice-cold lysis buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by autoradiography. In some cases the gels were blotted and further analyzed by Western blotting to assess the identity of labeled proteins using the polyclonal anti-p116Rip antibody (1:1000 dilution) and anti-myosin II antibodies (1:500 dilution). Antibodies and Confocal Microscopy—The FRA58 antibody directed against GST-RBD (amino acids 545–823) has been described previously (13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). N1E-115 cells and NIH3T3 cells were grown on gelatin-coated glass coverslips in six-well plates. N1E-115 cells were serum-starved overnight and NIH3T3 cells for 7 h. Cells were fixed 24 h after transfection in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100/PBS; 2 min), blocked (1% BSA/PBS; 30 min), and incubated with primary antibodies (FRA58 preimmune serum, polyclonal FRA58 anti-p116Rip, 3F10 anti-HA rat monoclonal antibodies (Roche; 1 h). Subsequently, cells were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies (Goat-anti-rabbit-fluorescein isothiocyanate (DAKO) and Goat-anti-rat-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Rockland); 30 min)) together with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield and analyzed using a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope. We originally isolated p116Rip through its interaction with activated RhoA-V14 in yeast two-hybrid assays in which the RhoA isoprenylation site was mutated to prevent membrane targeting (13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); no interaction was found with other small GTPases, notably activated RhoB, RhoE, Rac1, Cdc42, and Ras. 2J. Mulder, O. Kranenburg, and M. Poland, unpublished results. The interaction between p116Rip and RhoA-V14 was relatively weak, however, and in subsequent studies, we have been unable to confirm that p116Rip interacts with RhoA in mammalian cells (13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). 2J. Mulder, O. Kranenburg, and M. Poland, unpublished results. Furthermore, overexpression of p116Rip in COS-7 cells did not significantly influence the activation state of endogenous RhoA. 3F. van Horck and J. Mulder, unpublished results. We therefore conclude that p116Rip is unlikely to be a high-affinity binding partner and/or negative regulator of RhoA. p116Rip Localizes to Dynamic Actin-rich Structures and the Nucleus—As a first step in elucidating the function of p116Rip, we examined its subcellular localization in N1E-115 and NIH3T3 cells using a polyclonal anti-p116Rip antibody raised against the putative “RhoA-binding domain” (RBD; Ref. 13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cells were simultaneously double-stained with rhodamine-phalloidin to visualize F-actin. In serum-deprived N1E-115 cells, endogenous p116Rip colocalizes with F-actin structures, especially the actin-rich microspikes (Fig. 1, top). After stimulation with LPA, a potent activator of RhoA, N1E-115 cells rapidly round up and neurites retract (17Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Postma F.R. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 247-255PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In those contracted cells, p116Rip is found relocalized to the contractile actomyosin ring at the cell cortex (Fig. 1). In NIH3T3 cells, maintained either in serum-free medium or stimulated with LPA, p116Rip colocalizes with F-actin-rich structures, particularly along stress fibers, at cortical microfilaments, and at the leading edge of lamellipodia (Fig. 1, bottom). Of note, p116Rip staining is also detected in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 1, bottom). Specificity of the observed immunostaining was confirmed by using the GST-RBD polypeptide antigen (previously termed Δ2; ref. 13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which blocked the p116Rip fluorescence signal. Furthermore, p116Rip transfected into COS-7 or N1E-115 cells showed the same subcellular distribution pattern as endogenous p116Rip: colocalization with F-actin-rich structures as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 2B and results not shown). No colocalization with endogenous RhoA was detected in either N1E-115 or NIH3T3 cells (results not shown).Fig. 2Association of p116Rip with the actin cytoskeleton. A, expression constructs used for transfection in N1E-115 cells encode FLp116Rip and three deletion mutants encompassing the complete C terminus (construct CT; aa 545–1024) or part of the C terminus (construct RBD; aa 545–823) including the “RhoA-binding domain,” as indicated, or p116Rip encompassing the N-terminal PH domain (construct NT; aa 1–382.). P-rich, proline-rich regions. The N-terminal PH domain was not recognized earlier (13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). B, immunofluorescence analysis of transfected N1E-115 cells using anti-p116Rip antibody and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (red staining only in left). Transfected full-length p116Rip colocalizes with cortical actin, whereas truncation mutants CT and RBD are found in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. C, solubility of transfected full-length or truncated p116Rip in a buffer containing 0.1% Triton-X-100, as examined by subcellular fractionation into a supernatant (s) and pellet (p) fraction. The p116Rip antibody was used for detection on Western blot. Full-length p116Rip is partially insoluble whereas the truncation mutants CT and RBD are largely soluble. IB, immunoblot. D, N1E-115 cells were transfected with an HA-tagged construct encoding a truncated version of p116Rip encompassing the N-terminal PH domain (construct HA-NT; aa 1–382). Cells were fixed 24 h after start of transfection, and the localization of the expressed NT construct was analyzed by immunofluorescence using anti-HA antibody. F-actin was stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (red staining). It is seen that the NT protein colocalizes with F-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The NT Region of p116Rip Dictates Subcellular Localization—The subcellular localization of p116Rip raises the possibility that p116Rip is an F-actin-binding protein. To test this notion, we examined the intracellular localization of distinct domains of p116Rip and determined their detergent solubility. p116Rip contains several putative protein and phospholipid interaction motifs, including a central PH domain, an N-terminal PH domain (aa 43–152; not noted previously (13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar)); two proline-rich regions, and a C-terminal coiled-coil region (Fig. 2A). The putative “RhoA-binding domain” (RBD) that was isolated in yeast two-hybrid screens (13Gebbink M.F. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137 (Correction (2001) J. Cell Biol., 153, 133): 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) overlaps with the coiled-coil region, as indicated in Fig. 2A. We generated HA-tagged p116Rip and three truncated versions (HA-tagged) encoding the CT coiled-coil region, the RBD and the NT half (NT-p116Rip; Fig. 2A). The various cDNA constructs were transiently transfected into N1E-115 cells and the subcellular localization and detergent solubility of the resulting proteins were analyzed. Transfected HA-p116Rip, like endogenous p116Rip, localizes to cortical F-actin (and the nucleus; data not shown). In contrast, the p116Rip-CT and RBD polypeptides display nuclear and cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 2B). In keeping with these results, the CT and RBD truncation mutants are largely Triton-soluble, whereas full-length p116Rip (transfected and endogenous) is about 50% insoluble (Fig. 2C and results not shown), consistent with association with the cytoskeleton. Similar to full-length p116Rip, the N terminus of p116Rip (NT-p116Rip) colocalizes with F-actin and is also detectable in the nucleus (Fig. 2D and results not shown). When the NT-p116Rip-expressing cells were analyzed at >48 h after transfection, however, the F-actin cytoskeleton was largely disrupted (see below). Collectively, these results indicate that the N-terminal part of p116Rip (aa 1–382) determines its subcellular localization. Binding of p116Rip to F-actin—F-actin associates with the motor protein myosin-II to generate contractile forces in non-muscle cells. In metabolically labeled N1E-115 cells, we found that endogenous p116Rip as well as the purified polypeptide NT-p116Rip (fused to GST) coprecipitated with proteins of 43 and 200 kDa (Fig. 3A , lanes 2 and 4, respectively). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the 43-kDa protein is actin (not shown), and revealed that the 200 kDa protein represents the heavy-chain of non-muscle myosin-II (Fig. 3B). Although the reciprocal precipitations yielded variable results, our data support the notion that p116Rip associates with actomyosin in vivo. We next investigated the actin-binding properties of NT-p116Rip. As shown in Fig. 4A, NT-p116Rip (fused to GST) cosediments with purified F-actin, as did α-actinin, whereas GST alone and BSA did not. Fusion proteins containing the C-terminal regions of p116Rip (CT and RBD) failed to cosediment with F-actin (results not shown). It thus seems that the N-terminal region of p116Rip contains an F-actin-binding domain. We next examined the binding affinity of full-length p116Rip for F-actin. Increasing concentrations of purified F-actin (0–3.5 μm) were mixed with a fixed amount of p116Rip (1 μm). After high-speed centrifugation, the amount of p116Rip cosedimenting with F-actin was determined. From the resulting binding curve we estimate that p116Rip binds to F-actin with an apparent dissociation constant (K d) of about 0.5 μm (Fig. 4B). To define the N-terminal regions mediating F-actin binding in further detail, we made various deletion mutants and determined their F-actin cosedimentation properties, as illustrated in Fig. 4C. Whereas p116Rip has no obvious sequence homology to known actin-binding proteins, potential actin-binding motifs include the N-terminal PH domain (19Yao L. Janmey P. Frigeri L.G. Han W. Fujita J.

This potentially directs it to the 3′-ends of mature chloroplast mRNAs, which generally possess such structures. To understand the basis for this discrimination, the RNA elements directing CSP41 cleavage of petD RNA in vitro were dissected. Substrates containing fully base-paired stem-loops were optimal substrates, whereas deletion of part of the stem-loop decreased activity by 100-fold, and deletion of the distal arm of the stem-loop abolished cleavage, even in substrates containing the primary CSP41 cleavage site. Competition assays showed that the decrease in activity resulted from decreased affinity for the RNA by CSP41. Mutations of the residues at the scissile bond and mutations and deletions at the terminal loop of the stem had a moderate effect on activity but no effect on cleavage site specificity, suggesting that CSP41 has no sequence specificity. Titration of ethidium bromide into the assay decreased activity to a basal level of ∼18%, and introduction of a single base bulge into either arm of the stem-loop decreased cleavage at the primary cleavage site by up to 70%. This suggests that changing the structure of the helical stem has a mild effect on activity. Deletion analysis of CSP41 suggests that the specificity domain lies in the first 73 amino acids of the protein, a domain that also contains a putative dehydrogenaselike mononucleotide binding motif. These results are consistent with a broad role for CSP41 in the degradation of stem-loop-containing mRNAs.

These results are consistent with a broad role for CSP41 in the degradation of stem-loop-containing mRNAs. In the chloroplasts of higher plants and green algae, gene expression is regulated primarily at the post-transcriptional level. Most chloroplast mRNAs contain an inverted repeat in their 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; EDAC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl)aminopropylcarbodiimide; nt, nucleotide; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. that can fold into a stable stem-loop structure. These stem-loops constitute highly specific recognition sites for nucleus-encoded RNA-binding proteins (1Stern D.B. Jones H. Gruissem W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18742-18750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chen H.C. Stern D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4380-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Memon A.R. Meng B. Mullet J.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the absence of a stable stem-loop, or after their removal, transcripts become unstable (4Chen H. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24205-24211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because the stem-loop and associated proteins impede the activity of processive 3′- to 5′-exonucleases (1Stern D.B. Jones H.

Therefore, removal of the stem-loop is likely to be a key regulatory step in chloroplast mRNA degradation (reviewed in Ref. 7Monde R.A. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In light of this, a detailed understanding of how chloroplast ribonucleases distinguish their substrates is essential. However, although several chloroplast endoribonuclease activities (4Chen H.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have been reported, only the exonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (12Yehudai-Resheff S. Hirsh M. Schuster G. Mol. Cell.

Gruissem W. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1464-1475PubMed Google Scholar) has undergone thorough analysis. Previously, we reported the purification and characterization of CSP41 (chloroplast stem-loop-binding protein of 41 kDa), a ubiquitous endoribonuclease found in plant chloroplasts (14Yang J. Schuster G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1409-1420PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yang J. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12784-12880Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of CSP41 is >85% conserved in all plant species analyzed (data not shown), but it shares no homology with other proteins in the data bases. CSP41 also lacks known ribonuclease motifs but belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase reductase (SDR) structural superfamily (16Baker M.E. Grundy W.N. Elkan C.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This family consists of more than 1,600 proteins, including more than 130 in Arabidopsis thaliana (17Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jornvall H. Persson B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The best studied and closest relative of CSP41 in the SDR superfamily is Escherichia coli UDP-glucose epimerase. As such, CSP41 is predicted to contain a bidomain SDR Rossman fold. However, CSP41 lacks two sequence motifs required for epimerase activity (16Baker M.E. Grundy W.N. Elkan C.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Bellamacina C.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). CSP41 was shown to cleave primarily within the stem-loop structures of several chloroplast RNA 3′-UTR substrates in vitro (15Yang J. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12784-12880Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas CSP41 was shown to cleave double-stranded RNA substrates, its activity was optimal with stem-loop-containing RNAs (15Yang J. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12784-12880Google Scholar). Because stem-loop structures are known to be important for chloroplast mRNA stability, CSP41 was hypothesized to play a role in the initiation of RNA degradation. Three other members of the dehydrogenase family, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and two dehydrogenases from the archaeon Solfolobus solfataricus, have been shown to have endoribonucleolytic activity. The most prominent cleavage sites of these enzymes were in loops and bulges of the predicted secondary structure of phage T7 R1.1 RNA (19Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Schiltz E. Klug G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46145-46150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), reminiscent of the prominent cleavage sites for CSP41 within the chloroplast petD 3′-UTR. Therefore, whereas the mechanistic details regarding substrate recognition and cleavage by SDR motif-containing proteins are still somewhat vague, the evidence suggests that this motif may represent a new type of ribonuclease domain capable of binding and cleaving double-stranded RNA substrates, particularly stem-loops. Here, we have attempted to determine the basis of this substrate preference, using CSP41 as a model. Purification and Assay of CSP41—CSP41 was purified according to Yang and Stern (15Yang J. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12784-12880Google Scholar). The enzyme was assayed at room temperature in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 20 fmol of petD RNA, and 20 mm MgCl2. Preparation of Synthetic RNA Substrates—Templates encoding the petD 3′-UTR RNA substrates used in this study were contained between the SacI and EcoRV sites of pBluescript KS (–). Synthetic RNAs were prepared according to Stern and Gruissem (5Stern D.B. Gruissem W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1145-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) after linearizing templates with HindIII. RNA substrates for CSP41 assays were synthesized with 2.5 μm [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 25 μm cold UTP. Trace-labeled RNAs were transcribed in the presence of 8 nm [α-32P]UTP and 0.5 mm cold UTP. Substrates for footprinting were synthesized in the presence of 1 mm cold rNTPs and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP according to Yang and Stern (15Yang J. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12784-12880Google Scholar). Lengths of RNAs were as follows: Δ50, 208 nt; Δ18, 179 nt; Δ63, 168 nt; and Δ24, 152 nt. The DraI-linearized template produced a 92-nt substrate. Analysis of petD RNA Structure—105 cpm (roughly 20 fmol) of petD RNA was incubated in the presence of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol and 20 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 10 μl. The RNA was then partially digested with either RNase A (2 ng), RNase T1 (1 unit), RNase T2 (0.24 unit), or RNase V1 (0.001 unit). The reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 min at room temperature and were then stopped with 50 μl of 5 mm aurintricarboxylic acid, 6 m urea, and 2% SDS. The reactions were extracted with phenol/chloroform and subsequently ethanol-precipitated at –20 °C in the presence of 20 μg of yeast tRNA. The precipitated RNA was collected by centrifugation and analyzed in a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Inhibitor Titrations—The activity of CSP41 in the presence of variable concentrations of either ethidium bromide or actinomycin D was assayed as described above. Inhibition Assays—CSP41 was assayed in the presence of 20 fmol of petDΔ18 and unlabeled petDΔ18, Δ63, or Δ24 at 1:1, 2:1, or 10:1 molar ratios (competitor/32P-petDΔ18). The resulting products were analyzed in 5% denaturing acrylamide gels. For inhibition by tRNA, CSP41 was assayed in the presence of 20 fmol of petDΔ18 and the indicated molar quantities of unlabeled yeast tRNA. The average molecular mass of the tRNA was assumed to be 2.5 × 104 g/mol. Competition Assays with Inactive CSP41—A 10-μl sample of CSP41 (1 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 100 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.5, and 10% glycerol. The equilibrated CSP41 was incubated in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl)-aminopropylcarbodiimide (EDAC) (100 mm) and glycine methyl ester (25 mm) for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by dialysis against 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol. The EDAC-modified CSP41 was used in the standard assay in the presence of unmodified CSP41. Alternatively, CSP41ΔP, a C-terminal deletion mutant, was used as the protein competitor. This mutant has been described previously (15Yang J. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12784-12880Google Scholar). It was previously shown that whereas CSP41 cleaves efficiently within the double-stranded region of the petD RNA stem-loop or other stem-loop structures, an arbitrary double-stranded RNA was a poor substrate (15Yang J. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12784-12880Google Scholar). The current studies were undertaken to gain insight into substrate recognition by this enzyme. We first used a series of deletion mutants of the preferred petD RNA substrate, as shown in Fig. 1A. petDΔ18 corresponds to the mature form of the petD mRNA 3′-UTR, whereas petDΔ63 and petDΔ24 remove part or all of the stem-loop structure but still retain the primary cleavage site for CSP41 at position 136. We assayed CSP41 with these substrates to determine the minimal requirements for efficient and specific cleavage at position 136 in the presence of 20 mm MgCl2. We chose an enzyme/substrate ratio of 0.5 μg/20 fmol, within the range where the rate response of CSP41 to substrate concentration is linear, and we also determined that the accumulation of the 136-nt fragment was linear under the conditions of our time course (data not shown). In subsequent experiments, a single time point at 10 min was used to measure substrate cleavage. Fig. 1B shows that CSP41 cleaves petDΔ18 efficiently into 136- and 43-nt products, whereas the cleavage of petDΔ63 at position 136 was only 1.5% the level seen for petDΔ18 (Fig. 1C). petDΔ24 was cleaved at position 136 at a level similar to that of petDΔ63; however, cleavage occurred upstream of position 136 (marked by an asterisk). A substrate that ends at the petD translation termination codon (DraI) was not a substrate for CSP41. The stark difference in reactivity of Δ18 versus Δ63 could be due to sequence and/or structural differences. To map single-versus double-stranded regions of these substrates, 5′-end-labeled petDΔ18 and petDΔ63 were digested with sequence- and structure-specific endonucleases in the presence of 20 mm MgCl2, as shown in Fig. 2. RNases A, T1, and T2 cleave in single-stranded regions only, whereas RNase V1 prefers helical RNA substrates (20Lowman H.B. Draper D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5396-5403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis showed that upstream of the stop codon, the cleavage patterns were similar for petDΔ18 and petDΔ63, suggesting that their secondary structures are similar (data not shown). As predicted, there was a lack of petDΔ18 cleavage with RNases A, T1, and T2 between positions 125 and 144 and between positions 151 and 170, which correspond to the petD 3′-UTR stems. The cleavage pattern for petDΔ63 differed from that of petDΔ18 downstream of the stop codon. With petDΔ63, RNase A and RNase T1 cleaved in the proximal stem between positions 125 and 132, suggesting that petDΔ63 is single-stranded in this region. This and the lack of cleavage at the G residues at positions 133–135 are consistent with the schematic representation of petDΔ63 in Fig. 2B, although minor cleavage by RNase T1 at position 151 may suggest flexibility in the structure. Since petDΔ63 is largely single-stranded at the base of its stem under the conditions of our experiment, this suggests that the presence of a fully base-paired stem-loop is required for optimal cleavage at position 136 by CSP41 and that the smaller stem-loop still supports reduced but specific cleavage. It was of interest to determine whether petDΔ63 and petDΔ24 were poor substrates because of inefficient binding by CSP41 or if binding was unaffected but nonproductive in terms of promoting cleavage. In vivo, nonproductive binding might trap CSP41 on nonsubstrate RNAs and in this sense might be biologically unfavorable. To address the issue, competition experiments were performed in which CSP41 was assayed in the presence of radiolabeled petDΔ18 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor substrates, as shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3A, the control reaction (lane –) shows the cleavage of petDΔ18 at position 136 in the absence of competitor RNA. Using an equimolar amount of unlabeled petDΔ18 RNA (Δ18–1X), the accumulation of the 136-nt product decreased by 50% and decreased further as a function of increasing unlabeled petDΔ18. In the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled petDΔ63, however, there was only a 15% decrease in accumulation of the 136-nt band compared with the control reaction (Δ63–10X). Only in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled petDΔ63 was the cleavage of petDΔ18 significantly reduced (shown in Fig. 7C). There was no detectable decrease in cleavage of petDΔ18 in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of petDΔ24 (Δ24–10X). The results of the competition assays are summarized in Fig. 3B, which was repeated with unlabeled yeast tRNA. 50% inhibition of petDΔ18 cleavage by CSP41 occurred only in the presence of a 400-fold molar excess of tRNA. Taken together, these data suggest that a fully basepaired stem-loop is required for a high affinity interaction between CSP41 and petD RNA and that stem-loops in yeast tRNA do not possess the optimal structure required for binding by CSP41.Fig. 7CSP41ΔP binds to the petD RNA stem-loop. A, samples were incubated for 10 min in the presence of 0.5 μg of CSP41 and the indicated molar excess of unmodified CSP41 (–EDAC), or EDAC-modified CSP41 (+EDAC), as indicated at the top of each lane. A nonenzymatic control is included for reference (C). Transcript sizes are indicated at the left. B, samples were incubated for 10 min in the presence of 0.5 μg of CSP41 and the indicated molar ratios of CSP41ΔP to wild type (full-length) CSP41 as indicated at the top of each lane. A nonenzymatic control is included for reference (C). C, samples were incubated for 10 min in the presence of 0.5 μg of CSP41 and either petDΔ63 (at a 100-fold molar excess over radiolabeled petDΔ18), CSP41ΔP (where wild type CSP41 is present at an 8-fold molar excess over CSP41ΔP), or both competitors, as indicated at the top of each lane. A nonenzymatic control (C) and a control reaction in the absence of petDΔ63 and CSP41ΔP (–) are included for reference.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further assess the importance of the double-stranded RNA stem-loop in recognition and cleavage of petD by CSP41, cleavage was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of ethidium bromide, which intercalates into both dsRNA and double-stranded DNA. Intercalation of EtBr would be expected to distort the helix of Δ18, changing the spatial relationship of nucleotides potentially recognized by CSP41. If this treatment impeded cleavage, it might be concluded that CSP41 recognized specific sequences and/or required an undistorted helix for cleavage. As shown in Fig. 4A, increasing EtBr concentrations caused corresponding decreases in cleavage at position 136. (Several secondary CSP41-catalyzed cleavages are also visible in this gel; however, they were not reproducible (marked with asterisks).) To control for inhibition due to direct binding and inactivation of CSP41 by ethidium, the experiment was repeated in the presence of increasing concentrations of actinomycin D. Actinomycin D, like ethidium, is a hydrophobic DNA intercalator but is not an RNA intercalator. Propidium, another hydrophobic intercalating molecule similar in structure to ethidium, has been shown to inactivate RNase A nonspecifically via interactions at an apolar site on the enzyme, whereas RNase III was not inactivated by actinomycin D under similar conditions (21McGrath M. Cascio D. Williams R. Johnson D. Greene M. McPherson A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 600-605PubMed Google Scholar, 22Calin-Jageman I. Amarasinghe A.K. Nicholson A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1915-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When CSP41 was assayed with increasing levels of actinomycin D, cleavage at position 136 was unaffected (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the same results were obtained whether the reaction was started with the addition of CSP41 or with RNA, suggesting that preincubation of the enzyme with EtBr did not directly inactivate CSP41. The percentage of cleavage of petD RNA at position 136 was plotted as a function of EtBr concentration (Fig. 4C). The cleavage decreases as a function of concentration and plateaus at a level of ∼18%. The concentration giving half-maximal inhibition of cleavage was ∼3 μm. This is similar to the dissociation constant of 2.4 μm for EtBr binding to tRNA (23Torgerson P.M. Drickamer H.G. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3957-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that EtBr intercalates into the double-stranded stem of the petD 3′-UTR and disrupts cleavage, probably by changing the structure of the double-stranded stem. As an independent test of the importance of three-dimensional stem structure, single base bulges were introduced independently into each strand of the inverted repeat. The petD19 RNA contains an A insertion at position 166, and petD20 contains a U insertion at position 130. The structures tested are shown in Fig. 5A, and the results of cleavage assays are shown in Fig. 5B. The cleavage position of these substrates remained the same; however, compared with the control experiment with petDΔ18, cleavage of petD19 and petD20 was reduced by ∼30 and 70%, respectively. This is consistent with the results obtained with EtBr, where cleavage at position 136 was significantly reduced but not abolished. This further emphasizes that the formation of a fully base-paired stem-loop enhances cleavage at position 136. To gain additional insight into the relationship between RNA sequence/structure and cleavage efficiency/specificity, the cleavage rate and sequence specificity of CSP41 was measured with the mutant substrates shown in Fig. 6A. Because these mutations were introduced into petDΔ50, the accumulation of the 136-nt product of each mutant was normalized to this substrate (Figs. 6, B and C). In petD2, the C residues at positions 160 and 161 have been mutated to G residues, which causes a complete unwinding of the minor stem loop between positions 141 and 154 (4Chen H. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24205-24211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the primary CSP41 cleavage site is retained. In petD10, the A residues at positions 136 and 137 that flank the CSP41-targeted scissile bond have been mutated to U. petDd5 and petDd6 contain internal deletions in the proximal stem downstream of the scissile bond. CSP41 cleaved petD2, petD10, petDd5, and petDd6 with the same specificity as petDΔ50 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6C, the cleavage at position 136 was ∼30% higher and 50% higher with petDd5 and petDd6, respectively, than with Δ50 (wild type). This suggests that mutations downstream of the scissile bond have a moderate effect on the efficiency of cleavage at position 136 and that neither the sequence nor the structure above the scissile bond, nor the nucleotides at positions 136 and 137, direct specific cleavage at position 136. Overall, the experiments to this point paint a picture of an enzyme with significant structural but little sequence specificity. Although CSP41 is a member of the SDR structural family based on its sequence, this does not allow the a priori conclusion that SDR domains are involved in its function. To determine whether its SDR domains are important for specificity in binding and cleavage at position 136, we performed competition experiments in which wild type (full-length) CSP41 was assayed in competition with either inactivated full-length CSP41 or a CSP41 deletion mutant. We first performed a control experiment in which the competitor was an inactive form of CSP41. Wild type CSP41 was modified with EDAC and glycine methyl ester, which functions by modifying acidic (Asp/Glu) residues and inactivates the enzyme (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 7A, increasing amounts of unmodified CSP41 cause a corresponding increase in degradation of the full-length petDΔ18 substrate as expected, whereas adding EDAC-modified CSP41 to the standard assay resulted in a decrease in cleavage. This suggests that catalytically inactivated CSP41 has the same binding specificity as the unmodified enzyme and that it forms a specific complex with petDΔ18 that prevents cleavage by unmodified enzyme. We cannot completely rule out that EDAC-modified CSP41 inactivates the unmodified enzyme, for example by dimerizing, although unmodified CSP41 acts as a monomer when monitored by native gel electrophoresis or gel filtration (data not shown). An interesting observation in this experiment is that at increasing concentrations of CSP41, there is little additional accumulation of the 136-nt fragment, which would be expected given the increase in cleavage rate of the full-length RNA. It is possible that further cleavage of the 136-nt RNA could occur at these high enzyme concentrations. When dilutions of CSP41 are made below 0.5 μg/reaction, the amount of CSP41 added to the standard assay, both the degradation of full-length substrate and the accumulation of the 136-nt fragment decrease in a linear fashion as a function of decreasing CSP41 (data not shown). Furthermore, at 0.5 μg of CSP41, petDΔ24, which is nearly identical to the 136-nt product, was cleaved at ∼1% the rate of petDΔ18 but at a position several nucleotides upstream of position 136. The 136-nt product may be degraded in a similar manner at high CSP41 concentrations. The experiment was repeated with increasing amounts of CSP41ΔP, a deletion mutant that contains only the N-terminal 73 amino acids (15Yang J. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12784-12880Google Scholar). This portion of CSP41 contains three highly conserved motifs, including the βαβ mononucleotide motif responsible for binding NAD(P)H in dehydrogenases (16Baker M.E. Grundy W.N. Elkan C.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At least part of the CSP41 active site is deleted, because CSP41ΔP is not catalytically active (15Yang J. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12784-12880Google Scholar). Fig. 7B shows that CSP41ΔP inhibits cleavage of petDΔ18 at position 136 by wild type (full-length) CSP41. 50% inhibition of CSP41 activity occurred at a 1:16 molar ratio of CSP41ΔP to wild type CSP41, suggesting that CSP41ΔP has a 16-fold higher affinity for petDΔ18. The reason for this increased affinity is unknown, but it may be related to the lack of a complete catalytic site. These data also suggest that the specificity determinant of CSP41 may lie in the N-terminal 73 amino acids. The effect of added CSP41ΔP shown in Fig. 7B could result from specific or nonspecific binding of CSP41ΔP to the RNA. To test the specificity of CSP41ΔP binding, we repeated the assay in the presence of different RNA competitors. It was expected that if CSP41ΔP bound the petD stem-loop specifically, competition with unlabeled petDΔ63 would not alleviate inhibition of (wild type) CSP41 cleavage by CSP41ΔP, since Δ63 is not a substrate for specific cleavage (Fig. 1). On the other hand, if the binding of CSP41ΔP were nonspecific, then unlabeled petDΔ63 would compete with petDΔ18 for binding of CSP41ΔP and alleviate inhibition of wild type CSP41 by CSP41ΔP. In the presence of molar equivalents of wild type CSP41 and CSP41ΔP, cleavage at position 136 of petDΔ18 is almost completely abolished compared with the control reaction (Fig. 7B, third lane from left). Furthermore, in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled petDΔ63 over radiolabeled petDΔ18, cleavage at position 136 of petDΔ18 was similarly affected (Fig. 7C). In the presence of both an 8-fold molar excess of wild type CSP41 over CSP41ΔP and a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled petDΔ63 over petDΔ18, there was no cleavage at position 136. This suggests that CSP41ΔP has the same binding specificity as wild type CSP41 and that affinity is highest for a fully base-paired stem-loop. Previous results suggested that whereas CSP41 could recognize arbitrary dsRNA substrates, its cleavage activity and specificity were much lower than in the presence of petD RNA. This suggested that CSP41 recognized specialized structures and/or sequences within the petD RNA (15Yang J. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12784-12880Google Scholar). Here, we have expanded on its substrate specificity and determined the RNA structural elements necessary for recognition and cleavage within the stem-loop. A key question was whether the sequence at the scissile bond was important for cleavage, since such sequence contexts might be relatively rare in the chloroplast. In petD10, the adenine residues at positions 136 and 137, the primary cleavage sites for CSP41, were mutated to uracil (Fig. 6). This had the double effect of changing the identity of the bases at these positions and changing them from purines to pyrimidines. The cleavage of petD10 was the same as for wild type petD RNA, suggesting that CSP41 has no primary sequence specificity or preference for a particular type of residue. This is different from general endoribonucleases such as RNase A and RNase T1, which have a preference for cleavage after purines and after guanosine residues, respectively, or RNase T2, which has a slight preference for adenine residues but will cleave after any residue (24Uchida T. Egami F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1967; 61: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Results of cleavage assays with the substrates petDΔ24 and petDΔ63 (Fig. 1) suggest that there is no consensus sequence upstream of the petD stem-loop that can alone direct binding and cleavage. The results of cleavage assays containing one or multiple point mutations in several positions within the stem-loop further suggest that there is no consensus sequence within the stem that is recognized by CSP41 (Fig. 6). One implication of these results is that in vivo, CSP41 might target many 3′-UTRs, since most chloroplast mRNAs terminate in stem-loops. This would further implicate CSP41 broadly in chloroplast mRNA decay rather than as a petD-specific or highly specialized enzyme. Although we did not identify specific RNA residues that directed CSP41 cleavage, the deletion mutants showed the importance of a double-stranded stem. The optimal petD substrate was petDΔ18, which represents the mature petD RNA in vivo. Cleavage at position 136 of petDΔ63, which retains three base pairs below the scissile bond, was 100-fold lower, although specificity for position 136 was retained. With petDΔ24, lacking any stem base pairs, cleavage at position 136 was abolished. This is similar to the structural requirements of the substrates of yeast Rnt1p and E. coli RNase III, both of which require a double-stranded RNA region for recognition and cleavage. Furthermore, Rnt1p cleavage has been shown to require a duplex region on either side of the cleavage site, whereas the efficiency of cleavage is enhanced by a complete stem below the cleavage site (25Abou Elela S. Ares Jr., M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3738-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The results of competition experiments suggested that the low cleavage activity with petDΔ63 and with petDΔ24 reflects the inability of CSP41 to bind the mutated petD RNA rather than nonproductive binding (Fig. 3). This suggests that CSP41 contains a motif capable of discriminating between single- and double-stranded RNA substrates. To our knowledge, this is the first description of such a binding activity in an SDR protein. The importance of the helical nature of the stem-loop was tested using either an intercalating dye, EtBr (Fig. 4), or by introducing single base bulges that could alter the helical structure of the stem (Fig. 5). Cleavage decreased in the presence of EtBr, which has been shown to cause unwinding, lengthening, and local distortion of RNA double helices (22Calin-Jageman I. Amarasinghe A.K. Nicholson A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1915-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The fact that CSP41 cleavage was not completely abolished by saturating ethidium bromide shows that it was not inhibiting cleavage by simply intercalating at the scissile bond and preventing cleavage, a phenomenon that has been observed in similar experiments with E. coli RNase III (22Calin-Jageman I. Amarasinghe A.K. Nicholson A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1915-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We complemented these data by introducing single base bulges into the stem midway between the base of the stem and the primary CSP41 cleavage site, which caused modest decreases in cleavage at position 136 (Fig. 5). This suggests that whereas CSP41 requires a double-stranded stem for recognition and cleavage at a particular site, the absolute requirement for an A-form helix is relaxed with CSP41, and the RNA recognition motif on the enzyme can recognize several forms of helical RNA. This is also true for the double-stranded RNA binding motif, commonly found in dsRNA-binding proteins and double-strand-specific ribonucleases. For example, both human interferon-induced dsRNA-induced protein kinase and Xenopus RNA-binding protein A were found to bind to RNAs with secondary structure defects, provided the helix had an overall A-form geometry (26Bevilacqua P.C. George C.X. Samuel C.E. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6303-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The relatively loose requirement for A-form RNA is reflected in the fact that CSP41 is able to cleave petD, psbA, and rbcL RNA stem-loops at similar rates (15Yang J. Stern D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12784-12880Google Scholar). These substrates neither share primary sequence nor are predicted to share a common tertiary structure. However, unlike the dsRNA-specific (and double-stranded RNA binding motifcontaining) endoribonuclease Rnt1p from yeast (28Lebars I. Lamontagne B. Yoshizawa S. Aboul-Elela S. Fourmy D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7250-7258Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or Staufen from Drosophila (29Ramos A. Grunert S. Adams J. Micklem D.R. Proctor M.R. Freund S. Bycroft M. St. Johnston D. Varani G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 997-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), CSP41 does not appear to require specific interactions with the terminal loop on the stem-loop, because mutations that either alter the three-dimensional structure of the loop or modify the sequence of the terminal loop caused at most a 50% change in the level of cleavage of petD at position 136 (Fig. 6). With Rnt1p, for example, mutation of the AGGA tetraloop terminating the 25 S rRNA 3′-ETS substrate to GUGA causes at least a 4-fold decrease in both affinity and cleavage rate (30Nagel R. Ares Jr., M. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1142-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CSP41 is predicted to be a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (16Baker M.E. Grundy W.N. Elkan C.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Comparisons of the sequences and three-dimensional structures of many proteins in this family show that they are structurally related despite significant divergence in their amino acid sequences. We have shown here that the N-terminal 73 amino acids of CSP41 contain a domain with a high affinity and specificity for the petD double-stranded stem-loop (Fig. 7). Multiple expectation-maximum for motif elicitation (MEME) analysis using a training set of 195 SDR proteins suggested that three highly conserved structural motifs lie in this domain of CSP41. MEME is an artificial intelligence-based motif analysis tool that identifies the conserved regions that are characteristic of the data set, given a set of unaligned sequences (16Baker M.E. Grundy W.N. Elkan C.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Further analysis showed that one of the conserved motifs overlapped with the βαβ mononucleotide binding fold in dehydrogenases (16Baker M.E. Grundy W.N. Elkan C.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Several dehydrogenases have previously been shown to be sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was also shown to have a high affinity for tRNA (31Singh R. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 259: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 32Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and two dehydrogenases from the archaeon S. solfataricus, Acd-1 and Acd-5, are endoribonucleases (19Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Schiltz E. Klug G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46145-46150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the S. solfataricus enzymes, the active site of the enzyme was localized to the first mononucleotide binding motif, contained within the first 70 amino acids of the enzyme. However, direct comparisons between these dehydrogenases and CSP41 must be made with caution. The first mononucleotide binding motif of CSP41, which lies within the sequence of CSP41ΔP, does not have catalytic activity, since activity requires the first 191 amino acids of the protein. Furthermore, CSP41 activity absolutely requires Mg2+, whereas glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Acd-1, and Acd-5 do not (19Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Schiltz E. Klug G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46145-46150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Neither the endonucleolytic activity nor the cleavage specificity of CSP41 is inhibited by mono- or dinucleotides. 2T. J. Bollenbach and D. B. Stern, unpublished data. These data suggest that, whereas CSP41 contains a putative mononucleotide binding motif, the affinity of this motif for nucleotides is significantly reduced in CSP41."

To address these problems, a staphylokinase-based thrombolytic agent equipped with antithrombotic activity from hirudin was engineered. Because the N termini for both staphylokinase and hirudin are required for their activities, a Y-shaped molecule is generated using engineered coiled-coil sequences as the heterodimerization domain. This agent, designated HE-SAKK, was produced and assembled from Bacillus subtilis via secretion using an optimized co-cultivation approach. After a simple in vitro treatment to reshuffle the disulfide bonds of hirudin, both staphylokinase and hirudin in HE-SAKK showed biological activities comparable with their parent molecules. This agent was capable of targeting thrombin-rich fibrin clots and inhibiting clot-bound thrombin activity. The time required for lysing 50% of fibrin clot in the absence or presence of fibrinogen was shortened 21 and 30%, respectively, with HE-SAKK in comparison with staphylokinase. In plasma clot studies, the HE-SAKK concentration required to achieve a comparable 50% clot lysis time was at least 12 times less than that of staphylokinase. Therefore, HE-SAKK is a promising thrombolytic agent with the capability to target thrombin-rich fibrin clots and to minimize clot reformation during fibrinolysis.

Acute myocardial infarction (also known as heart attack) is a leading cause of death in the Western world. It is commonly caused by the formation of a pathologic clot (thrombus) at a critical position that results in obstructing the blood flow to heart tissues. The use of blood clot dissolving agents is one of the well established methods in treating patients with acute myocardial infarction (1The International Study GroupLancet. 1990; 336: 71-75Abstract PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 2Ohman E.M.

Results from several large scale clinical trials have firmly established the effectiveness of this approach in saving lives (1The International Study GroupLancet. 1990; 336: 71-75Abstract PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 2Ohman E.M.

Med. 1993; 329: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (3706) Google Scholar). Among the clinically approved blood clot dissolving agents including streptokinase, anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (or anistreplase), tissue-specific plasminogen activator (tPA), 1The abbreviations used are: tPA, tissue-specific plasminogen activator; APSAC, anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; HE, hirudin-E coil; HE-SAKK, hirudin-E coil-staphylokinase-K coil heterodimer; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry; SAK, staphylokinase; SAKK, staphylokinase-K coil; T 50%, time required for 50% clot lysis. and urokinase, tPA is the most commonly used blood clot dissolving agent in the Western world. Even though tPA is fibrin-specific, its short in vivo biological half-life and sensitivity to plasminogen activator inhibitors in circulation require the use of higher doses of tPA for effective clot lysis. At the pharmacological doses used, tPA exerts only partial fibrin specificity. This results in depletion of plasma proteins such as coagulation factors V and VIII, and to a certain degree, plasminogen and fibrinogen. Approximately 57% of the patients treated with tPA can restore their blood flow to an acceptable level within 90 min after receiving the treatment (2Ohman E.M. Harrington R.A. Cannon C.P. Agnelli G. Cairns J.A. Kennedy J.W. Chest. 2001; 119: 253S-277SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Within this group, 10–30% of patients showed reocclusion shortly after clot dissolution. The reformed secondary clots are usually platelet-rich (4Jang I.K. Gold H.K. Ziskind A.A. Fallon J.T.

Fallon J.T. Collen D. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1990; 16: 1728-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a low but significant percentage of the patients also suffer from stroke (3The GUSTO InvestigatorsN. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (3706) Google Scholar, 8ISIS-3 (Third International Study of Infarct Survival) Collaborative GroupLancet. 1992; 339: 753-770Abstract PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). To address these shortcomings in the current thrombolytic therapy, we report the engineering of a “Y”-shaped staphylokinase-hirudin heterodimer to target freshly formed, thrombin-rich thrombi to initiate the clot lysis event. At the same time, the hirudin moiety can effectively minimize clot reformation during thrombolysis through the inhibition of thrombin. Staphylokinase (SAK) is a promising blood clot dissolving agent (10Collen D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although SAK does not bind directly to fibrin, it can bind indirectly through the fibrin binding of plasmin(ogen) by forming a 1:1 stoichiometric SAK-plasmin(ogen) complex. The resulting SAK-plasmin complex can then function as the plasminogen activator to convert plasminogen to plasmin for clot lysis. Although SAK has comparable thrombolytic potency as tPA, several multicenter clinical trials demonstrate that staphylokinase shows a superior fibrin specificity in comparison to tPA (11Vanderschueren S. Barrios L. Kerdsinchai P. Van den Heuvel P. Hermans L. Vrolix M. De Man F. Benit E. Muyldermans L. Collen D. Van de Werf F. Circulation. 1995; 92: 2044-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Vanderschueren S. Dens J. Kerdsinchai P. Desmet W. Vrolix M. De Man F. Van den Heuvel P. Hermans L. Collen D.

Haemostasis. 2000; 83: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This high fibrin specificity (14Silence K. Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Blood. 1993; 82: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is accomplished by a mechanism whereby the plasminogen activation activity of any non-fibrin bound SAK-plasmin complex is inhibited by circulating α2-antiplasmin. In contrast, if the SAK-plasmin complex is fibrin bound, α2-antiplasmin is unable to bind to this complex. Consequently, the SAK-plasmin complex can activate plasminogen to generate plasmin locally on the surface of the clot. Furthermore, SAK is shown to bind preferentially to clot-bound plasmin(ogen) (15Sakharov D.V. Lijnen H.R. Rijken D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27912-27918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). SAK also has the ability to dissolve platelet-rich plasma clots and is much more efficient than tPA and streptokinase under both in vitro conditions and in animal models (16Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. Vanderbossche L. Collen D. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 6: 214-225Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, SAK is selected as the blood clot dissolving component in this engineered thrombolytic agent. To increase the potency of SAK, to equip SAK with the capability to differentiate freshly formed pathologic thrombi from physiological hemostatic plugs formed earlier and to minimize reocclusion, hirudin, a potent thrombin inhibitor (K d ∼ 10–11–10–13m, (17Dodt J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 685-688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), serves as both the anti-thrombotic agent and the targeting component to freshly formed clots in this engineered thrombolytic agent. SAK and hirudin are joined together via a pair of engineered coiled coil sequences that act as the heterodimerization domain (20Tripet B. Yu L. Bautista D.L. Wong W.Y. Irvin R.T. Hodges R.S. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1029-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A lysine-rich coiled coil sequence (K-coil) is added to the C-terminal tail of SAK to generate SAK-K coil (SAKK) and a glutamate-rich coiled coil sequence (E coil) is added to the C-terminal end of hirudin to generate hirudin-E coil (HE). Each of these proteins is produced from Bacillus subtilis via secretion to form heterodimeric molecules (designated HE-SAKK) via an optimized co-cultivation approach. With an in vitro treatment to reshuffle the disulfide bonds in hirudin (21Chang J.Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), both SAK and hirudin in the heterodimer are shown to retain biological activities comparable with their parent molecules. In vitro fibrin and plasma clot lysis studies demonstrate that HE-SAKK is a superior thrombolytic agent in comparison to staphylokinase. Assembly of K Coil and E Coil Sequences—The structural genes encoding both K coil and E coil sequences were assembled by using several long synthetic oligonucleotides (primers 1–4 for K coil and primers 5–8 for E coil) with a PCR-based strategy (22Sandhu G.S. Aleff R.A. Kline B.C. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 14-16PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wu S.-C. Hassan Q.M. Wong S.-L. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 24: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For the K coil sequence, portions of the primer 2 sequence are complementary to primers 1 and 3, respectively, and part of the primer 4 sequence is complementary to primer 3. The sequences of primers 1–4 are listed as follows: primer 1, 5′-GGGGATCCCCTGGACAGAAAGTTTCTGCTTGCAAACAG-3′; primer 2, 5′-CTTTTTGTTTTAAAGCGCTCACTTTCTGTTTAAGCGCGCTAACTTTCTGTTTGCAAGCAGAAAC-3′; primer 3, 5′-GTGAGCGCTTTAAAACAAAAAGTGTCAGCACTTAAGCAAAAAGTC TCTGCGCTGAAACAGTAATG-3′; primer 4, 5′-GGGCATGCGTTAACATTACTGTTTCAGCGCAG-3′. The assembled sequence encodes a portion of a linker sequence and the entire K coil sequence with a BamHI site at the 5′ end and an HpaI site at the 3′ end. This sequence was ligated to HincII-digested pUC19 as a blunt-end fragment to generate pUC19-K coil. The E coil sequence was assembled with a similar approach using four primers (primers 5–8) to generate a DNA fragment with a SpeI site at the 5′ end and a SphI site at the 3′ end. The fragment was ligated to HincII cut pUC19 to generate pUC19-E coil via a blunt-end ligation. Sequences of primers 5–8 are listed as follows: primer 5, 5′-GGACTAGTCCTGGACAGGAAGTTTCTGCTTGCGAACAG-3′; primer 6, 5′-CTTCTTGTTCAAGTGCTGAAACTTCTTGTTCTAATGCGCTCACTTCCTGTTCGCAAGCAGAAAC-3′; primer 7, 5′-CAGCACTTGAACAAGAAGTTAGCGCGCTTGAACAAGAAGTGAGCG CAT TAGAACAGTAATC-3′; primer 8, 5′-CCGCATGCCCGGGATTACTGTTCTAATGCG-3′. Nucleotide sequences of both the K coil and E coil sequences in pUC19-K coil and pUC19-E coil were determined and confirmed to be free of PCR errors. Construction of B. subtilis Expression Vectors for SAKK and HE Production—Plasmid pSAK-K coil is the B. subtilis vector for secretory production of SAKK. It is a derivative of the pUB18-SAK-K1 vector (24Szarka S. Sihota E. Habibi H.R. Wong S.-L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which encodes a staphylokinase fusion carrying the kringle-1 domain from human plasminogen. pSAK-K coil was generated by replacing the BamHI/HpaI fragment encoding a portion of the linker sequence and the kringle-1 domain sequence in pUB18-SAK-K1 with the synthetic BamHI/HpaI K coil sequence from pUC19-K coil. Plasmid pHirudin-E coil is the B. subtilis vector for secretory production of hirudin-E coil and is a derivative of pUB18-hirudin-SAK (24Szarka S. Sihota E. Habibi H.R. Wong S.-L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which produces a hirudin fusion with SAK at the C-terminal end. To construct pHirudin-E coil, the sak sequence (as a SpeI/SphI fragment) in pUB18-hirudin-SAK was replaced by a SpeI/SphI fragment encoding a portion of the linker sequence and the entire E coil sequence. The sequences of SAK-K coil and hirudin-E coil are available from GenBank™ with the accession numbers AF533145 and AF533146, respectively. Expression Studies in B. subtilis—Each of the pSAK-K coil and pHirudin-E coil plasmids was transformed into three engineered B. subtilis strains for expression studies. WB600 (25Wu X.-C. Lee W. Tran L. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4952-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), WB700 (26Ye R. Yang L.P. Wong S.-L. in Proceedings of the International Symposium on Recent Advances in Bioindustry, April 25–26, 1996. The Korean Society for Applied Microbiology, Seoul, Korea1996: 160-169Google Scholar), and WB800 (27Wu S.-C. Yeung J.C. Duan Y. Ye R. Szarka S.J. Habibi H.R. Wong S.-L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 3261-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) are strains deficient in 6, 7, and 8 extracellular proteases, respectively. Transformed cells were cultivated in super-rich medium (without glucose) (28Halling S.M. Sanchez-Anzaldo F.J. Fukuda R. Doi R.H. Meares C.F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2880-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) containing 10 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C and samples were collected at different time points. After normalization for cell density, culture supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions. Because all the expression vectors in this study are derivatives of pUB18 (29Wang L.-F. Doi R.H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 207: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), WB600(pUB18) was used as the negative control. Purification of HE, SAKK, and HE-SAKK—For HE purification, 50 ml of WB800(pHirudin-E coil) culture supernatant was collected by centrifugation and dialyzed against 4 liters of 17 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 4 °C overnight. The dialyzed sample was applied to a DE52 (Whatman, England) column (15 × 1.5 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column until the absorbance at 280 nm was less than 0.02, HE was eluted using a 150-ml linear salt gradient (0–0.7 m NaCl) in the same buffer. The HE-containing fractions (0.25–0.35 m NaCl) were combined, dialyzed, and concentrated in 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.05 m NaCl to a final volume of 200–300 μl using a Centricon unit. The concentrated sample was then loaded onto a Bio-Prep SE 100/17 column and eluted with 12 ml of 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.05 m NaCl buffer at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions containing HE were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. To purify HE-SAKK, 50 ml of culture supernatant was collected, dialyzed, and applied to a DE52 column. HE-SAKK was separated with a linear salt gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl (in 150 ml) and the HE-SAKK containing fractions (0.1–0.15 m NaCl) were further purified by gel filtration. For SAKK purification, 50 ml of culture supernatant was collected, dialyzed against 4 liters of 17 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 4 °C overnight, and applied to a Macro-Prep High S column (Bio-Rad, 5 × 1.5 cm) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column until A 280 was less than 0.1, SAKK was eluted from the column with a 100-ml linear salt gradient (0–1.0 m NaCl in the same buffer). SAKK monomer-containing fractions (0.4–0.5 m of NaCl) were further purified by gel filtration using 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.8) containing 0.1 m NaCl. Purified HE, SAKK, and HE-SAKK were quantified spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients (30Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) of 3,400 m–1 cm–1, 17,330 m–1 cm–1, and 20,730 m–1 cm–1, respectively. Disulfide Bond Reshuffling—The disulfide bond reshuffling of HE or HE-SAKK was performed based on the method of Chang (21Chang J.Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with modification. Briefly, each protein sample was dialyzed and concentrated to a final concentration of 50–70 μm in 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer (pH 8.3) in the absence of any extra salt to minimize dimer formation. The reshuffling process proceeded at 4 °C overnight in a microcentrifuge tube by adding cysteine (Cys) and cystine (Cys-Cys) to final concentrations of 4 and 2 mm, respectively. The efficiency of the reshuffling process was detected by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—Protein mass spectrometry analyses were performed at the Southern Alberta Mass Spectrometry Proteomics Research Centre, University of Calgary. Purified and concentrated samples were applied to a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF biospectrometry work station (Applied Biosystems) using sinapic acid as the matrix. Whole protein spectra were recorded in a linear mode and bovine serum albumin was used as the calibration marker. Quantification of Clot-bound Thrombin—Cross-linked fibrin clots were prepared by adding human thrombin (Sigma) at final concentrations from 0.1 to 2 NIH units/ml to 4 mg/ml human fibrinogen (Sigma) in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS, 0.02 m HEPES, 0.13 m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 20 mm CaCl2 at room temperature. Immediately after mixing, 100 μl of the polymerizing solution was transferred to a microtiter plate (Falcon 35–3912, BD Biosciences). The clots were formed at room temperature for 2 h. Two sets of fibrin clots were formed. The first set of fibrin clots was washed with 100 μl of HBS followed by careful removal of the washing buffer. This step was repeated 5 times until no thrombin activity in the wash buffer was detected. The second set of clots was unwashed and were used as the control to determine the ratio of thrombin incorporated into the fibrin clot. 100 μlof560 μm thrombin-specific chromogenic substrate (N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide, Sigma) was then added to each well and the color development was monitored over a 10-min period at 37 °C in the kinetic mode at 405 nm using a Ceres model UV900 plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). Thrombin activity (Fig. 6A) was expressed as the initial rate of color development (mOD/min). Thrombin Inhibition Assays—These assays were performed under two different conditions with hirudin and its derivatives (HE and HE-SAKK) as the inhibitors. The first series was performed with thrombin freely in solution although the second series was determined with clot-bound thrombin. For assays under the first condition (Fig. 5B), increasing amounts of hirudin and its derivatives (final concentrations from 0 to 30 nm) were incubated with thrombin (final concentration: 1 NIH unit/ml) at room temperature in HBS containing 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was started by the addition of 50 μl of 560 μm thrombin-specific chromogenic substrate to the thrombin/hirudin mixture (50 μl). Thrombin activity was determined as described above. IC50 values of hirudin and its derivatives were then determined (Fig. 5B). To monitor the inhibition of the clot-bound thrombin activity by hirudin and its derivatives, each washed fibrin clot was incubated with 100 μl of either HBS or inhibitors (75 nm). After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, liquid was carefully removed without disturbing the clot, and the clot was then washed with HBS to remove any unbound inhibitors. Finally, chromogenic substrate was added to each clot and the rate of color development (at 405 nm) was measured. The activity of the non-inhibited clot-bound thrombin was plotted over the thrombin concentrations used to form the clot (Fig. 6B). The amount of clot-bound thrombin inhibited by the inhibitor was determined as the differences of thrombin activities between the clots treated with the inhibitor and the clots treated with HBS (Fig. 6C). The First Fibrin Clot Lysis Assay—In this assay, washed fibrin clots with different amounts of clot-bound thrombin were prepared according to the above mentioned conditions. Each clot was treated with 100 μl of 75 nm SAK or HE-SAKK for 1 h. The solution was then removed by pipetting. Each clot was washed once with HBS to remove any unbound thrombolytic agent. Clot lysis was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 μm plasminogen in HBS. The lysis process was monitored at room temperature using the microtiter plate reader until the turbidity of the clot reached the minimal value. The extent of clot lysis expressed as the percentage of the original clot turbidity was plotted over the lysis time (minutes). T 50% for clot lysis, which represented the time required to achieve a 50% lysis of the fibrin clot, was obtained from the graphs. T 50% values for clots with different amounts of thrombin incorporated inside were then plotted over the thrombin concentration used in forming the clot to determine the thrombin effects on clot lysis mediated by HE-SAKK (Fig. 7). The Second and Third Fibrin Clot Lysis Assays—In these two assays, fibrin clots (formed in the presence of 0.8 NIH unit/ml of thrombin) were generated as described above and the assays were all performed at room temperature. In the second clot lysis assay, clot lysis was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of a freshly prepared thrombolytic solution (75 nm SAK or HE-SAKK + 1 μm plasminogen). The clot lysis process was monitored for 1 h. After this 1-h incubation, liquid (∼100 μl) was carefully removed to eliminate any unbound thrombolytic agent. In this process, plasminogen was removed as well. Therefore, 100 μl of a 1 μm plasminogen solution was layered on each clot. Upon returning the microtiter plate to the reader, the subsequent clot lysis process was monitored. The third fibrin clot lysis assay was identical to the second one except that all the plasminogen containing solution used in this set of assays also contained 4 mg/ml fibrinogen. Plasma Clot Lysis Assays—Cross-linked plasma clots were prepared using freshly prepared, citrated platelet-poor human plasma pooled from healthy donors. Once prepared, plasma was aliquoted and stored at –20 °C until use. Clotting was initiated by adding human thrombin to 0.8 NIH unit/ml (final concentration) and CaCl2 to 20 mm (final concentration) at room temperature. Immediately after mixing, 50 μl of the polymerizing plasma was transferred to microtiter plate. The clots were formed at room temperature for 2 h and washed once with plasma. Clot lysis was performed by adding 50 μl of plasma containing freshly added thrombolytic agent (600 nm HE-SAKK, 7,200 nm SAK, or 1,200 nm SAK plus 600 nm hirudin) on each clot. The clot lysis process was monitored. After 1-h incubation, liquid (plasma with unbound thrombolytic agent and thrombin) at the surface of the clot was removed and the same amount of plasma was added to the clot. One plasma clot was incubated with 50 μl of plasma as the control to monitor the stability of the plasma clot during the assay period. T 50% values were used to compare the clot lysis potencies of each agent. Other Methods—Purification of plasminogen and specific activity determination of SAK, SAKK, and HE-SAKK were performed as described by Szarka et al. (24Szarka S. Sihota E. Habibi H.R. Wong S.-L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Properties of both staphylokinase and hirudin-specific polyclonal antibodies used in this study were also described by Szarka et al. (24Szarka S. Sihota E. Habibi H.R. Wong S.-L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant protein production yield was measured using the quantitative Western blot method as described previously (31Wu S.-C. Ye R. Wu X.-C. Ng S.-C. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2830-2835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed at the DNA Sequencing Laboratory, University Core DNA and Protein Services, University of Calgary. In the fibrin-clot lysis studies with different thrombolytic agents (i.e. SAK versus HE-SAKK), the T 50% values were subject to the Student's t test for statistical significance analysis. A probability value of 5% (p < 0.05) was regarded as being significant. Design of the Y Shaped Heterodimer of SAK-K Coil and Hirudin-E Coil—To equip staphylokinase with the capability of targeting freshly formed thrombi and to minimize reocclusion, physical linkage of hirudin to staphylokinase is desirable. However, creation of simple linear fusions between these two molecules is not ideal because each component requires a free N terminus for its function. Removal of the positive charge of the α-amino group at the N terminus by either acetylation or addition of one extra amino acid severely reduces the inhibitory effect of hirudin to thrombin (19Lazar J.B. Winant R.C. Johnson P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 685-688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wallace A. Dennis S. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 10079-10084Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Wirsching F. Opitz T. Dietrich R. Schwienhorst A. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 204: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the hirudin-thrombin complex and site-directed mutagenesis of hirudin illustrate that the N-terminal α-amino group of hirudin forms a hydrogen bond with Ser195 in the catalytic site of thrombin (34Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 35Betz A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4557-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For staphylokinase, its processing by plasmin to remove the first 10 amino acids to expose the positively charged lysine residue at position 11 is essential for the activity of staphylokinase (24Szarka S. Sihota E. Habibi H.R. Wong S.-L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Schlott B. Guhrs K.H. Hartmann M. Rocker A. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although a processed version (deletion of the first 10 amino acids) of staphylokinase can be engineered using recombinant DNA technology, the presence of a positively charged residue at the N terminus of the processed staphylokinase is absolutely required (24Szarka S. Sihota E. Habibi H.R. Wong S.-L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a Y-shaped heterodimer of staphylokinase and hirudin was designed so that each molecule could have its N terminus free for its biological activity (Fig. 1A). We have previously demonstrated that fusion of proteins to the C-terminal end of staphylokinase does not affect the staphylokinase activity (24Szarka S. Sihota E. Habibi H.R. Wong S.-L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of hirudin is shown to bind to the thrombin cleft (also known as the anion-binding exosite) mainly through electrostatic interaction. With the presence of a flexible linker sequence, the addition of a dimerization domain to hirudin at the C-terminal end is expected to have a minimal effect on hirudin activity. In fact, several C-terminal hirudin fusions have been constructed and they all retain almost full activity (33Wirsching F. Opitz T. Dietrich R. Schwienhorst A. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 204: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 37Syed S. Schuyler P.D. Kulczycky M. Sheffield W.P. Blood. 1997; 89: 3243-3252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure the formation of heterodimers, a pair of engineered coiled coil sequences (also commonly known as a leucine zipper) designated K coil and E coil (20Tripet B. Yu L. Bautista D.L. Wong W.Y.

https://openalex.org/W1984560456,"Giardia lamblia is an early branching eukaryote, and although distinctly eukaryotic in its cell and molecular biology, transcription and translation in G. lamblia demonstrate important differences from these processes in higher eukaryotes. The cyclic octapeptide amanitin is a relatively selective inhibitor of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and is commonly used to study RNAP II transcription. Therefore, we measured the sensitivity of G. lamblia RNAP II transcription to α-amanitin and found that unlike most other eukaryotes, RNAP II transcription in Giardia is resistant to 1 mg/ml amanitin. In contrast, 50 μg/ml amanitin inhibits 85% of RNAP III transcription activity using leucyl-tRNA as a template. To better understand transcription in G. lamblia, we identified 10 of the 12 known eukaryotic rpb subunits, including all 10 subunits that are required for viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The amanitin motif (amanitin binding site) of Rpb1 from G. lamblia has amino acid substitutions at six highly conserved sites that have been associated with amanitin resistance in other organisms. These observations of amanitin resistance of Giardia RNA polymerase II support previous proposals of the mechanism of amanitin resistance in other organisms and provide a molecular framework for the development of novel drugs with selective activity against G. lamblia.

Giardia is a flagellated unicellular eukaryotic microorganism that commonly causes diarrheal disease throughout the world. This protist is a diplomonad with two nuclei but lacks nucleoli and peroxisomes and mitochondria. Based on comparisons of 18 S rRNA sequences, Giardia lamblia appears to be a basal eukaryote (1Sogin M.L. Gunderson J.H. Elwood H.J. Alonso R.A. Peattie D.A. Science. 1989; 243: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 2Philippe H. Germot A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 830-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 3Philippe H. Germot A. Moreira D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), although there is an ongoing debate about the interpretation of the position of Giardia in molecular trees (3Philippe H. Germot A. Moreira D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Bapteste E. Brinkmann H. Lee J.A. Moore D.V. Sensen C.W. Gordon P. Durufle L. Gaasterland T. Lopez P.

Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Gene organization and transcription in Giardia is unusual relative to more commonly studied eukaryotes. Most Giardia transcripts have a very short 5′-untranslated region (1–6 nucleotides) (6Adam R.D. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and do not possess a 7-methyl guanosine cap (7Yu D.C. Wang A.L. Botka C.W. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because many of the intergenic regions are less than 100 base pairs in length (6Adam R.D. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and can be as short as 8–10 bp, 1V. Seshadri and R. D. Adam, unpublished results.1V. Seshadri and R. D. Adam, unpublished results. the very compact nature of the genome might prevent the general use of longer 5′-untranslated regions. Because of the potential impact on organization of promoter regions, these short intergenic elements may constrain the regulation of transcription. Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; MSA, multiple sequence alignment; MEME, multiple expectation maximizations and motif elicitation; contig, group of overlapping clones; ORF, open reading frame.2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; MSA, multiple sequence alignment; MEME, multiple expectation maximizations and motif elicitation; contig, group of overlapping clones; ORF, open reading frame. promoters are highly conserved and usually have 3 short sequences centered at 30 (TATA box), 75 (CAAT box), and 90 (GC box) bases upstream of the transcription start site (8Zawel L. Reinberg D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 67-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In contrast, the G. lamblia RNAP II promoters have AT-rich sequences at the transcription start site (consensus AATTAAAAA), 20–35 nucleotides upstream of the start site (consensus CAAAAA(A/T)(T/C)AGA(G/T)TC(C/T)GAA), and a third hexamer 40–70 bases upstream of the start site (consensus CAATTT) (9Holberton D.V.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19699-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These differences in Giardia transcription suggest the possibility that the components of G. lamblia RNAP II that affect the transcription start site may differ from those of other eukaryotes. The RNAP II holoenzyme in eukaryotes consists of 12 subunits, Rpb1 through Rpb12 (11Kimura M. Sakurai H. Ishihama A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Ishihama A. Kimura M. Mitsuzawa H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 190-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sakurai H.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 347-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Rpb1, Rpb2, Rpb3, Rpb4, Rpb7, Rpb9, and Rpb11 are unique to RNAP II, whereas Rpb5, Rpb6, Rpb8, Rpb10, and Rpb12 are also components of the other two nuclear RNA polymerases (RNA polymerases I and III) (16Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 347-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Rpb4 and Rpb9 are dispensable in Saccharomyces cerevisiae at optimal growth conditions, whereas the remaining subunits are essential for viability (17Woychik N.A. Liao S.M. Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18McKune K. Richards K.L. Edwards A.M. Young R.A. Woychik N.A. Yeast. 1993; 9: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The three nuclear RNA polymerases vary in their sensitivities to the cyclic octapeptide α-amanitin. RNAP I is resistant to amanitin, RNAP II is 50% inhibited by 5–20 μg/ml, and RNAP III is 50% inhibited by 250 μg/ml amanitin. These differences in sensitivity are frequently exploited to study the transcription of genes by different polymerases. For example, the amanitin resistance of variant surface glycoprotein gene transcription in African trypanosomes provided the basis for the proposal that these genes are transcribed by RNAP I (19Kooter J.M. Borst P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9457-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, there are organisms in which RNAP II transcription is naturally amanitin-resistant. RNAP II transcription in Trichomonas vaginalis is resistant to 250 μg/ml amanitin (20Quon D.V.K. Delgadillo M.G. Johnson P.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 43: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Vanacova S. Tachezy J. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), whereas Entamoeba histolytica transcription is resistant to 1 mg/ml amanitin (22Lioutas C. Tannich E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the current manuscript, we describe the genes encoding G. lamblia RNAP II and demonstrate a potential molecular basis for amanitin-resistant transcription of protein-coding genes in G. lamblia.

To identify the Rpb subunits of Giardia, we used the protein sequences of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe rpb genes as a query in a TBLASTN search against the G. lamblia project data base (www.mbl.edu/Giardia). We then analyzed the contigs containing the putative rpb genes. Because introns are rare in Giardia (one has been identified in the 2Fe2S ferredoxin gene (29Nixon J.E.J. Wang A. Morrison H.G. McArthur A.G. Sogin M.L. Loftus B.J. Samuelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3701-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)), we used the ORFs of the primary genomic sequences for subsequent analysis. We used the translation of each putative rpb ORF as a query in a BLASTP search against the nonredundant data base to confirm whether it was the ortholog of the given gene. When bidirectional sequences were not available, we used primer walking to obtain complete bidirectional sequences. Using the S. pombe ortholog as a query, BLAST failed to identify the rpb7 gene in the genome data base, but a consensus of two conserved motifs from S. cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Homo sapiens returned a putative rpb7 sequence with a TBLASTN score of 0.24. rpb Probes—We prepared probes for each rpb gene to determine genomic location and organization as well as transcript length. The ORFs of the three largest subunits, Rpb1, Rpb2, and Rpb3, were found entirely within the plasmid clones MJ3673, NJ2874, and KJ2040 (www.mbl.edu/Giardia); therefore, these plasmids were used as probes. In the case of rpb3, we used the plasmid clone KJ2040 for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis hybridizations and an antisense oligo (described below) to probe genomic restriction fragments and RNA blots. We used PCR products amplified from genomic DNA with the following primers as probes for the following rpb ORFs. The number indicated in the brackets refers to the size of the amplified product. TACCAACAGTCTCCGACG and GTCTACGGAACGGCAGAG for rpb5a (651), ATGGACTCACTTGCGCTG and AGAGATGTTTCCCCGCAC for rpb5b (586), GCCCTTGATCGTGGAAAG and GTAACTCGCTGAGCTTCC for rpb6 (283), CTTCCACATTGAGGCCAC and CCCCCCTATTGATGTTTC for rpb7 (382), ATCATCCCTGTTCGGTGC and TTACTTCTGCTCCGCCGC for rpb10 (241), CGGATCGGTACAAAACAC and GTGGGTGTGCATGATACT for rpb11 (356), and GGGAAAATCAGCCTGTCG and GATTAGGGTTTGTGTTGC for rpb12 (96). We used single-stranded antisense oligonucleotide probes for rpb3 (5′-GGGAGCCTTTCAAATTCATCGCAC) and rpb8 (5′-GCATAATCTAAGTCTGGGTAGGCG). Because of the small size of rpb12, we used reverse transcription-PCR with primers rpb12A (GGGAAAATCAGCCTGTCG) and rpb12B (GATTAGGGTTTGTGTTGC) to analyze the transcription of rpb12. The EZ rTth RNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used to amplify a 96-bp product within the rpb12 ORF. Procedures were followed as suggested by the manufacturer, except that a 50 °C annealing temperature was used instead of 60 °C. Sequences similar to rpb4 and rpb9 do not occur in the current coverage of the G. lamblia genome. Identification of the G. lamblia Leucyl-tRNA Gene—The BLAST annotation of the Giardia genome sequences identified a putative leucyl-tRNA. The G. lamblia sequence was aligned with the C. elegans leucyl-tRNA sequence using LALIGN (30Huang X. Xiaoqiu Miller W. Webb Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (828) Google Scholar), using a +5/–4 scoring matrix with gap and extension penalties of –12 and –4, respectively. An oligonucleotide with the sequence complementary to the identified gene (5′-GCCAGCTGTGGGGTTCGAACCCACGCGGTCTTGCAACCAATGGGACTTGAATCCATCGCCTTAACCACTCGG CCAAACTGGC) was used to probe northern blots as well as run-on transcripts. Electrophoresis and Hybridization of Nucleic Acids—Total chromosomal DNA was prepared and separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using the ISR E11 isolate to identify chromosomal locations because chromosomes 1 and 2 of this isolate can be readily distinguished (26Adam R.D. Nash T.E. Wellems T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 4555-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA were performed by standard methods. DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane by alkaline transfer in 0.4 m NaOH. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), separated on a formaldehyde gel, and transferred to nylon in 10× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate). Double-stranded DNA probes were labeled by random priming, and unincorporated nucleotides were removed by Sephadex G-50 spun column chromatography. Hybridization to DNA was performed in 5× SSC at 50 °C, and hybridization to RNA was performed in 5× SSC and 50% formamide at 37 °C. Oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified using a G-25 column. Hybridization was carried out in 6× SSC, and washing was done in 1× SSC at 50 °C. Nuclear Run-on Assays—G. lamblia nuclear run-on assays were performed as previously described for Trypanosoma brucei (31Ullu E. Tschudi C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and G. lamblia (32Yee J. Mowatt M.R. Dennis P.P. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11432-11439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Trophozoite cultures were harvested in late log phase by centrifugation at 1200 × g and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. The pellets were re-suspended in Buffer A (150 mm sucrose, 20 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma-Aldrich) to a density of 6 × 108 cells/ml in 400-μl aliquots. Palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (lysolecithin) was added to a concentration of 500 μg/ml and chilled on ice for 1 min. Two volumes of Buffer A at room temperature were added, and the trophozoites were then recovered by centrifugation as described before. The pellets were washed twice in Buffer A and resuspended in 100 μl of the run-on mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 2 mm GTP, 2 mm CTP, 100 μCi of [32P]UTP), 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 1.2 μg/μl creatine kinase). In the amanitin experiments, amanitin was added at concentrations of 0, 50, 250, or 1000 μg/ml. The reaction was carried out for 1 h at room temperature and stopped by adding DNase I (0.2 mg/ml) and proteinase K (25 mg/ml) followed by incubation at 55 °C for 30 min. Radiolabeled RNA was extracted from the cells using the DNA/RNA kit procedure for RNA extraction (Qiagen). DNA probes used for nuclear run-on assays were denatured and slot-blotted onto 0.45 μm Supercharge Nytran membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). For the S. cerevisiae run-on assays, a log phase culture of S. cerevisiae was harvested by centrifugation at 4600 × g. The pellet (3 × 107 cells) was washed with TMN buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) and resuspended in 1 ml of 0.5% Sarkosyl. The suspension was placed on ice for 15 min, and the cells were recovered by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of run-on mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, GTP, and CTP, 100 μCi of [32P]UTP, 1 unit/μl RNasin, 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 1.2 μg/μl creatine kinase). In the α-amanitin control experiments, α-amanitin (50 μg/ml) was added to the run-on mixture (33Tukey R.H. Okino S.T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out for 1 h at room temperature and stopped by adding DNase I (0.2 mg/ml) and proteinase K (25 mg/ml) followed by incubation at 55 °C for 10 min. RNA was then extracted from the run-on mixture as for G. lamblia and hybridized to the slot-blotted nucleic acid probes (discussed below) in 6× SSC and 25% formamide at 37 °C. The blots were washed in 1× SSC at 50 °C. In the RNase A control experiment, the extracted RNA was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mg/ml RNaseA for 1 h before hybridization. Probes Used in Nuclear Run-on Assays—A plasmid probe for ribosomal DNA in Giardia was obtained from Tom Edlind (34Edlind T.D. Chakraborty P.R.

Parasitol. 1991; 49: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) probes were amplified from genomic DNA using the primers listed below. The vsp conserved primers were based on the vspA6 (CRP170) (38Adam R.D. Yang Y.M. Nash T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) sequence. In that region, all published vsp sequences demonstrate greater than 90% nucleotide identity; thus, all vsp transcripts should hybridize to the probe (37Mowatt M.R. Aggarwal A. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 49: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 3V. Seshadri, A. G. McArthur, M. L. Sogin, and R. D. Adam, unpublished data from MEME (multiple expectation maximizations and motif elicitation) analysis of 14 published vsp genes. The probes for β-giardin (810 bp) (GenBank™ accession number GI X85958) and the vsp conserved region (93 bp) (GenBank™ accession number GI M83933) were obtained by means of PCR from genomic DNA using the primer sets ATGTTCACCTCCACCCTTACG/GTGCTTTGTGACCATCGAGAG for β-giardin and GGTGCCATCGCGGGGATCTCC/CGCCTTCCCTCTACAG ATGAA for the vsp conserved region. Custom made oligo 60-mers, GGCAAGCACGTCCCGCGCGCGGTCTTCGTTGACCTCGAGCCCACGGTCGTC GACGAGGTC and GACCTCGTCGACGACCGTGGGCTCGAGGTCAACGAAGACCGCGCGCGGGACGTGCTTGCC, which are the sense and antisense strands of the α2-tubulin gene, were used as single strand DNA probes. Probes for the S. cerevisiae genes were amplified from genomic DNA using the primers GGTTGATCCTGCCAGTAGTCATATG and GACTTGCCCTCCAATTGTTCCTCG for 18 S rRNA (783-bp product) (39Rubtsov P.M.

MEME Analysis—The Rpb1 sequences of M. musculus (GenBank™ U37500), H. sapiens (X63564), C. elegans (T29959), Drosophila melanogaster (P04052), Arabidopsis thaliana (CAB81489), Helobdella stagnalis (AAA50227), S. pombe (AL121795), S. cerevisiae (X03128), Aspergillus oryzae (AB017184), Plasmodium falciparum (NP_473294), Leishmania major (AF009163), T. brucei (J03157), Mastigamoeba invertens (AF083338), Bonnemaisonia hamifera (U90209), T. vaginalis (U20501), and G. lamblia and Rpc1 sequences of G. lamblia, S. cerevisiae, and H. sapiens were entered in FASTA format at the MEME web site (meme.sdsc.edu/meme/website/meme.html) (40Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB'94). AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA1994: 28-36Google Scholar). To restrict the alignment to the α-amanitin motif, the training sequences included the amanitin motif described for M. musculus, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, and S. cerevisiae (41Bartolomei M.S. Corden J.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of these orthologs was also done using ClustalW (42Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar), which allows gaps to be introduced in the sequences. The results were identical to that of the MEME output within the amanitin motif. A similar procedure was followed to obtain a block diagram of the bridge helix. Amanitin Resistance of RNAP II Transcription—α-Amanitin, a mushroom-derived cyclic octapeptide, inhibits RNAP II of most eukaryotes by interacting with Rpb1. To determine its potential usefulness in studying RNAP II transcription in Giardia, we conducted nuclear run-on assays using housekeeping genes that have previously been characterized. The cytoskeletal gene α2-tubulin is highly expressed in trophozoites (43Elmendorf H.G. Singer S.M. Pierce J. Cowan J. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). β-Giardin is a cytoskeletal protein that is unique to G. lamblia and is found in the ventral disk that mediates attachment to the intestinal wall (35Baker D.A. Holberton D.V. Marshall J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36Aggarwal A. Adam R.D. Nash T.E. Infect.

Both have upstream flanking regions that fit the consensus for promoters of G. lamblia protein-coding genes (9Holberton D.V. Marshall J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2945-2953Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 43Elmendorf H.G. Singer S.M. Pierce J. Cowan J. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and transcripts for each of the genes have polyadenylated tails. Thus, we would expect both of these genes to be transcribed by RNAP II. The vsp gene transcripts also have polyadenylated tails and the short 5′-untranslated regions that are typical of G. lamblia genes and are most likely transcribed by RNAP II. However, vsp genes do not have the typical G. lamblia promoter regions. The vsp genes that have been characterized demonstrate at least 90% identity in the 110-bp 3′ region, so all vsp gene transcripts should hybridize to this region (37Mowatt M.R. Aggarwal A. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 49: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 3V. Seshadri, A. G. McArthur, M. L. Sogin, and R. D. Adam, unpublished data from MEME (multiple expectation maximizations and motif elicitation) analysis of 14 published vsp genes. Frequent antisense transcripts for a variety of genes have been reported in G. lamblia (45Elmendorf H.G. Singer S.M. Nash T.E.

Microbiol. 1999; 34: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); therefore, we used complementary 60-mer antisense and sense oligonucleotides for the tubulin gene to distinguish between sense and antisense transcripts in the run-on product. The antisense probe gave a strong signal, whereas the sense probe gave no signal (Fig 1A), indicating that the level of antisense transcription for the tubulin gene is low or absent. Control experiments using RNase A before hybridization yielded no signal, as expected (data not shown). We observed no inhibition of transcription in the presence of 50 μg/ml amanitin with the tubulin, giardin, or the vsp conserved region probes (Fig 1A). RNAP I transcription as measured by hybridization to the rRNA gene was unaffected at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. In contrast to the amanitin resistance of Giardia RNAP II, transcription of the S. cerevisiae EF1-α and tubulin genes was almost totally inhibited by 50 μg/ml amanitin, whereas rRNA transcription was unaffected (Fig 1B). Actinomycin D almost completely inhibited G. lamblia RNAP I and RNAP II transcription at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Nuclear run-on assays in the presence of 1 mg/ml amanitin or 10 μg/ml actinomycin D.

A putative G. lamblia leucyl-tRNA sequence from the BLAST annotations of the genomic sequences was 78.6% identical to the C. elegans ortholog (Fig. 3). A complementary oligonucleotide identified an 80-nucleotide band on a Northern blot (Fig. 4), which is the expected size of a tRNA gene. Run-on assays at varying concentrations of amanitin (50, 250, and 1000 μg/ml) using the leucyl-tRNA antisense oligonucleotide probe demonstrated that RNAP III transcription was 85% inhibited by 50 μg/ml of amanitin, whereas RNAP I and RNAP II transcription was unaffected (Fig. 5). When we separated the run-on transcripts on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, we observed a series of bands ranging in size from 70 to 82 nucleotides (Fig. 6), which most likely represent tRNA, as well as 93- and 110-nucleotide bands, which were present in the amanitin untreated sample and not in the treated ones. We do not know the identity of the 93- and 110-nucleotide bands.Fig. 4Leucyl-tRNA Northern blot.

The detected transcripts are indicated in the right panel. The experiment was carried out three times, and the results were consistent. The bottom panel demonstrates the relative levels of RNAP I (rRNA), RNAP II (tubulin), and RNAP III (tRNA) transcription at varying amanitin concentrations. The radioactive counts per minute in each of the above shown bands was estimated by scintillation counting and subtracting the background.

This is the only redox reaction in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. In rapidly proliferating cells pyrimidine salvage pathways cannot compensate for the lack of UMP caused by inhibition of DHOD.

Class 1 enzymes, which are subdivided into class 1A and 1B enzymes, are cytosolic proteins, whereas class 2 enzymes are membrane-associated. The bacterium Lactococcus lactis contains genes that encode DHODs representing subclass 1A and 1B, DHODA, and DHODB.

Structure. 2002; 10: 1211-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Relative to the class 1 enzymes, they possess an extended N terminus, which plays a role in the membrane association of the enzyme and provides the binding site for the respiratory quinones that serve as physiological electron acceptors (16Liu S.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1222-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Crithidia fasciculata (19Pascal Jr., R.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) together with more recent studies on DHODB from Enterococcus faecalis (20Marcinkeviciene J. Tinney L.M. Wang K.H. Rogers M.J. Copeland R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13129-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and on DHODC from E. coli (21Palfey B.A. Björnberg O. Jensen K.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4381-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) describe the stereospecific oxidation of (S)-dihydroorotate to orotate as mediated by an active site base. The active site base abstracts the C5-S proton of dihydroorotate (DHO) followed by hydride transfer from the C6 position of DHO to the N5 of FMN. Based on structural comparisons of class 1 and class 2 enzymes we have suggested that the mechanism for the first half-reaction is highly conserved, and two highly conserved lysines are essential for the catalytic function (17Nørager S. Jensen K.F. Björnberg O. Larsen S. Structure. 2002; 10: 1211-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the class 1 enzymes the active site base is a cysteine residue (7Björnberg O. Rowland P. Larsen S. Jensen K.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16197-16205Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) while in class 2 enzymes it is a serine (14Björnberg O. Grüner A.C. Roepstorff P. Jensen K.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In terms of structure DHODA represents the simplest type of DHOD, with a common binding site for the two substrates. At the same time DHODA exhibits properties that are common for DHODs in general, which makes the protein an excellent model system for detailed investigation of the function and structure of DHODs. The structure of the dimeric DHODA with orotate bound in the active site is shown in Fig. 1. Each subunit folds into a (β/α)8-barrel with the prosthetic FMN group situated at the C-terminal end of the β-strands at the top of the barrel and close to the dimer interface. The reaction product, orotate, stacks on the isoalloxazine ring of FMN in a favorable position for hydride transfer from the substrate to N5 the isoalloxazine ring. Cys-130, the active site base, is contained in a flexible and highly conserved loop (residues 129–138), which we refer to as the active site loop. This loop covers the active site, and it is obvious that it must undergo movements to let substrate in and product out of the active site (8Rowland P. Nielsen F.S. Jensen K.F. Larsen S. Structure. 1997; 5: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Rowland P. Björnberg O. Nielsen F.S. Jensen K.F. Larsen S.

Des. 2000; 8: 1227-1238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cys-130 in the active site loop is only conserved in the class 1 DHODs, but the loop contains three residues that are totally conserved in both classes, Ser-129, Pro-131, and Asn-132. The role of the latter residue was assigned earlier (9Rowland P. Björnberg O. Nielsen F.S. Jensen K.F. Larsen S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but from our structural investigations studies we were unable to assign any function to the two former residues. Another very highly conserved segment of amino acids, residues 50–57 in DHODA, found in the DHOD sequences, forms a fixed loop delineating the active site in the DHOD structures (8Rowland P. Nielsen F.S. Jensen K.F. Larsen S. Structure. 1997; 5: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Rowland P. Björnberg O. Nielsen F.S. Jensen K.F. Larsen S.

Structure. 2002; 10: 1211-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which we refer to as the cis-proline loop. Two of the residues in this loop, Arg-57 and Pro-56 (forming a cis-peptide bond to the non-conserved Leu-55) are conserved in all DHODs. Their putative functions in catalysis have not been investigated. In addition to the two loop regions, the alignment of DHOD sequences and structures revealed a number of other residues conserved between the DHODs. Two of these (Asn-132 and Lys-43 in DHODA) are important for catalysis (7Björnberg O. Rowland P. Larsen S. Jensen K.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16197-16205Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Their side chains are hydrogen-bonded to the product orotate, and in addition Lys-43 interacts with O4 of FMN (9Rowland P. Björnberg O. Nielsen F.S. Jensen K.F. Larsen S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in all the known structures the pyrimidine ring of orotate is held tightly by hydrogen bonds to three totally conserved asparagines residues (Asn-67, Asn-127, and Asn-193). Three basic residues, Arg-50, Lys-136, and Lys-213 are only conserved in class 1A. Their presence close to the entrance to the active site led us to propose (9Rowland P. Björnberg O. Nielsen F.S. Jensen K.F. Larsen S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that they could play a role in the first step of the reaction by the attraction and proper orientation of the substrate. Arg-50 is located in the cis-proline loop, Lys-136 in the active site loop, and Lys-213 at the C-terminal of end of a 310 helix, which we will refer to as the Lys-213 helix. The positions of these residues in the DHODA dimer are illustrated in Fig. 1. We report here the kinetic characterization of ten mutant enzymes, seven of these represent changes to alanine of residues totally conserved among all DHODs (N67A, N127A, N193A, P56A, R57A, S129A, P131A) and three were constructed to change the surface charge at or near the entrance to the active site (R50E, K136E, K213E). In addition structural investigations at low temperature were made for five of them in the presence or absence of the product orotate (N67A(Oro), P56A(Oro), R57A(Oro), K136E, K136E(Oro), K213E(Oro)). A low temperature structure determination was also performed for the uncomplexed DHODA, as our initial structure determination for the enzyme was a room temperature study and contained Cys-130 in an oxidized form (8Rowland P. Nielsen F.S. Jensen K.F. Larsen S. Structure. 1997; 5: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These results from the kinetic and structural investigations have revealed several new characteristics of the enzymatic function of DHODA that have implications for the function of dihydroorotate dehydrogenases in general. Mutagenesis and Purification of Mutant Enzymes—The wild-type DHODA was prepared according to the procedure of Nielsen et al. (11Nielsen F.S. Rowland P. Larsen S. Jensen K.F. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mutations in the pyrDa gene were introduced by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described by Björnberg et al. (7Björnberg O. Rowland P. Larsen S. Jensen K.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16197-16205Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using the plasmid pFN1 as template and mutant primers. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into BamHI- and HindIII-digested pUHE23–2 to generate plasmids similar to pFN1, but with a mutation in the pyrD gene. To ensure the presence of only the desired mutation the entire pyrDa gene of each clone was sequenced. The modified enzymes were purified as described for the wild-type (11Nielsen F.S. Rowland P. Larsen S. Jensen K.F. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) enzyme, although the different enzymes needed different volumes of isocratic washing with the 1 m NaCl buffer to be eluted from the hydroxyl apatite column. Enzyme concentrations were determined from the flavin content (7Björnberg O. Rowland P. Larsen S. Jensen K.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16197-16205Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) after denaturation of the protein in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for a few minutes at room temperature. The absorbance measured to calculate the enzyme concentration was based on the extinction coefficient of 12.5 mm–1 for free FMN at 445 nm. Steady State Kinetics—Steady state kinetic measurements of the enzyme activity with different electron acceptors were carried out in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 with 1 mm DHO as substrate under normal aerobic conditions (Table I). A Zeiss Specord S10 diode array instrument thermostatted at 25 °C was used to record the spectrum as a function of time. When DCIP served as electron acceptor the absorbance at 600 nm with an extinction coefficient ϵ = 20 mm–1 cm–1 was used to estimate the orotate concentration. With oxygen as electron acceptor the concentration of orotate was estimated from the absorbance at 278 nm using an extinction coefficient ϵ = 7.7 mm–1 cm–1, and with fumarate as electron acceptor the orotate absorbance at 300 nm (ϵ = 3.05 mm–1 cm–1) was used to estimate its concentration.Table ISteady state activities of wild type and mutant enzymesEnzymeActivityOxygen (only)DCIP (50 μM)Fumarate (8.5/0.87 mM)μmol/min × mgNative2.013.615.8N67A0.090.110.30N127A1.00.751.2 (1.8aThese two enzymes, although stimulated by low concentrations of fumarate, are inhibited by higher concentrations of fumarate (see also Table II).)N193A0.170.150.14 (0.42aThese two enzymes, although stimulated by low concentrations of fumarate, are inhibited by higher concentrations of fumarate (see also Table II).)P56A0.150.470.48R57A3.365.627.0S129A1.811.72.8P131A2.34.03.7R50E3.37.219.0K136E1.613.018.1K213E1.92.47.2a These two enzymes, although stimulated by low concentrations of fumarate, are inhibited by higher concentrations of fumarate (see also Table II). Open table in a new tab Pre-steady State Kinetics—Pre-steady state rate of bleaching of the enzymes (Table III) following addition of DHO were determined in a 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer of pH 8.5 at 5 °C using a stopped flow instrument (SX-18MV) from Applied Photophysics. Different procedures were employed to reduce the oxygen concentration in the syringes for substrate and enzyme, respectively. The substrate syringe, with a range of DHO concentrations in 0.2 m Tris-HCl pH 8.5, were flushed with argon for 15 min while the enzyme solution was diluted in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer supplemented with a mixture of 11 mm glucose, 1 mm DTT, glucose oxidase (10 μg/ml), and catalase (1 μg/ml). Reduction of the flavin in the wild-type enzyme appeared to follow biphasic kinetics. This was also seen for the R50E, K136E, and S129A mutant enzymes, and the bleaching rates (k c in Table III) represent the fastest rate with the largest amplitude. However, reduction rates of the two mutants K213E and P131A were much lower and conformed to simple first order kinetics. As we did not detect any re-oxidation of the flavin during the experiments, these conditions must have been sufficiently anaerobic.Table IIIStopped flow determinations of the saturation of the bleaching of wild type and mutant DHODAs under anaerobic conditionsEnzymeBleaching rate kcSaturation constant KDRedox potentials-1μ mmVNative187 ± 2169 ± 6-245R50E43.0 ± 0.5226 ± 8-245K136E86 ± 2107 ± 6-245K213E3.47 ± 0.02295 ± 12-251S129A30.7 ± 1.2369 ± 47-247P131A6.00 ± 0.0686 ± 3-263 Open table in a new tab Determination of Orotate Binding Constants by Red Shift Titrations—The marked red shift of the FMN absorbance spectrum (Fig. 2), accompanying the binding of orotate to DHODA and quantified by the difference between the absorbance at 515 and 600 nm Δ(A 515–A 600), was used to determine the parameters for binding of orotate to the DHODA enzymes. The spectrum was recorded before and after each of a series (13Björnberg O. Jordan D.B. Palfey B.A. Jensen K.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; PubMed Google Scholar) of successive additions of orotate to the cuvette and corrected for dilution. The total orotate concentration ranged from 5 μm to 2 mm, but for the weak binding enzymes, i.e. the N193A, P56A, and N127A proteins, concentrations up to 12 mm of orotate were used. To determine the dissociation constants (K D) for the enzyme-orotate complexes, the data were fitted to Equation 1, which assumes a uniform affinity of the ligand at all binding sites and a binding stoichiometry of 1:1 between the ligand and the number of binding sites (21Palfey B.A. Björnberg O.

Open table in a new tab However, as illustrated in Fig. 3 the binding behavior did not fully agree with Equation 1 and in some cases, for enzymes with K D values below 100 μm we attempted a fit to Equation 2 (22Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins 1990, Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1991: 60-66Google Scholar), which describes the binding of a ligand (L) to an enzyme with two different types of binding sites (A and B), Δ(A515-A600)=Δ(A515-A600)Max·(fA·Lf/(KD,A+Lf)+fB·Lf/(KD,B+Lf))(Eq. 2) where K D,A and K D,B are dissociation constants at sites A and B; f A and f B are fractions of the total binding capacity constituted by sites A and B; L f is the concentration of free orotate, which equals [orotate]total – [orotate]bound. The concentration of bound orotate was calculated according to Equation 3. [orotate]bound=[E0]×(Δ(A515-A600)/Δ(A515-A600)Max)(Eq. 3) Redox Potentials—Redox potentials (Table III) were determined using the xanthine-xanthine oxidase method described by Massey (22Massey V.

Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1991: 60-66Google Scholar) with phenosafranin as reference dye, E0(pH 7.0) = –252 mV. Enzyme concentrations were near 1 mg/ml in 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Crystallization—Prior to crystallization the proteins were dialyzed against a 25 mm NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 6.0, containing 10% glycerol. The P56A, R57A, N67A, K136E, and K213E mutant enzymes were crystallized with the reaction product orotate in 5-fold molar excess relative to the protein concentration. The native DHODA and the K136E mutant were crystallized also without orotate; in these cases 1 mm DTT was added to the crystallization mother liquor, to ensure a reduced state of the active site cysteine. Good quality crystals were obtained after microseeding with crystals resulting from the original conditions (11Nielsen F.S. Rowland P. Larsen S. Jensen K.F. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in drops in which no spontaneous crystallization occurred. Optimal microseeding conditions differed slightly from mutant to mutant, but were all within the range 23–35% polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5–9.0, and protein concentrations of 13–20 mg/ml. Data Collection and Processing—All data sets were collected under cryogenic conditions (120 K). Mother liquor containing 10% glycerol was used as cryoprotectant. The data sets were integrated and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38231) Google Scholar). Structure factors were derived from the reflection intensities using TRUNCATE (24French G.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1978; 34: 517-525Crossref Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The main statistics for data collection and integration are given in Table IV. The crystals of the mutated proteins belong to the same space group (P21) as the native enzyme. The unit cell parameters are similar and slightly smaller than those obtained earlier for the structures at room temperature (8Rowland P. Nielsen F.S. Jensen K.F. Larsen S.

https://openalex.org/W2035760400,"Bone metastasis is the major reason for death caused by breast cancer. We used human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells that are poorly metastatic but show highly inducible migration to determine bone-derived factors that induce migration of initially non-disseminating breast cancer cells. We have found that a lipid fraction from human osteoblast-like MG63 cell-conditioned medium (MG63CM) contains a migration-inducing factor for MCF-7 cells. In this fraction, we have identified oxysterol (OS) as a lipid mediator for tumor cell migration. In MCF-7 cells, insulin-like growth factor 1 elevates the expression of OS-binding protein-related protein 7. Binding of OS to OS-binding protein or OS-binding protein-related protein is known to trigger elevation of sphingomyelin, a sphingolipid that organizes lipid microdomains in the cell membrane. In MCF-7 cells, OS increases the intracellular concentration of sphingomyelin and other phospholipids and induces the translocation of the small GTPase p21Ras to GM1- and cholesterol-rich membrane areas. The induction of migration by MG63CM is prevented by incubation of MG63 cells with mevinolin, a statin-type cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor that depletes the conditioned medium of OS. Osteoblast-derived OS may, thus, be a yet unrecognized lipid mediator for bone metastasis of breast cancer and a new target for anti-metastasis chemotherapy with statins. Bone metastasis is the major reason for death caused by breast cancer. We used human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells that are poorly metastatic but show highly inducible migration to determine bone-derived factors that induce migration of initially non-disseminating breast cancer cells. We have found that a lipid fraction from human osteoblast-like MG63 cell-conditioned medium (MG63CM) contains a migration-inducing factor for MCF-7 cells. In this fraction, we have identified oxysterol (OS) as a lipid mediator for tumor cell migration. In MCF-7 cells, insulin-like growth factor 1 elevates the expression of OS-binding protein-related protein 7. Binding of OS to OS-binding protein or OS-binding protein-related protein is known to trigger elevation of sphingomyelin, a sphingolipid that organizes lipid microdomains in the cell membrane. In MCF-7 cells, OS increases the intracellular concentration of sphingomyelin and other phospholipids and induces the translocation of the small GTPase p21Ras to GM1- and cholesterol-rich membrane areas. The induction of migration by MG63CM is prevented by incubation of MG63 cells with mevinolin, a statin-type cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor that depletes the conditioned medium of OS. Osteoblast-derived OS may, thus, be a yet unrecognized lipid mediator for bone metastasis of breast cancer and a new target for anti-metastasis chemotherapy with statins. The analysis of cell signaling for bone metastasis of breast cancer cells is crucial for the development of novel approaches for treatment of cancer. A great body of work has been done on the identification of proteinogenic growth and migration-inducing factors (1Mundy G.R. Nat. Rev.

Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4298-4303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only little is known, however, about the significance of lipid mediators in this process. Numerous studies show that the response of cancer cells to growth or migration-inducing factors critically depends on the lipid microenvironment of their receptors (6Onuffer J.J. Horuk R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 7Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4453) Google Scholar). For example, incubation with cholesterol has been found to significantly enhance IGF-1 and chemokine-dependent migration of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells toward the source of the growth or migration-inducing factor (8Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Lacalle R.A. Keller P. Labrador J.P. Martinez-A C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6211-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These studies have also shown that the use of MCF-7 cells with a low degree of intrinsically active cell migration allows for the sensitive determination of exogenous factors that induce migration by alteration of the membrane lipid composition. The potential of these factors to induce migration in poorly metastatic MCF-7 cells indicates that they are likely to turn a non-disseminating into a disseminating tumor. Lipids of the plasma membrane, in particular cholesterol and sphingolipids (i.e. sphingomyelin, GM1) are clustered in lipid microdomains that are known to associate with growth factor or chemokine receptors (9Van Meer G. Lisman Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25855-25858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 10Holthuis J.C.M. Pomorski T. Raggers R.J. Sprong H. van Meer G. Physiol.

The tight packing between cholesterol and sphingolipids has been shown to organize the formation of membrane lipid microdomains (12London E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that up-regulation of intracellular cholesterol and sphingomyelin may enhance lipid microdomain formation and in turn assist or amplify growth factor or chemokine-dependent cell signaling for breast cancer cell migration (6Onuffer J.J.

Martinez-A C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6211-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that lipid domains in the plasma membrane recruit small GTP-binding proteins (e.g. Ras, Rho) and growth factor or chemokine receptors to the leading edge of migrating cancer cells (8Manes S.

The association of these proteins in cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich membrane domains may, thus, form a cell signaling platform or module that triggers or controls the induction of tumor cell migration (3Guvakova M.A. Adams J.C.

The cholesterol and sphingomyelin biosynthesis is tightly regulated by soluble lipids, in particular steroids. We have identified hydroxylated cholesterol or oxysterol (OS) in medium that has been conditioned by osteoblast-like MG63 cells. OS is a soluble and cell-permeable form of cholesterol that has been reported to modulate both the intracellular cholesterol and sphingomyelin concentration in a variety of cell species (16Schroepfer Jr., G.J.

We have developed an improved drop agarose migration assay that allows us to determine the expression of OS-binding proteins and microdomain-associated lipids specifically in migrating tumor cells. This assay has been used to visualize the effect of OS on lamellipodia formation at the leading edge of MCF-7 cells. Our analyses show that osteoblast-derived OS may be an important lipid mediator for the navigation of migrating breast cancer cells to bone tissue. Furthermore, we discuss results that suggest a therapeutic potential of cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors for anti-metastasis therapy. Materials—Human breast cancer MCF-7 (ATCC HTB-22) and human osteosarcoma MG63 (ATCC CRL-1427) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). EMEM medium was from Invitrogen. Dextran-coated charcoal, LongR3-IGF-1 peptide analog, low melt agarose, wortmannin, arachidonic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, filipin, sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholesterol were from Sigma. Polyclonal rabbit IgG against IGF-1 receptor β-subunit and monoclonal mouse IgG against RhoA IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal IgG against anti-phospho-Thr-202/Tyr-204-p42/44-MAPK and rabbit polyclonal IgG against p42/44-MAPK were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Y-27632, PD98059, prostaglandins, and rabbit polyclonal IgG against p21Ras was from Calbiochem. Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 594-labeled cholera toxin B were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). HPTLC plates were obtained from Merck. All other chemicals were analytical grade or higher, and organic solvents were freshly re-distilled before use. Tumor Cell Culture and Medium Conditioning—MCF-7 and MG63 cells were propagated in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 using EMEM medium with or without phenol red or fetal bovine serum. Medium was conditioned by incubation of MG63 or MCF-7 cells with serum-free EMEM for 48 h followed by filtration of the conditioned medium through a 0.2-μm filter membrane. To remove lipids, the filtered medium was incubated with dextran-coated charcoal for 2 h, and the supernatant was used for incubation of MCF-7 cells as described (22Bradlow H.L. Arcuri F. Blasi L. Castagnetta L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 115: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In one series of experiments, the MG63-conditioned medium was supplemented with 1 μg/ml anti-IGF-1R antibody to prevent signaling via the IGF-1-induced pathway following a previously published procedure (23Puglianiello A. Germani D. Rossi P. Cianfarani S. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 165: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Migration Assays—The soft agarose drop migration assay was performed following the procedure introduced by Varani et al. (24Varani J Orr W. Ward P.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1978; 90: 159-171PubMed Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells (104–105 cells) in 10 μl of serum-free medium were mixed with 10 μl of 0.6% low melting point agarose liquefied in serum-free medium and then dropped onto the pre-cooled surface of a 6-well dish. The agarose was allowed to solidify for 15 min at 4 °C and was then covered with 0.5 ml of serum-free medium. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 h, growth or migration factors were added, and the assay mixture was incubated for another 24 h at 37 °C. Cells that migrated out of the rim of the drop were counted for quantitative determination of migrating cells. A modified drop agarose migration assay (co-culture migration assay) was designed to determine the trophic effect of growth or migration factors on MCF-7 cells that were released from a local source over a period of time. A dialysis tube containing MG63 cells was placed into a 60-mm dish before adding the agarose drop with MCF-7 cells to the dish. Alternatively, the dialysis tube was filled with medium that has been supplemented with migration or growth factors. After incubation of the cells, the agarose was removed, and the tumor cells were fixed and analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Statistically significant differences in data sets (p < 0.05) were assessed from at least 10 independent experiments using one way analysis of variance. Lipid Preparation and Analysis—Lipids were extracted from conditioned medium or agarose-embedded cells in 500 μl of deionized water by thoroughly mixing with an equal volume of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, by volume). The lower (organic) phase was evaporated to dryness with a stream of nitrogen, and the residue was dissolved in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, by volume) for further analysis by HPTLC and followed by mass spectrometry or preparative chromatography of the migration-inducing lipid fraction. HPTLC of cholesterol, ceramide, and prostaglandins was performed in the solvent system CH3OH/CH3COOH (9:1, by volume) followed by staining with 3% cupric acetate in 8% phosphoric acid and comparison to standard lipids as described (25Bieberich E. Hu B. Silva J. MacKinnon S. Yu R.K. Fillmore H. Broaddus W. Ottenbrite R. Cancer Lett. 2002; 181: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Phospholipids, including sphingomyelin, were resolved by HPTLC in CHCl3/EtOH/H2O/triethylamine (35:30:7:35, by volume) and specifically stained using a modified Dittmer's (CuSO4/H2SO4/molybdate) reagent (26Dasgupta S. Hogan E.L. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol and oxysterol were separated using HPTLC in CHCl3/CH3OH (95:5, by volume) and visualized by staining with 5% ammonium molybdate in 10% sulfuric acid as described (27Shan H. Pang J. Li S. Chiang T.B. Wilson W.K. Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Steroids. 2003; 68: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For preparative HPTLC, individual lipid fractions that co-migrated with cupric acetate-stained bands were scraped of the silica plate and extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, by volume). After removal of the silica particles by centrifugation, the supernatant was dried, and the residue was redissolved in serum-free EMEM medium or organic solvent for incubation of MCF-7 cells or analysis by mass spectrometry, respectively. Lipid extracts (in CHCl3/CH3OH, 1:1 by volume) and matrix (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in H2O/EtOH, 9:1 by volume) were co-crystallized on the target in a dried-droplet application. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired in positive ion mode on a Voyager DE STR (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with a UV laser (λ = 337 nm). The assignment of mass peaks to lipid species and their fragments followed previously published procedures (28Careri M. Ferretti D. Manini P. Musci M. J. Chromatogr. A. 1998; 794: 254-262Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Proteomics Analysis—Protein was extracted from free or agarose-embedded MCF-7 cells using SDS-sample buffer according to Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar) for SDS-PAGE or sample buffer for isoelectric focusing (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% (w/v) Bio-Lytes 3/10). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed with pre-cast immobilized pH gradient gels following the procedures given by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). The SDS gels were stained with Coomassie, and stained bands/proteins were cut out for tryptic digestion and proteomics analysis. Proteins were digested (trypsin, sequencing grade, Promega, Madison, WI) in gel. The tryptic digests were extracted from the gel, dried, and dissolved in 50% acetonitrile in trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%), and an aliquot was mixed on target with matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile in trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%). MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired as described for the analysis of lipids, and potential peptide sequences were identified using the PROFOUND and MASCOT programs for mass fingerprinting. RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from free or agarose-embedded MCF-7 cells using the Trizol method according to the manufacturer's (Invitrogen) protocol. An aliquot (0.6–1.0 μg of RNA) was used for RT-PCR with the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR system following the supplier's (Invitrogen) instructions. PCR was carried out by applying 35 cycles with various amounts of first strand cDNA template (equivalent to 0.05–0.2 μg of RNA) and 20 pmol of OSBP-related protein 7 (ORP7)-specific sense (ORP7s 5′-agcgctggatcgagcactatg-3′) and antisense (ORP7a 5′-catgttcccatagcctggctc-3′) oligonucleotide primers. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The agarose drop migration assay was performed on cover slips, and the drop was removed after incubation with migration-inducing factors. Migrating cells attached to the cover slips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Unspecific binding sites were saturated by incubation with 3% ovalbumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. The cover slips were then incubated with 5 μg/ml primary antibody in 0.1% ovalbumin, PBS followed by incubation with the appropriate fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody for 2 h at 37 °C. After staining with antibodies, GM1 was stained by incubation with 1 μg/ml Alexa 594-labeled cholera toxin subunit B in 0.1% ovalbumin, PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Cholesterol was stained by incubation with filipin at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in 0.1% ovalbumin, PBS for 1 h at room temperature as described previously (30Mukherjee S. Zha X. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1915-1925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 31Castanho M.A.R.B Coutinho A. Prieto M.J.E. J. Biol.

MG63-conditioned Medium Induces Migration of MCF-7 Cells—The observation that 50% of primary breast tumors metastasize to bone suggests the activity of bone-derived growth factors on the migration of breast cancer cells. We assayed the degree of inducible migration of human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells using a soft agarose drop migration assay (Fig. 1A). Medium was conditioned by incubating human osteoblast-like MG63 cells with serum-free EMEM. The conditioned medium (MG63CM) was added to MCF-7 cells that had been embedded into agarose drops, and migration was determined after incubation for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, cells migrating out of the agarose drop surrounded its edge and were also attached to the dish surface beneath the drop (Fig. 1B). The surrounding cells were counted for quantitative determination of migration (Fig. 2). The results were consistent with the number of migrating cells that stayed attached to the dish surface after the drop was removed (Fig. 1B).Fig. 2IGF-1- and MG63-conditioned medium-induced migration of MCF-7 cells. Agarose-embedded MCF-7 cells were incubated with or without serum or IGF-1 or MG63CM. The bars have been calculated from counts for cells that migrated out of the drops. 100% migration is equivalent to the value obtained from counts with serum-incubated cells. All values were determined as the averages from counts in at least 10 independent experiments with standard variances indicated as line bars. The asterisks mark values that were significantly different (p < 0.05) from those obtained with cells that were incubated without serum as compared with IGF-1 or MG63CM(*) or anti-IGF-1R and IGF-1 as compared with IGF-1 (**).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects of serum or IGF-1, a well known migration-inducing factor for breast cancer cells (3Guvakova M.A. Adams J.C. Boettiger D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4149-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 4Murphy P.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 345: 833-835Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 5Neuenschwander S. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4298-4303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), on MCF-7 cell migration were determined as positive controls. Incubation of the agarose drop in serum-free medium resulted in 30% of the migration observed with serum-containing medium (Fig. 2). Supplementation of serum-free medium with LongR3-IGF-1 peptide analog (100 ng/ml) restored migration to 55% of the serum value. MG63CM also restored migration of MCF-7 cells to 60% of the serum value (Fig. 2). This effect was specific for MG63 cells since medium that was self-conditioned by MCF-7 cells only slightly induced migration. We tested whether IGF-1 is a migration-inducing factor in MG63CM since it has been reported that osteoblasts secrete IGF-1 to the medium (32Gabbitas B. Canalis E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 172: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An antibody against IGF-1R, however, did not suppress the migration-inducing effect of MG63CM, whereas the effect of LongR3-IGF-1 was completely inhibited (Fig. 2). These results indicated that MG63CM contained a migration-inducing factor that was different from IGF-1. Migration was also not affected by the presence of phenol red in the conditioned medium or by the addition of estrogen (not shown), indicating that the migration-inducing effect of MG63CM is independent of estrogen. Oxysterol in MG63-conditioned Medium Is a Migration-inducing Factor—MG63-conditioned medium was treated with charcoal to determine whether the migration-inducing factor was a lipid or protein. As shown in Fig. 3, charcoal treatment of MG63CM suppressed MCF-7 migration to the value obtained with serum-free medium, which suggested that the MG63-derived migration-inducing factor was a lipid. We isolated four different lipid fractions from MG63CM using organic extraction and preparative HPTLC (Fig. 4A). The migration-inducing effect of each lipid fraction was determined after back-addition to serum-free or charcoal-treated MG63CM in the agarose drop assay. Only the lipid fraction termed L1 (Fig. 3 and lane 11, Fig. 4A) restored migration of MCF-7 cells to 85% of the value obtained with MG63CM.Fig. 4HPTLC analysis of the lipid fraction L1 from MG63-conditioned medium. Lipids were isolated by partitioning with organic solvent from MG63CM and separated by HPTLC in CHCl3/CH3COOH (9:1, by volume (A)) or CHCl3/CH3OH (95:5, by volume (B)). A, fractions co-migrating with stained bands (cupric acetate reagent) were scraped off the HPTLC plate, eluted from the silica gel, and analyzed for their migration-inducing effect on MCF-7 cells. Lane 11 shows lipid fraction L1 that was found to induce migration (see Fig. 3). Lane 1, standard gangliosides; lanes 2 and 3, standard neutral glycolipids; lane 4, sphingomyelin; lane 5, dihydrosphingosine and dimethylsphingosine; lane 6, phosphatidic acid; lane 7, sphingosine 1-phosphate; lane 8, fatty acids; lane 9, cholesterol; lane 10, lipid extract from MG63-conditioned medium (MG63CM); lane 11, lipid fraction L1 from MG63CM. B, oxysterol and cholesterol species from MG63CM were visualized with ammonium molybdate reagent and quantified by comparison to the staining intensity obtained with known OS (25-hydroxycholesterol) concentrations in serum-free medium.

The respective mass peaks were also found with prostaglandin, cholesterol, or OS standards, suggesting that these compounds were present in L1. The biologically active prostaglandins PGE2 (0.5 μm), PGB2 (0.5 μm), and PGD2 (0.5 μm, not shown) or their precursor arachidonic acid (30 μm), however, did not induce migration of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6). These results were consistent with the observation that incubation of MG63 or MCF-7 cells with 200 μm cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylic acid did not reduce migration that was induced by MG63CM (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Effects of prostaglandins on migration of MCF-7 cells. Agarose-embedded MCF-7 cells were incubated with or without prostaglandin PGB2, PGE2, arachidonic acid, or acetyl salicylic acid. 100% migration has been calculated from serum-incubated cells as described in the legend for Fig. 2.

PGB 2/E 2, prostaglandins B2/E2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A mass peak at 425 indicated the presence of the sodium salt of OS in L1. The concentration of OS extracted from MG63CM was quantified by comparison to the mass peak (not shown) or staining intensity of 25-hydroxycholesterol, a biologically active OS species that was added to serum-free medium at different concentrations and then re-extracted with organic solvent for mass spectrometry and quantitative HPTLC (Fig. 4B). The OS concentration in MG63CM was 0.8 ± 0.2 μm. The exact structure of the hydroxylated cholesterol was not determined yet. A migration assay, however, showed that 1–10 μm 25-hydroxycholesterol in serum-free medium restored migration of MCF-7 cells to 100% that of the value obtained with MG63CM (Fig. 3). The significance of OS as a migration-inducing factor in L1 was verified by incubation of MG63 cells with mevinolin, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis. Mevinolin incubation resulted in the disappearance of the 425 mass peak in the L1 fraction (Fig. 5B). Consistently, the L1 fraction from mevinolin-treated MG63 cells (MG63CM L1 mevinolin-treated) did not induce migration of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3). We also tested for the migration-inducing effect of cholesterol following a procedure that has previously been reported to induce lamellipodia protrusion and migration in MCF-7 cells (8Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Lacalle R.A. Keller P. Labrador J.P. Martinez-A C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6211-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, we were not able to detect a direct effect of cholesterol added to serum-free medium on cell migration of agarose-embedded MCF-7 cells (not shown). IGF-1 Elevates the Expression of ORP7 in MCF-7 Cells—To identify a potential alteration of proteins by incubation with OS we determined the protein expression patterns in migrating MCF-7 cells that were incubated with IGF-1, serum, or MG63CM. As shown in Fig. 7, protein was extracted from cells that migrated out of the agarose drop and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Coomassie-stained protein fractions between 40 and 90 kDa were cut out of the gel and digested with trypsin, and the tryptic fragments were analyzed by mass spectrometry. As shown in Table I, of 17 tryptic fragments from a 85-kDa protein fraction 8 could be assigned to ORP7 and 9 to heat shock 70-kDa protein 8 isoform 1 (HSP8). This fingerprint was only found when MCF-7 cells were incubated with serum or IGF-1 (Fig. 7A) but not without serum or with MG63CM (Fig. 7B). In addi"
https://openalex.org/W2105265676,"Cadherins comprise a superfamily of calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules. Within the superfamily are six subfamilies including type I and type II cadherins. Both type I and type II cadherins are composed of five extracellular repeat domains with conserved calcium-binding motifs, a single pass transmembrane domain, and a highly conserved cytoplasmic domain that interacts with β-catenin and p120 catenin. In this study, we describe a novel cadherin, cadherin-24. It is a type II cadherin with a 781-codon open reading frame, which encodes a type II cadherin protein complete with five extracellular repeats containing calcium-binding motifs, a transmembrane domain, and a conserved cytoplasmic domain. Cadherin-24 has the unusual feature of being alternatively spliced in extracellular repeat 4. This alternative exon encodes 38 in-frame amino acids, resulting in an 819-amino-acid protein. Sequence analysis suggests the presence of β-catenin and p120 catenin-binding sequences, and immunoprecipitation experiments confirm the ability of both forms of the novel cadherin to associate with α-catenin, β-catenin, and p120 catenin. In addition, aggregation assays show that both forms of cadherin-24 mediate strong cell-cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2071025990,"Two homologous Δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerases from Comamonas testosteroni (TI-WT) and Pseudomonas putida biotype B (PI-WT) exhibit different pH activity profiles. TI-WT loses activity below pH 5.0 due to the protonation of the conserved catalytic base, Asp-38, while PI-WT does not. Based on the structural analysis of PI-WT, the critical catalytic base, Asp-38, was found to form a hydrogen bond with the indole ring NH of Trp-116, which is homologously replaced with Phe-116 in TI-WT. To investigate the role of Trp-116, we prepared the F116W mutant of TI-WT (TI-F116W) and the W116F mutant of PI-WT (PI-W116F) and compared kinetic parameters of those mutants at different pH levels. PI-W116F exhibited significantly decreased catalytic activity at acidic pH like TI-WT, whereas TI-F116W maintained catalytic activity at acidic pH like PI-WT and increased the k cat/K m value by 2.5- to 4.7-fold compared with TI-WT at pH 3.8. The crystal structure of TI-F116W clearly showed that the indole ring NH of Trp-116 could form a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl oxygen of Asp-38 like that of PI-WT. The present results demonstrate that the activities of both PI-WT and TI-F116W at low pH were maintained by a tryptophan, which was able not only to lower the pK a value of the catalytic base but also to increase the substrate affinity. This is one example of the strategy nature can adopt to evolve the diversity of the catalytic function in the enzymes. Our results provide insight into deciphering the molecular evolution of the enzyme and creating novel enzymes by protein engineering.

Our results provide insight into deciphering the molecular evolution of the enzyme and creating novel enzymes by protein engineering. Isozymes carry out the same enzymatic reaction yet exhibit different properties such as substrate affinity, preference of different coenzyme, stability, optimal pH, etc. Even if the sequence differences of those isozymes are evident, the origin of different properties is mostly not clear at the molecular level. Identification of functional divergence on the mechanistic basis is important to understand how the enzyme as a molecular machine can be evolved in the biological system and to rationally modify the enzyme function with desired physical and catalytic properties (1Chen R. Trends. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 13-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the post-genomic era, protein sequences and high resolution protein structures are being accumulated rapidly, but the remarkable catalytic mechanism of enzymes as well as the catalytic strategies utilized by nature to evolve new catalytic functions remain to be understood at the molecular level (2Gerlt J.A. Babbitt P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 209-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The understanding of the structural basis for different properties of isozymes and their catalytic diversity could provide the insights into not only discovering the properties of the enzymes from their protein sequences or structural data but also creating novel enzymes by protein engineering.

Although KSIs from two different bacterial sources, Comamonas testosteroni and Pseudomonas putida biotype B, share only 34% sequence identity, the catalytic residues Tyr-14, Asp-38, and Asp-99 (the residues are numbered according to C. testosteroni KSI) are well conserved in the two isomerases (9Kim S.W. Joo S. Choi G. Cho H.-S. Oh B.-H. Choi K.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7742-7747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kim S.W. Choi K.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2602-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the overall three-dimensional structures are remarkably similar to each other, indicating that the two KSIs can share the same catalytic mechanism (11Cho H.-S. Choi G. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8325-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Wu Z.R. Ebrahimian S. Zawrotny M.E. Thornburg L.D. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Brothers P. Pollack R.M. Summers M.F.

In KSIs, Asp-38 acts as the only catalytic base to abstract a proton from C-4 of the steroid substrate and to transfer the proton to the C-6 position for the allylic rearrangement of Δ5-3-ketosteroids (3Pollack R.M. Thornburg L.D. Wu Z.R. Summers M.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Ha N.-C. Choi G. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). KSI from P. putida (PI-WT) was reported to exhibit different dependence of V max and K m on pH compared with that from C. testosteroni (TI-WT) (15Smith S.B. Richards J.W. Benisek W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2685-2689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The V max value of PI-WT was not so sensitive to pH as that of TI-WT, which had been observed before (15Smith S.B. Richards J.W. Benisek W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2685-2689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Weintraub H. Alfsen A. Baulieu E.-E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The pH-rate profiles for k cat and k cat/K m were extensively investigated for TI-WT (17Pollack R.M. Bantia S. Bounds P.L. Koffman B.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1905-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The pK a of the catalytically important group on the free enzyme (pK E) was determined to be 4.57 utilizing a nonsticky substrate, 5,10-estrene-3,17-dione (17Pollack R.M. Bantia S. Bounds P.L. Koffman B.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1905-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of TI-WT is supposed to decrease abruptly below pH 5.0 due to the protonation of the catalytic base, Asp-38. The pK a values of catalytic residues can be affected by the local microenvironment of the active site in the enzyme (18Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999: 169-189Google Scholar). The environment of Asp-38 in TI-WT is very similar to that in PI-WT as judged by crystallographic data of both wild-type enzymes (11Cho H.-S. Choi G. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8325-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Kim S.W. Cha S.-S. Cho H.-S. Kim J.-S. Ha N.-C. Cho M.-J. Joo S. Kim K.K. Choi K.Y. Oh B.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, there is a significant difference in that the carboxyl oxygen of Asp-38 is hydrogen-bonded to NH on the indole ring of Trp-116 only in PI-WT (Fig. 1B). Trp-116 in PI-WT is homologously replaced with Phe-116 in TI-WT (Fig. 1C). The different electrostatic environments around the catalytic bases in TI-WT and PI-WT could affect the pK a of Asp-38, resulting in different pK E values of two homologous KSIs. To investigate the role of Trp-116 in PI-WT, we have prepared the F116W mutant of TI-WT (TI-F116W) and the W116F mutant of PI-WT (PI-W116F), and compared their kinetic parameters at various pHs, respectively. The crystal structure of TI-F116W determined at 2.0-Å resolution exhibited that the indole ring NH of Trp-116 could form a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl oxygen of Asp-38. Our kinetic and structural results demonstrate that different pH activity profiles in the two KSIs originate from a single hydrogen bond between Trp-116 and Asp-38 and that Trp-116 also contributes to the better binding of the hydrophobic steroid substrate to compensate for the lowered basicity of the catalytic residue. Materials—5-Androstene-3,17-dione (5-AND), and 5,10-estrene-3,17-dione (5,10-EST) were purchased from Steraloids. Chemicals for buffer solutions were from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were from Genotech Inc., Korea. A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was supplied by Stratagene. pKK223-3 plasmid was from Amersham Biosciences. Superose 12 gel filtration column was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Mutagenesis—Phe-116 of TI-WT was replaced with a tryptophan to make TI-F116W. TI-F116W was prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and a thermocycler (Minicycler, MJ Research). pKSI-TI was used as the DNA template (11Cho H.-S. Choi G. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8325-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two primers were designed to introduce the F116W mutation into the KSI gene of C. testosteroni. A forward primer was 5′-AGC ATG CGC GCC TTG TGG GGC GAG AAG AAT ATT-3′ and a reverse primer was 5′-AAT ATT CTT CTC GCC CCA CAA GGC GCG CAT GCT-3′; underlined nucleotides represent the ones changed by point mutations. Recombinant plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene) and purified by use of QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). The entire KSI gene was then sequenced to confirm the intended mutation only without the change of other sequences in the KSI gene. The W116F mutation of PI-WT was described previously (20Kim D.-H. Nam G.H. Jang D.S. Choi G. Joo S. Kim J.-S. Oh B.-H. Choi K.Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13810-13819Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of KSI Proteins—The protein was overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) utilizing the pKK223-3 plasmid containing the wild-type or mutant KSI gene and purified by deoxycholate affinity chromatography and Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography as described previously (21Choi G. Ha N.-C. Kim S.W. Kim D.-H. Park S. Oh B.-H. Choi K.Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purity of the protein was confirmed by a single band on SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration was determined utilizing the difference extinction coefficient between tyrosinate and tyrosine at 295 nm as described previously (22Copeland R.A. Methods of Protein Analysis. Chapman and Hall, New York1993: 51-54Google Scholar). The accuracy of the protein concentration was confirmed by the quantitative analysis of the band on SDS-PAGE by use of an imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad, GS-700) and a software program provided by its manufacturer (Molecular Analyst/PC). Steady-state Kinetic Analysis—The catalytic activities of the purified KSIs were determined spectrophotometrically using 5-AND as a substrate according to the procedure described previously (21Choi G. Ha N.-C. Kim S.W. Kim D.-H. Park S. Oh B.-H. Choi K.Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Various amounts of the substrate were added to a reaction buffer containing 34 mm potassium phosphate and 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, at 25 °C. The concentration of 5-AND was 12, 35, 58, 82, and 116 μm, respectively. The final concentration of methanol was 3.3 vol%. The initial reaction rate was obtained within 1 or 2 min after the initiation of the enzymatic reaction. The fraction of the substrate converted to the product was below 10% of the substrate applied to the reaction mixture. The reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 248 nm, using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2501 PC). Kinetic data were analyzed by use of Lineweaver-Burk reciprocal plots to obtain k cat and K m. pH Activity Profiles—All the buffers used to determine the kinetic constants contained 80 mm NaCl to adjust the ionic strength of the solution. The buffer solution contained 20 mm sodium acetate for pH 3.8–4.9, 20 mm sodium MES for pH 5.2–6.3, or 20 mm potassium phosphate for pH 6.6–8.0. The procedures for obtaining kinetic parameters were the same as those for the steady-state kinetic analysis as described above. The stability of the enzyme was confirmed by determining the catalytic activity at pH 7.0 after incubating the enzyme in the respective assay buffer for 2 min. The observed kinetic parameters were fitted to Equations 1 and 2 to obtain the pK E and pK ES values, respectively, by nonlinear least-squares analysis utilizing a computer program (Abelbeck Software, Kaleidagraph version 3.06). (kcat/KM)obs=(kcat/KM)/(1+[H+]/KE)(Eq. 1) (kcat)obs=(kcat)/(1+[H+]/KES)(Eq. 2) To obtain the pK E and pK ES values of TI-WT, TI-F116W, and PI-WT from the pH activity profile, a nonsticky substrate, 5,10-EST, was used as described previously (17Pollack R.M. Bantia S. Bounds P.L. Koffman B.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1905-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similarly, the pK E and pK ES values of PI-W116F were obtained using 5-AND, which can be considered a nonsticky substrate, because its k cat/K m values are at least one order of magnitude smaller than that for PI-WT as described previously (23Thornburg L.D. Henot F. Bash D.P. Hawkinson D.C. Bartel S.D. Pollack R.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10499-10506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To compare the kinetic parameters of TI-WT and TI-F116W, both 5,10-EST and 5-AND were used. The plot of (k cat/K m)obs versus pH was utilized to determine pK a for the free enzymes (pK E) and the plot of (k cat)obs versus pH to determine pK a for the enzyme-substrate complexes (pK ES) (18Fersht A.

Crystallization and Structure Determination—The crystal of TI-F116W was grown at 25 °C from a solution containing 4% polyethylene glycol 400, 1.6 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, by the hanging-drop method as described previously (11Cho H.-S. Choi G. Choi K.Y. Oh B.-H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8325-8330Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The crystal was briefly immersed in the same solution containing 15% glycerol. Then the crystal was flash-cooled in the stream of cooled nitrogen gas (100 K) prior to x-ray data collection. Diffraction data were obtained by using an R-AXIS IV++ image plate with a rotating anode generator (Rigaku, RU300). The crystal belongs to the space group P3 (1Chen R. Trends. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 13-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with unit cell dimensions of a = 71.525, b = 71.525, c = 103.340 Å, and γ = 120°. Data reduction, merging, and scaling were carried out by use of the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK, as described previously (25Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). The structure was determined by using a molecular replacement program, AMORE, utilizing the atomic coordinates of TI-WT (PDB code 8CHO). Further refinement was carried out by use of the program CNS as described previously (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopic Analysis—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the enzymes were obtained with a spectropolarimeter (Jasco, 715) equipped with a Peltier-type temperature controller (Jasco, PTC-348WI), using a quartz cuvette with 0.2-cm path length. The wild-type and mutant enzymes at 10 μm were preincubated at 25 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium acetate for pH 3.8, 4.2, and 5.0, 20 mm sodium MES for pH 6.0, or 20 mm potassium phosphate for pH 7.2. Scans were collected at 0.1-nm intervals with 1-nm bandwidth and accumulated three to five times. Each spectrum was corrected by subtracting the spectrum of the solution containing the used buffer and smoothened by use of a software program provided by the manufacturer of the spectropolarimeter. Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Native PAGE was carried out as described previously with a slight modification (23Thornburg L.D. Henot F. Bash D.P. Hawkinson D.C. Bartel S.D. Pollack R.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10499-10506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24Langsetmo K. Fuchs J.A. Woodward C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7603-7609Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant enzymes were subjected to electrophoresis in 8% polyacrylamide gels in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.3, or 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C to keep the gel from being overheated by high voltage. During the electrophoresis, the tray buffer was circulated between two reservoirs to maintain constant pH. Each gel was pre-run at 150 V for 1 h, after which 1.0–2.0 μg of the protein in the respective buffer solution containing 10% glycerol and 0.003% bromphenol blue was loaded on the gel and run at 100 V. Kinetic Parameters—k cat and K m values of TI-F116W and PI-W116F were compared with those of their respective wild-type enzyme (Table I). The k cat values of TI-F116W and PI-W116F were lower than those of TI-WT and PI-WT by 4.42- and 4.46-fold, respectively. The K m value of PI-W116F was higher than that of PI-WT by 2.98-fold, whereas the K m value of TI-F116W was lower than that of TI-WT by 3.14-fold. TI-F116W exhibited the k cat/K m value nearly comparable to that of the wild-type, because both K m and k cat values were decreased simultaneously at pH 7.0.Table IKinetic parameters of WT and mutant KSIsEnzymekcatKMk cat/KMpKEpKESS-1μMM-1s-1PI-WT21230 ± 810aData from Kim et al.

Open table in a new tab pH Activity Profiles—To estimate the pK a values of the catalytic base in two KSIs, kinetic parameters were determined at various pHs (Fig. 2). The observed kinetic parameters, which were fitted to Equations 1 and 2 to obtain the pK E and pK ES values, respectively, are listed in Table I. The pK E values of TI-WT were consistent with the previous results for two substrates, 5-AND and 5,10-EST (17Pollack R.M. Bantia S. Bounds P.L. Koffman B.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1905-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The pK E value in TI-F116W was decreased by 1.05 pH unit relative to that of TI-WT. At pH 3.8, the k cat/K m value of TI-F116W was increased by 2.5-fold and by 4.7-fold for two substrates, 5,10-EST and 5-AND, respectively, compared with that of TI-WT. The apparent pK a values of Asp-38 in PI-WT and in PI-W116F were estimated to be 3.75 and 5.00, respectively, with a significant decrease of catalytic activity at low pH in PI-W116F (Fig. 2). Structural Analysis of TI-F116W—To identify a hydrogen bond formed by the indole ring NH of Trp-116 in TI-F116W, the crystal structure of TI-F116W was determined at 2.0-Å resolution. The statistics of the crystallographic data and refinement are summarized in Table II. No significant structural changes were observed in the mutant KSI compared with TI-WT. The structure of TI-F116W exhibited that the carboxyl oxygen of Asp-38 could form a hydrogen bond with the indole ring NH of Trp-116, and the distance between Asp-38 Oδ1 and Trp-116 Nϵ1 was measured to be 2.87 Å. Structural comparison of PI-WT, TI-WT, and TI-F116W indicated clearly that the hydrogen bond formed by the indole ring NH of tryptophan with the carboxyl oxygen of the catalytic base was the only difference of the environment around Asp-38 between two wild-type KSIs, and between TI-WT and TI-F116W (Fig. 3). For simulated annealing omit map, the structure was disturbed at 1000 K at an initial refinement stage when the residues, Trp-116 and Asp-38, were omitted. The electron density map was then calculated with the omission. Trp-116 and Asp-38 exhibited clear electron densities, supporting that the indole ring NH of Trp-116 can form a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of Asp-38 (Fig. 4).Table IICrystallographic data and refinement statistics for TI-F116WResolution (A)2.0R sym (%)6.0Data completeness, F> 1 δ (%)91.8R standard (%)22.88R free (%)28.24No. of refined atoms (atom/water)4161/377Average B factor21.454r.m.s.d. bond length (Å)ar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.0.005970r.m.s.d. bond angles (deg)1.16570Ramachandran plot (%)Most favored regions90.8Additional allowed regions8.3Generously allowed regions0.9Disallowed regions0.0a r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.

CD spectra were obtained between 200 and 250 nm to estimate the content of the secondary structure in the protein. TI-WT and TI-F116W exhibited similar spectra in the pH range from 3.8 to 7.2, respectively, whereas the spectra of PI-WT and PI-W116F were marginally changed below pH 5.0, indicating that there were no significant structural changes over the pH range from 3.8 to 7.2 in all different forms of KSI. Native PAGE—The ionization state of the catalytic base in the two KSIs can affect the overall charge of the enzyme, because the catalytic base, Asp-38, is located in the boundary between the cavity of the hydrophobic active site and the solvent (Fig. 1). Mobilities of PI-WT, PI-W116F, TI-WT, and TI-F116W in the gel electrophoresis were compared at two different pHs, 4.3 and 7.3 (Fig. 6). PI-WT and PI-W116F had the same mobility at pH 7.3, whereas PI-W116F migrated more slowly than PI-WT toward the anode at pH 4.3. TI-WT and TI-F116W also had the same mobility at pH 7.3, whereas TI-WT migrated more slowly than TI-F116W toward the anode at pH 4.3, indicating that TI-WT and PI-W116F have less effective negative charges than TI-F116W and PI-WT, because the carboxylic group of Asp-38 in those KSIs could be protonated at pH 4.3. The analyses of pH activity profiles and crystallographic structures at high resolution for the wild-type and mutant forms of two homologous KSIs from two different bacterial sources allowed us to identify the role of Trp-116, including a hydrogen bond formed by the indole ring NH with the catalytic base, Asp-38, in PI-WT. A different environment around Asp-38 was found to be the origin of the different pH activity profiles of the two KSIs. The carboxylate ion could be destabilized in a relatively hydrophobic region of the active sites in TI-WT and PI-W116F, resulting in the increase of the pK a value of Asp-38. In contrast, the pK a values of Asp-38 in PI-WT and TI-F116W could be decreased, because the carboxylate ion in Asp-38 was stabilized by a hydrogen bond with Trp-116 (Fig. 7). Considering the different environment of the critical catalytic base, Asp-38, in two KSIs, the low pK E value of PI-WT can be attributed to a hydrogen bond between the carboxylate of Asp-38 and the indole ring NH of Trp-116. The replacement of Trp-116 with a phenylalanine in PI-WT to mimic the active-site environment of TI-WT resulted in a significant decrease of the catalytic activity at low pH, and the W116F mutation increased the pK E value by 1.25 relative to that of PI-WT. The increase of pK E in PI-W116F is due to the pK a increase of Asp-38, because the hydrogen bond between Trp-116 and the carboxylate of Asp-38 could not be formed. The low mobility of PI-W116F on native PAGE is the evidence for the protonated state of Asp-38 at pH 4.3, because the apparent pK a value of Asp-38 was kinetically estimated to be 5.0 in PI-W116F. The far-UV CD spectra of PI-WT and PI-W116F between 200 and 250 nm were almost indistinguishable at low pH, indicating that the enzymes did not undergo any significant conformational change at low pH. Therefore, the decreased activity of PI-W116F at low pH originates not from any structural change of the protein, but from the protonation of the catalytic base. TI-F116W was prepared to confirm that a hydrogen bond between Trp-116 and Asp-38 could compensate for the decreased activity of TI-WT at low pH by stabilizing the ionization state of the catalytic base, Asp-38. As expected, TI-F116W exhibited no decrease of catalytic activity at low pH and increase of k cat/K m by 4.7- and 2.5-fold compared with TI-WT when 5-AND and 5,10-EST were used as substrates at pH 3.8, respectively. As shown in the crystal structure of TI-F116W, a hydrogen bond can be formed by the indole ring NH of Trp-116 with a carboxyl oxygen of Asp-38 (Fig. 3). The hydrogen bond could cause the pK a value of Asp-38 to be decreased in TI-F116W. The lower mobility of TI-WT relative to TI-F116W on native PAGE at pH 4.3 was also consistent with the pK a values estimated kinetically, reflecting the change of ionization state of the critical catalytic base, Asp-38. The far-UV CD spectra of TI-WT and TI-F116W showed almost identical patterns in the pH range from 3.8 to 7.2, indicating that any significant conformational change over the pH range did not take place. Hence, the low activity of TI-WT at low pH is not from the structural change but from the protonation of the catalytic base, Asp-38. The importance of the indole ring NH of tryptophan was previously suggested in its interaction with other residues in the protein (29Ippolito J.A. Alexander R.S. Christianson D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 30Samanta U. Pal D. Chakrabarti P. Proteins. 2000; 38: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Tryptophan can have characteristics of both hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity due to the amphipathic property, which originates from the indole ring in its side chain (30Samanta U. Pal D. Chakrabarti P. Proteins. 2000; 38: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The amphipathic characteristic of tryptophan plays two different roles in the catalysis of KSIs. One role of tryptophan is that the bulky hydrophobic indole ring contributes to the better binding of the hydrophobic substrate like steroids. Compared with TI-WT and PI-W116F, PI-WT and TI-F116W have relatively lower K m values for the hydrophobic steroid substrate (Table I). This notion that Trp-116 contributes to the favorable binding of the steroid is consistent with the previous result in the characterization of PI-W116F (20Kim D.-H. Nam G.H. Jang D.S. Choi G. Joo S. Kim J.-S. Oh B.-H. Choi K.Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13810-13819Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The other role of tryptophan is the stabilization of ionized state of the catalytic base residue, Asp-38, at low pH in the hydrophobic active site of KSI, due to a hydrogen bond between Trp-116 and Asp-38. Although the hydrogen bond could decrease the basicity of Asp-38, this adverse effect for catalytic activity could be overcome by the increased binding affinity to the substrate. The alteration of pH activity profiles by changing the pK a value of a catalytic base in an enzyme has been observed previously (31Spomer W.E. Wootton J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 235: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Russell A.J. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 33Russell A.J. Thomas P.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The pK a value of the active site histidine was raised by 0.2 pH unit by acetylation of all surface lysines in trypsin (31Spomer W.E. Wootton J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 235: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Shifted pH activity profiles and higher catalytic activity were obtained by changing the surface charge of subtilisin using site-directed mutagenesis (32Russell A.J. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The pK a value of His-64 in the active site of subtilisin was lowered by 0.4 unit at low ionic strength in the range of 0.005–0.01 m by the removal of one surface carboxylate (33Russell A.J. Thomas P.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The lowering of the pK a by employing the change of the surface charge is dependent basically on the long range macroscopic electrostatic interaction, which requires a specific condition of low ionic strength to unmask electrostatic interaction (32Russell A.J. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). During evolution, enzymes may utilize a long-range electrostatic interaction to regulate the pK a value of the catalytic residue. However, the low ionic condition to unmask the electrostatic interaction may not be allowed in the biological system. In both intracellular and extracellular environments of a typical mammalian cell, the ion concentration can be higher than 0.1 m (34Albert, B., Bray, D., Lewis, J., Raff, M., Roberts, K., and Watson, J. D. Molecular Biology of the Cell, pp. 507–549, 3rd Ed., Garland Publishing, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar), and total ion concentration of the bacterial cell was reported to be comparable to that of the mammalian cell (35Albert, B., Bray, D., Lewis, J., Raff, M., Roberts, K., and Watson, J. D. Molecular Biology of the Cell, pp 89–90, 3rd Ed., Garland Publishing, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). The direct regulation by use of the neighboring residue could be more effective than the indirect regulation through the long range electrostatic interaction in the aspect that it is relatively independent of ionic strength of the solution. In this study, we demonstrated that the alteration of the pK a value of the catalytic residue in a mutant with higher activity than the wild-type enzyme at low pH could be achieved not by changing surface charge but by directly changing the microscopic active-site environment of the catalytic residue utilizing a single hydrogen bond. In summary, based on comparative studies using two homologous KSIs on the role of a tryptophan, we demonstrated that tryptophan could alter the pH activity profile by both forming the hydrogen bond with the catalytic base and increasing simultaneously the substrate affinity. PI-WT could employ a kind of a protective strategy to stabilize the deprotonation state of a catalytic base, which can play a critical role as a base catalyst at low pH. This strategy is based on the fine regulation of pK a of the catalytic base with minimizing a loss of the catalytic activity by increasing the substrate affinity. The enzyme can adapt to the environment to maintain catalytic activity at low pH, independent of external biological buffer during evolution. We assume that this strategy can be found in other enzymes and applied to the alteration of pH activity profile by protein engineering.

It has been assigned several cellular functions, including protection against oxidative damage, maintenance of a reducing cellular thiol-disulfide balance, electron donation for a number of enzymes, protection of protein sulfhydryls from irreversible oxidation, and detoxification of foreign compounds (1Meister A.

Glutathione is synthesized enzymatically from its constituent amino acids in two consecutive reactions. Glutathione synthetase (EC 6.3.2.3) catalyzes the second step, the addition of glycine to γ-glutamylcysteine. In most eucaryotic organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Homo sapiens, and Rattus norvegicus, glutathione synthetase is a 104-112-kDa homodimer composed of two identical 52-56-kDa subunits (4Mooz E.D.

A. 1995; 92: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, the structure of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe enzyme has not been completely elucidated. The enzyme was purified as a 120-kDa heterotetramer consisting of two kinds of subunits, called the “small” and “large” subunits, with apparent molecular masses of 26 and 33 kDa (11Nakagawa C.W. Mutoh N. Hayashi Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). While the gene encoding the 26-kDa subunit was unknown, the gene encoding the 33-kDa subunit, GSH2, had been cloned, and the coding region had been assigned to the 3′ end (12Mutoh N. Nakagawa C.W. Ando S. Tanabe K. Hayashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When the GSH2 gene was re-sequenced at a later date, however, frameshift errors in the original sequence were identified (13Wang C.L. Oliver D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 14Al-Lahham A. Rohde V. Heim P. Leuchter R. Veeck J. Wunderlich C. Wolf K. Zimmermann M. Yeast. 1999; 15: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These errors resulted in a shortened open reading frame, downstream from the correct start codon. A protein derived from the full-length GSH2 gene would have a molecular mass of 56 kDa, and BLAST searches showed that this protein is homologous to the glutathione synthetase proteins of other eucaryotic organisms. Wang and Oliver (13Wang C.L. Oliver D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) proposed that the 56-kDa protein was the primary translation product, from which the subunits could be derived by proteolysis. Here we report the homologous expression and purification of a histidine-tagged form of the fission yeast glutathione synthetase. We show that a 56-kDa protein corresponding to the whole open reading frame is indeed formed. Proteolytic cleavage then yields the small subunit, the 24-kDa N-terminal fragment, and the large subunit, the 32-kDa C-terminal fragment of this protein. Moreover, a model of the tertiary and quaternary structure of the fission yeast glutathione synthetase was generated, based on the structure of the human ortholog. On the basis of these results, in vitro mutagenesis experiments were performed to shed light on the subunit structure of the enzyme. The mutated recombinant proteins were expressed and affinity purified; in vivo as well as in vitro activities were determined. Our experiments provided novel data relating to folding and evolution of glutathione synthetase. Materials—The chemicals used were of molecular biology grade or pro analysi grade. DNA Methods—Standard molecular biology techniques were used for DNA isolation, analysis, and cloning (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Bacterial Strain and Cultivation—Escherichia coli DH5α was used for all DNA cloning experiments. Bacteria were grown in LB medium or LB medium containing 125 μg/ml ampicillin. Transformation and plasmid isolation were carried out according to standard methods (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The different forms of glutathione synthetase were expressed in a mutant strain of S. pombe (ΔGSH2), in which a central 479-bp region of the GSH2 gene (nucleotides 282-761) was deleted (17Wunderlich, C.

Ph.D. thesis, Institut für Biologie IV (Mikrobiologie), Aachen University, Aachen, GermanyGoogle Scholar). The mutation was considered stable, because no reversions were observed. No functional glutathione synthetase was produced in this strain, so functional testing of the different proteins was possible. The S. pombe wild type strain D18h- (ura-) was transformed, respectively, with the plasmids pREP2-gsh2:hft (Table I, part C) and pREP2-gsh2-D15:hft (Table I, part C). The resulting recombinant strains were crossed with strain 46a14h+ (ΔGSH2, geneticinr, ura-), producing strains 46a14h- pREP2-gsh2:hft (ΔGSH2, geneticinr, ura+) and 46a14h- pREP2-gsh2-D15:hft (ΔGSH2, geneticinr, ura+) respectively. Strain 46a14h+ (ΔGSH2, geneticinr, ura-) was a segregant of the strains 46a14h- (ΔGSH2, geneticinr, ura-) and D18h+ (ura-). The fission yeast strain 46leu/42 (ΔGSH2, geneticinr, ura-, leu-) was generated as a segregant of the strains 46a14h+ (ΔGSH2, geneticinr, ura-) and leu1-32h- (leu-). This strain was transformed with the plasmids pREP2-GUgsh2:hft (Table I, part C) and pREP1-hft:KUgsh2 (Table I, part C) to express the regions of the putative large and small subunit of glutathione synthetase separately and with plasmid pREP2-Sp-GSH2-perm (Table I, part C) to express the permuted enzyme. Cells were grown at 28 °C in Edinburgh minimal medium (18Hochstenbach, F. (1997) Fission Yeast Handbook (www.bio.uva.nl/pombe/handbook)Google Scholar). Microbiological Methods—Standard techniques were applied for yeast transformation, crosses, the plasmid loss test, and other microbiological methods (18Hochstenbach, F.

Physiological Tests—For heavy metal tolerance tests, the minimal inhibitory concentration of cadmium was determined using Edinburgh minimal medium containing different concentrations of CdCl2. GSH and phytochelatin concentrations were determined by RP-HPLC as described previously (20Grill E. Winnacker E.L. Zenk M.H. Science. 1985; 230: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Phytochelatin standards were purchased from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany). Protein Expression and Purification—Cells were grown in 3 × 500 ml minimal medium with gentle shaking at 28 °C for 24 h, harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 1500 × g, GSA rotor, 4 °C), washed twice with distilled water, and lyophilized. Cell disruption was performed in a cell mill using glass beads (3 × 3 min dry; 6 × 3 min with 10 ml of immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) binding buffer/g of lyophilized cells). After centrifugation (30 min, 1500 × g, SS34 rotor, 4 °C) the supernatant was utilized for the following purification procedure, with all steps carried out at 4 °C. For IMAC chelating Sepharose fast flow was loaded with nickel as indicated by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). After applying the cell extract to the column and washing with IMAC binding buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4), the bound proteins were eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration stepwise to 50 mm and then to 100 mm. Glutathione synthetase eluted at an imidazole concentration of 100 mm. For reactive dye affinity chromatography, the sample was adjusted to the appropriate buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.8) by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration chromatography and applied to the column packed with Cibacron blue 3GA-agarose. After a 10-ml wash, elution was carried out by increasing the NaCl concentration to 250 mm. Assay for Glutathione Synthetase—Purified glutathione synthetase was equilibrated to 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2, by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration chromatography. Glutathione synthetase activity was assayed according to Huang et al. (10Huang C.S. He W. Meister A. Anderson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) using γ-glutamylcysteine trifluoroacetate salt (Sigma) as a substrate. One unit of enzyme is defined as the amount that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of product/min. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protease Inhibition Experiments—For protease inhibition experiments the strain 46a14h- pREP2-gsh2:hft expressing the histidine-tagged wild type glutathione synthetase was used. Cell disruption was performed in the presence of different protease inhibitors at the following concentrations (aprotinin, 50 μg/ml; benzamidine HCl, 10 mm; EDTA-Na2, 10 mm; E-64, 5 μg/ml; leupeptin-hemisulfate, 5 μg/ml; pepstatin A, 7 μg/ml; PMSF, 0.5 mm). After cell disruption, the cell extracts were incubated at 4 °C. Samples were taken immediately and after 1, 5, and 21 h of incubation. Histidine-tagged glutathione synthetase was detected by immunoassay after SDS-PAGE and Western blot. SDS-PAGE, Western Blot, and Immunodetection of the Histidine Tag—SDS-PAGE was performed following the method of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using the M12 molecular mass standard (Novex, San Diego, CA). For Western blotting the proteins were electrotransferred, after SDS-PAGE, to a PVDF membrane in CAPS buffer (10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, 15% (v/v) methanol) at 870 mA for 2 h. The prestained marker 7B (Sigma) served as a molecular mass standard. Proteins containing a histidine tag were localized on the PVDF membrane by applying an anti-His6 monoclonal mouse antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase and BM Blue POD substrate (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Native PAGE—For native PAGE, precast gels with a 4-20% acrylamide gradient (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) were used. Native PAGE was performed as described above for SDS-PAGE except SDS was omitted from all buffers. Glycerol, at 25% (v/v), was added to the protein samples before application to the gel. Bovine serum albumin was used as a molecular mass marker. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography was carried out using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column connected to a fast performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). After equilibrating the column with 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20 mm NaCl, the protein sample was applied. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Proteins were detected by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Alcohol dehydrogenase from S. cerevisiae (141 kDa) (Sigma) was used for column calibration. N-terminal Sequencing of the Proteins—After SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and staining with Amido Black, protein bands with molecular masses of 56, 32, and 24 kDa were cut from the membrane and sequenced by the automated Edman degradation method. Sequencing was carried out by the Institute of Enzyme Technology, Forschungszentrum Jülich (Germany). Protein and Peptide Analysis by MALDI-TOF-MS—For the determination of exact molecular masses a purified sample of glutathione synthetase was, after partial cleavage of the 56-kDa protein, dialyzed against water and lyophilized. The residue was dissolved in 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and deposited on a MALDI probe. After evaporation of the solvent the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (20 mg/ml in a solution of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile (2:1 v/v) was added. For peptide analysis, the method described by Jeno et al. (23Jeno P. Mini T. Moes S. Hintermann E. Horst M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was followed. Analysis and sequencing by MALDI-TOF-MS was performed at the German Wool Research Institute, Aachen, Germany. A BRUKER BIFLEX™ III MALDI-TOF-MS equipped with a nitrogen laser was used. Pulses of 3 ns at 337 nm were used at a voltage of 20 kV. About 100 shots were averaged for each acquired spectrum. External calibration was performed with a protein standard (angiotensin II, substance P, ACTH fragment 1-17, ACTH fragment 18-39; Sigma). Molecular Modeling of the Fission Yeast Glutathione Synthetase—The alignment of the amino acid sequences from S. pombe, S. cerevisiae, Pichia angusta, A. thaliana, and H. sapiens was performed with the GCG package (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). As the crystal structure of the fission yeast glutathione synthetase has not yet been determined, homology modeling was used to create a structural model. The crystal structure of the human glutathione synthetase (24Polekhina G. Board P.G. Gali R.R. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3204-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was used as the template. The modeling was performed using the Modeler program under the homology module of Insight II. To simplify the procedure, the full-length 56-kDa form of the S. pombe monomer was analyzed. The template structure of the human protein 2The atomic coordinates for the crystal structure of this protein are available in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank under accession code PDB 2HGS (www.rcsb.org/pdb). was adopted for continuously aligned sequence stretches between the human and the S. pombe proteins. Sequence insertions and deletions were only allowed outside secondary structure elements. Insertions larger than three amino acids were modeled in an extended conformation. Cloning and Expression of the Fission Yeast Glutathione Synthetase—An 18-bp sequence encoding six histidine residues was attached to the C terminus of glutathione synthetase by PCR. The protein was expressed in a ΔGSH2 fission yeast strain under control of the nmt1 promoter using the expression vector pREP2 (25Maundrell K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10857-10864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the plasmid was confirmed by PCR. Plasmid loss tests were performed as a control. Purification of the Fission Yeast Glutathione Synthetase and Subunit Structure of the Enzyme—The histidine-tagged glutathione synthetase was purified to apparent homogeneity in a two-step affinity chromatography procedure. In the first step (IMAC), glutathione synthetase coeluted with other contaminating proteins. These were removed in the second step by reactive dye affinity chromatography (Fig. 1). The purified enzyme produced a single band in a native PAGE gel (Fig. 2). The gel did not allow the accurate determination of the molecular mass. In gel filtration chromatography one protein peak was observed. The observed elution volume was slightly lower than that of S. cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase (141 kDa), the protein used for calibration (data not shown). These results are consistent with the value of 120 kDa reported for the molecular mass of the fission yeast glutathione synthetase by Nakagawa et al. (11Nakagawa C.W. Mutoh N. Hayashi Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In SDS-PAGE a strong band of about 56 kDa and two faint bands of about 32 and 24 kDa were visible immediately after purification (Fig. 1). The 56- and 32-kDa proteins contained the C-terminal His6-tag, which was identified by Western blot and immunodetection using a monoclonal anti-His6 antibody (data not shown). Upon prolonged storage of the protein (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20 mm NaCl, 4 °C); however, the 56-kDa band faded, while the other two bands became more intense. The 56-kDa protein was completely cleaved to the 32- and 24-kDa proteins when partially purified by IMAC and kept at 4 °C for 4 weeks (Fig. 1). However, the 56-kDa protein was still present in fractions of the protein purified by IMAC and reactive dye affinity chromatography in which no contaminating proteins were detectable by SDS-PAGE after storage for more than 6 months under the conditions given above (data not shown). The N-terminal sequence of the 32-kDa protein was identified as “SDNTKPIVLF” by Edman degradation. This truncated protein starts with the serine residue at position 218 and not with the methionine residue at position 214, as previously assumed (12Mutoh N. Nakagawa C.W. Ando S. Tanabe K. Hayashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The 56-kDa protein and the 24-kDa protein were N-terminally blocked. Tryptic Digestion and Peptide Analysis of the 24-kDa Protein—Because the N terminus of the 24-kDa protein was blocked, this protein was further investigated by analysis of the fragments obtained after tryptic digestion by MALDI-TOF-MS. Molecular masses between 400.0 and 2900.0 Da could be detected by the parameter file employed for MALDI-TOF-MS. Nineteen fragments theoretically arising from tryptic digestion of the N-terminal region (residues 1-218) of the 56-kDa protein are within this molecular mass range. Eleven of these fragments were recorded (Table II).Table IIProtein fragment identification by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis after tryptic digestion of the 24-kDa subfragmentMass(experimental)PositionPeptide sequenceMass (calculated)DeviationDaDa%939.685-92LHLQSITK939.50.011946.493-99YDEFMNK946.30.011964.5100-106LWNLYQK964.40.0101140.676-84IANDYEFLR1140.50.0091306.76-16YTPEQIEELGK1306.40.0231534.8116-128ENQFQPLSLGVFR1534.50.0201590.56-19YTPEQIEELGK-GARaFragments detected as larger peptides (due to one miscleavage).1590.8−0.0191698.9144-159QVEFNTISVSFGGVSK1698.50.0241768.8160-175AVSNLHAYCSQSGLYR1768.60.0111853.920-36DFAFAHGVVFTELSVSK1853.70.0112196.820-39DFAFAHGVVFTELSVSK-EGRaFragments detected as larger peptides (due to one miscleavage).2196.10.032a Fragments detected as larger peptides (due to one miscleavage). Open table in a new tab The 1140.5-Da fragment (residues 76-84) was sequenced and the expected sequence “IANDYEFLR” was found. Thus, MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of the tryptic peptides derived from the 24-kDa subfragment provided further evidence that this protein was derived from the 5′ region of the GSH2 gene. (Fig. 3) shows a schematic diagram of the regions of the GSH2 gene. Amino Acid Sequence of the Fission Yeast Glutathione Synthetase in Comparison with Other Eucaryotic Organisms and Molecular Modeling of the Structure of the Fission Yeast Enzyme—The sequences of the fission yeast glutathione synthetase and homologous enzymes from other eukaryotes show evidence for homology over the whole alignment (Fig. 4). S. pombe glutathione synthetase shows 57, 57, 53, and 50% similarity, and 36, 37, 33, and 35% identity to the homologous enzymes from S. cerevisiae, P. angusta, A. thaliana, and H. sapiens, respectively. There is no detectable sequence similarity between the bacterial and eucaryotic enzymes. The most striking difference among the eucaryotic enzymes is a 15-amino acid segment (residues 204-218) between helix α 8 and strand β 6, which occurs only in the S. pombe enzyme, although a slightly smaller insert of nine amino acids occurs in the yeasts P. angusta and S. cerevisiae (Fig. 4). Since the crystal structure of the human enzyme has been solved (24Polekhina G. Board P.G. Gali R.R. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3204-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the structure of the S. pombe enzyme can be modeled according to these data. Although the crystal structure of glutathione synthetase from E. coli has also been determined (26Yamaguchi H. Kato H. Hata Y. Nishioka T. Kimura A. Oda J. Katsube Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1083-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the data collected for this enzyme were not taken into consideration due to the lack of sequence homology. Fig. 5 shows a model of the tertiary structure of one 56-kDa subunit of the fission yeast enzyme. The structure was determined assuming that the fission yeast enzyme is a homodimer composed of two identical 56-kDa subunits, each subunit derived from the whole GSH2 open reading frame. The calculations were based on the x-ray coordinates of the human enzyme and the sequence alignment between the proteins. The regions corresponding to amino acid residues 1-203 and 219-498 are colored in red and blue, respectively. The 15 amino acids missing in the human enzyme (residues 204-218) are colored in yellow. The predicted small and large subunits correspond to amino acids residues 1-217 and 218-498, respectively. Four additional small insertions and a single amino acid deletion are located in the vicinity of the large 15-amino acid insertion. With the exception of the allocations discussed above, the modeled str"
