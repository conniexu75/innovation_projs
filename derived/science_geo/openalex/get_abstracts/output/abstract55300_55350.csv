https://openalex.org/W1529321087,"Abstract In order to assess the effect of the covalently bonded heme on the stabilization of the conformation of horse heart cytochrome c, both the heme-free apo-cytochrome c and the iron-free, porphyrin-cytochrome c were prepared. The properties of these derivatives in solution were compared with those of native cytochrome c by the study of their viscosity, circular dichroism, and fluorescence. Porphyrin-cytochrome c appears to have a compact structure similar to native cytochrome c, although it is less stable to heat denaturation. It appears that the coordination of the iron atom of the heme with histidine-18 and methionine-80 results in an increase in the stability of this protein, but is not required for the folding of porphyrin-cytochrome c into a compact conformation. Apo-cytochrome c has the properties of a disordered structure. However, apo-cytochrome c can bind with the disordered heme-containing fragment of residues 1 to 65, prepared by the method of Corradin and Harbury ((1970) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 221, 489), and forms a product with spectral properties closely resembling native cytochrome c in the same manner as does the COOH-terminal fragment of residues 66 to 104 (Corradin, G., and Harbury, H. A. (1971) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 68, 3036). The observations indicate that the presence of the porphyrin ring covalently bonded with cysteines 14 and 17 is essential for cytochrome c to exist in the stable native conformation."

Transport of this hexose was found to be 4 to 5 times faster in transformed cells than in normal cells growing at the same rate, and 30 times faster than in contact-inhibited cells. The rate of efflux was increased to the same extent as the rate of influx. 3-O-Methylglucose transport in these cells was found to be a saturable process which was not accompanied by post-transport phosphorylation and which did not result in accumulation of the hexose against a concentration gradient. It is concluded that a facilitated diffusion system for hexose transport is activated in the transformed cells. Kinetic measurements revealed that the Km for transport of 3-O-methylglucose or of 2-deoxyglucose and the Ki for the phlorizin inhibition of 2-deoxyglucose transport were not significantly altered by malignant transformation. Only the Vmax for hexose uptake showed consistent, significant change. We suggest that a new hexose transport system is not synthesized in the transformed cells and that the activation of hexose transport occurs via either a modification or additional de novo synthesis of the normal cellular transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1535549237,"Abstract The effect of aromatic hydroxamic acids on skunk cabbage spadix and bean hypocotyl mitochondrial respiration has been measured. It is shown that the measurement of rate versus inhibitor concentration leads to the determination of the fluxes of reducing equivalents in each of the two pathways of electron transport in both State 3 and State 4. The alternate, cyanide-insensitive pathway is regulated by the activity of the normal cytochrome pathway. The conclusions about fluxes in State 3 are confirmed by the quantitative effect of hydroxamic acids on the ADP to oxygen ratio. The alternate pathway may be involved in regulation of NADH levels in the plant cell and in heat production by the skunk cabbage spadix."
https://openalex.org/W1511496806,"Abstract In order to investigate the effects of hormones on the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase of adipose tissue, it was necessary to study the characteristics of the enzyme in crude tissue extracts. There was an apparent activation of the enzyme by NaF, but this effect was probably due to inhibition of adenosine triphosphatase activity. The activity of phosphodiesterase in the extracts was low under the conditions of the experiments. Two procedures to determine the state of activation of the protein kinase in crude extracts are described. Both procedures are based on the amounts of inactive protein kinase (holoenzyme) and active catalytic subunit present. In the first procedure the activity ratio of the protein kinase is measured, i.e. the ratio of activity in the absence to activity in the presence of cAMP. At 0° in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl the protein kinase activity ratio was not affected by dilution of the extracts. Under these conditions, when cAMP was removed by gel filtration, the activity ratio decreased only very slowly but decreased rapidly in the absence of NaCl. The salt probably inhibits association of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of the protein kinase. In the second procedure for determining the activation state of the protein kinase, crude adipose tissue extracts were chromatographed on Sephadex G-100 columns and the areas under the curves of the two peaks of enzyme activity corresponding to holoenzyme and catalytic subunit were estimated. Sodium chloride (0.5 m) at 0° inhibited the association of the protein kinase subunits during this procedure. Sephadex G-100 profiles of the protein kinase in crude extracts of heart, brain, and liver were also determined. Sodium chloride (0.5 m) was also found to increase the activity ratio of the protein kinase in the presence of cAMP. At 0° this increase occurred relatively slowly and was accompanied by an increase in cAMP binding and a decrease in the cAMP requirement for enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W2058358352,"An adenylate cyclase that is activated specifically by very low concentrations of octopamine has been identified both in homogenates and in intact cells of the thoracic ganglia of an insect nervous system. This enzyme appears to be distinct from two other adenylate cyclases present in the same tissue, which are activated by dopamine and by 5-hydroxytryptamine, respectively. The data raise the possibility of a role of octopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in the physiology of synaptic transmission."

https://openalex.org/W1602379280,"Abstract The effects of lipolytic and antilipolytic hormones on the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase of rat adipose tissue were investigated. Incubation of epididymal fat pads with epinephrine increased the protein kinase activity in tissue extracts assayed in the absence of cAMP but not in the presence of cAMP. This was associated with conversion of the inactive holoenzyme form to the active catalytic subunit form as judged by resolution of these two forms of protein kinase on Sephadex G-100 columns. The time course of formation of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase in general paralleled the epinephrine-induced increase in the cAMP concentration. Concentrations of epinephrine (0.1 to 0.3 µm) which produced small increases in both the cAMP concentration and the catalytic form of protein kinase gave a maximum rate of lipolysis. Higher epinephrine concentrations further increased the cAMP concentration and the percentage of catalytic subunit form of protein kinase. Other lipolytic hormones such as adrenocorticotropic hormone and glucagon also activated the protein kinase. Activation of protein kinase in isolated fat cells by epinephrine in the absence and presence of caffeine was demonstrated. Insulin inhibited by up to 70% the epinephrine of protein kinase in fat pad. This inhibition by insulin was rapid with the maximum effect occurring within 10 min. The insulin effect was associated with a decrease in the relative amount of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase and can be quantitatively accounted for by the decrease in cAMP. Both the epinephrine and insulin effects on protein kinase disappeared when cAMP was removed by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 under conditions that allowed association of the protein kinase subunits. When cAMP was removed under conditions of high ionic strength which prevented the association of the enzyme subunits, the effects of hormones on the protein kinase were retained. The above results are consistent with the hypothesis that epinephrine and insulin do modify the activation state of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase through changes in the cAMP concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1956627733,"Abstract Both adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and its o-nitrophenyl sulfenyl derivative (NPS-ACTH) in which the single tryptophan residue of the hormone is modified, were able to stimulate corticosterone synthesis to the same maximal rate in isolated rat adrenal cells. The concentration of NPS-ACTH required for half-maximal steroidogenesis was approximately 70 times that of ACTH. Although both ACTH and NPS-ACTH stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation, the effect of NPS-ACTH was marginal; the maximal stimulation of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation in response to ACTH was 30 to 100-fold greater than that due to NPS-ACTH. Apparently ACTH increased cyclic AMP accumulation well beyond that required for the stimulation of maximal steroidogenesis. NPS-ACTH appeared to inhibit in a competitive manner the effect of ACTH on cyclic AMP production but not steroid synthesis. The continued presence of ACTH or NPS-ACTH was necessary for the continued stimulation of steroidogenesis indicating that the factor (or factors) mediating the steroidogenic response must be present throughout the time of stimulation. The relationship between steroid synthesis and cyclic AMP accumulation was different for ACTH and NPS-ACTH. Much less cyclic AMP was produced when NPS-ACTH stimulated steroid synthesis to 75% of the maximal level than when ACTH enhanced steroidogenesis half-maximally. Even though cyclic AMP was found to leave the cells during the time of incubation, the same lack of correlation between cyclic AMP generation and rate of steroid synthesis mentioned above was found whether intracellular or total cyclic AMP was measured. These results suggest that there may be two receptors for ACTH in the adrenal cell population which may be in the same cell or in different cell types. NPS-ACTH stimulates one of these receptors but inhibits the other. Furthermore, these results imply that either very small amounts of cyclic AMP are required for the stimulation of steroidogenesis or factor (or factors) besides cyclic AMP may be involved in mediating this function of ACTH."
https://openalex.org/W1605454764,"Abstract The kinetics of changes in the tissue content of citric acid cycle intermediates and free amino acids have been investigated in isolated perfused hearts during the transition from substrate-free perfusion to perfusion with medium containing 5 mm glucose and 5 x 10-3 units of insulin per ml. Glycolytic flux increased within 1 min to about 300 µmoles of glucose equivalents per g (dry weight) per hour, and oxygen uptake increased by 18 to 28% from a basal rate of 3000 µatoms per g (dry weight) per hour. The ratio of lactate to pyruvate in the perfusion fluid showed a transient rise from a value of 0.4 to a peak of 18 after 2 min and reached a final steady state value of 4. The tissue contents of oxalacetate and aspartate decreased by 76 and 59%, respectively, within the first 3 min, whereas the glutamate content increased reciprocally by 230%. The tissue contents of malate, citrate, and alanine increased more gradually over a 12-min period by 4.3-, 8.6-, and 4.4-fold, respectively. The α-ketoglutarate content initially increased rapidly and then fell before rising again to final values about 2-fold greater than the initial. The changes in the tissue contents of amino acids other than glutamate, aspartate, and alanine were minor. Net accumulation of citric acid cycle intermediates in the heart following addition of glucose can be accounted for by double transamination between alanine and aspartate aminotransferases. Creatine-P levels increased by 14 µmoles per g (dry weight), whereas tissue inorganic phosphate levels decreased by 12 µmoles per g (dry weight). These changes together with the observed increase of the ATP:ADP ratio from 10.8 to 14.2 indicate a higher energy state of the adenine nucleotide system after glucose addition. From the measured rates of glucose metabolism, oxygen uptake, and changes of the aspartate and alanine contents, together with the previously verified assumption that glycolytically generated NADH is transported to the mitochondria via the malate-aspartate cycle, calculations were made of flux through steps of the citric acid cycle and the anion exchange reactions across the mitochondrial membrane. The data indicate a rapid increase of α-ketoglutarate-malate exchange upon addition of glucose and insulin, but a 1- to 2-min delay in the onset of increased glutamate-aspartate exchange and flux through mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase. This delay of intramitochondrial glutamate transamination was attributed to a low affinity of the glutamate carrier for extramitochondrial glutamate in the presence of high extramitochondrial aspartate concentrations. The calculations showed that flux through citrate synthase initially increased, whereas flux through α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase decreased. It is postulated that these changes are a direct consequence of the regulation of glutamate influx across the mitochondrial membrane. A uniform flux through the citric acid cycle except for malate dehydrogenase was achieved by a fall of flux through citrate synthase and increase of flux through α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase to common steady state values. Increased flux through citrate synthase is attributed to the observed rise of acetyl-CoA levels, whereas decreased flux through α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is attributed to inhibition of the enzyme by an increase of succinyl-CoA and NADH levels. The reciprocal reversals of flux after 1.5 min are attributed to competition for oxalacetate between citrate synthase and mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase, and an increased rate of generation of intramitochondrial α-ketoglutarate which overcomes product inhibition of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase by increasing the intramitochondrial α-ketoglutarate concentration."

https://openalex.org/W1586400700,"Abstract Colicin E3 receptor activity was extracted from the envelope fraction of colicin-sensitive Escherichia coli cells with Triton X-100 and EDTA, and was purified by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The purified receptor fraction retained full receptor activity against both colicin E2 and E3, but it had little activity towards colicin E1 and almost no colicin K receptor activity. A protein with a molecular weight of about 60,000 was detected in purified fractions by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. During the final stages of purification this protein was enriched in proportion to the specific activity of the colicin receptor. When excess colicin E3 was added to the purified receptor fraction and then precipitated with rabbit anticolicin, this 60,000 molecular weight protein was co-precipitated with the colicin, whereas other contaminating protein was only partially precipitated. In order to further confirm the relationship between this protein and colicin receptor activity, a culture of a colicin-sensitive strain was labeled with 3H-amino acids and mixed with a culture of a colicin-resistant mutant strain labeled with 14C-amino acids. When the purified receptor fraction obtained from this mixed culture was analyzed by gel electrophoresis, it was observed that the 60,000 molecular weight protein was labeled only with 3H, indicating that this protein is missing or altered in the colicin-resistant mutant. It was estimated that there are 220 copies of this protein per cell. The purified receptor activity was inactivated by periodate, suggesting that a carbohydrate is also required for activity. A small amount of carbohydrate was present in the purified receptor fraction, and preliminary analysis indicated that glucose, galactose (and/or heptose), rhamnose, uronic acids, and amino sugars were present. The 60,000 molecular weight protein did not appear to contain any large amount of covalently linked carbohydrate. As yet, there is no evidence to confirm the identity of any specific carbohydrate which is essential for receptor activity."

https://openalex.org/W1640149810,"Abstract High density lipoproteins (HDL) were isolated from pig plasma by ultracentrifugal flotation between densities 1.063 and 1.210 g per ml. After delipidation, the apolipoproteins were fractionated by chromatography on Sephadex G-150 and DEAE-cellulose in 5.4 m urea. One major apolipoprotein was isolated and characterized. From its chemical and physical properties, this major apolipoprotein appears very similar to apoLP-Gln-I from human HDL. Pig HDL appears to differ from human HDL in a marked decrease in the relative content of apoLP-Gln-II in the pig lipoprotein family. A distinct peak associated with apoLP-Gln-II was not identified by chromatography of pig apoHDL. A small quantity of a protein with the same mobility of human apoLPGln-II was detected in pig apoHDL after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The major apolipoprotein from pig HDL had an approximate molecular weight of 26,000 as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Its calculated molecular weight from amino acid analysis was 29,800. Rabbit antisera prepared against the pig apolipoprotein formed precipitin lines of partial identity between this protein and apoLP-Gln-I from human HDL. Treatment of the pig apolipoprotein with carboxypeptidase established Leu-Gln as the COOH-terminal sequence. Pig and human apoLPGln-I had similar amino acid compositions, but the pig protein contained isoleucine and had 12 more residues of alanine than did human apoLP-Gln-I. Pig and human apoLP-Gln-I had indistinguishable absorption spectra and similar circular dichroism spectra indicating a relatively high content of α-helical conformation. Both proteins activated human lecithin : cholesterol acyltransferase. These studies demonstrate that the major apolipoprotein from human and pig HDL have similar chemical, immunological, physical, and physiological properties."

https://openalex.org/W1520500655,"Abstract The antimicrotubular agents colchicine, vinblastine, and podophyllotoxin have been found to stimulate steroid production by Y-1 adrenal tumor cells in culture. The amount of steroid secreted under the influence of these agents is comparable to the amount produced during maximal adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation. The steroid end products, 20α-dihydroprogesterone and 11β-hydroxy-20α-dihydroprogesterone, are identical after both kinds of stimulation. ACTH stimulation and vinblastine stimulation are not additive. As with ACTH, stimulation by vinblastine occurs between the cholesterol and Δ4-pregnenolone steps, and it is inhibited by aminoglutethimide and cycloheximide. It does not, however, involve activation of the adenylate cyclase system. The time course of stimulation differs from ACTH—the antimicrotubular agents stimulate after a 6- to 9-hour lag period which is absent with ACTH. D2O, an agent which stabilizes microtubules, inhibits stimulation of steroid by vinblastine, ACTH, or cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Steroid secretion by Leydig tumor cells in culture is also stimulated by vinblastine, but to a lesser extent than by cAMP. This stimulation exhibits a lag period and is inhibited by D2O. We propose that the antimicrotubular agents facilitate access of cholesterol to the mitochondrion and that this may also be the mechanism of hormonally-stimulated steroid secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1579429245,"Abstract A bacterium has been isolated from soil by enrichment culture using melilotate as the sole carbon source and has been tentatively identified as a Pseudomonad. Crude extracts of this organism contain a melilotate hydroxylase (melilotate, NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylation)) capable of converting melilotate (2-hydroxyphenylpropionate) to 2,3-dihydroxyphenylpropionate. This enzyme has been purified to homogeneity making use of a substrate-specific elution from DEAE-cellulose. Melilotate hydroxylase contains FAD as the prosthetic group, with 1 mole of FAD per protein of 65,000 molecular weight. The enzyme exists as a tetramer in solution. The apoprotein of the enzyme can be converted to holoenzyme by incubation with FAD and dithiothreitol. The visible absorption spectrum of the enzyme depends on temperature, with the extinction coefficient at 454 nm changing from 11,300 m-1 cm-1 at 25° to 11,900 m-1 cm-1 at 1°. Unlike many other flavoproteins, this enzyme does not react with sulfite. Melilotate hydroxylase is reduced rapidly by irradiation with visible light in the presence of EDTA or by dithionite. The oxidized enzyme is converted directly to the reduced enzyme with no evidence for a semiquinone intermediate. Slightly more than 1 mole of dithionite per mole of enzyme flavin is required for full reduction, whereas the reduced enzyme is completely reoxidized by 1 mole of 2,6-dichloroindophenol. A complex (1:1) is formed between enzyme and melilotate. Formation of this complex affects the visible absorption and circular dichroism properties of the enzyme. The free enzyme is slowly reduced by NADH; the rate of this reduction is dramatically increased by melilotate."
https://openalex.org/W1968604298,"The soluble supernatant fraction of homogenates of cloned rat astrocytoma cells (linle C-2A) was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two peaks of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate phosphodiesterase activity were found, corresponding to peaks I and IV of a similarly prepared homogenate of rat brain. Incubating cells with norepinephrine (0.3 millimolar) caused about a threefold increase in the activity of peak IV but no change in peak I. This increase was completely inhibited by prior incubation with propranolol (0.1 millimolar), a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, or with cyclohexamine (40 micromolar), a protein synthesis inhibitor. Induction of a specific phosphodiesterase form by norepinephrine suggests another feedback control mechanism whereby an organism can prevent the effects of excessive sympathetic activity."

https://openalex.org/W1482654179,"Abstract A kinetic analysis of the reaction mechanism of d-β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, a lipid-requiring enzyme from mitochondria, was made for both the membrane-bound enzyme in submitochondrial particles and for a purified soluble preparation. The results are consistent with an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism (nomenclature of Cleland) where NAD is the first substrate to add to the enzyme and NADH is the last product to leave. The mechanism is the same whether or not the enzyme is bound to the membrane. The dissociation constants for NADH and NAD of the soluble enzyme reactivated with mitochondrial phospholipid are the same as that for the membrane-bound enzyme. Replacing mitochondrial phospholipid with purified lecithin when reactivating the soluble enzyme results in tighter binding of these nucleotides to the enzyme. These studies (a) indicate that the enzyme is not appreciably altered by release from the membrane and by the purification procedure, (b) that the lipid environment of the enzyme in the membrane more closely approximates that of mitochondrial phospholipid than lecithin alone, and (c) provide insight into how phospholipid can modulate important parameters of enzymic catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1857950310,"Abstract The amount of radioactive dihydrotestosterone (17β-hydroxy-5α-[1,2-3H]androstan-3-one) bound to high molecular weight molecules in the 8 to 10 S fraction of the 100,000 x g supernatant was measured at intervals following castration. As expected, the receptor concentration (and activity per mg of cytosol protein or per µg of DNA) declined steadily to immeasurable levels by the 4th day following castration. However, whereas the size of the prostate and the DNA content per prostate and per mg of tissue continued to fall, the receptor concentration per mg of tissue and per µg of DNA increased to levels similar to those found 1 day following castration. The maximum was reached by the 8th day after castration and was maintained for at least 6 weeks. The results of the sucrose gradient analysis were confirmed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The same phenomenon was observed in animals which were either hypophysectomized or adrenalectomized at the time of castration. This finding indicates that restoration of receptor is not mediated by adrenal androgens or pituitary hormones. These observations suggest that there is an androgen-independent mechanism for providing receptor to receive the androgenic stimulus for growth and development as well as for maintenance of the mature prostate."

Penta-, tetra-, tri-, and disaccharides were isolated from the products of acetolysis of this material, and their structures were studied by chemical, enzymatic, and immunological methods. Periodate oxidation of a reduced sulfated disaccharide composed of N-acetylglucosamine gave predominantly erythritol, indicating 1 → 4 linkage between the two glucosamine residues. Galactose and N-acetylglucosamine were obtained from the treatment of trisaccharide with β-galactosidase. Methylation analysis of the trisaccharide revealed equal amounts of acetates of 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methylgalactitol and 2,4,6-tri-O-methylgalactitol in addition to 3,6-di-O-methyl-N-methylglucosaminitol. This is consistent with the structure Gal (β1-3)/→ Gal (β1-4)/→ GlcNAc.

https://openalex.org/W1591646146,"Abstract The effect of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) on the ability of the glial tumor cell line, C-6, to elevate its adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) content in response to norepinephrine has been examined. Increasing concentrations of BrdUrd were found to inhibit the norepinephrine response progressively, with a maximal inhibition of approximately 80%. No effect of BrdUrd was seen on basal cAMP levels. Analysis of individual enzymes demonstrated that BrdUrd increased the cAMP phosphodiesterase activities but had no effect on the adenylate cyclase or its sensitivity to norepinephrine. In addition, BrdUrd caused a change in the shape of the cells. The effect on shape also occurred in confluent cells, whereas the effect on the norepinephrine response required dividing cells, suggesting that incorporation of the BrdUrd into DNA was required. N6, O2'-Dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate also increased the cAMP phosphodiesterase activities of the cells, and caused a similar change in their morphology. Although BrdUrd had no effect on the adenylate cyclase, variations in the culture conditions were found to have a large effect on the enzyme's norepinephrine sensitivity. Following subculturing, there was little elevation of cAMP in response to norepinephrine until after the cells began to enter the stationary growth phase. Phosphodiesterase activity was found to remain constant throughout this period. The results suggest that cell-to-cell contact may regulate certain cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W1572275240,"Abstract The reaction mechanism of melilotate hydroxylase has been investigated by a variety of kinetic methods. A steady state analysis has indicated that the enzyme has a mechanism involving two ternary complexes but not a quaternary complex of the enzyme and the three substrates. The reduction of the enzyme-melilotate complex by NADH has been studied by measuring fluorescence changes in the stopped flow apparatus. This reaction is second order and very rapid. The product of this reaction, observed by stopped-flow spectrophotometry, is believed to be a charge-transfer complex between the reduced FAD of the enzyme and NAD+. It has a broad, long wave length band centered at 750 nm and little absorption at 450 nm. This long wave length band disappears with a rate independent of the NADH concentration; this is presumably due to the dissociation of NAD+ from the complex. A charge-transfer complex can also be formed by anaerobic titration of reduced enzyme with NAD+ or 3-acetylpyridine-NAD+. The charge-transfer band is sensitive to the nature of the pyridine nucleotide. The spectrum of the complex between reduced enzyme and NAD+ appears to be identical with the spectrum observed transiently during the reduction of the enzyme by NADH in the stopped flow apparatus. The reaction of reduced melilotate hydroxylase with molecular oxygen in the absence of melilotate is a second order reaction. The rate of this reaction is enhanced more than 10-fold by the presence of melilotate, and the reaction profile becomes more complex. This complexity is due to the formation of an intermediate, which is believed to be an adduct of molecular oxygen to the reduced FAD of the enzyme. The spectrum of this intermediate has been determined by analog computer simulation using experimentally determined rate constants for its formation and decay, as well as the known extinction coefficients for reduced and oxidized enzyme. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on the steady state analysis. This analysis enabled the kinetic constants for the reaction to be determined. These kinetic constants have also been predicted from individually determined rate constants assuming the proposed mechanism. The values obtained by these two methods are in excellent agreement. They also correlate with the Kdiss previously determined for the dissociation of melilotate from the enzyme-substrate complex."

https://openalex.org/W1648032338,"Abstract Studies on the properties of the reaction and the mechanism of conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to squalene have been carried out with purified yeast squalene synthetase. The general properties of the yeast enzyme are similar to those of the enzyme obtained from mammalian liver. A divalent metal ion (Mg++ or Mn++) is essential for the formation of presqualene pyrophosphate, but not for the conversion of this compound to squalene. However, the rate of the latter reaction is increased in the presence of Mg++. Yeast squalene synthetase activity is inhibited by concentrations above 50 mm of farnesyl pyrophosphate, by N-ethylmaleimide, and to a lesser extent by iodoacetamide. Hence it is evident that a sulfhydryl group or other nucleophile is required for enzyme activity. Yeast squalene synthetase has a maximum enzyme activity at pH 7.3 to 7.5. However, great differences in enzyme activity were found, depending on the buffer used. These differences are due in part to ionic strength, and possibly to a direct effect of phosphate ion on enzymatic activity. Initial velocity studies for the formation of squalene and presqualene pyrophosphate from farnesyl pyrophosphate have shown that the mechanism of the condensing reaction is ping-pong. Initial velocity kinetics and product inhibition studies for the reduction of presqualene pyrophosphate to squalene have shown that this reaction is sequential ordered. In the reduction reaction NADPH is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme, followed by presqualene pyrophosphate. The first product to be released is pyrophosphate, followed by squalene. The last product to leave the enzyme is NADP. A chemical mechanism for squalene synthesis is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1596642293,"Abstract The chemical and enzymatic composition and the respiratory components of an intact membrane preparation, ghosts from Mycobacterium phlei, were compared to those of the electron transport particles. The ghosts were found to contain 5 to 7% of some of the soluble enzymes associated with the cytoplasm. In contrast, 97% of the total content of cytochromes b, c1 + c, and a + a3 was found in the ghost preparation. The content of cytochromes, menaquinone, latent ATPase, and phospholipid was similar in both ghost and electron transport particle preparations. The oxidative activities of the ghosts were similar to or slightly lower than those of the electron transport particles with all substrates tested. Coupled phosphorylation, however, was cryptic with the ghost preparations. Phosphorylation was demonstrable following brief sonication or preincubation of the ghosts with substrates and other components of the phosphate acceptor system. The synthesis of ATP was found to occur within the ghosts. Evidence is presented which suggests that the cell membrane of the ghost is oriented as in the intact cell, whereas the orientation of the membrane in the electron transport particles appears to be inside out."
https://openalex.org/W1651409392,"Abstract The transport of androgens in rat prostate has been studied with the use of a pulse-chase method that yields an approximate 250-fold dilution of pulse-derived 3H-steroid in the cytosol and an 8- to 11-fold dilution in the nucleus. The large difference between the chase effects on cytosol and nuclei is explained either by the low capacity of the system which actively transports steroids across the nuclear membrane or by the limited ability of nuclei to accommodate steroid hormones. Examination of the sequence of labeling of cytosol receptor, whole nuclei, and nuclear receptor indicates that the amount of 3H-steroid lost from cytosol receptor is almost equal to the amount of 3H-steroid gained by nuclei and nuclear receptor. This observation is consistent with the concept that the combined action of cytosol and nuclear receptors is necessary for the transfer of steroids across the nuclear membrane. Two-thirds of the intranuclear steroid is recovered in a free form and appears to arise in part from extensive dissociation of the nuclear steroid-receptor complex. With increasing time, the ratio of dihydrotestosterone: testosterone in the nuclear fractions improves in favor of dihydrotestosterone. Since the total amount of 3H-steroid remains constant during this interval, the latter result appears to be a reflection of the intranuclear metabolism of testosterone. Chase injection of estradiol, cyproterone acetate, and epitestosterone reduces the amount of pulse-derived 3H-steroid equally in the cytosol receptor, whole nuclei, and nuclear receptor fractions; moreover, estradiol appears to bind to the same receptor which binds testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. The possibility that the action of antiandrogens such as estradiol and cyproterone acetate is based on their ability to form inactive migratory complexes is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1975906128,"THERE is considerable evidence that cholera diarrhoea is caused by accumulation of cyclic AMP in intestinal mucosa, stimulated by cholera enterotoxin1–3. Prostaglandin-E1 (PGE1) reproduces the effects of cholera enterotoxin on both cyclic AMP and secretion of fluid and electrolytes by intestinal mucosa3 and it was suggested4 that the toxin might first act by stimulating the release or synthesis of prostaglandin which then acts through cyclic AMP. Bennett4 proposed that acidic anti-inflammatory drugs, as they are potent inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis in several tissues5–7, might antagonize the effect of cholera enterotoxin. Jacoby and Marshall reported that indomethacin, aspirin, and several other anti-inflammatory agents inhibited the cholera toxin-induced accumulation of fluid in ileal-ligated rats8. Because of its potential therapeutic significance, I have studied this proposed mechanism."

Properties, including low levels of nuclease activity and a preference for native duplex DNA templates, were favorable for the study of in vitro DNA synthesis using circular duplex DNA templates. Initiation of DNA synthesis occurs predominantly at sites of single strand scissions with covalent addition of nucleotides to the priming template strand. Centrifugation and electron microscopy have established that the template DNA strand ahead of the growing point is displaced rather than degraded. Hairpin structures are not formed in the course of DNA synthesis on duplex DNA templates."
https://openalex.org/W1550994434,"A crystalline silver perchlorate complex of riboflavin, a possible model for enzymic metal-flavin interactions, has been prepared and characterized by x-ray techniques. The orange crystals are monoclinic, with symmetry C2, and unit cell constants a = 19.464(10) (figures in parentheses are standard deviations in the least significant figures cited), b = 7.886(4), c = 15.459(8)A, β = 107.34(2)°, Z = 4, ρobs = 1.79 g/cm3, and ρcalc = 1.77 g per cm3 for AgClO4· C17H20N4O6(CO)0.45·½H2O. The crystal structure, refined using 2837 counter-measured reflections, gives an R factor of 6.2% and revealed that about 45% of the riboflavin in the crystal used was formylated in the 5′ position by the formic acid solvent. Each riboflavin molecule bonds fairly strongly to two silver ions: one via N(1) (2.304(5)A), O(2) (2.786(5)A), and O(2′) (2.559(6)A), and the other via N(5) (2.295(5)A) and O(4) (2.521(5)A). These results confirm the existence of two separate chelate sites in the N(3)-protonated, quinoid isoalloxazine ring system, and together with earlier crystal structure studies suggest that both these chelate sites will nearly always be occupied by positive ions or dipoles (such as —OH). Two conformationally preferred forms of riboflavin seem both to have the ribityl chain extending above the isoalloxazine ring when viewed with the benzo ring to the right and N(10) at the top. In one, C(1′)—C(4′) and O(4′) are nearly planar and fully extended; in the other, O(2′) and C(2′)—C(5′)."
https://openalex.org/W1526886876,"Abstract Kinetic and aggregatory properties of a partially purified preparation of d-erythro-imidazoleglycerol phosphate dehydratase-histidinol phosphate phosphatase from a derepressed mutant of Salmonella typhimurium (his01242) have been investigated. The molecular weight in crude extracts is 300,000. Purification of the enzyme causes disaggregation, the main component being 75,000 in molecular weight. Addition of MnCl2 causes reaggregation resulting in a molecular weight greater than 300,000. Aminotriazole (Ki = 3.2 µm) and phosphate ion (Ki = 1.3 mm) competitively inhibited only the dehydratase activity. Zinc chloride, at micromolar concentrations, inhibits only the dehydratase activity. Both histidinol (Ki = 52 µm) and histidine (Ki = 10 mm) are competitive inhibitors of only the phosphatase activity. Heating at 54° results in a very rapid loss of only the phosphatase activity, T1/2 = 2 min; the dehydratase activity is stable under these conditions. Imidazoleglycerol phosphate is not hydrolyzed and does not inhibit the phosphatase activity. Histidinol phosphate does not affect the dehydratase activity. We conclude that the dehydratase and phosphatase active sites are separate and distinct, although they appear to reside in a single protein. The energies of activation for both substrates were determined to be 15,100 cal per mole for the hydrolysis of histidinol phosphate and 14,700 cal per mole for the dehydration of imidazoleglycerol phosphate. The optimum pH for phosphatase activity was 6.5 to 7 and was near pH 7.5 for the dehydratase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1603171185,"Abstract Squalene synthetase, the first enzyme to synthesize a water-insoluble precursor of cholesterol, has been purified from bakers' yeast to near homogeneity. Key steps in purification are the release of this enzyme from particulate fractions of yeast by treatment with 50% sucrose and the stabilization of enzyme activity with 30% glycerol in 100 to 200 mm phosphate buffer. Enzyme activities of 20 to 40 nmoles of squalene formed per min per mg of protein are obtained with the enzyme purified by the procedure reported herein. Squalene synthetase exists in two forms (termed and protomeric). The first of these forms synthesizes squalene and presqualene pyrophosphate whereas the latter form synthesizes only presqualene pyrophosphate. An equilibrium mixture of the protomeric and polymeric forms of squalene synthetase exists. However, the ratio of these two forms can be affected markedly by the conditions of treatment. At a low glycerol concentration the polymeric form of the enzyme is converted to the protomeric form. In 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol, the half-life of the polymer is 11.8 hours. Dissociation of the polymeric form is greatly accelerated by detergents. In 10% glycerol and 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 0.4 mg per ml of Tween 80 and 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, the half-life of the polymeric form is approximately 3 hours. At a high glycerol concentration (50%) in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, the protomeric form is partially reassociated to the polymer. However, the specific enzyme activity of the reassociated polymer is lower than that of the original enzyme, thereby suggesting that some of the enzyme is denatured in the process of dissociation and subsequent reassociation. The activities of the protomeric and the polymeric forms are not changed by the presence of sterol carrier protein."
https://openalex.org/W1535792073,"Abstract Desaturation of [1-14C]stearic acid, [1-14C]palmitic acid, and [1-14C]stearoyl-CoA was measured in homogenates of 10-day-old rat brain. Desaturation was maximal with stearoyl-CoA at pH 6.0 to 6.6. With free fatty acids, monoene formation was maximal at pH 7.2 to 7.6; stearic acid was more actively desaturated than palmitic acid. Activity with stearic acid or stearoyl-CoA was linear with protein concentration of 2 to 6 mg per ml and time to 10 min and was optimal at 37 to 45°. At pH 7.4, fatty acid desaturation was not limited by the formation of fatty acyl-CoA derivatives when coenzyme A, Mg2+, and ATP were added. Rapid loss of activity in vitro prevented accurate subcellular location of the enzyme system. Oxygen and NAD+ or NADH were necessary for maximal activity. Diphosphonucleotides were more active than triphosphonucleotides, and oxidized were as effective as reduced forms. The monoene fraction from desaturation of the labeled stearic acid was 91% oleic acid (18:1(n-9)); desaturation of palmitic acid produced 22% palmitoleic acid (16:1(n-7)) and 72% cis-vaccenic acid (18:1(n-7)). At concentrations approximating normal tissue evels, these monoenes did not inhibit desaturation."

https://openalex.org/W1483570189,"Abstract 1. Steady state kinetic constants were determined at pH 6 for various phosphohydrolase and phosphotransferase activities catalyzed by glucose 6-phosphatase of liver microsomes that were supplemented with 0.4% sodium taurocholate and assayed in the presence of albumin. Km and Vmax values were evaluated for reactions with glucose 6-phosphate, carbamyl phosphate, inorganic pyrophosphate, mannose 6-phosphate, ATP, and phosphoenolpyruvate as phosphoryl donor compounds and d-glucose and d-mannose as phosphoryl acceptor compounds. 2. The order of decreasing reactivity of these substrates was carbamyl phosphate g inorganic pyrophosphate g mannose 6-phosphate = glucose 6-phosphate >> ATP g phosphoenolpyruvate. Phosphotransferase activities with d-mannose were significantly faster than the corresponding glucose phosphotransferase activities. With the exception of phosphoenolpyruvate, values for Vmax and Km for a given phosphate substrate were greater in the phosphotransferase reactions. The Km for a given substrate in the phosphotransferase reaction varied with the specific nature and concentration of the second substrate. Values of Km for the phosphoryl donor substrates were greatest with mannose as the acceptor, while Km values for the phosphoryl acceptor varied directly with the reactivity of the phosphoryl donor compound. 3. These observations were shown to be incompatible with the conclusion from an earlier study that the step in the mechanism was the formation of the phosphoryl enzyme from the binary complex of enzyme and phosphoryl donor compound. Rather, it is concluded that the hydrolysis of phosphoryl enzyme is the slowest step in the hydrolysis of all substrates that possess reactivity equal to or greater than glucose 6-phosphate. Moreover, no individual rate constant could be considered as the rate-limiting factor in these reactions. The earlier conclusions appear to be valid at pH 6 in the cases of phosphoenolpyruvate, ATP, or other nucleotides where additional steric or electrostatic factors restrict the rate of formation of phosphoryl enzyme. 4. An analysis of the data for all activities permitted the assignment of upper and lower limits on the relative magnitude of the individual rate constants for the glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase activity and means by which these limits may be refined are discussed."

Stimulation of collagenase also occurred on similar treatment of cell-free unfractionated control medium but no effect was observed with purified collagenase or the zymogen of collagenase. The possible relationship of adenosine cyclic 3':5'-monophosphate to activation of the zymogen of collagenase is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1542254498,"Several recent studies propose that DPNH exerts a modulating effect on a variety of enzymes, thus constituting a metabolic control system. We have reinvestigated the reported control of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) of Escherichia coli B by a study of steady state kinetics of the reaction and find no evidence of such control. The reported apparent modulation is explained by the presence of stray light in single beam spectrophotometers which are used for assaying enzyme activity by change in optical density. It is suggested that the proposed control of several other enzymes by DPNH also needs to be reinvestigated."

Product DNA, covalently attached to template DNA, was analyzed with respect to the complements separated in alkaline CsCl bouyant density gradients. The results indicated base composition-complement fidelity of the product of DNA synthesis as well as preferential synthesis of DNA corresponding to the denser complement (in alkaline CsCl solution) of mitochondrial DNA. This asymmetric synthesis of mitochondrial DNA appears to arise from a bias in the number of single-strand scissions sustained by the complementary strands of mitochondrial DNA during incubation with the protein fraction containing the mitochondrial DNA polymerase."

In crude 100,000 x g soluble extracts of fat cells, the activity of the enzyme is dependent on the addition of both adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and ATP. This dependency is due to activation of the enzyme by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase which uses ATP as specific nucleotide substrate. This latter kinase is separated from the GTP-specific protein kinase by chromatography on histone-Sepharose. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase purified from beef skeletal muscle also activates the fat cell GTP-protein kinase."
