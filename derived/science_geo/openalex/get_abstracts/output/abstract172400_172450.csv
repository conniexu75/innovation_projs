https://openalex.org/W2073026107,"We describe an approach to detect the frequency of interaction between any two genomic loci. Generation of a matrix of interaction frequencies between sites on the same or different chromosomes reveals their relative spatial disposition and provides information about the physical properties of the chromatin fiber. This methodology can be applied to the spatial organization of entire genomes in organisms from bacteria to human. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we could confirm known qualitative features of chromosome organization within the nucleus and dynamic changes in that organization during meiosis. We also analyzed yeast chromosome III at the G1 stage of the cell cycle. We found that chromatin is highly flexible throughout. Furthermore, functionally distinct AT- and GC-rich domains were found to exhibit different conformations, and a population-average 3D model of chromosome III could be determined. Chromosome III emerges as a contorted ring."
https://openalex.org/W2149529243,"Coral reefs are the most biologically diverse of shallow water marine ecosystems but are being degraded worldwide by human activities and climate warming. Analyses of the geographic ranges of 3235 species of reef fish, corals, snails, and lobsters revealed that between 7.2% and 53.6% of each taxon have highly restricted ranges, rendering them vulnerable to extinction. Restricted-range species are clustered into centers of endemism, like those described for terrestrial taxa. The 10 richest centers of endemism cover 15.8% of the world's coral reefs (0.012% of the oceans) but include between 44.8 and 54.2% of the restricted-range species. Many occur in regions where reefs are being severely affected by people, potentially leading to numerous extinctions. Threatened centers of endemism are major biodiversity hotspots, and conservation efforts targeted toward them could help avert the loss of tropical reef biodiversity."

These temperature records are systematically warmer than earlier hydrographic temperature measurements from the region, suggesting that mid-depth Southern Ocean temperatures have risen 0.17 degrees C between the 1950s and the 1980s. This warming is faster than that of the global ocean and is concentrated within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, where temperature rates of change are comparable to Southern Ocean atmospheric temperature increases."

RAR1 is an early convergence point in a signaling pathway engaged by multiple R genes. Here, we show that RAR1 interacts with plant orthologs of the yeast protein SGT1, an essential regulator in the cell cycle. Silencing the barley gene Sgt1 reveals its role in R gene-triggered, Rar1-dependent disease resistance. SGT1 associates with SKP1 and CUL1, subunits of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, the RAR1-SGT1 complex also interacts with two COP9 signalosome components. The interactions among RAR1, SGT1, SCF, and signalosome subunits indicate a link between disease resistance and ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W1620028706,"GSK3/SHAGGY is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase implicated in many signaling pathways in eukaryotes. Although many GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinases have been identified in plants, little is known about their functions in plant growth and development. Here we show that the Arabidopsis BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 2 ( BIN2 ) gene encodes a GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase. Gain-of-function mutations within its coding sequence or its overexpression inhibit brassinosteroid (BR) signaling, resulting in plants that resemble BR-deficient and BR-response mutants. In contrast, reduced BIN2 expression via cosuppression partially rescues a weak BR-signaling mutation. Thus, BIN2 acts as a negative regulator to control steroid signaling in plants."

https://openalex.org/W1751748906,"Phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) on specific tyrosine and threonine sites by MAP kinase kinases (MAPKKs) is thought to be the sole activation mechanism. Here, we report an unexpected activation mechanism for p38alpha MAPK that does not involve the prototypic kinase cascade. Rather it depends on interaction of p38alpha with TAB1 [transforming growth factor-beta-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein 1] leading to autophosphorylation and activation of p38alpha. We detected formation of a TRAF6-TAB1-p38alpha complex and showed stimulus-specific TAB1-dependent and TAB1-independent p38alpha activation. These findings suggest that alternative activation pathways contribute to the biological responses of p38alpha to various stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1665675901,"The corepressor CtBP (carboxyl-terminal binding protein) is involved in transcriptional pathways important for development, cell cycle regulation, and transformation. We demonstrate that CtBP binding to cellular and viral transcriptional repressors is regulated by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides NAD + and NADH, with NADH being two to three orders of magnitude more effective. Levels of free nuclear nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides, determined using two-photon microscopy, correspond to the levels required for half-maximal CtBP binding and are considerably lower than those previously reported. Agents capable of increasing NADH levels stimulate CtBP binding to its partners in vivo and potentiate CtBP-mediated repression. We propose that this ability to detect changes in nuclear NAD + /NADH ratio allows CtBP to serve as a redox sensor for transcription."

Somatic hypermutation and switch recombination have recently been shown to depend on the activation-induced deaminase ( AID ) gene product. Here, we show that the disruption of the AID gene in the chicken B cell line DT40 completely blocks Ig gene conversion and that this block can be complemented by reintroduction of the AID complementary DNA. This demonstrates that the AID master gene controls all B cell–specific modifications of vertebrate Ig genes."

https://openalex.org/W2028966970,"Animal SGT1 is a component of Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligases that target regulatory proteins for degradation. Mutations in one (SGT1b) of two highly homologous Arabidopsis SGT1 genes disable early plant defenses conferred by multiple resistance (R) genes. Loss of SGT1b function in resistance is not compensated for by SGT1a. R genes differ in their requirements for SGT1b and a second resistance signaling gene, RAR1, that was previously implicated as an SGT1 interactor. Moreover, SGT1b and RAR1 contribute additively to RPP5-mediated pathogen recognition. These data imply both operationally distinct and cooperative functions of SGT1 and RAR1 in plant disease resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2097836350,"Histone N-terminal tails are post-translationally modified in many ways. At lysine residues, histones can be either acetylated or methylated. Both modifications lead to the binding of specific proteins; bromodomain proteins, such as GCN5, bind acetyl lysines and the chromodomain protein, HP1, binds methyl lysine 9 of histone H3. Here we show that the previously characterized transcriptional repressor complex NuRD (nucleosomeremodeling and deacetylase) binds to the histone H3 N-terminal tail and that methylation at lysine 4, but not lysine 9, prevents binding. Given that lysine 4 methylation is found at sites of active transcription, these results suggest that a function of lysine 4 methylation is to disrupt the association of histones with a repressor complex. Histone N-terminal tails are post-translationally modified in many ways. At lysine residues, histones can be either acetylated or methylated.

Given that lysine 4 methylation is found at sites of active transcription, these results suggest that a function of lysine 4 methylation is to disrupt the association of histones with a repressor complex. The N-terminal tails of histones are multiply post-translationally modified. Such evolutionarily conserved modifications include phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation (1.Strahl B.D.

The “histone code hypothesis” predicts that combinations of modifications on the histone N termini will serve as binding sites for different protein modules (1.Strahl B.D. Allis C.D.

Furthermore, this differential binding of proteins to histone tails is proposed to affect chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation (4.Marmorstein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Indeed bromodomains have been shown to bind to acetylated lysines in histone N-terminal tails (5.Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 6.Jacobson R.H. Ladurner A.G. King D.S. Tjian R. Science. 2000; 288: 1422-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), and in vivo data suggest that the bromodomain of GCN5 can target transcriptional activators to acetylated promoter regions (7.Syntichaki P. Topalidou I. Thireos G. Nature. 2000; 404: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Although methylation of histone lysines was discovered over 35 years ago (8.Murray K. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), only recent studies have elucidated that the transcriptional repressor SUV39H1 can methylate lysine 9 of histone H3 (9.Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). In accordance with the histone code hypothesis, methyl lysine 9 of histone H3 provides a binding site for the chromodomain of HP1 (10.Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O.

Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). The binding of HP1 is essential for heterochromatic silencing (10.Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A.

Nature. 2001; 412: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar).Consistent with a repressive role for transcription, lysine 9 methylation is found at silent heterochromatic sites (14.Litt M.D. Simpson M.

Genet. 2002; 30: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In contrast, methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 localizes to sites of active transcription (14.Litt M.D. Simpson M. Gaszner M. Allis C.D. Felsenfeld G. Science. 2001; 293: 2453-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 15.Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), suggesting that this modification may be stimulatory for transcription.Here we identify a complex of proteins that specifically binds to H3 tails and the binding of which is abrogated by lysine 4 methylation. Using mass spectrometry, we identify that this complex is the previously characterized repressor complex NuRD (nucleosomeremodeling and deacetylase). We postulate that the displacement of NuRD from histone tails may be the activatory mechanism of lysine 4 methylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptidesHistone peptides, trimethylated at different lysine residues, were made by G. Bloomberg (Bristol University, UK). The C terminus of the peptides contained a two-glycine spacer followed by a cysteine. Peptides were immobilized onto Sulfolink coupling gel (Pierce) via the C-terminal cysteine at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.Affinity Purification from HeLa Nuclear ExtractHeLa nuclear extract (Computer Cell Culture Center, Belgium) was diluted in IPH buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v)) to a final protein concentration of 4 mg/ml and precleared. Affinity purifications were done with 5 μl of Sepharose-linked peptide and 150 μl of diluted HeLa nuclear extract. Competitor peptide was added to a final concentration of 150 μg/ml, where used. The purifications were incubated for 90 min on a wheel at 4 °C and washed 3 times in IPH before resolution on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel. For column purification of complex, 2 ml of diluted HeLa nuclear extract was poured twice over a microcolumn of 100 μl of Sepharose-linked unmethylated H3 peptide. The column was washed with 4 column volumes of IPH, and bound proteins were eluted in 250 mm NaCl IPH. Eluted fractions containing the complex were made up to 150 μl in IPH and rebound to 5 μl of H3 peptide-Sepharose, as above. Bound proteins were visualized by silver staining as described previously (17.Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar).Mass Spectrometry Identification of ProteinsProteins that rebound unmethylated peptide after column purification were excised from an 8% Coomassie stained gel with a protein-free razor blade. Proteins were digested in-gel with trypsin. After overnight incubation at 30 °C, a 0.5-μl aliquot from the digest was spotted on the MALDI 1The abbreviations used are: MALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationCAF-1chromatin assembly factor 1HDAChistone deacetylase target for fingerprinting. The remaining digest was purified using C18 Zip-Tips prior electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Peptide mass fingerprints were taken with a MALDI instrument from Micromas fitted with delayed extraction, using α-cyanocinnamic acid dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as matrix. Collision-induced decomposition fragmentation spectra from peptides were taken with an ion-trap instrument (LCQ-Decca) from ThermoQuest. Protein data bases were searched with the mass spectrometry data using the programs Mascot (matrixscience.com, mass fingerprinting and fragmentation spectra) and Profound (129.85.19.192, mass fingerprinting data).Deacetylase AssaysHistone peptide affinity purifications from HeLa nuclear extract were resuspended in 100 μl of fresh IPH buffer containing 150,000 cpm of 3H-labeled acetylated H4 peptide. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 120 min with regular mixing. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 65 μl of acid mix (1 m HCl, 0.16 m acetic acid). 700 μl of ethyl acetate was added and tubes were vortexed vigorously for 20 s. Phases were separated by centrifugation at 13,500 rpm for 1 min. 500 μl of the upper phase (ethyl acetate) was removed and mixed with 1 ml of scintillant (OptiphaseTM, Wallac). Release of [3H]acetate from the H4 peptide was measured in counts per min using a scintillation counter (Beckman LS6000SC).Western Blots, Antibodies, and ImmunoprecipitationsBound proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted to nitrocellulose, and blocked overnight (4% nonfat milk, 0.5% Tween 20, v/v). Blots were probed with the following antibodies for 1 h at room temperature: anti-Rbap48 (Genetex, 11 g10, 1 μg/ml), anti-DNMT1 (NEB-231, 1 in 1000), anti-Sin3 (Santa Cruz 994, 1 μg/ml), and anti-p60 (T. Krude, 1 in 1000). Blots were washed in blocking buffer, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Abcam), and visualized with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). NuRD immunoprecipitations were done by incubating 500 μl of diluted HeLa nuclear extract with anti-MTA2 antibody (Santa Cruz 9447, 1 μg/ml) and 15 μl of protein A/G bead mix (Amersham Biosciences) for 5–12 h at 4 °C. Precipitations were washed 3 times with IPH before resolution on a 20% SDS-PAGE gel. After blotting to nitrocellulose and blocking (5% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, the blots were probed overnight with anti-MBD3 (Santa Cruz 9402, 1 μg/ml), anti-H3 2A. Bannister, unpublished data. (500 ng/ml), or anti-H4 (Abcam ab7311, 500 ng/ml). Blots were washed briefly with bovine serum albumin blocking buffer, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody, and visualized as above.RESULTSThe Histone H3 N Terminus Binds a Set of Proteins When Unmethylated at Lysine 4Our recent discovery that a function of methylation of lysine 9 is to recruit HP1 proteins specifically to histone tails (10.Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar) prompted us to ask whether methylation of other residues of H3 might recruit a different set of proteins to histone tails. Our approach was to use differently methylated histone peptides in pull-down assays from HeLa nuclear extract and analyze the bound proteins by silver stain. The histone peptides used were trimethylated at lysine 4 (K4), lysine 9 (K9), or both (K4+K9), and two control peptides of unmethylated H3 and H4 tails (Fig. 1A). These peptides were immobilized onto Sepharose beads via a C-terminal cysteine residue and used to affinity purify proteins from HeLa nuclear extract. Although there were some proteins that were specifically bound to the methylated peptides, we noticed a number of proteins that were specifically purified by the unmethylated H3 peptide (Fig. 1B, lane 1, marked by arrows). This set of proteins is also purified by the Lys-9 methylated H3 peptide (lane 4) but not by a peptide methylated at Lys-4 (lane 3) or Lys-4 and Lys-9 (lane 2) or by an unmethylated H4 peptide (lane 5). This suggests that these proteins only bind to histone H3 N termini when lysine 4 is unmethylated and that methylation of lysine 9 does not disrupt the binding of the complex.To confirm the specificity of the proteins binding to unmethylated H3 peptide, pull-down assays were done as in Fig. 1B, lane 1, in the presence or absence of competitor peptide. The set of proteins bound to the unmethylated peptide (Fig. 1C, lane 1) is competed away by peptides unmethylated at lys-4 (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 5) but not by peptides with a methylated Lys-4 (lanes 3 and 4). The competition experiment highlights those bands that are specific for unmethylated H3 (marked on left with arrow) and those bands that are nonspecific contaminants and cannot be competed away (marked on right with asterisk).The Set of Proteins Bound to Unmethylated H3 Tails Is the NuRD ComplexTo identify the components bound to unmethylated histone H3 we used mass spectrometry. For this purpose, the complex was purified from HeLa nuclear extract over a column of unmethylated H3 peptide. The column-purified complex, once eluted in high salt, was rebound to unmethylated peptide in a pull-down assay. The rebound components were resolved by SDS-PAGE and silver stained (Fig. 2A). This purified source of the complex was used for mass spectrometry identification of the components. The subunits of the complex identified in this way are indicated on the right of Fig. 2A. The subunits include the histone deacetylases HDAC1/2, the ATPase chromatin-remodeling enzyme Mi-2β, the RB-associated proteins Rbap48/46, the metastasis-associated antigens MTA1/2, and the methyl CpG binding domain MBD3. These components are all found in the previously characterized NuRD complex (18.Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D.

Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Proteins of the same molecular weight as bands B and K are present in other NuRD purifications (20.Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), and therefore the unmethylated H3 binding complex is indeed NuRD.Figure 2The unmethylated H3 binding complex is the NuRD complex. A, the complex was purified over a column of unmethylated H3 peptide and eluted by a stepwise salt gradient. Eluted fractions were used to rebind to the unmethylated histone H3 peptide. Identical samples of bound protein were run on an 8% PAGE gel and either silver stained, as shown here, or Coomassie stained. Coomassie stained bands were excised from the gel and subjected to mass spectrometry protein identification. The results of the analysis are shown on the right of the gel. B, the column-purified fraction used for A (Complex) was run on an 8% SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blotted in comparison to HeLa nuclear extract input (Input). C, peptide pull-down assays were done as for Fig. 1B. Bound protein was assayed for deacetylase activity, and released tritiated acetate was measured by scintillation counting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Several components of the NuRD complex have been identified in other deacetylase complexes (21.Knoepfler P.S. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1999; 99: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To investigate whether complexes other than NuRD are also being purified by our method, we probed the purified complex (Fig. 2A) with antibodies against other deacetylase complex components. As expected, the Rbap48 protein was detected (Fig. 2B, lane 1), whereas DNMT1 and Sin3 (present in distinct deacetylase complexes (22.Robertson K.D. Ait-Si-Ali S. Yokochi T. Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 23.Zhang Y. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Cell. 1997; 89: 357-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar)) were absent from the H3 purified complex (lanes 2 and 3). Rbap48 is also present in the CAF-1 (chromatin assembly factor 1) complex (24.Ridgway P. Almouzni G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2647-2658PubMed Google Scholar). However, a Western blot with the p60 subunit of CAF-1 did not detect CAF-1 in the H3 purified complex (lane 4).NuRD has deacetylase activity when immunopurified from extracts (18.Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar,20.Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol.

Nature. 1998; 395: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and also when purified using ion-exchange chromatography (26.Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Vermaak D. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 843-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this is thought to contribute to its repressive potential. To establish if NuRD still has deacetylase activity when affinity purified on unmethylated H3 peptide, we assayed peptide pull-down assays for deacetylase activity. Fig. 2C shows that the unmethylated H3 peptide did associate with a significant level of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity (lane 1). In contrast a peptide methylated at Lys-4 pulled down background levels of HDAC activity (Fig. 2C, lane 2). This suggests that the deacetylase activity of the NuRD complex is not compromised when it is associated with the unmethylated histone H3 tail.NuRD Complex Associates with Native Histone H3 Only When Unmethylated at Lysine 4To demonstrate that NuRD binds not only to histone N-terminal peptides but also to full-length native histone we asked if the NuRD complex can associate with histones when immunoprecipitated from HeLa nuclear extract. Previous studies have shown that the NuRD complex can be immunoprecipitated using anti-MTA2 antibodies (19.Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that MTA2 antibodies can precipitate MBD3 (a component of NuRD) as well as histone H3 and H4, as detected by Western blot with the respective antibodies (lane 1). The immunoprecipitated histones can be efficiently competed away by the unmethylated peptide but not by the Lys-4 methylated peptide (Fig. 3, lane 2 versus 3). These data suggest that the NuRD complex associates with unmethylated native histone H3 (and interacts indirectly with H4 via H3).Figure 3The NuRD complex binds histones via the unmethylated N terminus of H3. NuRD was immunoprecipitated (IP) from HeLa nuclear extract using an anti-MTA2 antibody, resolved on a 20% PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blotted for the presence of MBD3, histone H3, or histone H4. Lane 1 shows the immunoprecipitation in the absence of competitor peptide. Lanes 2 and 3 show immunoprecipitations done in the presence of unmethylated and Lys-4 methylated peptide competition, respectively, and lane 4 shows a nonspecific antibody immunoprecipitation control. Inputs (1%) were loaded on the same gel as lanes 1–4, and in each case input is the identical exposure as lanes 1–4.

The NuRD complex can be purified effectively following two rounds of affinity purification with the histone H3 peptide (Fig. 2A), suggesting a selective and avid interaction. The deacetylase activity associated with NuRD is not compromised following the association with histone H3 tails, suggesting that the complex may possess repressive activity while bound to histones. Although there are a number of repressive complexes containing histone deacetylases, our limited analysis provides no evidence of an interaction with a complex other than NuRD. We cannot exclude the possibility however that the association with other repressive complexes may be compromised under our conditions.The NuRD repressor complex is targeted to specific promoters by DNA binding transcriptional repressors (27.Ahringer J. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). This is likely to be the first step in transcriptional repression. The binding of NuRD to histone H3 may be necessary as a second step in repression because its deacetylase activity may aid the process of methylation at lysine 9 of histone H3 (9.Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar, 12.Nakayama J. Rice J.C. Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 292: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Such a model is consistent with the finding that the NuRD complex can associate with histone H3 when lysine 9 is methylated.The fact that lysine 4 methylation prevents the association of histone H3 with NuRD suggests a de-repressive mechanism by which lysine 4 methylation may stimulate transcription. In this model, lysine 4 methylation displaces the deacetylase activity of the NuRD repressor leading to the acetylation of lysine 9 and the occlusion of the HP1 repressor protein. The N-terminal tails of histones are multiply post-translationally modified. Such evolutionarily conserved modifications include phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation (1.Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar, 2.Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). The “histone code hypothesis” predicts that combinations of modifications on the histone N termini will serve as binding sites for different protein modules (1.Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar, 3.Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this differential binding of proteins to histone tails is proposed to affect chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation (4.Marmorstein R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Indeed bromodomains have been shown to bind to acetylated lysines in histone N-terminal tails (5.Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 6.Jacobson R.H. Ladurner A.G. King D.S. Tjian R. Science. 2000; 288: 1422-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), and in vivo data suggest that the bromodomain of GCN5 can target transcriptional activators to acetylated promoter regions (7.Syntichaki P. Topalidou I. Thireos G. Nature. 2000; 404: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although methylation of histone lysines was discovered over 35 years ago (8.Murray K. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), only recent studies have elucidated that the transcriptional repressor SUV39H1 can methylate lysine 9 of histone H3 (9.Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). In accordance with the histone code hypothesis, methyl lysine 9 of histone H3 provides a binding site for the chromodomain of HP1 (10.Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar, 11.Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). The binding of HP1 is essential for heterochromatic silencing (10.Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar, 12.Nakayama J. Rice J.C. Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 292: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar) and is also involved in the repression of euchromatic genes (13.Nielsen S.J. Schneider R. Bauer U.M. Bannister A.J. Morrison A. O'Carroll D. Firestein R. Cleary M. Jenuwein T. Herrera R.E. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 412: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Consistent with a repressive role for transcription, lysine 9 methylation is found at silent heterochromatic sites (14.Litt M.D. Simpson M. Gaszner M. Allis C.D. Felsenfeld G. Science. 2001; 293: 2453-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 15.Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 16.Peters A.H. Mermoud J.E. O'Carroll D. Pagani M. Schweizer D. Brockdorff N. Jenuwein T. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In contrast, methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 localizes to sites of active transcription (14.Litt M.D. Simpson M. Gaszner M. Allis C.D. Felsenfeld G. Science. 2001; 293: 2453-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 15.Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), suggesting that this modification may be stimulatory for transcription. Here we identify a complex of proteins that specifically binds to H3 tails and the binding of which is abrogated by lysine 4 methylation. Using mass spectrometry, we identify that this complex is the previously characterized repressor complex NuRD (nucleosomeremodeling and deacetylase). We postulate that the displacement of NuRD from histone tails may be the activatory mechanism of lysine 4 methylation. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptidesHistone peptides, trimethylated at different lysine residues, were made by G. Bloomberg (Bristol University, UK). The C terminus of the peptides contained a two-glycine spacer followed by a cysteine. Peptides were immobilized onto Sulfolink coupling gel (Pierce) via the C-terminal cysteine at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.Affinity Purification from HeLa Nuclear ExtractHeLa nuclear extract (Computer Cell Culture Center, Belgium) was diluted in IPH buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v)) to a final protein concentration of 4 mg/ml and precleared. Affinity purifications were done with 5 μl of Sepharose-linked peptide and 150 μl of diluted HeLa nuclear extract. Competitor peptide was added to a final concentration of 150 μg/ml, where used. The purifications were incubated for 90 min on a wheel at 4 °C and washed 3 times in IPH before resolution on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel. For column purification of complex, 2 ml of diluted HeLa nuclear extract was poured twice over a microcolumn of 100 μl of Sepharose-linked unmethylated H3 peptide. The column was washed with 4 column volumes of IPH, and bound proteins were eluted in 250 mm NaCl IPH. Eluted fractions containing the complex were made up to 150 μl in IPH and rebound to 5 μl of H3 peptide-Sepharose, as above. Bound proteins were visualized by silver staining as described previously (17.Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar).Mass Spectrometry Identification of ProteinsProteins that rebound unmethylated peptide after column purification were excised from an 8% Coomassie stained gel with a protein-free razor blade. Proteins were digested in-gel with trypsin. After overnight incubation at 30 °C, a 0.5-μl aliquot from the digest was spotted on the MALDI 1The abbreviations used are: MALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationCAF-1chromatin assembly factor 1HDAChistone deacetylase target for fingerprinting. The remaining digest was purified using C18 Zip-Tips prior electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Peptide mass fingerprints were taken with a MALDI instrument from Micromas fitted with delayed extraction, using α-cyanocinnamic acid dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as matrix. Collision-induced decomposition fragmentation spectra from peptides were taken with an ion-trap instrument (LCQ-Decca) from ThermoQuest. Protein data bases were searched with the mass spectrometry data using the programs Mascot (matrixscience.com, mass fingerprinting and fragmentation spectra) and Profound (129.85.19.192, mass fingerprinting data).Deacetylase AssaysHistone peptide affinity purifications from HeLa nuclear extract were resuspended in 100 μl of fresh IPH buffer containing 150,000 cpm of 3H-labeled acetylated H4 peptide. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 120 min with regular mixing. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 65 μl of acid mix (1 m HCl, 0.16 m acetic acid). 700 μl of ethyl acetate was added and tubes were vortexed vigorously for 20 s. Phases were separated by centrifugation at 13,500 rpm for 1 min. 500 μl of the upper phase (ethyl acetate) was removed and mixed with 1 ml of scintillant (OptiphaseTM, Wallac).

This disrupted normal epithelial cell behavior, and mutant cell clones dispersed into the surrounding wild-type tissue. Rap1 is enriched at adherens junctions, particularly between newly divided sister cells where it may reseal the adherens junction ring.

For example, in Parkinson’s disease, iron levels are increased and magnesium levels are reduced in the brains of patients.

Parkinson's disease Parkinson’s disease (PD)1Hoehn M.M. Yahr M.D. Neurology. 1998; 50: 318-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar is a common motor disorder that affects about 1% of population over the age of 65 (1). The disease is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration predominantly affecting dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system (2Gibb W. Lees A. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psych. 1988; 51: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (2840) Google Scholar). The degenerating neurons develop intracellular inclusions, termed Lewy bodies, which are composed of a dense core of filamentous and granular material (3Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that α-synuclein is a major filamentous component of Lewy bodies (3Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6265) Google Scholar). Genetic studies suggest that α-synuclein plays a key role in the pathophysiology of PD, because mutations in α-synuclein, at A53T or A30P, are associated with early-onset familial PD (5Polymeropoulos M.H.

The accumulation of aggregated protein underlies the pathophysiology of many neurodegenerative disorders, and increasing evidence suggests that aggregated α-synuclein plays a key role in the pathophysiology of PD. α-Synuclein has a strong tendency to aggregate and does so spontaneously in vitro at a slow rate (7Hashimoto M. Hsu L. Sisk A. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Brain Res. 1998; 799: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 8Wood S. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J. Citron M. Biere A. J. Biol.

U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Both the A53T and the A30P mutations in PD increase the tendency of α-synuclein to aggregate. Many studies in cultured neurons, and some studies in transgenic animals, suggest that α-synuclein aggregation is linked to cellular toxicity and neurodegeneration (10Ostrerova-Golts N. Petrucelli L. Hardy J. Lee J. Farrer M. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6048-6054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A.

In cell culture, formation of α-synuclein aggregates correlates with cell injury (10Ostrerova-Golts N. Petrucelli L. Hardy J. Lee J. Farrer M. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6048-6054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpressing α-synuclein in Drosophila leads to an age-dependent accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein and associated neurodegeneration (12Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Masliah and colleagues also observed that aggregated α-synuclein is associated with loss of markers in dopaminergic neurons, although other studies of α-synuclein overexpression in transgenic mice have been less conclusive (11Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 13Kahle P.J. Neumann M. Ozmen L.

Thus, increasing lines of evidence suggest that aggregation of α-synuclein is associated with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and suggest that α-synuclein contributes to the neurodegenerative processes occurring in PD. Recombinant α-synuclein aggregates spontaneously following prolonged incubation in vitro. Recently, we and others have shown that α-synuclein also aggregates rapidly following exposure to Fe(II) (10Ostrerova-Golts N. Petrucelli L. Hardy J. Lee J. Farrer M. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6048-6054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Paik S.R. Shin H.J. Lee J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In vitro, Fe(II) accelerates the rate of α-synuclein aggregation. For example, similar amounts of aggregation are inducedin vitro by incubating 23 μm α-synuclein alone for 30 days or with 50 μm FeCl2 for only 3 days, suggesting that 50 μm Fe(II) increases the rate of α-synuclein aggregation about 10-fold (see discussion below). These observations suggest that interaction with iron could greatly accelerate α-synuclein aggregation. The factors regulating α-synuclein aggregation in the brain are poorly understood. Some studies suggest that neurotoxins, such as the pesticide rotenone or paraquat, stimulate α-synuclein aggregation (16Li V.N. Uversky J. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The involvement of metals in PD suggests that metals might also play a role in the aggregation of α-synuclein and the pathophysiology of PD. Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to metals is associated with PD. For instance, individuals with industrial exposure to iron, copper, and/or lead have high rates of PD (17Gorell J.M. Johnson C.C. Rybicki B.A. Peterson E.L. Kortsha G.X. Brown G.G. Richardson R.J. Neurotoxicology. 1999; 20: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar). Neuropathological studies show that synucleinopathies are generally associated with iron accumulation, which is consistent with a pathological link between iron and α-synuclein (18Duda J.E. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Brains from patients with PD, type I iron storage disease (Hallorvorden-Spatz disorder), and multiple systems atrophy all show increased iron content (19Galvin J.E. Giasson B. Hurtig H.I. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 361-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In PD the levels of iron are increased over controls, and Fe(II) has been identified as a major component of Lewy bodies (20Castellani R. Siedlak S. Perry G. Smith M.

How iron contributes to Lewy body formation and the pathophysiology of PD, though, is not understood. In the experiments described below, we examine the regulation of α-synuclein aggregation using both spontaneous and iron-induced α-synuclein aggregation in vitro and show contrasting actions of iron and magnesium on α-synuclein aggregation. These studies have important implications for the pathophysiology of PD and other synucleionopathies. α-Synuclein (wild-type, A53T, and A30P) was cloned into the NcoI/NotI site of the Pro-Ex His 6 vector (Invitrogen). To generate recombinant α-synuclein, BPer (Pierce) reagent was used to solubilize the recombinant α-synuclein from the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced bacterial lysates, which were then passed over a nickel-agarose column for purification. All spectrophotometric analysis were repeated three to five times. Cells were harvested with SDS lysis solution (2% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 μm AEBSF). The amount of protein was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce), 5–30 μg per lane was run on 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (200 mA, 12 h). The nitrocellulose was then incubated 1 h in 5% I-block (Tropix)/phosphate-buffered saline, washed, incubated overnight in primary antibody, washed, then incubated 3 h in peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and developed with chemiluminescent reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For analysis of aggregation using thioflavine-T, 23 nm α-synuclein was incubated in 10 μm thioflavine-T (in 50 mm glycine, pH 8.5) and measured by fluorescence (λex = 440, λem = 450–600 nm). To analyze aggregation of α-synuclein by filtration, samples were diluted into 100 μl of water, filtered through cellulose acetate (0.2 μm pore size), washed with 200 μl phosphate-buffered saline, and then immunoblotted as described above. To understand factors regulating α-synuclein aggregation, we investigated the interaction of different metals with α-synuclein using tyrosine fluorescence (27Garzon-Rodriguez W. Yatsimirsky A. Glabe C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let. 1999; 9: 2243-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15498-15505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine fluorescence has been used to monitor the association of various metals with a number of proteins, including Aβ, α-transducin and, more recently, α-synuclein (27Garzon-Rodriguez W. Yatsimirsky A. Glabe C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let. 1999; 9: 2243-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22680-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In these studies tyrosine fluorescence is used as an indicator of changes in protein conformation or binding of metals. Exciting tyrosine at 280 nm elicits fluorescence that peaks at 310 nm for monomeric tyrosine and at 350–400 nm for tyrosinate (30Szabo A.G. Lynn K.R. Krajcarski D.T. Rayner D.M. FEBS Lett. 1978; 94: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The fluorescence spectrum of α-synuclein yielded fluorescence peaks at 310 and 375 nm (Fig.1, A and B). Tyrosinate reactivity occurs when the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine forms hydrogen bonds with carboxyl groups in nearby aspartates or glutamates. The fluorescence peak of α-synuclein at 375 nm showed a pH dependence similar to that of tyrosinate (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with the pH dependence of fluorescence due to tyrosinate. The peak at 375 nm had the highest intrinsic fluorescence at low pH and showed little change in fluorescence at pH > 7.0 (Fig. 1C). Further studies confirmed that the peak at 375 nm is not due to tyrosine dimerization, because both gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry of the α-synuclein showed that the α-synuclein was monomeric (Fig. 1D, Coomassie gel of recombinant α-synuclein shown), and in addition, tyrosine dimerization of α-synuclein reduced its intrinsic fluorescence (Fig.1, E and F, described further below). These results suggest that the peak at 375 nm is due to tyrosinate, which could result from proton transfer from the phenolic hydroxyl to aspartic or glutamic acid protein acceptors (30Szabo A.G. Lynn K.R. Krajcarski D.T. Rayner D.M. FEBS Lett. 1978; 94: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Next we used the fluorescence to examine the interaction of α-synuclein with metals. We observed three classes of interaction with α-synuclein. Class I metals included iron (Fe(II) and Fe(III)) and copper (Cu(II)) and decreased the fluorescence at both 310 and 375 nm (Fig. 1A). Class II metals included magnesium, zinc, and calcium, and increased the fluorescence at 375 nm, but did not affect the fluorescence at 310 nm (Figs.2A and 3A). Class III metals included nickel and manganese and did not affect α-synuclein fluorescence (data not shown). We proceeded to examine the fluorescence of α-synuclein in more detail to determine whether the metal induced changes α-synuclein fluorescence reflected interaction with metals or some other process, such as tyrosine dimerization. To examine whether the changes in fluorescence could be explained by tyrosine dimerization, we exposed monomeric α-synuclein to 312 nm light for 2 h (which is a process that induces tyrosine dimerization) and analyzed the emission fluorescence spectrum with excitation at either 280 or 315 nm. The emission spectrum derived using excitation at 280 nm showed that ultraviolet-irradiation reduced α-synuclein fluorescence strongly at 375 nm, but only weakly at 310 nm (Fig. 1E). The contrast between the changes in fluorescence induced by ultraviolet irradiation and by metals suggests that the changes in α-synuclein fluorescence induced by metals are not due to tyrosine dimerization. Analysis of the emission fluorescence spectrum of α-synuclein following excitation at 315 nm showed a reduced fluorescence at 380 nm for the ultraviolet-irradiated α-synuclein (Fig. 1F). In contrast, iron increased, rather than decreased, the fluorescence of α-synuclein as measured using the 315 nm excitation. These data indicate that the iron-induced quenching of α-synuclein fluorescence is not due to cross-linking of α-synuclein mediated by tyrosine dimerization.Figure 3The effects of zinc on α-synuclein fluorescence and dimerization. A, incubating zinc or calcium with recombinant α-synuclein increases the peak of α-synuclein emission fluorescence at 375 nm in a graded manner, using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (λex = 280 nm; λem 290–450 nm). B, immunoblot of recombinant α-synuclein after incubation with zinc shows formation of a 32-kDa band consistent with formation of an SDS-resistant α-synuclein dimer.

There is a small amount of binding of iron to α-synuclein between 1–10 μm Fe(II), which is a range that could be physiologically relevant (intracellular free iron is about 1.5 μm) (31Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Leedman P.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The effect of magnesium on α-synuclein differed dramatically from that of iron. Magnesium increased the fluorescence at 375 nm but did not affect the fluorescence at 310 nm (Fig. 2A). Binding of magnesium to α-synuclein was also striking because the tyrosine fluorescence showed a sharp stepwise increase between 60 and 80 μm of magnesium indicating cooperative binding (Fig.2A). The cooperative regulation of tyrosine fluorescence, specifically at 375 nm, suggests that magnesium causes a conformational change in synuclein differing from that induced by iron. Co-incubating 80 μm magnesium with iron did not prevent iron-induced quenching of α-synuclein tyrosine fluorescence and in fact increased affinity of α-synuclein for iron from 173 to 50 μm(Fig. 2B). These data suggest that iron and magnesium bind to different sites on α-synuclein. Zinc and calcium also increased the fluorescence of α-synuclein at 375 nm, but showed a more graded pattern of interaction (Fig.3A). Jensen and colleagues recently noted a similar pattern of binding of calcium to α-synuclein (29Nielsen M.S. Vorum H. Lindersson E. Jensen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22680-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Interestingly, immunoblots of recombinant α-synuclein following incubation with zinc showed that zinc induced formation of a prominent band at 32 kDa, consistent with formation of an SDS-resistant α-synuclein dimer (Fig. 3B). Neither magnesium nor calcium induced formation of SDS-resistant dimers identifiable by immunoblot (data not shown). We also examined how the A53T mutation in human α-synuclein affected binding of iron and magnesium. The A53T mutation did not change the apparent affinity of iron for α-synuclein (data not shown), but did abolish the interaction between magnesium and α-synuclein (Fig.2C). Previous studies have shown that the A53T mutation changes the conformation of α-synuclein by increasing its helical content (5Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Di Duvoisin R.C. Iorio G. Golbe L.I. Nussbaum R.L. Science. 1997; 276: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (6732) Google Scholar). These conformational changes might either reduce binding of magnesium to α-synuclein or prevent the conformational change associated with binding of magnesium to α-synuclein. The differing effects of magnesium and iron on the fluorescence spectrum of α-synuclein suggested to us that magnesium and iron might also induce different conformational states. We hypothesized that the conformational changes induced by binding of magnesium to α-synuclein might inhibit α-synuclein aggregation. To test this, we examined whether magnesium could inhibit the spontaneous aggregation of α-synuclein. α-Synuclein (23 μm) was incubated for 30 days at 37° ± MgCl2 (500 μm). To measure the amount of aggregation, the α-synuclein was diluted to 23 nm in the presence of 10 μm thioflavine-T (in 50 mm glycine pH 8.5), and the fluorescence spectrum was measured. The solution of aged α-synuclein showed a strong fluorescence peak at 480, indicating the presence of abundant β-pleated sheet structures (Fig.4A). Prior experiments have shown that the spontaneous aggregation of α-synuclein proceeds through a mechanism involving β-pleated sheet formation, and that thioflavine-T, which binds to proteins with β-pleated sheet structure, accurately measures α-synuclein aggregation (9Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Using thioflavine-T we observed that samples incubated in the presence of magnesium showed only base-line levels of fluorescence, indicating that magnesium prevented the formation of β-pleated sheet structures and the aggregation of α-synuclein (Fig. 4A). To verify that the magnesium was inhibiting α-synuclein aggregation, we measured the amount of aggregated α-synuclein in each sample by capturing the aggregates with 0.2-μm cellulose acetate filters, measuring the amount of retained α-synuclein by dot blot, and quantitating the resulting optical density. The results of the cellulose acetate assay paralleled the thioflavine-T assay and showed that magnesium prevented the spontaneous aggregation of α-synuclein (Fig. 4, B andC). Thus, two independent methods show that magnesium inhibits the spontaneous aggregation of α-synuclein in vitro. Magnesium was also able to prevent iron-induced α-synuclein aggregation. α-Synuclein (8 μm) was incubated with 50 μm FeCl2 for 72 h and then analyzed by thioflavine-T fluorescence or cellulose acetate. In both cases, α-synuclein samples co-incubated with 500 μm magnesium chloride showed little aggregation (Fig.5, A and B). The amount of thioflavine-T fluorescence induced by iron was less than that induced by spontaneously aggregated α-synuclein, which likely indicates that spontaneously induced α-synuclein contains more β-pleated sheet structure. Indeed analysis of iron-induced α-synuclein aggregates by circular dichroism did not show formation of β-pleated sheet structures, which suggests formation of a more amorphous aggregate (Fig. 5, C and D). These data suggest that magnesium inhibits the formation of α-synuclein aggregates containing either β-pleated sheet structure (via spontaneous aggregation) or amorphous structure (via iron-induced aggregation). We also examined aggregation by immunoblot analysis, which has been successfully used to examine aggregation of α-synuclein, as well as aggregation of other proteins implicated in neurodegenerative disease, such as the huntingtin and PrP proteins (29Nielsen M.S.

In these assays, wild-type recombinant α-synuclein (8 μm) was incubated with 0–3 mm FeCl2 and 0 or 100 μm MgCl2 for 24 h at 37 °C. The samples were immunoblotted with anti-α-synuclein antibody, and the total amount of α-synuclein reactivity above 46 kDa (which includes structures larger than a dimers) was quantified by video densitometry (Fig. 6, A and B). We observed a reduction in formation of high molecular weight immunoreactivity of α-synuclein at all but the highest dose of iron (n = 3, p < 0.0001). These results support the hypothesis that magnesium inhibits aggregation of α-synuclein induced following treatment with iron. Since we did not observe interaction between magnesium and A53T α-synuclein using tyrosine fluorescence, we tested whether aggregation of recombinant A53T α-synuclein was also insensitive to magnesium. We incubated recombinant A53T α-synuclein with 0–3 mm FeCl2 and 0 or 100 μmMgCl2 for 24 h, then immunoblotted the α-synuclein and quantified aggregation by video densitometry, as described above (Fig. 6, C and D). We did not observe consistent inhibition of iron-induced aggregation of A53T α-synuclein by magnesium. This suggests that magnesium cannot inhibit iron-induced aggregation of A53T α-synuclein. These data demonstrate that iron (II), magnesium, zinc, and calcium all interact with α-synuclein. Our data primarily rely on tyrosine fluorescence as a measure of the interaction of α-synuclein with metals. The Ki of α-synuclein for iron is 173 μm, and the Ki of magnesium for α-synuclein is between 60 and 80 μm. These affinities are consistent with an affinity of α-synuclein for calcium, determined by Nielson and colleagues (29Nielsen M.S. Vorum H. Lindersson E. Jensen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22680-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Nielson and colleagues also confirmed their tyrosine fluorescence studies using equilibrium dialysis; our attempts at using equilibrium dialysis were stymied by extensive binding of α-synuclein to dialysis membranes. However, the studies of Nielson and colleagues show that tyrosine fluorescence provides an accurate indication of metal-synuclein binding interactions. The apparent affinity of α-synuclein for magnesium is strong enough to allow interaction of α-synuclein with magnesium in living cells, where the average intracellular concentration of magnesium is about 0.5 mm. This suggests that this interaction could have physiological significance. Although binding of magnesium to α-synuclein occurs at a concentration range that is physiologically significant, the concentration of free iron in the cell is much lower (<1.5 μm), which is far below the affinity of α-synuclein for iron that we observed (173 μm) (36Ponka P. Beaumont C. Richardson D. Semin. Hematol. 1998; 35: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar). However, studies using cell culture and neuropathology both suggest that α-synuclein interacts with iron. Incubating cells with iron induces α-synuclein aggregation in viable cells, which suggests that the concentration of iron in a cell is sufficient to induce α-synuclein aggregation under some conditions. In addition, α-synuclein aggregates in iron type I storage disease, and iron co-localizes with α-synuclein in Lewy bodies (19Galvin J.E. Giasson B. Hurtig H.I. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 361-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although it is unclear how α-synuclein might interact with iron in the living cell, it is possible that cofactors increase the affinity of α-synuclein for iron sufficient to allow a physiological interaction. Many other factors might also affect the behavior of α-synuclein. For instance, binding to lipids and phosphorylation or binding to β-synuclein have all been shown to change the biochemistry of α-synuclein, and these agents might increase its affinity for iron (44Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Mante M. Mallory M. Masliah E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Our preliminary studies examining magnesium already provide a hint of modulation. TheKi of iron (II) drops to 50 μm in the presence of magnesium. Future studies might unravel the biochemistry of α-synuclein further. Although binding of magnesium appears to introduce a conformation that promotes binding of iron, this same conformational change inhibits aggregation of α-synuclein. We hypothesize that magnesium either changes the conformation of α-synuclein to one that resists aggregation or induces dimerization to a structure that resists aggregation (Fig. 7). The ability of zinc to induce SDS-resistant α-synuclein dimers, coupled with the similarity the changes in tyrosine fluorescence observed with magnesium and zinc, suggest that magnesium might induce dimerization of α-synuclein in a manner similar to that of zinc. Future studies using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy will need to be performed to investigate further how magnesium affects the conformation of α-synuclein. The most important observation made in this paper is that magnesium inhibits the aggregation of α-synuclein. This observation is supported by our use of four independent lines of investigation (immunoblot, cellulose acetate filtration, and thioflavine-T fluorescence). The type of aggregate measured by each assay likely differs slightly. Immunoblotting detects aggregates that are stable enough to resist both heating and SDS. Cellulose acetate filtration and thioflavine-T are more gentle methods that can detect both stable aggregates and also aggregates that might be re-dissolved by SDS. Thioflavine-T recognizes aggregate with a β-pleated sheet structure. Interestingly, spontaneously aggregated α-synuclein shows much more fluorescence by thioflavine-T than iron-induced aggregate, suggesting that the former has more β-pleated sheet structure. We have also taken care to examine two forms of α-synuclein aggregation: spontaneous and iron-induced aggregation. Many studies show that α-synuclein has a strong tendency to spontaneously aggregate, and this is the most widely accepted method for inducing α-synuclein aggregation (7Hashimoto M. Hsu L. Sisk A. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Brain Res. 1998; 799: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 8Wood S. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J. Citron M. Biere A. J. Biol.

Metal-induced aggregation has only been investigated by a small number of groups, but is perhaps the only method currently available for inducing α-synuclein aggregation in cultured cells (10Ostrerova-Golts N. Petrucelli L. Hardy J. Lee J. Farrer M. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6048-6054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Paik S.R. Shin H.J. Lee J.H. Arch. Biochem.

The ability of magnesium to inhibit α-synuclein aggregation induced by both protocols (spontaneous and iron-induced) suggests that this is a robust phenomenon. Increasing evidence suggests that metals play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Zinc and copper greatly accelerate aggregation of β-amyloid and might play a critical role in neurotoxicity induced by β-amyloid (38Atwood C. Moir R. Huang X. Scarpa R. Bacarra N. Romano D.

Iron levels are increased in brains of patients with PD, and iron is present in Lewy bodies. Neuromelanin selectively binds Fe(III) and might liberate Fe(II) as the Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) (via the Haber Weiss reaction) by free radicals produced in response to the oxidative stress associated with PD, providing a potential source of Fe(II) to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation (42Hirsch E.C.

Classical models of craniofacial development argue that the neural crest is prepatterned or preprogrammed to make specific head structures before its migration from the neural tube. In contrast, recent studies in several vertebrates have provided evidence for plasticity in patterning neural crest populations. Using tissue transposition and molecular analyses in avian embryos, we reconcile these findings by demonstrating that classical manipulation experiments, which form the basis of the prepatterning model, involved transplantation of a local signaling center, the isthmic organizer. FGF8 signaling from the isthmus alters Hoxa2 expression and consequently branchial arch patterning, demonstrating that neural crest cells are patterned by environmental signals."

It has been suggested that these pathological changes are caused by “metabolic stroke” due to accumulation of toxic organic acids (8.Heidenreich R. Natowicz M. Hainline B.E. Berman P. Kelley R.I. Hillman R.E. Berry G.T. J. Pediatr. 1988; 113: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A recent study has supported this hypothesis, demonstrating restricted diffusion and elevated amounts of lactate in globus pallidus of affected patients signaling mitochondrial dysfunction (9.Trinh B.C. Melhem E.R. Barker P.B. Am. J. Neuroradiol. 2001; 22: 831-833PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, symmetrical lesion in the basal ganglia are also found in patients with inherited complex II deficiency (10.Martin J.J. van de Vyver F.L. Scholte H.R. Roodhooft A.M. Martin C.C. Luyt-Houwen I.E. J. Neurol. Sci. 1988; 84: 189-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The neuropathogenesis of methylmalonic acidurias remains unclear but MMA, which reaches millimolar concentrations in body fluids and brain tissue during acute metabolic crises, was recently suggested to act as an endogenous toxic metabolite, mediating neuronal damage via inhibition of mitochondrial energy metabolism (11.Wajner M. Coelho J.C. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1997; 20: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In particular, MMA-induced inhibition of complex II (succinate dehydrogenase, EC1.3.99.1), which is imparted in the TCA cycle and the mitochondrial respiratory chain, has become a focus of interest (12.Dutra J.C. Dutra-Filho C.S. Cardozo S.E.C. Wannmacher C.M.D. Sarkis J.J.F. Wajner M. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). MMA induces cell damage in different neuronal culture systems (13.McLaughlin B.A. Nelson D. Silver J.A. Erecinska M. Chesselet M.F. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 276-290Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14.Kölker S. Ahlemeyer B. Krieglstein J. Hoffmann G.F. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intrastriatal injections of MMA evokes rotational behavior, seizures, and striatal lesions in rats (15.De Mello C.F. Begnini J. Jimenez-Bernal R.E. Rubin M.A. de Bastiani J. da Costa Jr., E. Wajner M. Brain Res. 1996; 721: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16.Narasimhan P. Sklar R. Murrell M. Swanson R.A. Sharp F.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7336-7346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MMA-induced changes can be prevented by succinate,N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade, and antioxidants (15.De Mello C.F. Begnini J. Jimenez-Bernal R.E. Rubin M.A. de Bastiani J. da Costa Jr., E. Wajner M. Brain Res. 1996; 721: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17.Fighera M.R. Queiroz C.M. Stracke M.P. Brauer M.C. Gonzalez-Rodriquez L.L. Frussa-Filho R. Wajner M. de Mello C.F. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2039-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Consequently, MMA has been suggested to induce secondary (indirect) excitotoxicity (18.Albin R.L. Greenamyre J.T. Neurology. 1992; 42: 733-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in analogy to the complex II inhibitors malonate (MA) (19.Greene J.G. Porter R.H. Eller R.V. Greenamyre J.T. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and 3-nitropropionate (20.Beal M.F. Brouillet E. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W. Miller J.M. Storey E. Srivastava R. Rosen B.R. Hyman B. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4181-4191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, previous studies have failed to clarify whether MMA inhibits complex II directly or indirectly via intracellular formation of other metabolites. In the present study, we provide evidence that neuropathogenesis of methylmalonic aciduria may involve an inhibition of complex II and the TCA cycle by accumulating toxic organic acids, and synergistic secondary excitotoxic mechanisms. Primary striatal cell cultures were prepared from embryonic (E18) rats as previously described (21.Farkas L.M. Suter-Crazzolara C. Unsicker K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, pregnant Han-Wistar rats were killed by CO2 asphyxia and embryos were collected in ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen, Eggenstein, Germany). Striata were dissociated by 0.25% trypsin and subsequently triturated with fire-polished pasteur pipettes. Cells in the supernatant were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in serum-free Neurobasal medium containing the B27 supplement (22.Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml glutamine (all obtained from Invitrogen). Cells were seeded at a density of 150,000 cells/cm2 onto 24-well plates (Costar, Bodenheim, Germany) coated with polyornithine and laminin (Invitrogen). Cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. On the second day in vitro (DIV), cultures were treated with 1 μm cytosine β-arabinofuranosid (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) for 24 h to inhibit glial proliferation. Animal care followed the official governmental guidelines and was approved by the government ethics committee. Vulnerability to NMDA and MA during culture period was investigated at DIV 3, 7, 10, and 14. Neurons were incubated for 1 h with NMDA in Mg2+-free HEPES-buffered saline, containing 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2 × 2 H2O, 10 mmd-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 μm glycine in deionized water (adjusted to pH 7.4). Thereafter, HEPES-buffered saline was removed and cells were grown in B27-free Neurobasal medium for another 23 h. In sister cultures, neurons were incubated with 1 mm MA (in B27-free Neurobasal medium) for 24 h. Based on these data (Fig. 1 A), all subsequent experiments were performed at DIV 10. Next, striatal neurons were exposed to 0.1–10 mm MMA or MA (in B27-free Neurobasal medium) for 24 h in sister cultures. In further experiments, MMA (10 mm) was co-incubated with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (10 μm; Tocris, Bristol, UK), the non-NMDA receptor antagonist CNQX (50 μm; Tocris), the metabotropic GluR antagonist L-AP3 (50 μm; Tocris), succinate (0.1–10 mm; Sigma), B27 supplement or glutamate (0.01–1 mm; Sigma) for 24 h. Cell viability of striatal neurons was determined by the trypan blue (0.5% in phosphate-buffered saline; Invitrogen) exclusion method after an incubation of 24 h with MMA or MA or 23 h after the incubation with NMDA as previously described (23.Kölker S. Ahlemeyer B. Krieglstein J. Hoffmann G.F. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 47: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, the number of stained (non-viable) and unstained (viable) neurons were counted under a microscope (1,000–1,500 neurons in randomly chosen subfields; n = 10) without knowledge of the treatment. Cell viability of controls was normalized to 100%. Protein was determined according to Lowry et al. (24.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.R. Farr A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of respiratory chain complex II was investigated in submitochondrial particles (SMPs) from bovine heart, using phenazine methosulfate (PMS) (25.Sorensen R.G. Mahler H.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1982; 14: 527-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or decylubiquinone (DBQ) (26.Ziegler D. Rieske J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 231-235Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27.Kölker S. Okun J.G. Hörster F. Assmann B. Kohlmüller D. Exner-Camps S. Ahlemeyer B. Mayatepek E. Krieglstein J. Hoffmann G.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as electron mediators. In brief, steady state activities of mitochondrial complex II were recorded using a computer tunable spectrophotometer (Versamax Microplate Reader, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) operating in the dual wavelength mode. Reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol was detected at 610–750 nm (ε = 22.0 mmol/liter−1 × cm−1) in thermostatted 96-well plates in a final volume of 300 μl (n = 8–16 experiments). SMPs were diluted to a final protein concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm NaN3, and 20 mm sodium succinate. SMP dilution was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, 15 μg of SMP were added into each well. The reaction was started by addition of 300 μl of reaction mixture, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (adjusted to pH 7.4), 20 mm sodium succinate, 2 mm NaN3, 60 mmdichlorophenolindophenol with (A) 500 μm PMS or (B) 0.01% Triton X-100 and 40 μm DBQ. Inhibitors were applied: 1) to the SMP dilution or 2) to the reaction mixtures A or B. To investigate the pH dependence of complex II activity at pH 5–10, Tris-HCl was replaced by 50 mm of a multibuffer mixture, containing 10 mm of CAPS, MES, CHES, EPPS, and MOPS. Spectrophotometric analysis of single respiratory chain complexs I and III-V were determined in SMPs as previously described (27.Kölker S. Okun J.G. Hörster F. Assmann B. Kohlmüller D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2625-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) using the same equipment as described above. Mean standard activities (units/mg total protein,n = 8–16) were as follows: complex I (1.24), complex III (24.0), complex IV (15.0), and complex V (0.50). The addition of standard respiratory chain inhibitors (2-n-decylquinazolin-4-yl-amine, antimycin A, NaCN, or oligomycin) revealed a good inhibitory response (93–100% of control activity, p < 0.001 versus respective controls). The effect of MA or MMA on single complex activities was subsequently investigated. Organic acid analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on a DB-5 applied capillary column (inner diameter: 30 m × 0.25 mm; J&W, Cologne, Germany) connected to a Hewlett-Packard MSD 5972A mass-selective dectector (Hewlett-Packard, Waldbronn, Germany). The starting column temperature was 80 °C (4 min) and temperature program was as follows: 4 °C/min to 264 °C, total run time 50 min. Injection (volume: 1 μl) was splitless, injector temperature 280 °C, transfer line 290 °C, carrier gas helium with a flow of 0.7 ml/min, electron impact 70 eV. Primary striatal cell cultures (DIV 10) were incubated for 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 h with 10 mm MMA. Thereafter, medium was removed and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were harvested by addition of phosphate-buffered saline, containing 0.1% SDS. Protein content was determined according to Lowry et al. (24.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.R. Farr A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deuterated MMA (total amount: 25 nmol) was added to the cell homogenate (980 μl with 0.8–1.0 mg/ml total protein). Samples of 1 ml, containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), 0.1% SDS, deuterated MMA (25 nmol), MA and MCA (total amounts each: 0, 5, 10, and 200 nmol) were used for external calibration. Correlation coefficients of standard curves were >0.995. To precipitate the protein and SDS, 200 μl of HCl (5 m) and 200 μl of KCl (1 m) were added to the homogenates and the calibration samples. The solutions were centrifuged for 15 min at 5,000 ×g max. Pellets were discarded and the supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen for lyophilization. After removing the water, the white solid residue was suspended in 250 μl of ethanol. After centrifugation for 15 min at 5,000 ×g max, supernatants were filtered using a syringe-driven filter unit (Millex-GV, 22 μm; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). Subsequently, ethanol was vaporized at 65 °C by a nitrogen flow. The dried residues were dissolved by the addition of 50 μl of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilylheptafluorobutyramide (Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany) and silylated for 1 h at 65 °C. Subsequently, silylated samples (1 μl) were injected into the GC-MS unit. Organic acid were quantitated by use of the applied standards. To investigate MMA-induced effects on the mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids, human skin fibroblast cultures were prepared and the differentiation of the acylcarnitine profile by tandem mass spectrometry was performed as previously described (27.Kölker S. Okun J.G. Hörster F. Assmann B. Kohlmüller D. Exner-Camps S. Ahlemeyer B. Mayatepek E. Krieglstein J. Hoffmann G.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibroblast cultures from healthy volunteers (n = 10) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (all from Invitrogen). After reaching confluency, cultures were incubated with unlabeled palmitic acid,l-carnitine, and bovine serum albumin (all from Sigma) as substrates as well as with MMA (1–10 mm) or vehicle for 96 h. Thereafter, the acylcarnitine pattern of the culture media was determined using an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE SCIEX API 365 LC/MS/MS system; MDS Sciex, Concord, Canada) as previously described (27.Kölker S. Okun J.G. Hörster F. Assmann B. Kohlmüller D. Exner-Camps S. Ahlemeyer B. Mayatepek E. Krieglstein J. Hoffmann G.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 666-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Experiments were performed at least in triplicate, except for GC-MS analysis, which was performed in duplicate. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Scheffé's test (for three or more groups) or Student's t test (for two groups) were calculated using SPSS for Windows 10.0 software. p < 0.05 was considered significant. pH dependence of complex II activity was analyzed using the Psiplot software 5.02a. We first established a time course in the vulnerability of cultured striatal neurons by exposing cultures at different time points (DIV 3, 7, 10, and 14) with 1 mm NMDA for 1 h or with 1 mm MA for 24 h (Fig. 1 A). NMDA-induced cell damage determined by trypan blue exclusion increased from DIV 3 to DIV 10 (5–60% cell damage). Cell numbers remained stable between DIV 10 and DIV 14 (60–68%). Similarly, MA-induced neuronal damage increased from DIV 3 to DIV 14 (24–58%). However, this increase was not as pronounced as for NMDA (Fig. 1 A). All subsequent experiments were performed at DIV 10. Next, we determined the effects of MMA and MA (0.1–10 mm; 24 h) on cell viability of striatal neuronal cultures (Fig. 1 B). Both organic acids reduced viability of striatal neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. At 10 mm MA and MMA caused a 65% (p < 0.001 versus control) and 43% (p < 0.001), respectively, cell damage. Minimal effective concentrations were 0.1 mm for MA (25% cell damage, p = 0.033) and 1 mm for MMA (26%,p < 0.001 Fig. 1 B). To begin to address the underlying mechanisms of MMA neurotoxicity, we studied the effects of GluR antagonists, antioxidants, and succinate. MMA (10 mm)-induced cell damage (50%, p < 0.001 versus 10 mm MMA) was reduced by MK-801 (10 μm; 15% cell damage, p < 0.001) and CNQX (50 μm; 23%, p < 0.001), but not L-AP3 (50 μm; 55%), suggesting a role for ionotropic GluRs (Fig. 2 A). Antioxidant-containing B27 supplement (22.Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar) also reduced MMA-induced neuronal damage (17%, p < 0.001), indicating a contribution of reactive oxygen species (Fig. 2 B). Since MMA has previously been shown to inhibit complex II activity in a competitive manner (12.Dutra J.C. Dutra-Filho C.S. Cardozo S.E.C. Wannmacher C.M.D. Sarkis J.J.F. Wajner M. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we co-incubated MMA (10 mm) with succinate (0.1–10 mm) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2 B, succinate protected against MMA toxicity at concentrations of 1–10 mm (18–11% cell damage,p < 0.001). To investigate whether MMA, similar to MA, directly inhibits complex II, we determined complex II activity in SMPs using DBQ or PMS as electron mediators (Table I). Complex II activity was not different in the presence of DBQ (V max: 1.02 units/mg protein) or PMS (V max: 0.95 units/mg protein). However, the DBQ system revealed a higher affinity for succinate (K m: 57 ± 2 μm) and an enhanced inhibitory response to TTFA (8 mm; 11 ± 1% of control) compared with PMS (K m: 171 ± 8 μm; TTFA: 32 ± 0.5% of control). Thus, the DBQ system is apparently more reliable to investigate complex II activity. Notably, it is accepted that DBQ resembles the natural ubichinone chemistry in mitochondria (30.Fato R. Estornell E. Di Bernado S. Pallotti F. Parenti Castelli G. Lenaz G.

Open table in a new tab Surprisingly, we found no evidence for an inhibition of complex II at concentrations of up to 20 mm MMA neither in the DBQ (0.5–20 mm: 107–111% of control) nor PMS systems (109–115% of control; Table I). In contrast, DBQ and PMS responded to the competitive complex II inhibitor MA, revealing a slightly better inhibitory response of the DBQ (0.5–20 mm MA: 51–3% of control activity; I50 = 0.5 mm MA) than the PMS system (0.5–20 mm MA: 72–2% of control; I50= 0.75 mm MA). Decreasing the succinate concentrations (0.04–20 mm: 108–98% of control) did not unmask a competitive inhibitory effect of MMA, which might have been overseen at high succinate concentrations (Table II).Table IIInfluence of succinate concentrations on complex II inhibitionSuccinate (mm)MA (3 mm)MMA (10 mm)PA (10 mm)% of control activitya) Decylubiquinone 011 ± 1108 ± 1105 ± 1 0.0410 ± 1114 ± 1109 ± 1 0.415 ± 1100 ± 1102 ± 2 2025 ± 12-a1.5 mm MA: 47 ± 1% of V max.99 ± 1101 ± 1a) Phenazine methosulfate 011 ± 1108 ± 1102 ± 1 0.1614 ± 195 ± 199 ± 1 1.618 ± 198 ± 199 ± 1 2024 ± 12-b1.5 mm MA: 43 ± 1% of V max.99 ± 198 ± 12-a 1.5 mm MA: 47 ± 1% of V max.2-b 1.5 mm MA: 43 ± 1% of V max. Open table in a new tab Since our data did not confirm the results of a previous study using PMS (12.Dutra J.C. Dutra-Filho C.S. Cardozo S.E.C. Wannmacher C.M.D. Sarkis J.J.F. Wajner M. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we systematically investigated modulatory factors of complex II activity. Complex II activity reached a maximum at pH 7.4 (V max (mean of n = 8 experiments): 1.05 units/mg protein), whereas pH changes dramatically reduced V max (given as units/mg protein: pH 5, 0.03; pH 6, 0.28; pH 7, 1.02; pH 8, 0.7; pH 9, 0.11; pH 10, 0.01). pH dependence was described according to Brandt and Okun (28.Brandt U. Okun J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11234-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), revealing the following pK values: pK A = 6.73 and pK B = 7.85 (with DBQ as an electron mediator). To exclude that MMA solutions (adjusted to pH 7.4) caused a pH shift, we measured the pH in the test mixture before and after administration of buffered MMA (up to 20 mmol/liter). However, MMA-induced pH changes were only marginal (≤0.05) and did not influenceV max. In addition, we excluded by GC-MS that MMA spontaneously desintegrated in the test mixture (data not shown). Furthermore, the decarboxylation product of MMA, propionate (PA), did not influence complex II activity at concentrations of 1–10 mm (101–103% of control; Table I). Together, our data suggest reliability of the DBQ system, but no direct effect of MMA on complex II activity. Spectrophotometric analysis revealed no inhibitory effect of MMA on complexes I, III, and IV. However, we found a weak inhibition of complex V by MMA (K i: 19 mmol/liter MMA) (Table III). Furthermore, MMA (1–10 mm) did not affect the mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids in skin fibroblast cultures (data not shown).Table IIIEffect of methylmalonate on respiratory chain complexes I, III, IV, and VComplex IComplex IIIComplex IVComplex V% control activityMMA (10 mm)100 ± 2101 ± 3103 ± 271 ± 33-ap < 0.05versus control (one-way ANOVA followed by Scheffé's test).

However, intracellular MMA accumulation like in methylmalonic aciduria was shown to let alternative catabolic pathways become more prominent, e.g. the formation of acetyl-CoA via propionyl-CoA (1.Fenton W.A. Gravel R.A. Rosenblatt D.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Valle A.D. Sly W.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 2165-2193Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether MMA-induced complex II inhibition in striatal neurons was explained by intracellular formation of alternative metabolites. In fact, loading of striatal cultures with MMA (10 mm) induced an intracellular increase in MMA (0–8 h"
https://openalex.org/W1984473437,"The coagulation protease Factor Xa (Xa)1 triggers a variety of cellular responses that may be important for inflammatory reactions to tissue injury. Protease-activated receptors (PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4) can mediate Xa signaling in heterologous expression systems. However, other candidate Xa receptors have been described, and the extent to which one or more PARs account for Xa signaling in relevant differentiated cells is unknown. We examined Xa signaling in endothelial cells from wild-type and PAR-deficient mice. Wild-type endothelial cells responded to agonists for PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4. Relative to wild-type, Xa-triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis was reduced by 60–75% in Par2−/− endothelial cells, by 20–30% in Par1 −/− endothelial cells, and by ∼90% in Par2 −/− endothelial cells treated with a PAR1 antagonist. Similar results were obtained when ERK1/2 phosphorylation was used to assess Xa signaling. Thus PAR2 is the main endogenous Xa receptor in these endothelial cell preparations and, together, PAR2 and PAR1 appear to account for ∼90% of endothelial Xa signaling. By contrast, in fibroblasts, PAR1 by itself accounted for virtually all Xa-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis. This information is critical for the design and interpretation of knockout mouse studies to probe the possible roles of Xa signaling in vivo. The coagulation protease Factor Xa (Xa)1 triggers a variety of cellular responses that may be important for inflammatory reactions to tissue injury. Protease-activated receptors (PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4) can mediate Xa signaling in heterologous expression systems. However, other candidate Xa receptors have been described, and the extent to which one or more PARs account for Xa signaling in relevant differentiated cells is unknown. We examined Xa signaling in endothelial cells from wild-type and PAR-deficient mice. Wild-type endothelial cells responded to agonists for PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4. Relative to wild-type, Xa-triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis was reduced by 60–75% in Par2−/− endothelial cells, by 20–30% in Par1 −/− endothelial cells, and by ∼90% in Par2 −/− endothelial cells treated with a PAR1 antagonist. Similar results were obtained when ERK1/2 phosphorylation was used to assess Xa signaling. Thus PAR2 is the main endogenous Xa receptor in these endothelial cell preparations and, together, PAR2 and PAR1 appear to account for ∼90% of endothelial Xa signaling. By contrast, in fibroblasts, PAR1 by itself accounted for virtually all Xa-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis. This information is critical for the design and interpretation of knockout mouse studies to probe the possible roles of Xa signaling in vivo.

The formation of Xa is localized to the surfaces of cells and membrane vesicles, and in addition to binding Va to form the prothrombinase complex, Xa can directly regulate cellular behavior. For example, Xa can cause endothelial cells to release cytokines (3Gajdusek C. Carbon S. Ross R. Nawroth P. Stern D. J.

Importantly, studies in animal models of septic shock and the recent clinical trial of activated protein C strongly suggest that coagulation proteases contribute to organ damage and death in this syndrome (7Taylor F.

Fisher Jr., C.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (5092) Google Scholar). Such studies have also raised the possibility that coagulation proteases upstream of thrombin might contribute to the pathogenesis of septic shock via activities unrelated to thrombin generation (11Taylor F.B. Chang A.C. Li G. Peer A. Ezban M. Hedner U. Blood. 1998; 91: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These considerations motivate efforts to identify the receptors that mediate Xa responses in endothelial cells and other cell types. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are G protein-coupled receptors that mediate signaling to thrombin and other proteases by a mechanism that requires proteolytic cleavage of the receptor (13Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). Because inhibitors that block the proteolytic activity of Xa also ablate its ability to trigger cellular responses, PARs are candidates for mediating Xa signaling (14Camerer E. Røttingen J.A. Iversen J.G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29034-29042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Camerer E. Røttingen J.-A. Gjernes E. Larsen K. Skartlien A.H. Iversen J.-G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32225-32233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is substantial evidence that Xa can signal via PARs. For example, expression of PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4 in Xenopus oocytes confers calcium signaling in response to Xa (16Camerer E. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5255-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). TF·VIIa complex can also activate PAR2 expressed in oocytes and fibroblasts, and when tissue factor and PAR2 are co-expressed in fibroblasts in the presence of zymogen factor X, picomolar VIIa is sufficient to trigger robust signaling (16Camerer E. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5255-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The TF·VIIa·Xa ternary complex may be especially effective for activating PAR2 (17Riewald M. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7742-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Thus PARs can mediate Xa signaling in heterologous expression systems. Are PARs the major endogenous mediators of Xa signaling in untransfected cells and tissues? Several pharmacological studies are consistent with this notion. For example, in HeLa cells, a PAR1-blocking antibody inhibited Xa-induced ERK phosphorylation and gene induction (18Riewald M. Kravchenko V.V. Petrovan R.J. O'Brien P.J. Brass L.F. Ulevitch R.J. Ruf W. Blood. 2001; 97: 3109-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and desensitization of PAR2 abolished Xa-induced relaxation of rat aortic rings (19Kawabata A. Kuroda R. Nakaya Y. Kawai K. Nishikawa H. Kawao N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To further define the relative contribution of PARs to Xa signaling and to lay groundwork for studies to define the importance of Xa signalingin vivo, we utilized cells from PAR-deficient mice. We focused on endothelial cells because they express the three PARs that are candidate Xa receptors in mouse, because they are probably exposed to Xa at sites of tissue injury, and because their responses to Xa, such as cytokine release and surface expression of adhesion molecules (4Senden N.H. Jeunhomme T.M. Heemskerk J.W. Wagenvoord R. van't Veer C. Hemker H.C. Buurman W.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4318-4324PubMed Google Scholar), may contribute to the link between tissue injury and inflammatory responses. The agonist peptides TFLLRNPNDK (PAR1), SLIGRL (PAR2), SFLLRN (PAR1 and PAR2), and AYPGKF (PAR4) as well as the competitive PAR1 antagonist BMS (BMS-200261,N-trans-cinnamoyl-p-fluoroFpGuFLRR) (20Bernatowicz M.S. Klimas C.E. Hartl K.S. Peluso M. Allegretto N.J. Seiler S.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 4879-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were synthesized as carboxyl amides and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Hirudin, heparin, and anti-FLAG antibody were from Sigma; antibodies to ICAM-2, PECAM, and Flk-1 from BD PharMingen; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins from Bio-Rad; rabbit anti-ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 from Cell Signaling; magnetic beads from Dynal; collagenase and dispase from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; endothelial cell growth supplement from BTI; trypsin and cell culture medium from Invitrogen; human plasma-derived Xa and thrombin from Enzyme Research Laboratories and Hematologic Technologies. 1 Unit/ml Xa corresponds to 174 nm. Generation of mice deficient in PAR1 and PAR2 has been described elsewhere (21Connolly A.J. Ishihara H. Kahn M.L. Farese Jr., R.V. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 22Lindner J.R. Kahn M.L. Coughlin S.R. Sambrano G.R. Schauble E. Bernstein D. Foy D. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Ley K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6504-6510Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Mice used for cell preparations had been bred five or more generations into the C57BL/6 strain. Endothelial cells were isolated by a modification of published techniques (23Dong Q.G. Bernasconi S. De Lostaglio S. Calmanovici R.W. Martin-Padura I. Breviario F. Garlanda C. Ramponi S. Mantovani A. Vecchi A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each experiment, skin and lung were collected from 4 to 10 wild-type (wt) or Par −/− mice. For skin and lung preparations, tissue was harvested 2–3 and 2–6 days after birth, respectively. Tissues were minced, digested with collagenase B and dispase II at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking, disrupted by passage through a 14-gauge cannula, and filtered through a stainless steel wire mesh. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min, plated on gelatin-coated culture dishes, and cultured in endothelial cell growth medium (50% Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), 50% Ham’s F-12 with non-essential amino acids, 20% serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mg/ml heparin, and 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement). On day 2, cell cultures were incubated with magnetic beads coated with rat anti-mouse ICAM-2. Cells were then released from plates by trypsinization and washed, and ICAM-2-expressing cells (endothelial cells) were isolated using a magnet, washed three times in DME, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and plated into gelatin-coated culture dishes. A second round of purification was performed 3–4 days later. Experiments were done 8–12 days after the initial tissue digest; each experiment used cells from a separate cell isolation. Purity of the endothelial cell preparations was characterized by immunostaining for PECAM, ICAM-2, and Flk-1, and by parallel isolation and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining of endothelial cells from mice bearing a Tie-2 promoter-driven β-galactosidase transgene (24Schlaeger T.M. Bartunkova S. Lawitts J.A. Teichmann G. Risau W. Deutsch U. Sato T.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3058-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Each of these measures suggested that >90% of the cells in these preparations were endothelial cells. The fibroblast preparations used in these studies were prepared as follows. The cells from the ICAM-2-negative fraction from the first isolation of endothelial cells (day 2) were cultured in parallel with the ICAM-2-positive cells but in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum without heparin or specific endothelial cell growth factors. Like the endothelial cell cultures, these preparations were used for experiments 8–12 days after the initial tissue digest. As expected from the growth conditions and method of isolation, cells in these cultures were fibroblast-like by morphology. Thus these preparations were designated as “fibroblast” preparations, but they almost certainly contained multiple cell types. The KOLF lung fibroblast cell line was derived from PAR1 knockout mice (25Trejo J. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21536-21541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). KOLFs were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. KOLF-based cell lines (KOLFPAR1, KOLFPAR2, and KOLFPAR4) were generated by co-transfecting expression constructs with a hygromycin resistance vector and screening hygromycin B-resistant clones for cell surface PAR expression by cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (26Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in 24-well plates were loaded overnight with 2 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol in DMEM/bovine serum albumin (0.2%) without fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, changed to fresh DMEM/bovine serum albumin without myoinositol for 2 h, treated with 20 mm LiCl in DMEM/bovine serum albumin with or without agonist for 90 min, then extracted with formic acid. Released total [3H]inositol phosphates were quantitated (26Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Basal [3H]inositol phosphate release was ∼350 cpm in dermal and lung endothelial cell cultures and ∼500 cpm in lung fibroblast cultures, regardless of PAR genotype. Experiments comparing Xa responses in wild-typeversus Par −/− cells were repeated 3–6 times; other comparisons were in most cases repeated three times. Within each experiment, there were four replicates for each condition. The data shown in Fig. 3 are the average of the pooled experiments. Cells in 12-well plates were incubated overnight in serum-free medium, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and changed to fresh serum-free medium 2 h prior to agonist addition. The time course of ERK phosphorylation after addition of Xa to wild-type skin endothelial cell cultures was characterized by an initial spike of ERK phosphorylation that peaked at ∼5 min and declined to a plateau that lasted more than 60 min. Two sets of experiments were done: one in which cells were incubated with agonists for 5 min to sample the peak, and one in which cells were incubated with agonists for 40 min to sample the plateau. After incubation with agonist, cells were lysed directly in a reducing SDS sample buffer. Lysates were sheared with an insulin syringe then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblotting with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 or anti-ERK1/2 antibodies followed by an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was done at 4 °C. After repeated washes with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween, the membranes were developed with ECL plus (Amersham Bioscience), and visualized using either film or a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). PAR2-lacZ knockin mice were generated using a strategy analogous to that used for the PAR4-lacZ knockin (27Sambrano G. Weiss E. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). 2C. T. Griffin and S. R. Coughlin, manuscript in preparation.In this mouse, the β-galactosidase gene was inserted into PAR2 exon 1 such that the lacZ start codon supplanted that of PAR2. Tissues from mice homozygous or heterozygous for the PAR2-lacZ allele were stained for β-galactosidase as described (24Schlaeger T.M. Bartunkova S. Lawitts J.A. Teichmann G. Risau W. Deutsch U. Sato T.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3058-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Tissue sampling was preceded by saline perfusion when tissues were to be used for sectioning. In previous studies, we showed that overexpression of human PAR1, PAR2, or PAR4 in Xenopusoocytes conferred Xa-dependent calcium mobilization (16Camerer E. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5255-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), which reflects phosphoinositide hydrolysis in those cells. PAR3 did not confer Xa responsiveness (16Camerer E. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5255-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Because PAR1 and PAR4 can be activated by thrombin while PAR2 cannot and because it seemed likely that thrombin would be generated in most situations in which Xa was present, we focused on PAR2 signaling in response to Xa in that study. Xa did trigger phosphoinositide hydrolysis in KOLF cells (KOLFs) stably expressing PAR2 (16Camerer E. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5255-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). For the present study, we were interested in Xa activation of all candidate PARs. Accordingly, we compared Xa signaling in KOLFs stably expressing similar levels of PAR1, PAR2, or PAR4. Xa triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis (Fig.1a) and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1b) in all three PAR-transfected cell lines (in PAR4 expressing cells, ERK phosphorylation in response to Xa was seen at 40 min only). Untransfected KOLFs showed no responses to Xa. In each of three experiments with KOLFs expressing PAR1 or PAR2, the threshold concentration of Xa for detecting Xa-induced increases in phosphoinositide hydrolysis was ∼7 nm; for PAR4-expressing KOLFs, the threshold was ∼35 nm (Fig.1a and additional data not shown). The concentration response curves to Xa did not clearly saturate in the transfected KOLFs, even at 870 nm Xa. In PAR1-transfected cells, the response to 870 nm Xa was only ∼25% of that triggered by a saturating concentration of PAR1-activating peptide. In PAR2- and PAR4-transfected cells, the response at 870 nm Xa was ∼70% of the maximal peptide response. Xa was used at 1 unit/ml (174 nm) in most subsequent studies. This corresponds to the concentration of Xa that would be achieved if all zymogen X in plasma were converted to active Xa. We chose this highest practical concentration of Xa because our studies in PAR-deficient cells would look for loss of Xa signaling. The increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis in response to 1 unit/ml Xa in PAR2-expressing cells was consistently ∼50% of the maximal response to PAR2-activating peptide, while the response to Xa in cells expressing PAR1 or PAR4 was 20–30% of the maximal response to PAR1- or PAR4-activating peptides (Fig. 1a and data not shown). Thus Xa can signal via PAR1, PAR2, or PAR4 heterologously expressed in KOLFs, and PAR2 appears to be a relatively better receptor for Xa than PAR1 or PAR4 in the context of this expression system. To determine which of these PARs, if any, are the major endogenous Xa receptors in a biologically interesting differentiated cell type, we next examined Xa signaling in endothelial cells from mice deficient in individual PARs. Endothelial cells were isolated from lung or skin from wild-type and PAR-deficient neonatal mice using ICAM2 antibodies bound to magnetic beads. Over 90% of the cells in each preparation expressed endothelium-specific markers at the time of the experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”). We first characterized agonist responses in wild-type endothelial cells using phosphoinositide hydrolysis and ERK phosphorylation as end points. Endothelial cells from lung and skin responded to both Xa and thrombin (Figs. 2 and3). The thrombin inhibitor hirudin blocked responses to thrombin but not Xa, thus the Xa responses seen in these studies were unlikely to be due to contaminating thrombin or to activation of any prothrombin remaining in the cultures (Figs. 2 and 3and not shown). The threshold Xa concentration for detectable increases in phosphoinositide hydrolysis in wild-type dermal and lung endothelial cell preparations was ∼7 nm (Fig. 2a and not shown). The EC50 was ∼25 nm and the maximal response to Xa was similar to that seen in response to 100 μm PAR2-activating peptide and greater that than seen with 10 nm thrombin (Fig. 2a). For ERK phosphorylation in endothelial cell preparations from wild-type mice, the threshold Xa concentration for detectable increases was 1.5–7 nm (0.008–0.04 units/ml) and the EC50 was ∼30 nm (Fig. 2b). The time courses for ERK phosphorylation in endothelial cells after addition of Xa, SLIGRL, and thrombin were similar, with a peak at ∼5 min followed by a plateau lasting 40–60 min (Fig. 2c). In endothelial cells from both from skin and lung of wild-type mice, the average fold increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis triggered by a saturating concentration of PAR2 agonist (SLIGRL) was greater than that for PAR1 (TFLLRNPNDK), which was in turn greater than that for PAR4 (AYPGKF) (Fig. 3, a and b, and not shown). These pharmacological data suggested that PAR2, PAR1, and PAR4 were all functionally expressed in endothelial cells from mouse skin and lung and that any of these receptors might contribute to endothelial Xa signaling. The relative robustness of PAR2 versus PAR1 and PAR4 as a Xa receptor in the KOLF studies (Fig. 1), the relative robustness of responses to PAR2- versus PAR1- and PAR4-activating peptides in endothelial cells, and the observation that maximal responses to Xa were greater than those seen to thrombin in endothelial cells (Figs. 2 and 3) were consistent with PAR2 being the major Xa receptor in these cells. By contrast, in wild-type lung fibroblasts, PAR2-activating peptide triggered virtually no response and the maximum response to Xa and thrombin were similar (Fig.3d and not shown). Thus PAR1 appeared to be the major Xa receptor in fibroblasts (see below). Xa signaling was substantially reduced in endothelial cells derived from Par2 −/− mice relative to wild-type mice (Fig. 3). In endothelial cells from wild-type mouse skin, Xa-stimulated a 3.7-fold increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis versus an only 1.7-fold increase in cells from Par2 −/− mice (p < 0.01; Fig. 3a). Similarly, in lung endothelial cells, Xa stimulated a 3.3-fold increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cells from wild-type miceversus a 2.0-fold increase in cells from Par2−/− mice (p < 0.05; Fig. 3b). ERK phosphorylation in response to Xa was also substantially reduced inPar2 −/− endothelial cells relative to wild-type (Fig.3c). In five independent experiments, ERK phosphorylation in response to 1 unit/ml Xa in PAR2 −/− skin endothelial cells ranged from absent to less than 2-fold over unstimulated, but was uniformly greater than 5-fold increased in wild-type. In contrast to Xa responses, responses to thrombin were not decreased in cells fromPar2 −/− mice (Fig. 3, a–c). These data strongly suggest that PAR2 is an endogenous Xa receptor in these endothelial cell preparations. Indeed, PAR2 appears to account for more than half of Xa-triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis and most of the ERK activation in these cells. Xa signaling was only moderately reduced in endothelial cells fromPar1 −/− mice compared with wild-type (Fig. 3). In wild-type skin endothelial cells, Xa triggered a 3.7-fold increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis versus 2.8-fold inPar1 −/− cells (Fig. 3a). In wild-type lung endothelial cells, Xa stimulated a 3.3-fold increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis versus a 2.9-fold increase inPar1 −/− cells (Fig. 3b). These differences in Xa signaling in wild-type versus Par1 −/− endothelial cells did not reach statistical significance. To better probe the role of PAR1 in Xa signaling in endothelial cells in the absence of the contribution made by PAR2, we utilized PAR2-deficient endothelial cells and the PAR1 antagonist BMS200261 (BMS) (20Bernatowicz M.S. Klimas C.E. Hartl K.S. Peluso M. Allegretto N.J. Seiler S.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 4879-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition to its activity as a PAR1 antagonist, BMS is a partial agonist for PAR2 (not shown). Therefore, BMS could only be used informatively in Par2 −/− endothelial cells. Treatment of endothelial cells from Par2 −/− mice with BMS decreased Xa-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis and ERK1/2 phosphorylation to near basal levels (Fig. 3 and not shown). In Par2 −/− endothelial cells from skin, BMS decreased Xa-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis from 1.7- to 1.2-fold basal (Fig. 3a). InPar2 −/− endothelial cells from lung, BMS decreased Xa-triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis from 2.0-fold basal to 1.2-fold basal (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3b). BMS did not decrease serum- and lysophosphatidic acid-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis nor did it cause cell loss (data not shown). Moreover, BMS reduced the thrombin responses in Par2−/− cells to a level similar to that of the AYPGKF response (Fig. 3,a and b), consistent with inhibition of PAR1 but not PAR4 and concordant with previous studies (28Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PAR1 is an endogenous Xa receptor and may account for 20–30% of the response to Xa in the endothelial cell preparations studied. The PAR4 agonist AYPGKF stimulated an increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis in endothelial cells (Fig. 3) and responses to AYPGKF were absent in Par4 −/− endothelial cells; these results suggest that PAR4 is expressed in microvascular endothelial cells at levels sufficient to mediate signaling. 3H. Kataoka and S. Coughlin, manuscript in preparation. PAR4-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in response to Xa when expressed in KOLFs (Fig. 1) or Xenopus oocytes (16Camerer E. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5255-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The residual Xa signal in the BMS-inhibited Par2 −/− cells (Fig. 3) was less than that elicited by PAR4 activation. Thus our data are consistent with the notion that the residual Xa signal in the BMS-inhibited Par2−/− cells may be mediated by PAR4, but certainly do not prove it. Taken together, these experiments suggest that Xa activates microvascular endothelial cells through PAR2, PAR1, and possibly PAR4. Studies of fibroblast preparations, cultures derived from cells left behind after immunopurifying endothelial cells, were done in parallel with the endothelial cell studies described above. Fibroblasts derived from wild-type mouse lungs responded to agonists for PAR1 but showed little or no increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis in response to PAR2- and PAR4-activating peptides (Fig. 3d and not shown). In the mouse, PAR3 serves a cofactor function rather than itself mediating transmembrane signaling (27Sambrano G. Weiss E. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 29Nakanishi-Matsui M. Zheng Y.W. Sulciner D.J. Weiss E.J. Ludeman M.J. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Thus, of the four known PARs, PAR1 was the major candidate for mediating Xa signaling in our lung fibroblast preparations, and Xa-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis was indeed absent in lung fibroblasts from Par1−/− mice (Fig. 3d). Skin fibroblasts derived from wild-type mice showed little response to any PAR agonist but did show robust phosphoinositide hydrolysis in response to serum and lysophosphatidic acid (not shown); they were not studied further. These experiments suggest that Xa activates fibroblasts from lung predominantly through PAR1 and support the hypothesis that PAR1 is an endogenous Xa receptor in some cell types. The observation that PAR2 is the main Xa receptor in endothelial cells but plays little or no role in fibroblasts shows that different PARs mediate Xa signaling in different cell types and also suggests that fibroblast contamination did not confound signaling results obtained with endothelial cell preparations.

https://openalex.org/W1982453626,"Rev1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae functions with DNA polymerase ζ in mutagenictrans-lesion synthesis. Because of the reported preferential incorporation of a C residue opposite an abasic site, Rev1 has been referred to as a deoxycytidyltransferase. Here, we use steady-state kinetics to examine nucleotide incorporation by Rev1 opposite undamaged and damaged template residues. We show that Rev1 specifically inserts a C residue opposite template G, and it is ∼25-, 40-, and 400-fold less efficient at inserting a C residue opposite an abasic site, an O6-methylguanine, and an 8-oxoguanine lesion, respectively. Rev1 misincorporates G, A, and T residues opposite template G with a frequency of ∼10−3to 10−4. Consistent with this finding, Rev1 replicates DNA containing a string of Gs in a template-specific manner, but it has a low processivity incorporating 1.6 nucleotides per DNA binding event on the average. From these observations, we infer that Rev1 is a G template-specific DNA polymerase. Rev1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae functions with DNA polymerase ζ in mutagenictrans-lesion synthesis.

Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Rev1 also could incorporate a C residue opposite templates G and A but was only ∼20 and 10% as effective, respectively, in these reactions as the insertion opposite an abasic site (8Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Because of the preferential ability of Rev1 to insert a C residue opposite an abasic site, a noninformational DNA lesion, this activity has been referred to as a deoxycytidyltransferase. The Rev1 and Rad30 proteins differ also in the manner in which they contribute to the replication of UV-damaged DNA. Whereas Rev1 functions with the REV3, REV7-encoded DNA polymerase ζ (9Nelson J.R.

Polη replicates through a cis-syn-thymine-thymine (T-T) dimer with the same efficiency and accuracy as through undamaged Ts (10Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol.

Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Polζ, which is a member of the Polα family, promotes lesion bypass by extending from the nucleotide inserted by another DNA polymerase opposite the 3′-T of a T-T dimer or a (6-4)TT photoproduct (13Johnson R.E.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3558-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although the Rev1 protein is almost as indispensable for UV mutagenesis as is Polζ, its C-transferase activity is not needed for this function, because C insertion occurs only rarely opposite the UV lesions in yeast (15Gibbs P.E.M. Kilbey B.J. Banerjee S.K. Lawrence C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2607-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Gibbs P.E.M. Borden A. Lawrence C.W.

Prakash, unpublished observations. The mutagenic bypass of abasic sites also requires Rev1 and Polζ (17Johnson R.E. Torres-Ramos C.A. Izumi T. Mitra S. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and it depends upon the sequential action of two DNA polymerases in which one inserts the nucleotide opposite the abasic site and Polζ subsequently extends from the inserted nucleotide (18Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Johansson E. Burgers P.M.J. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Although Rev1 is able to insert a C residue opposite an abasic site in an in vitro reaction, the inactivation of Rev1 C-transferase activity causes no significant reduction in the incidence of mutations resulting from the bypass of abasic sites (18Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Johansson E. Burgers P.M.J. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This result is probably because of the fact that many different polymerases, including Polδ and Polη, contribute to the insertion step (18Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Johansson E. Burgers P.M.J. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 19Haracska L. Kondratick C.M. Unk I. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol.

The indispensability of the Rev1 protein, but not of its C-transferase activity, for the mutagenic bypass of UV lesions as well as that of abasic sites has suggested that the primary role of Rev1 in the mutagenic bypass of these lesions is structural. In this role, Rev1 could act as an intermediary, promoting the assembly of Polζ with Polδ stalled at a lesion site (18Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Johansson E. Burgers P.M.J. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).

In Figs. 1B and 2, instead of the Tris buffer, the reactions were carried out in a phosphate buffer containing 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol. Assays were assembled on ice, incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and stopped by the addition of loading buffer (40 μl) containing EDTA (20 mm), 95% formamide, 0.3% bromphenol blue, 0.3% cyanol blue. The reaction products were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea. The quantitation of the results was done using a Molecular Dynamics STORM PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Rev1 (3 nm) was preincubated with the DNA substrate (10 nm) in phosphate buffer that contained no deoxynucleotides for 5 min at 30 °C. Reactions were initiated by adding all four deoxynucleotides at increasing concentration (0.5–100 μm each) or all four deoxynucleotides plus 100-fold excess of nonradiolabeled DNA substrate as a trap followed by 10-min incubation at 30 °C. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the trap, Rev1 was preincubated with the DNA trap and the primer-template substrate before the addition of dNTPs. The processivity of Rev1 at 100 μm dNTP concentration was calculated as described previously (20Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36835-36838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Gel band intensities (In) of the deoxynucleotide incorporation products were quantitated at each band position (n). Processivity is defined as the probability, Pn, that the enzyme will incorporate the next deoxynucleotide rather than dissociating. The processivity of Rev1 at a particular band position was calculated by using the equation: Pn = (In+1 + In+2 + … )/(In + In+1 + In+2 + … ). Steady-state kinetic analyses for deoxynucleotide incorporation opposite undamaged G, A, T, and C residues or an abasic site, a 8-oxoG, or a m6G were performed as described previously (21Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 22Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Rev1 (1 nm) was incubated with 10 nm DNA substrate in the presence of increasing concentrations of a single deoxynucleotide for 10 min in a Tris buffer. Gel band intensities of the substrates and products were quantitated by PhosphorImager, and the observed rate of deoxynucleotide incorporation was plotted as a function of dNTP concentration. The data were fit by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot 5.0 to the Michaelis-Menten equation describing a hyperbola, v = (Vmax × [dNTP]/(Km + [dNTP]). Apparent Km andVmax steady-state parameters were obtained from the fit and were used to calculate the efficiency of deoxynucleotide incorporation (kcat/Km). First we examined whether Rev1, besides its deoxycytidyltransferase activity, is able to incorporate other nucleotides opposite various undamaged and damaged template residues. DNA substrates containing a different template nucleotide at the primer:template junction were incubated with Rev1 in the presence of just one dNTP (Fig.1A). Rev1 protein incorporated a C residue across from each of the four undamaged template nucleotides and also with various efficiencies opposite uracil, 8-oxoG, m6G, and abasic site. Whereas the C residue was incorporated most readily opposite template G, Rev1 also incorporated the other nucleotides G, A, and T opposite template G (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4). Because yeast Rev1 was shown to have only a deoxycytidyltransferase activity in the previous study (8Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), we examined the dependence of these other nucleotide incorporations by Rev1 on the sequence context and on the Tris buffer we used instead of the phosphate buffer employed in the previous study. The incorporation by Rev1 of each of four deoxynucleotides opposite a template G residue present in two other sequence contexts was examined in phosphate buffer (Fig.1B). Here also, Rev1 incorporated all four nucleotides opposite template G; however, the level of incorporation of the G, A, and T nucleotides varied depending on the sequence context of the template (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1–3 withlanes 7–9). Rev1 inserted a C residue opposite uracil, 8-oxoG, and m6G, whereas opposite an abasic site in addition to a C, Rev1 inserted some G and T as well (Fig. 1A). Next, we examined whether Rev1 could synthesize DNA on a template containing a string of Gs in a template-specific manner, and we found that Rev1 could in fact synthesize DNA almost to the end of this template, specifically inserting a C residue (Fig.2A, lanes 5 and6). This observation raised the possibility that instead of transferring only one nucleotide in a single DNA binding event, Rev1 was able to polymerize DNA, like DNA polymerases, in a G template-dependent manner and could incorporate more than one nucleotide per DNA binding event. We measured the processivity of Rev1 on a DNA substrate containing a string of 11 Gs toward the 5′ end of the template right after the primer:template junction (Fig.2B). Processivity is a measure of how many deoxynucleotides a DNA polymerase incorporates in a single DNA binding event. To ensure that we were observing deoxynucleotide incorporation resulting from a single DNA binding event, we monitored DNA synthesis by Rev1 in the presence of excess of nonradiolabeled DNA substrate as a trap (Fig.2B). The reactions were performed by first preincubating Rev1 with the radiolabeled DNA substrate without deoxynucleotide. DNA synthesis was initiated by the addition of increasing concentrations of all four deoxynucleotides (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–7) or a mixture of 100-fold excess of the same but nonradiolabeled DNA substrate and all four deoxynucleotides to the reaction (Fig.2B, lanes 8–14). Under these conditions, any Rev1 molecule that dissociates from the labeled DNA substrate will be trapped by the excess of nonradiolabeled DNA. The effectiveness of the trap was verified by first preincubating Rev1 with the radiolabeled DNA substrate and the excess nonlabeled DNA followed by the addition of deoxynucleotides. The lack of DNA synthesis in this sample shows that the 100-fold excess of nonlabeled DNA is sufficient to trap all Rev1 molecules (Fig. 2B, lane 15). In the presence of saturating nucleotide concentration, Rev1 copied the template DNA, incorporating as many as nine nucleotides in a single DNA binding event (Fig. 2B, lane 14). The percentage of active Rev1 molecules was calculated from the intensities of bands in Fig. 2B, lane 14 (see “Materials and Methods”), and the percentage of Rev1 molecules adding at least one deoxynucleotide was set as 100%. The percentage of active Rev1 molecules decreased after the addition of each subsequent nucleotide because of the dissociation of some fraction of Rev1 molecules from DNA (Fig. 2C). The processivity of Rev1, defined quantitatively as the probability (Pn) for each deoxynucleotide incorporation event n that Rev1 will move ahead to incorporate the next nucleotide n + 1 rather than dissociate from the DNA template, on this DNA substrate is 0.61. Thus, after each nucleotide incorporation, on average 61% of the bound Rev1 molecules incorporate at least one additional deoxynucleotide, whereas 39% dissociate from the DNA substrate, which leads to an incorporation of 1.6 nucleotides per DNA binding event on the average. Thus, Rev1 shares the low processivity characteristic of the Y family of DNA polymerases. Rev1 protein has been designated as a deoxycytidyltransferase based upon its ability, examined at saturating nucleotide concentrations, to insert a C nucleotide more efficiently opposite a template abasic site, a noninstructional lesion, than opposite template G (8Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). This designation may suggest that Rev1 does not monitor the information of the template strand and is not very efficient at distinguishing between correct and incorrect nucleotide insertion. To characterize further the specificity of the DNA polymerization reaction catalyzed by Rev1, we analyzed the steady-state kinetics of nucleotide incorporation opposite undamaged and damaged template residues by Rev1. The kinetics of insertion of a single deoxynucleotide opposite undamaged G, A, T, or C were determined as a function of deoxynucleotide concentration under steady-state conditions. From the kinetics of deoxynucleotide incorporation, the steady-state apparent Km andkcat values for each deoxynucleotide were obtained from the curve fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The frequency of nucleotide misincorporation, finc, was calculated as the ratio of the efficiency (kcat/Km) of incorrect nucleotide incorporation to the efficiency (kcat/Km) of correct nucleotide incorporation (TableI).Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters of nucleotide insertion reactions catalyzed by yeast Rev1 proteinSitedNTP addedKmkcatkcat/Kmfinc(μm)(min−1)(min−1μm−1)Insertion opposite GdGTP88 ± 90.21 ± 0.010.00242.0 × 10−3 5′–CTCdATP440 ± 1300.034 ± 0.0080.000086.5 × 10−5 --GAGGTC-dTTP110 ± 200.15 ± 0.010.00131.1 × 10−3dCTP0.18 ± 0.030.22 ± 0.0051.21.0Insertion opposite A 5′–CTCdCTP97 ± 80.25 ± 0.020.00252.0 × 10−3 --GAGATC-Insertion opposite T 5′–CTCdCTP48 ± 40.22 ± 0.010.00453.7 × 10−3 --GAGTTC-Insertion opposite C 5′–CTCdCTP26 ± 30.24 ± 0.030.0097.5 × 10−3 --GAGCTC-Insertion opposite abasic sitedGTP280 ± 600.17 ± 0.0080.00060 5′–CTCdATP1200 ± 5000.016 ± 0.0090.000013 --GAG0TC-dTTP290 ± 700.12 ± 0.0050.00040dCTP4.7 ± 0.20.24 ± 0.020.051Insertion opposite G 5′–CATdCTP0.21 ± 0.030.18 ± 0.030.861.0 --GTAGAA-Insertion opposite abasic site 5′–CATdCTP5.2 ± 0.60.17 ± 0.020.0323.7 × 10−2 --GTA0AA-Insertion opposite O6-methylguanine 5′–CATdCTP7.2 ± 0.80.16 ± 0.020.0222.6 × 10−2 --GTAGAA-‖ m6Insertion opposite 8-oxoguanine 5′–CATdCTP18 ± 20.042 ± 0.0130.00232.7 × 10−3 --GTAGAA-‖8-oxo Open table in a new tab As indicated by the kcat/Kmvalues, Rev1 incorporates a C opposite template G ∼130–500-fold more efficiently than opposite template A, T, or C. Opposite template G, Rev1 incorporates the correct C ∼500-, 1000-, or 15000-fold more efficiently than it inserts the incorrect G, T, or A, respectively (Table I). This finding indicates that while inserting nucleotides opposite undamaged template bases, Rev1 uses the information of the template and discriminates between the correct and incorrect nucleotides. Next, we compared the efficiencies of deoxynucleotide insertion opposite an undamaged G, an abasic site, an m6G, and an 8-oxoG (Fig. 3). As judged from the kcat/Km values, Rev1 inserts a G, an A, a T, or a C ∼4-, 6-, 3-, 24-fold less efficiently, respectively, opposite an AP site than opposite an undamaged G (Table 1). In another sequence context, Rev1 incorporated a C residue opposite an AP site ∼27-fold less efficiently than opposite an undamaged G template residue (Fig. 3 and Table I). Rev1 inserted a C residue opposite an m6G lesion, ∼39-fold less efficiently, and opposite an 8-oxoG lesion ∼370-fold less efficiently than opposite an undamaged G (Fig. 3 and Table I). Thus, Rev1 is sensitive to DNA lesions, and its activity is inhibited on lesion containing DNA substrates. Here, we show that Rev1 is most efficient at inserting a C opposite template G, and Rev1 replicates a poly(dG) template DNA by specific insertion of Cs, and on this DNA, it incorporates 1.6 nucleotides per DNA binding event on the average. Rev1 misincorporates nucleotides opposite template G with a frequency of ∼10−3 to 10−4. In its fidelity and processivity on the G template, Rev1 resembles Polη, which misincorporates nucleotides opposite G with a similar frequency and displays a similar low processivity (20Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36835-36838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In contrast to a previous study that reported that Rev1 was ∼5-fold more efficient at inserting a C opposite an abasic site than opposite template G (8Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), we found that Rev1 is over 20-fold better at inserting C opposite undamaged G than opposite an abasic site. Furthermore, our steady-state kinetic studies show that the more proficient insertion of C opposite template G than that opposite an abasic site results from a reduction in the apparent Km for the nucleotide, whereas the kcat stays approximately the same (Table I). Because the previous study was qualitative performed with a single saturating concentration of the nucleotide, one would not have detected the differences in Km that we report here. We also examined Rev1 for its ability to insert a C opposite two other DNA lesions, m6G and 8-oxoG. Rev1 inserted a C opposite m6G approximately 40-fold less efficiently than opposite an undamaged G, and in this case as well, the inefficient insertion of C opposite m6G was almost entirely attributed to an increase in theKm for the nucleotide (Table I). Rev1 was very inefficient at inserting a C opposite 8-oxoG, because it did so ∼370-fold less efficiently than the insertion of C opposite template G. This poor nucleotide insertion opposite 8-oxoG results from an ∼100-fold increase in the Km for the nucleotide and from an ∼5-fold decrease in the kcat for the enzyme (Table I). Thus, Rev1 is most conducive for nucleotide incorporation when bound to the template G than when bound to the other undamaged template nucleotides or to DNA lesions. This finding may suggest that Rev1 more readily adopts a configuration suitable for binding the C nucleotide when it is bound to the G template than when bound to the other template nucleotides. The proficient ability of Rev1 to insert a C opposite template G and to replicate poly(dG) DNA in a template-specific manner implies that Rev1 is a G template-specific DNA polymerase. Although Rev1 can also incorporate a C opposite templates T, A, and C, it does so with a frequency of ∼10−2 to 10−3. In this regard also, Rev1 resembles Polη, which misincorporates a C opposite these templates with a similar frequency (20Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36835-36838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, in its specificity for primarily incorporating a C opposite template G, Rev1 is more similar to human Polι (13Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1642-1650PubMed Google Scholar), another member of the Y polymerase family, than to Polη. Polι is most efficient at inserting the correct nucleotide T opposite template A, and opposite this template, it misincorporates with a frequency of 10−4 to 10−6. Although Polι incorporates the correct nucleotides C and G opposite templates G and C, respectively, it is much less efficient and accurate opposite these templates than opposite template A (13Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Polι is highly inefficient at inserting nucleotides opposite template T, and moreover, it incorporates a G opposite this template ∼10-fold better than an A (13Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Thus, Polι is most efficient and accurate on template A, and on the other three template nucleotides, it is much less efficient and accurate. However, in striking contrast to Polι, Rev1 is unable to insert the other three nucleotides with any reasonable efficiency, and its ability to primarily insert a C represents the most extreme deviation from normal polymerase behavior. Rev1 and Polι resemble each other in their ability to insert nucleotides opposite an abasic site. However, in contrast to the specific insertion of a C opposite this lesion by Rev1, Polι primarily incorporates an A, and to a lesser extent, a G opposite this lesion site (13Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The specificity of Rev1 for C insertion opposite an abasic site is enigmatic, because when a pyrimidine is positioned opposite the abasic site, both the pyrimidine and the abasic sugar are extrahelical and the helix collapses (24Cuniasse P. Fazakerley G.V. Guschlbauer W. Kaplan B.E. Sowers L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). By contrast, when an A is positioned opposite the AP site, the DNA retains the B-form, and both the unpaired A and the abasic residues remain intrahelical (24Cuniasse P. Fazakerley G.V. Guschlbauer W. Kaplan B.E. Sowers L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25Cuniasse P. Sowers L.C. Eritja R. Kaplan B. Goodman M.F. Cognet J.A.H. LeBret M.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Consequently, most DNA polymerases tend to insert an A opposite an abasic site (27Strauss B.S. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). At low temperatures, a G opposite an abasic site is also predominantly intrahelical, and similar to Polι, Polη inserts a G or an A opposite an abasic site (19Haracska L. Kondratick C.M. Unk I. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Pre-steady-state kinetic analyses of Polη have indicated a two-step nucleotide binding mechanism in which the DNA bound polymerase first binds the nucleotide and then undergoes the rate-limiting induced fit conformational change prior to the chemical step of phosphodiester bond formation (28Washington M.T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Cell. 2001; 107: 917-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The preference of Rev1 to insert a C opposite template G and also opposite DNA lesions might suggest that Rev1 undergoes the induced fit conformational change prior to the chemical step of phosphodiester bond formation far more readily when a C nucleotide is bound in the active site of the enzyme. In the presence of nucleotides other than C, such a conformational change may not occur or it becomes too slow. The over 20-fold preferential incorporation of a C opposite template G than opposite an abasic site and even a greater inhibition of C insertion opposite 8-oxoG and m6G lesions additionally suggest that the presence of G in the template is also important for such a putative conformational change to occur. In conclusion, our results indicate that Rev1 is a G template-specific DNA polymerase. However, because of its inability to incorporate all four deoxynucleotides during the synthesis reaction, we consider it inappropriate to assign it a Greek letter nomenclature used for eukaryotic DNA polymerases."

The mechanistic role of the C terminus of PS in its metabolism and function still remains unknown, but one possibility is that this portion serves as the binding site for the interacting proteins that regulate the metabolism and functions of PS (6.Ratovitski T.

In this paper, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to search for proteins that interact with the C-terminal region of PS2, and we identified a novel PS-binding protein CALP/KChIP4 (calsenilin-like protein) that belongs to the calsenilin/KChIP protein family harboring four EF-hand motifs (32.An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). CALP/KChIP4 did not affect the stability or HMW complex formation of PS, nor did it alter γ-cleavage of βAPP or site 3 cleavage of Notch. However, it exhibited a unique character to alter the voltage-gating and inactivation properties of voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv4 as observed with other KChIPs. MATCHMAKER LexA Two-hybrid System (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. A cDNA encoding the C-terminal 43 amino acid residues of PS2 (amino acids 406–448) was subcloned into pLexA as a bait. The bait plasmid and thelacZ reporter plasmid, p8op-lacZ, were transformed into the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48, which contains a genomic LEU2 reporter gene. Then human brain cDNA library in pB42AD (CLONTECH) was transformed using the lithium acetate method. Transformants (4.8 × 109 clones) were selected on Gal/Raf/−His/−Ura/−Trp/−Leu plates, and positive clones were chosen after 7–10 days of culture at 30 °C. The colony-lift β-galactosidase filter assay was performed to exclude false positives. The individual library plasmids of positive transformants were recovered in Escherichia coli strain KC8 and selected based on the digestion pattern by HindIII. Protein interaction was further confirmed by re-transformation of the isolatedprey plasmid into EGY48 containing pLexA/PS2 C terminus. The confirmed cDNAs were sequenced using Thermosequenase (Amersham Biosciences) on an automated sequencer (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Alternative splice variant of human CALP cDNA was cloned by screening the human brain cDNA library (λZAP II, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by the plaque hybridization method using the human CALP cDNA obtained by the two-hybrid system as a probe. To identify a sequence including the transcription start site, we amplified cDNAs from the Cap Site cDNA dT (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd., Tokyo) of human brain by nested PCR (“CapSite Hunting”). The following sets of primers were used: 5′-GATGCTAGCTGCGAGTCAAGTC-3′ (1RDT) and 5′-CGAGTCAAGTCGACGAAGTGC-3′ (2RDT) as “anchor” forward primers; 5′-GGTTTCTTCATTAACAACACCACTGG-3′ (moro-1) and 5′-TGACGGTGGCCATCTCCAGTTCATCTT-3′ (31-3out) as “gene-specific” reverse primers. The reaction solution contained the following reagents: 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2 mmMgSO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 400 μmdATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 1 μl of Cap Site cDNA dT from human brain (Nippon Gene), 1.25 units PfuTurbo polymerase (Stratagene), 0.5 μm each primers (e.g. 1RDT and moro-1 for 1st PCR and 2RDT and 31-3out for 2nd “nested” PCR), 5 μl of GC-Melt (CLONTECH). The first PCR was performed for 35 cycles, with each cycle consisting of denaturation for 60 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C, and extension for 90 s at 72 °C. The second PCR was performed in the same buffer, using 1 μl of the first PCR products as a template and the same program as the 1st PCR. Specific PCR products were subcloned into pCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene) and subjected to sequencing. To obtain a mouse CALP cDNA, we performed 5′-RACE or 3′-RACE using mouse brain Marathon-Ready cDNA library (CLONTECH) and CALP-specific primers. The isolated PCR fragments were subcloned and sequenced. Northern hybridization analysis was carried out using a 0.9-kb human CALP cDNA fragment as a hybridization probe, which was hybridized to Northern Lights™ Human Multiple mRNA Blot (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The blots were then stripped and reprobed with human β-actin cDNA as an internal control. Full-length cDNAs encoding wild-type (wt) or N141I FAD mutant (mt) human PS2 in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) were obtained as described (15.Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H. Shinozaki K. Tokuhiro S.

The amplified cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+)/hyg (Invitrogen). EFmt-CALP in pcDNA3.1(+)/hyg were generated by long-PCR mutagenesis usingPfuTurbo polymerase according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) using the following primers: 5′-gtc tgt agc aaa tgc att gaa cag-3′ and 5′-cac aat gca gct gtg agt ttc gag-3′ for mutagenesis in the 2nd EF-hand; 5′-ttt aat ctg tat gcc ata aat aaa gat gcc tac atc act aaa-3′ and 5′-ttt agt gat gta ggc atc ttt att tat ggc ata cag att aaa-3′ for the 3rd EF-hand; 5′-ttt cag aaa atg gcc aaa aat aaa gat gcg gtt gtt acc ata-3′ and 5′-tat ggt aac aac cgc atc ttt att ttt ggc cat ttt ctg aaa-3′ for the 4th EF-hand, respectively. To assess the electrophysiological property of CALP, cDNA fragment encoding fl-, ΔN-, or EFmt-CALP was amplified by PCR using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) and subcloned into pTracer-CMV2 (Invitrogen). To express the CALP protein in E. coli, cDNA encoding fl- or EFmt-CALP fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) was generated by subcloning the amplified PCR fragments into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). All constructs were sequenced. cDNAs encoding rat KChIP2S, KChIP2L, Kv4.2, human calsenilin/KChIP3 in pcDNA3.1(33–35) or mouse NotchΔE in pCS2+MT vector were described previously (36.Schroeter E.H.

https://openalex.org/W2084989979,"Mutations in the X-linked retinitis pigmentosa 2 gene cause progressive degeneration of photoreceptor cells. The retinitis pigmentosa 2 protein (RP2) is similar in sequence to the tubulin-specific chaperone cofactor C. Together with cofactors D and E, cofactor C stimulates the GTPase activity of native tubulin, a reaction regulated by ADP-ribosylation factor-like 2 protein. Here we show that in the presence of cofactor D, RP2 protein also stimulates the GTPase activity of tubulin. We find that this function is abolished by mutation in an arginine residue that is conserved in both cofactor C and RP2. Notably, mutations that alter this arginine codon cause familial retinitis pigmentosa. Our data imply that this residue acts as an “arginine finger” to trigger the tubulin GTPase activity and suggest that loss of this function in RP2 contributes to retinal degeneration. We also show that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both cofactor C and RP2 partially complement the microtubule phenotype resulting from deletion of the cofactor C homolog, demonstrating their functional overlap in vivo. Finally, we find that RP2 interacts with GTP-bound ADP ribosylation factor-like 3 protein, providing a link between RP2 and several retinal-specific proteins, mutations in which also cause retinitis pigmentosa.

It is caused by mutations in a dizzying variety of genes; some are structural proteins of photoreceptors, many are involved in photoreception and transduction, and a few are seemingly unrelated ubiquitously expressed proteins (see RetNet, www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/retnet/). Most (80–90%) cases of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa are caused by mutations in two genes,XRP2 and XRP3 (2.Schwahn U. Paland N. Techritz S. Lenzner S. Berger W. Hum. Mol.

It has been shown that cofactor C acts in a pathway together with four other tubulin-specific chaperone proteins (cofactors A, B, D, and E) to chaperone quasi-native α- and β-tubulin subunits released from the cytosolic chaperonin CCT and assemble the α/β-tubulin heterodimer. Each step in this pathway has been deduced from in vitroreconstitution experiments using purified components (7.Tian G. Vainberg I.E. Tap W.D. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Biol.

The pathway hinges on the formation of a supercomplex containing α− and β-tubulin and cofactors C, D, and E. The hydrolysis of GTP by tubulin, stimulated by cofactors C and D, is part of the heterodimer assembly reaction; the stimulated hydrolysis of GTP by β-tubulin acts as a switch for the release from the supercomplex of native, newly made tubulin heterodimers (10.Tian G.

Given the sequence similarity between cofactor C and RP2 and the interaction of Arl2 with tubulin-folding cofactors, we decided to compare the functional and biochemical properties of RP2 and cofactor C and to investigate the possibility that RP2 might interact with one or more Arl proteins. Our data show that RP2 acts as a GAP for tubulin in concert with cofactor D, but unlike cofactor C, it does not catalyze tubulin heterodimerization. We also show that both cofactor C and RP2 partially complement CIN2 deletion in S.cerevisiae and that RP2 binds to Arl3 in a nucleotide and myristoylation-dependent manner. DNA fragments encoding human RP2, cofactor C, BART (binder of Arl2) and carboxyl-terminally His6-tagged Arl2, Arl3 and Arl4 were generated by PCR using reverse transcribed human testis RNA (CLONTECH, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) as template. These were inserted into the pET23b vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). From these plasmids, mutated cDNAs (encoding RP2-R118H, RP2-ΔS6, cofactor C-R262A, Arl3-T30N, and Arl3-Q70L) were generated by PCR, using the recombinant pET23b plasmids as template, with specific mismatched primers and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). For the expression of glutathione S-transferase-RP2 (GST-RP2), a fragment encoding human RP2 was generated and subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) in frame with the GST-coding region. For expression in yeast, human RP2 and RP2-R118H, human cofactor C wild type, and R262A were subcloned from pET23b into pRS413-GPD carrying the HIS3 gene and the 2μori (26.Mumberg D. Muller R.

Full-length, untagged wild type and mutant cofactor C were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells using the expression plasmids described above. Harvested cells were lysed using a French press and clarified by centrifugation, and the recombinant proteins were purified through two dimensions as follows: 1) a cation exchange column of SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), developed with a linear gradient of 10–250 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1 mm each DTT, MgCl2, and EGTA and 2) an anion exchange column (Q15; Amersham Biosciences), also developed using a phosphate buffer gradient (10–400 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3). The recombinant proteins were monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis of fractions emerging from the columns. Wild type and mutant RP2 proteins were expressed from pET23b recombinant plasmids harbored in E. coli BL21(DE3). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g and applied to a Q15 anion exchange column developed with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.01–0.7 m NaCl in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT). The purified material from this dimension was loaded on a column of hydroxyapatite (Pentax, American International Chemical Co., Inc., Natick, MA) in 0.5 mmMgCl2, 50 μm CaCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Elution was performed in the same buffer using a linear gradient of 0–0.25 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7. Fractions enriched in RP2 were further purified by application to a MonoQ anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 1 mm DTT via a 0.0–0.5m gradient of MgCl2. Following each dimension of purification, aliquots of fractions emerging from the column were analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-RP2 antibody for the detection of immunoreactive material. His6-tagged Arl2, Arl3, Arl4, and GST-tagged RP2 were affinity-purified on cobalt resin (CLONTECH, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and agarose-coupled glutathione (Amersham Biosciences), respectively, according to the manufacturer's recommended protocols. Purified recombinant proteins were used as antigens for the production of antisera in rabbits (Arl3, cofactor C) or guinea pigs (RP2) (Cocalico Biologicals Inc., Reamstown, PA). For this purpose, Arl3 was first coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The resulting sera were tested for their titer and specificity by Western blotting against both their respective antigens and whole cell lysates. In vitrotubulin refolding assays (10 μl) were performed in folding buffer (20 mm Mes, pH 6.8, 20 mm KCl, and 1 mmeach DTT, MgCl2, and EGTA), containing 10 μm[α-32P]GTP (2.5 μCi), purified bovine brain tubulin (3 μm), the cytosolic chaperonin CCT (1.5 μm) and various combinations of cofactors B, D, E (6 μg/ml each), and C (6 μg/ml) or RP2 (6–300 μg/ml). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1.25 h and analyzed by native gel electrophoresis (30.Zabala J.C. Cowan N.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 23: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) followed by autoradiography to assess the incorporation of non-exchangeable radiolabeled GTP into refolded tubulin dimers. Purified bovine brain tubulin (1 μm) was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 25 μm [γ-32P]GTP (10 μCi) in folding buffer in the presence of various combinations of tubulin-folding cofactors and RP2 (see Fig. 1 legend). Release of radiolabeled inorganic phosphate was measured at 1 min intervals as described (10.Tian G. Bhamidipati A. Cowan N.J. Lewis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24054-24058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A CIN2deletion strain (413.4B:MATα ade2 his3 leu2 lys2 ura3 cin2::LEU2) (11.Stearns T. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Genetics. 1990; 124: 251-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed according to the lithium acetate method with either pRS413 alone or pRS413 carrying the wild type or mutant versions of RP2 or cofactor C.CIN2-pRS413 was used as a positive control. Transformants were selected on synthetic medium. Single colonies were picked and grown at 30 °C overnight in liquid medium lacking the appropriate amino acids. Transformants were resuspended in sterile water at the same optical density, and growth on plates was tested at 26 °C by spotting serial dilutions of cell suspensions onto yeast extract/peptone/dextrose plates containing 0, 1, or 5 μg/ml of benomyl. cDNAs encoding RP2, cofactor C, and BART were transcribed and translated in vitro using TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine (0.8 mCi/ml) at 30 °C for 1 h. Samples were cleared of ribosomes by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 20 min and preincubated with uncoupled Talon cobalt affinity beads (CLONTECH, Inc.) to remove nonspecifically bound translated protein. Transcription/translation reactions were diluted 20-fold in reaction buffer (0.3 m NaCl, 50 mmphosphate, pH. 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with cobalt affinity beads preloaded with about 25 μg of bound His6-Arl2, 3, or 4 or (in a control reaction) without bound protein. The resin-bound complexes were extensively washed with reaction buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and eluted in SDS gel loading buffer. Some of the in vitrotranscription/translation reactions were done by addition of ethanol alone or 0.6 mmdl-α-hydroxymyristic acid (HMA, Sigma) dissolved in ethanol (the maximum that the system could tolerate). GST-RP2 binding assays were carried out by incubating 0.5 mg of GST-RP2 bound to glutathione-conjugated-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). For binding to immobilized RP2-GST, unfractionated soluble protein from a bovine testis lysate (9.Tian G. Huang Y. Rommelaere H. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) was transferred into PBS by passage over Sephadex G25. 0.6 ml of this material (containing 20 mg/ml total protein) was used for each binding reaction. Incubations were performed at room temperature in the presence of various nucleotides each at a concentration of 1 mm. The beads were washed with PBS containing that nucleotide and 0.05% Tween 20. Protein was eluted with 15 mm glutathione in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, fractionated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-Arl3 antisera or a mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Human RP2 and human cofactor C share 53% similarity and 29% identity over a domain of ∼200 amino acids. The untagged, bacterially expressed proteins were purified to homogeneity through several dimensions of ion exchange chromatography. Using these purified recombinant proteins, together with the cytosolic chaperonin CCT and the other tubulin-specific chaperone proteins required for tubulin heterodimer formation (i.e. cofactors B, D, and E) (9.Tian G. Huang Y. Rommelaere H. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), we performed in vitro α-tubulin refolding reactions in the presence of radiolabeled GTP. In these reactions, tubulin is cycled through the folding (CCT-driven) and heterodimerization (tubulin-folding cofactors) machinery, in the process incorporating non-exchangeable GTP bound to α-tubulin in the α/β heterodimer (10.Tian G. Bhamidipati A. Cowan N.J. Lewis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24054-24058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31.Lewis S.A. Tian G. Cowan N.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 479-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The products were analyzed by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 A). We found that despite its sequence similarity, RP2 was unable to substitute for cofactor C in these in vitro folding reactions and hence cannot participate in the heterodimerization of tubulin under these experimental conditions. Increasing the concentration of RP2 in these reactions had no effect (data not shown). However, reactions containing RP2, cofactors D, or D and E, and native tubulin showed tubulin-GAP activity (Fig. 1 B). No GTP hydrolysis was observed in control reactions containing either RP2 alone or RP2 plus tubulin. We conclude that RP2, like cofactor C, acts in concert with cofactor D as a tubulin-GAP. As is the case with cofactor C, cofactor E enhances this tubulin-GAP activity but is not essential to it (Fig. 1 B). A higher concentration of RP2 relative to cofactor C is needed to elicit comparable tubulin-GAP activity; possible reasons for this difference are discussed below. It has been proposed that GTPase activators share a common active site consisting of an arginine finger (32.Sceffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Arg-118 in RP2 and Arg-262 in cofactor C constitute the only pair of conserved arginines found in these two proteins (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, using site-directed mutagenesis, we engineered plasmid constructs expressing either cofactor C or RP2 mutated at this position, i.e.cofactor C-R262A and RP2-R118H. In the latter case, mutation of arginine to histidine was chosen because this mutation has been shown to cause X-linked retinitis pigmentosa in some families (3.Schwahn U. Lenzner S. Dong J. Feil S. Hinzmann B. van Duijnhoven G. Kirschner R. Hemberger M. Bergen A.A. Rosenberg T. Pinckers A.J. Fundele R. Rosenthal A. Cremers F.P. Ropers H.H. Berger W. Nat.

Sci. 2000; 41: 2712-2721PubMed Google Scholar). We also made a plasmid expressing another disease mutant RP2 protein, RP2-ΔS6. This mutation is known to prevent myristoylation of the protein, a defect leading to intracellular misrouting (2.Schwahn U. Paland N. Techritz S. Lenzner S. Berger W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6.Chapple J.P. Hardcastle A.J. Grayson C. Spackman L.A. Willison K.R. Cheetham M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1919-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The three mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified using precisely the same chromatographic dimensions used to purify the wild type protein. The mutant proteins behaved indistinguishably from their wild type counterpart on all dimensions (see “Materials and Methods”). We conclude that these mutations do not result in any global changes in the structures of the respective proteins. We tested each mutant protein in tubulin-GAP reactions; the results are shown in Fig. 2. Mutation of the invariant arginine common to both RP2 and cofactor C completely abolished their tubulin-GAP activity (Fig. 2,B and C). However, deletion of serine 6 in RP2 had no effect on its GAP activity (Fig. 2 C). Given the structural integrity of the mutant proteins, it seems likely that the invariant arginine is critical for tubulin-GAP activity and suggests that it is indeed part of an arginine finger. Cofactor C and RP2 are distantly related in sequence to the yeast protein CIN2 (11.Stearns T. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Genetics. 1990; 124: 251-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Hoyt M.A. Stearns T. Botstein D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar,40.Hoyt M.A. Macke J.P. Roberts B.T. Geiser J.R. Genetics. 1997; 146: 849-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CIN1, CIN2, CIN4, andPAC2 (putative homologs of cofactor D, cofactor C, Arl2, and cofactor E, respectively) act together in a pathway affecting microtubule stability. Yeast harboring mutations in these genes show supersensitvity to cold and to benomyl, both of which destabilize microtubules. To test whether human cofactor C or RP2 can compensate for the loss of CIN2 in yeast, we transformed plasmids expressing wild type and mutant versions of these proteins into a CIN2deletion strain. We assayed the resulting strains for their benomyl resistance in the cold (26 °C) where benomyl supersensitivity of the parental strain is enhanced. The positive control wasCIN2-cloned into the same vector, and the negative control was the vector itself. As shown in Fig. 3, only wild type RP2 or cofactor C but not RP2-R118H, cofactor C-R262A, or vector alone could complement for the loss of CIN2. Neither RP2 nor cofactor C complemented as well as CIN2 itself, and cofactor C was more effective than RP2 in restoring benomyl resistance. The tubulin-GAP activity of cofactors C and D is modulated by the small G protein Arl2 (ARF-like protein 2) (22.Bhamidipati A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the possibility that one or more members of the Arl family of proteins might bind to RP2. To do this, we generated constructs for the expression in E. coli of Arl2, Arl3, and Arl4, each His6-tagged at their carboxyl termini. The Arl2- and Arl3-binding protein BART (34.Sharer J.D. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27553-27561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 35.Van Valkenburgh H. Shern J.F. Sharer J.D. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22826-22837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. Agarose-bound nickel beads loaded with each of the His6-tagged proteins were incubated with either35S-labeled RP2, BART, or cofactor C generated by translation in vitro. Analysis of the bound products by SDS-PAGE showed that Arl3 bound to in vitro translated RP2 but only in the presence of the slowly hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTP-γ-S (Fig. 4 A). This suggested a specific binding between RP2 and GTP-Arl3. As a positive control, both Arl2 and Arl3 bound to BART, while none of the three Arl proteins tested bound to cofactor C (Fig. 4 A). We also made two mutant forms of Arl3, Arl3-Q71L and Arl3-T30N, based on mutant proteins used for the study of the well characterized and quite similar Ras family of G-proteins (36.Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 37.Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). These mutations correspond to Q61L and T17N in Ras. The former mutation results in a defect in GTP hydrolysis, leading to GTP-bound mutant protein, whereas the latter is defective in GTP binding, resulting in nucleotide-free or GDP-bound protein. We found that the putative GTPase-defective mutant Arl3 binds most strongly to RP2, reinforcing our conclusion that it is GTP-Arl3 that binds to RP2 (Fig. 4 B). The interaction between RP2 and Arl3 was also found using purified tagged proteins (data not shown), demonstrating that the interaction is direct and not mediated by some third protein. To confirm the binding of RP2 to GTP-Arl3 in tissue extracts, we expressed RP2 as a GST fusion protein, immobilized it on agarose-bound glutathione beads, and examined the ability of these beads to specifically bind proteins contained in an unfractionated tissue extract. These experiments were done in the presence of GTP, GDP, GTP-γ-S, or no nucleotide. In each case, the bound proteins were eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with an anti-Arl3 antiserum. These experiments showed that binding of Arl3 is strongest in the presence of GTP-γ-S (Fig. 4 C), supporting a specific interaction between RP2 and GTP-Arl3 in the context of whole cells. We have shown that Arl2 inhibits the tubulin-GAP activity of the tubulin-specific chaperones known as cofactors C and D (22.Bhamidipati A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, we found that neither wild type nor mutant His6-tagged Arl3 modulated the tubulin-GAP activity of RP2 and cofactor D, nor did RP2 behave as a GTPase activator of Arl3 (data not shown). However, these negative results could result from using bacterially synthesized Arl3 protein that is both tagged and unmodified, as well as recombinant RP2, which is not acylated. Because our data established that RP2 binds to GTP-Arl3, we decided to see whether there was differential binding among the RP2 mutant proteins that we used in the GAP experiment shown in Fig. 2. We found that in vitro translated RP2-R118H binds to the GTPase-defective form of Arl3 more weakly than wild type RP2, whereas RP2-ΔS6 bound much more strongly to this form of Arl3 and to wild type Arl3 (Fig. 5 A). Since deletion of serine 6 in RP2 is known to prevent its myristoylation (6.Chapple J.P. Hardcastle A.J. Grayson C. Spackman L.A. Willison K.R. Cheetham M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1919-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we tested whether the enhanced binding of RP2-ΔS6 might be a result of its inability to acquire this posttranslational modification. To do this, we included an inhibitor of myristoylation (dl-α-hydroxymyristic acid) (38.Nadler M.J. Harrison M.L. Ashendel C.L. Cassady J.M. Geahlen R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9250-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in in vitrotranslation reactions and showed that a greater proportion of wild type RP2 is bound to Arl3 when myristoylation is inhibited (Fig. 5 B). We conclude that myristoylation of RP2 indeed weakens its binding to Arl3 while increasing the nucleotide dependence of that interaction. Retinitis pigmentosa 2 protein, RP2, is similar in sequence over half its length to the tubulin-specific chaperone cofactor C. We investigated the functional similarities and differences between the two proteins. We demonstrate here that the two proteins have overlapping but not identical functions. Both stimulate the GTPase activity of native tubulin, in both cases only with the cooperation of cofactor D. However, only cofactor C participates in the heterodimerization of newly folded tubulin subunits. Whereas the ADP-ribosylation factor-like 2 protein (Arl2) regulates the tubulin-GAP activity of cofactors C and D (22.Bhamidipati A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the related protein Arl3, to which RP2 binds specifically (see below), does not affect the tubulin-GAP activity of RP2 and cofactor D. The fact that RP2 and cofactor C are not functionally identical is not surprising given that they only share one of two putative domains and that the former is largely a membrane-associated protein, whereas the latter is cytosolic. Remarkably, we found that mutation of the only conserved arginine residue present in both RP2 and cofactor C (R118H in RP2 and R262A in cofactor C) causes a total loss of tubulin-GAP activity in each protein. The mutation R118H in RP2 is one that has been shown to cause familial retinitis pigmentosa (3.Schwahn U. Lenzner S. Dong J. Feil S. Hinzmann B. van Duijnhoven G. Kirschner R. Hemberger M. Bergen A.A. Rosenberg T. Pinckers A.J. Fundele R. Rosenthal A. Cremers F.P. Ropers H.H. Berger W. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This mutation does not, however, lead to the mislocalization or destabilization of the RP2 protein (2.Schwahn U. Paland N. Techritz S. Lenzner S. Berger W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,6.Chapple J.P. Hardcastle A.J. Grayson C. Spackman L.A. Willison K.R. Cheetham M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1919-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). When expressed in cultured cells (either tagged or untagged), RP2-R118H is expressed at high levels and is targeted to the plasma membrane in a manner indistinguishable from wild type RP2. Combining these genetic studies with the biochemical data presented here, we conclude that the loss of tubulin-GAP activity itself may cause retinitis pigmentosa in families harboring this mutation. The active site of many different GAPs is hypothesized to contain an arginine finger (32.Sceffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). It is likely that the arginine residue we have mutated plays this role in cofactor C and RP2 for two reasons. First, it is the only arginine that is invariant in all sequenced RP2 and cofactor C proteins (2.Schwahn U. Paland N. Techritz S. Lenzner S. Berger W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Second, mutation of this arginine leads to a total loss of GAP activity, while leaving the stability and chromatographic properties of both proteins unchanged. From the latter fact we conclude that mutation of the conserved arginine does not lead to a global rearrangement or misfolding of the proteins. If structural analysis confirms our inference that cofactor C and RP2 act as tubulin-GAPs through an arginine finger, this would be very striking given the fact that tubulin has a very different GTP binding pocket than the small GTP-binding proteins (39.Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). CIN2, the putative homolog of cofactor C in yeast, acts together with CIN1, CIN4, and PAC2(the putative homologs of cofactor D, Arl2, and cofactor E, respectively) in a pathway affecting microtubule stability (11.Stearns T. Hoyt M.A. Botstein D. Genetics. 1990; 124: 251-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Hoyt M.A. Stearns T. Botstein D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar,40.Hoyt M.A. Macke J.P. Roberts B.T. Geiser J.R. Genetics. 1997; 146: 849-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown here that cofactor C and RP2 can partially complement a deletion in CIN2. However, when mutated at the conserved arginine residue, neither protein can restore benomyl resistance to the CIN2 deletion strain. These findings suggest that tubulin-GAP activity is essential for restoring normal microtubule function in vivo. There was a gradient in the effectiveness of these proteins in conferring benomyl resistance: CIN2 > cofactor C > RP2. This result is readily explained by the degree of sequence similarity among the three proteins. We infer that cofactor C is the human homolog of CIN2 and that RP2 (which is similar in sequence over only half its length to cofactor C and CIN2) shares some but not all functions of the latter two proteins. As tubulin-GAPs, RP2 and cofactor C convert GTP-tubulin to GDP-tubulin. Since it is only the former species that is competent to polymerize into microtubules, these GAP activities could regulate microtubule polymerization in vivo. Microtubules are stabilized against catastrophic depolymerization by a dynamic cap of GTP-tubulin formed because, although hydrolysis of bound GTP by tubulin is coupled to its polymerization, this reaction lags slightly behind the polymerization reaction (41.Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1986; 45: 329-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 42.Carlier M.F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1992; 336: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). If the GAP activity of either RP2 or cofactor C causes the destruction of this GTP cap, these proteins would be powerful regulators of microtubule dynamics. Since RP2 is plasma membrane-bound, it is possible that it plays a role in maintaining the plasticity of microtubules near the periphery. The fact that RP2 is membrane-bound in vivo means that in the cell, it is effectively concentrated in two dimensions. This may explain the somewhat higher concentrations of RP2 required for GAP activity in thein vitro reaction compared with those of cofactor C, which is a cytosolic protein. In addition, the myristoylation and palmitoylation of RP2 may enhance its GAP activity (we used recombinant, unmodified RP2 in our in vitro GAP assays). There are several reasons to believe that the GAP activity of RP2 is tubulin specific. 1) This activity is totally dependent on the action of a third protein (cofactor D). 2) RP2 displays no GAP activity toward, for example, recombinant ADP ribosylation factor-like proteins. 3) GAP proteins are usually extremely specific (36.Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar), sometimes selectively recognizing specific isoforms of G proteins. Biochemical and genetic data have previously shown that Arl2, a member of the ARF-like (Arl) subfamily of small G proteins, regulates tubulin-specific chaperones (22.Bhamidipati A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23.Radcliffe P.A. Vardy L. Toda T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we show that RP2 binds to the related protein Arl3. The interaction of Arl3 and RP2 is very likely to be physiologically significant, because 1) it occurs in whole cell extracts and 2) it is GTP-dependent, as is typically the case for interactions of G proteins with their effectors. Interestingly, we find that while RP2-R118H shows a weak affinity to Arl3, RP2-ΔS6 binds more strongly to it than its wild type counterpart as does unmyristoylated RP2. Our data imply that the absence of myristoylation causes the stronger binding of RP2-ΔS6. It is possible that in vivo Arl3 binds to unmodified RP2 and participates in its targeting. The interaction of RP2 and Arl3 is particularly interesting since Arl3 has recently been shown to bind to PDE δ, the δ subunit of rod-specific cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (43.Linari M. Hanzal-Bayer M. Becker J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a molecule involved in phototransduction. PDE δ also interacts with the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (44.Linari M. Ueffing M. Manson F. Wright A. Meitinger T. Becker J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1315-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); mutations in the gene (XRP3) encoding this protein are the major cause of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that Arl3 links RP2 with RGPR and PDE δ in a common pathway necessary for the maintenance of rod photoreceptor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038007176,"A likely causal chain is established here that connects humidity in the stratosphere, relative humidity near the tropical tropopause, ice crystal size in towering cumulus clouds, and aerosols associated with tropical biomass burning. The connections are revealed in satellite-observed fluctuations of each quantity on monthly to yearly time scales. More aerosols lead to smaller ice crystals and more water vapor entering the stratosphere. The connections are consistent with physical reasoning, probably hold on longer time scales, and may help to explain why stratospheric water vapor appears to have been increasing for the past five decades."

The stabilization of loop 98–118 closing the active site through dimeric contacts and interaction with domain 2 allows to observe novobiocin-protein interactions that could not be seen in the 24K-inhibitor complexes. Furthermore, this loop adopts a position which defines an “open” conformation of the active site in absence of ATP, in contrast with the “closed” conformation adopted upon ATP binding. All together, these results indicate how the subdomains may propagate conformational changes from the active site and provide crucial information for the design of more specific inhibitors.

Type II topoisomerases are enzymes essential for chromosome segregation and cell division due to their ability to modify the topological forms of procaryotic and eukaryotic DNA (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). The topoisomerases II share sequence, functional, and structural similarities and this knowledge comes mostly from complementary comparative studies done on the procaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes (2Roca J.

At difference with the eukaryotic enzyme, the bacterial enzyme named gyrase, catalyzes the negative supercoiling of DNA and consists of two proteins, namely GyrB and GyrA associated into a A2B2 oligomer. ATP binding and hydrolysis in the N-terminal part of the B subunit appears to be required for protein-protein interactions and recycling of the enzyme (6Brino L. Urzhumtsev A. Mousli M. Bronner C.

This part of the protein also contains the entry site for the DNA T-segment (7Williams N.L. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13502-13511Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Williams N.L.

Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies on yeast topoisomerase II have shown that the domains of this modular enzyme are capable of wide conformational changes which could be correlated with the topoisomerization mechanism (4Fass D. Bogden C. Berger J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the structure of the whole enzyme is not known. Up to now, the only structural information from the ATP-binding site comes from the Escherichia coli 43K complex with ADPPNP (6Brino L. Urzhumtsev A. Mousli M. Bronner C. Mitschler A. Oudet P. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9468-9475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 11Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Most of the residues which bind the ATP molecule lie in the 24-kDa N-terminal region between residues 1 and 220 (domain 1), but there are two residues (Gln335 and Lys337) in domain 2 (residues 220–392) which also contact the ATP molecule. Although the role of these highly conserved residues remains unclear, mutational studies have pointed out their role in the hydrolysis of ATP and they are thought to be implicated in the transmission of conformational changes upon ATP hydrolysis (12Smith C.V. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9658-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Hu T. Chang S. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9586-9592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The loop closing the active site and comprising residues 98 to 118 forms a β-sheet with the N-terminal arm of the other monomer containing essential residues for the dimerization process, among them is the conserved Ile10 (6Brino L.

Mousli M. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The loop 98–118 is implicated in the binding and hydrolysis of ATP and is composed of conserved residues among the gyrase family (15Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29: 271-297Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) which are involved in the catalytic mechanism (16Lee M.P. Hsieh T.S. J. Mol.

The inhibition of this enzyme has been extensively studied because of the relative sequence divergence in the different pathological bacterial strains and between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes for the design of specific antibiotics or alternatively antitumoral drugs. It has been suggested that diverse inhibitors of type II eukaryotic and procaryotic topoisomerases such as quinolones and etoposides share a common binding site and a common mechanism of action (19Huff A.C. Kreuzer K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20496-20505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In each case, inhibition of the type II DNA topoisomerases yields a complex of enzyme covalently bound to cleaved DNA (20Chen G.L. Yang L. Rowe T.C. Halligan B.D. Tewey K.M. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13560-13566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another group of molecules, namely the coumarins, were previously designed to target the ATP-binding site of gyrase B from bacterial pathogens (21Drlica K. Coughlin S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 44: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Althaus I.W. Dolak L. Reusser F. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1988; 41: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The crystallographic structure of domain 1 (residues 1–220) of the gyrase B subunit from different strains, a 24-kDa protein, has been solved in complex with several coumarins, one of the most potent families of gyrase inhibitors (24Lewis R.J.

Some residues in the pocket are specifically dedicated to the novobiocin binding and mutations at these positions induce the propagation of resistant bacterial strains. Nevertheless, it was shown that the 24 kDa is unable to bind and hydrolyze ATP nor to bind ADP or ADPPNP 1The abbreviations used are: ADPPNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (26Gilbert E.J. Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). No structural data are available on the conformation adopted by the whole 43K ATP-binding domain in the presence of a coumarin inhibitor. 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate We present here the first structural data available on the complex between the entire N-terminal domain of GyrB (43K) and novobiocin, one of the most potent inhibitors of gyrases. We used the 43K domain of gyrase B from the thermophilic bacteria Thermus thermophilus which presents a wider temperature range of activity than the mesophile E. coli bacteria. The particular properties of the thermophile enzyme allowed us to crystallize the N-terminal domain dimer in a new conformation. At the same time, this structure provides information on the ATP binding pocket conformational state targeted by novobiocin. The details of the cloning of T. thermophilus Gyrase A and Gyrase B and of the determination of optimum temperature will be published elsewhere. 2L. Hoermann et al., unpublished data. Negative supercoiling of relaxed pBR322 plasmid was carried out as described by Brino et al. (14Brino L. Bronner C. Oudet P. Mousli M.

Chem. 1984; 259: 9199-9201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 30 min of incubation at 25 °C, reactions were stopped by addition of 1% SDS-DNA gel loading buffer. The decatenation activity was determined using kinetoplast DNA (KDNA, TopoGen, Inc.). The details of the cloning, purification, and crystallization of the T. thermophilus 43K domain of Gyrase B will be described elsewhere. 3V. Lamour et al., unpublished data. Briefly, the T. thermophilus 43K domain from the initial Met to residue 392 was overexpressed in E. coli and purified using a three-step protocol ending with a size exclusion chromatography. The 43K protein was concentrated to 4.5 mg ml−1 in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 200 mm NaCl. The initial screening using Crystal Screen I and II from Hampton ResearchTM was carried out with a protein/novobiocin ratio of 1:1.2 at 276 K and 295 K. We obtained two crystal forms, one with PEG8000 and the other with sodium formate as a precipitating agent. The crystals obtained using sodium formate at pH 8.5 appeared within 3 days at 295 K and could be directly frozen from the mother liquor using a cryoloop. Despite their size (5–10 × 60 × 60 μm3), the crystals diffract up to 2.3 Å on beamline ID14-EH4 (ESRF, Grenoble, France) and a full dataset could be collected with a single crystal. The crystals belong to the P21 space group with a = 44.9 Å, b = 125.5 Å,c = 79.8 Å, and β = 96.4° with 2 molecules per asymmetric unit. The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) between 15 and 2.3 Å (Rsym = 6.4% with redundancy of 2.6 and completeness of 96.6%). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using one E. coli 43K monomer (6Brino L. Urzhumtsev A. Mousli M. Bronner C. Mitschler A. Oudet P. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9468-9475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (all residues replaced by alanines) as a search model with the program AmoRE (29Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The molecular replacement calculations gave two solutions in the asymmetric unit with a correlation coefficient of 21.1% and an R factor of 54.5% after fast rigid body refinement. The two molecules are related by a 2-fold noncrystallographic axis. Iterative cycles of rigid body refinement and torsion angle molecular dynamics at 4000 K in crystallography NMR software (30Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) yielded the complete structure. Although their electron densities were clear, the novobiocin molecules were only included at the last stages of the refinement. Anisotropic scaling and a bulk solvent correction were used and individual B atomic factors were refined anisotropically. Before a last refinement step, solvent molecules were added according to unassigned peaks in a Fo − Fc Fourier difference map contoured at 2.5 ς. The final model consists of residues 9 to 392, the novobiocins (one per monomer), and 469 water molecules with a R factor of 20% and R free 26% (using 7.5% of the reflexions). According to PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), 90% of all residues of both chains are in the most favored main chain torsion angle Ramachandran regions. The coordinates of the crystal structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. We chose the T. thermophilus enzyme because of the sequence conservation with the already known E. coli system from which structural and enzymatic data are available and to take advantage of its thermostable properties. The T. thermophilus Gyrase B shares 51% identity and 64.6% similarity with the E. coli enzyme. The two enzymes essentially differ due to the presence of an additional stretch of about 165 amino acids between residues 559 and 728 in the E. coli sequence (15Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29: 271-297Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This insertion domain is missing in Gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasma, it is also absent in eukaryotic topoisomerase II. Nevertheless, the catalytic activity data obtained for the T. thermophilusA2B2 complex are similar to the E. coli A2B2 one (Table I). The thermophile enzyme presents the same response as the E. coli protein to the inhibition by novobiocin. The main difference resides in the optimum activity temperature which is of 65 °C for the T. thermophilus gyrase versus 37 °C for the E. coli gyrase. At the same time, the temperature range of activity is much wider for the thermophile enzyme than for the mesophile gyrase. This indicates a greater stability of the T. thermophilusA2B2 assembly and probably a greater stability of the individual subunits.Table IEnzymatic activities of E. coli and T. thermophilus A2B2 enzymesE. coli A2B2T. thermophilusA2B2Supercoiling++++Decatenation++++Novobiocin inhibition1:401:47Optimum temperature37 °C65 °CTemperature range16–47 °C25–77 °CThe activities were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab The activities were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The catalytic sites of the E. coli and T. thermophilus gyrases are very similar. The 43K ATPase domain is 48% identical to the E. coli enzyme with 62% similarity in this domain (Fig. 1). The limits of the T. thermophilus 43K domain were engineered by comparison with the E. coli sequence which led to the crystallographic determination of its structure (see “Experimental Procedures”). The recombinant protein was overproduced in E. coli and purified to more than 95% purity using two chromatographic steps (details of the protocol will be published elsewhere).3 We incubated the N-terminal 43K domain (residues comprising the initial Met to residue 392) in the presence of an excess of novobiocin prior to crystallization. Thin plates of less than 10 μm thick appeared at 295 K using sodium formate as the precipitating agent. This crystal form could be reliably reproduced at this temperature and also at 278 K. The crystals belong to the space group P21 (a = 44.88Å, b = 125.55Å,c = 79.83Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 96.36°) with two molecules per asymmetric unit and diffract to 2.3 Å. The 43K N-terminal of T. thermophilus GyrB presents the same fold as the E. coli enzyme with two structural subdomains (11Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). All residues from Ala9 could be constructed out of the density map, the 8 extreme N-terminal residues being disordered. In both proteins, a novobiocin molecule could be localized at the entry of the ATP binding pocket, partially covering its binding site (see below). In the crystal, the T. thermophilus 43K-novobiocin complex forms a dimer similar to the one previously observed between the E. coli enzyme with ADPPNP, one monomer being related to the other by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis. The superposition of monomer A with monomer B of the T. thermophilus dimer shows a root mean square deviation of 0.55 Å, which indicates that the two molecules are identical. The existence of a dimer in the presence of novobiocin was not expected according to previous data obtained in the field. The structure of the E. coli 24K domain in complex with novobiocin showed a monomeric structure (24Lewis R.J. Singh O.M. Smith C.V. Skarzynski T. Maxwell A. Wonacott A.J. Wigley D.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1412-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This could be explained because many residues involved in the dimeric contacts in domain 2 were not present in this construct. Furthermore, the characterization of the oligomeric state of the E. coli GyrB by gel filtration chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the 43K-novobiocin complex behaves mainly like a monomer in solution (33Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We performed gel exclusion chromatography experiments on the entire GyrB in the absence and presence of novobiocin and ADPPNP. In the Sepharose gel, the protein behaves as a monomer when alone or in the presence of novobiocin and as a dimer in presence of the ADPPNP (data not shown). To analyze the species present in the elution fractions, we examined an aliquot of the top of each peak by native gel electrophoresis. This confirms that the GyrB alone is a monomer whereas both monomer and dimer coexist in the presence of ADPPNP or novobiocin (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the fraction of dimeric species is more important for the ADPPNP-GyrB complex than for the novobiocin-GyrB complex, suggesting that the dimeric form with novobiocin is much less stable than the one with ADPPNP. The same experiments were performed on the 43K domain and showed similar results indicating that most of the dimeric contacts lie in the 43K domain (Fig. 2). Indeed, the buried surface in the novobiocin dimer interface (2141 Å2) is 20% smaller than that of the E. coli-ADPPNP complex (2710 Å2), a fact that could explain the decreased stability of this complex in solution. Moreover, in the complex with ADPPNP, Tyr5 makes an interaction which contributes to the stabilization of the dimer. In our structure, the presence of novobiocin prevents this residue from closing the ATP binding pocket, further decreasing the stability of the dimer. Nevertheless, this interaction was shown to be dispensable for the formation of the dimer whereas mutation of Ile10 alone strongly affects the ability of the 43K domain to dimerize (6Brino L. Urzhumtsev A. Mousli M. Bronner C. Mitschler A. Oudet P. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9468-9475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Despite the equilibrium between the monomeric and the dimeric forms of the 43K-ADPPNP complex in solution, the previous crystallographic structures showed that the dimeric form was stabilized in the crystal (6Brino L. Urzhumtsev A. Mousli M. Bronner C. Mitschler A. Oudet P. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9468-9475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 11Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In the crystallization conditions we used, we could also stabilize the dimeric form of the 43K domain in complex with novobiocin. In both E. coli and T. thermophilus complexes, there are three regions of interaction between the molecules forming the 43K dimer. The two C-terminal helices and loops 274–286 make few Van der Waals contacts, whereas the N-terminal part of each monomer contributes to most of the contacts with elements of the ATP-binding site. Both E. coli and T. thermophilus dimers occupy roughly the same volume (Fig. 3 a). However, the superposition of domain 1 of a monomer of the T. thermophilus complex on domain 1 of the E. coli complex leads to a root mean square deviation of 3.6 Å suggesting a large rearrangement of the dimer interface (Fig. 3 b). We can observe that the second molecule has rotated about 18° around an axis positioned between the monomers defining a different orientation from the position it adopts in the E. coli complex. As a consequence, the buried surface between the monomers is reduced and the residues that are involved in the dimeric contacts of the T. thermophilus complex constitute a subset of those participating to the dimeric interface of the ADPPNP complex. At the level of one monomer, the superposition of domain 1 of one E. coli monomer on one of the T. thermophilus complex shows a root mean square deviation of 2 Å and reveals a large movement of domain 2 (Fig. 3 c), whereas the ATP-binding region remains unchanged except loop 98–118 (see below). The spatial movement of domain 2 takes root in the hinge region of Gly211, a conserved residue in most procaryotic and eukaryotic sequences. The movement is amplified at the end of the strand 211–219 where the flexibility is ensured by two conserved glycines (Gly220 and Gly221). The new position of domain 2 is finally completed by a larger movement articulated around the first residues of loop 231 to 240, a variable region which contains charged residues. As a consequence, the β-sheet of domain 2 slides on the hydrophobic face of helix 219–230 reaching a position different from the one observed for the E. coli 43K-ADPPNP complex. The movement of domain 2 can be resumed as a rotation of 18° around an axis containing Gly221. The most important dimeric contacts are localized between the loop 98–118 closing the ATP-binding site of one monomer and the first 30 N-terminal residues of the other monomer. The β-sheet formed by the N-terminal residues 10 to 13 from one monomer with the loop residues 98 to 100 from the other monomer is maintained. Nevertheless, compared with the ADPPNP complex, this loop embraced a wider volume (Fig. 4 a). In its N-terminal part, the new position of the loop induces a slight bending of loop 78–90 due to the strictly conserved Gly78, so as to keep the dimeric contact between Asp85 and Lys14 from the other monomer. The other loop residues implicated in the dimeric contacts are rearranged to stabilize the new dimeric interface. Histidines A99 and A116 form a water mediated hydrogen bond with TyrB26. The symmetrical interaction network can be found in the other monomer between TyrA26, HisB98, HisB115, and a water molecule (Fig. 4 b). In the E. coli complex with ADPPNP, TyrA26 is in direct interaction with HisB99 and with the main chain carbonyl group of HisB116, whereas the side chain of HisB116 is implicated in another hydrogen bond network with the side chain of Gln335. In addition, the loop 98–116 appears to play a key role in the relative position of domain 2 versus domain 1. This loop forms two contacts with domain 2: Ser111 (E. coli Ser112) interacts with Asn271 whereas Tyr108 (E. coli Tyr109) makes a hydrogen bond with Glu249. Although maintained, these contacts are slightly rearranged due to the new conformation of loop 98–118 in the T. thermophilus complex. The interactions between the conserved residues His116, Tyr26, and Gln335 are lost in the absence of ADPPNP and the contact between Gly113 and Lys337 implicated in the binding of the γ-phosphate of ADPPNP is also lost due to the position adopted by loop 98–118 in this region (see Fig. 4 a). The conformation adopted by loop 98–118 is different from the one observed with ADPPNP. Its position is stabilized by both dimeric interactions and contacts with domain 2 which results in rearrangements in both dimer interface and orientation of domain 2. The novobiocin molecule is maintained at the entry of the active site by both hydrophobic and hydrophilic contacts, partially overlapping the ATP-binding site. The strongest interactions of the coumarin with the ATP binding pocket as the one with the conserved Arg136, are the same as those observed in the crystal structure of the E. coli 24-kDa domain with novobiocin (24Lewis R.J. Singh O.M. Smith C.V. Skarzynski T. Maxwell A. Wonacott A.J. Wigley D.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1412-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). One additional strong hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp80 (a glycine in the E. coli sequence) can be observed whose implications will be discussed below. Some weak interactions with novobiocin are slightly modified compared with the E. coli 24-kDa novobiocin complex. The carboxylic side chain oxygen of Glu49 is at a H-bond distance of the novobiose ring whereas in the E. coli 24 kDa-novobiocin complex, the corresponding Glu50 binds the novobiose ring through an ordered water molecule. Interestingly, the stabilization of loop 98–118 by dimeric contacts allows additional interactions of the loop residues with the novobiocin molecule which could not be seen in the 24 kDa-novobiocin complex due to the monomeric structure of domain 1 alone. There are three additional hydrophobic contacts with residues Phe103, Val117, and Ile10 from the other monomer with novobiocin and some additional water-mediated contacts with the main chain of Tyr94 and Val117 (Fig. 5). Furthermore, Lys102 and Lys109 point toward the novobiocin molecule suggesting weak interactions with the inhibitor (Fig. 5). In the E. coli complex, loop 98–118 is wrapping tightly the ADPPNP molecule in a conformation where Lys102 binds the β-phosphate of ADPPNP. We can also observe that Tyr108 which positions the ATP adenine ring points outside the active site in the presence of novobiocin. Positioning of the Tyr108 side chain inside the pocket would result in a steric clash with the novobiose ring. Tyr108 is now stabilized by a hydrogen bond of its hydroxyl group with the carbonyl oxygen of Glu249 in domain 2. The hydrogen bond between Asp80 and the novobiocin molecule constitutes a specific feature of the novobiocin binding to the T. thermophilus enzyme. In E. coli, this residue is replaced by a glycine. At this position the gyrase family exhibits either a negatively charged residue (Asp or Glu) or an hydrophobic residue which is mainly a glycine, and sometimes an alanine in the prokaryotic GyrBs (15Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29: 271-297Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In a novobiocin-resistant strain of Haloferax, this residue is replaced by a glycine while at the same time Ser121 and Arg136 are also mutated (34Holmes M.L. Dyall-Smith M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 642-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arg136 is a strictly conserved residue and its only mutation provokes novobiocin resistance in various organisms (34Holmes M.L. Dyall-Smith M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 642-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Contreras A. Maxwell A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 36Samuels D.S. Marconi R.T. Huang W.M. Garon C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3072-3075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Up to now, the mutation of Asp80 alone was not shown to induce novobiocin resistance but it is worth noting that the eukaryotic TopoIIs sequences present a valine at this position, suggesting that the novobiocin binding specificity for the bacteria possessing a charged residue may partly lie in this region. As for Asp80 in the resistant strain of Haloferax, the mutation of Ser121(Ser120 in T. thermophilus) alone does not induce novobiocin resistance and in the E. coli complex with ADPPNP, this residue makes no particular interactions with other residues. However, in the present conformation of the dimer, loop 98–118 is stabilized by an internal water-mediated hydrogen bond network between residues from its N and C terminus ends implicating Ser120. A mutation at this position could affect the stability of the loop and destabilize this particular conformation of the catalytic pocket and as a consequence the novobiocin-binding site. In the structure of the E. coli-ADPPNP complex, the conserved residues among the type II topoisomerases, Lys337 and Gln335 are within hydrogen bonding distance of the γ-phosphate (6Brino L. Urzhumtsev A. Mousli M. Bronner C. Mitschler A. Oudet P. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9468-9475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 11Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Tyr108 induces the bending of loop 98–118 over the ATP molecule by interacting with the adenine ring, whereas Asn46 links the α-phosphate. Lys102contributes to the positioning of the β-phosphate with the conserved Glu41 (Glu42 in E. coli) which is involved in the nucleophilic attack of the ATP through a Mg2+ ion (37Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The C-terminal part of loop 98–118 together with residues Gln335 and Lys337 of domain 2, is very tighly closed on the γ-phosphate (Fig. 4a), this can be considered as a closed conformation of the active site. The new conformation of loop 98–118 is essentially stabilized by strong dimeric contacts and interactions with domain 2, leaving most of the ATP-binding site filled with water molecules. The novobiocin molecule has trapped an open conformation of the active site in contrast with the closed conformation adopted upon ATP binding. The hydrolysis of ATP bound in the closed conformation and the departure of the reaction products would induce a complete reorganization of the active site by provoking the breaking of the hydrogen bonds between the β-phosphate and Lys102(E. coli Lys103), between His116 and Gln335, as well as between the main chain amide group of Tyr26 and Gln335 and finally between Tyr108 (E. coliTyr109) and the adenine ring. In the open conformation, the side chain of Lys109 is directed to the inside of the active site whereas those of Lys102 and Tyr108point outside the active site, in the opposite direction from the one they adopt in the closed conformation (Fig. 6). The flexibility of the two conserved pairs of glycine upstream and downstream loop 98–118 would facilitate the rearrangement of the backbone in the absence of ATP. Previous mutational studies of Lys102, Lys109, and Tyr108 were shown to impair the catalytic activity of type II topoisomerases (16Lee M.P. Hsieh T.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17Li W. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31190-31195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These data all together with the structural information from both open and closed conformations correlate the catalytic activity of the enzyme to the motions of the loop closing the active site. Moreover, mutagenesis studies showed that Lys337 has a critical role in the ATPase reaction in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and it was suggested that this residue is likely to be implicated in the stabilization of the transition state (12Smith C.V. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9658-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Hu T. Chang S. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9586-9592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the conformation we observe, Gln335 and Lys337are pushed away by the dilatation of loop 98–116 which fills the space left free by the β- and γ-phosphates and leads to the complete swivel of domain 2. Furthermore, the breaking of the hydrogen bond between Gln335 and Tyr26 involved in dimeric contacts would initiate the conformational changes observed at the dimeric interface. These results are in agreement with previous works suggesting that Gln335 and Lys337 provide a mechanism for signaling the hydrolysis of ATP to the rest of the protein by initiating conformational changes following ATP hydrolysis (11Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The relative orientation of domain 1 and 2 and the resulting dimeric interface are coupled to the loop 98–118 conformation adopted upon ATP hydrolysis. Since gyrase B can bind ADP while keeping a partial activity (38Roca J. Wang J.C. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39Sugino A. Higgins N.P. Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), there should be a particular conformation of the catalytic site in the presence of ADP. The conformation adopted right after ATP hydrolysis, in the presence of ADP and after the release of inorganic phosphate, may be an intermediate conformation between the closed and the open conformation and may define another dimer interface. The catalytic activity of the T. thermophilus enzyme is identical to that of the E. coli enzyme with the advantages of its thermostable properties. The large homology of the T. thermophilus gyrase with the E. coli enzyme allows us to use the structural observations for understanding the function. This enzyme provided a tool for observing easily other reaction intermediates. Our results show that the novobiocin molecule has trapped a new dimeric conformation of the ATP-binding 43K domain. Considering the implication of the loop residues in the stabilization of the new conformation of the catalytic pocket, this clarifies the origin of some otherwise unexplained resistance mechanisms. In particular, mutation of Ser121 could decrease the occurrence of the open conformation and thus, together with the other mutations, prevent novobiocin from binding. Furthermore, the description of the full 43K active site provide additional information about possible contacts with the coumarins which could be used to design more specific compounds."

It is well established, however, that the brain controls eye position by integrating eye velocity commands. By electrically stimulating and reversibly inactivating midbrain sites in the head-free (nonimmobilized) monkey, we found that the interstitial nucleus of Cajal functions as a neural integrator for head posture. We suggest that a bilateral imbalance in this structure, through either direct damage or inappropriate input, could be one of the mechanisms underlying torticollis."

Human MxA protein belongs to a family of highly conserved GTPases that have been discovered because some Mx family members have antiviral activity against RNA viruses (1.Haller O. Frese M. Kochs G. Rev. Sci. Tech. Off. Int. Epizoot. 1998; 17: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).

Human MxA is a 76-kDa protein with low affinity for GTP and a high GTP turnover rate (13.Melen K. Ronni T. Lotta T. Julkunen I. J. Biol.

Interestingly the GTPase activity of MxA appears to be independent of cofactors such as GTPase-activating proteins or nucleotide exchange factors (2.Staeheli P. Pitossi F. Pavlovic J. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 268-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This intrinsic GTPase activity is a characteristic feature of all members of the superfamily of dynamin-like large GTPases (15.Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L.

Furthermore, a feature common to most family members is their localization to intracellular membranes and their involvement in intracellular membrane fission processes. In contrast, the Mx proteins seem not to be membrane-associated and are not involved in membrane fission but are involved in the early interferon-induced antiviral response (17.Staeheli P. Haller O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2150-2153Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The domain structure of large GTPases is now well established. All family members have a highly conserved tripartite GTP binding motif within their N-terminal G domains (15.Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). GTP binding and/or hydrolysis are required for function (18.Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2000; 1: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This has also been demonstrated for the antiviral activity of Mx proteins (19.Pitossi F. Blank A. Schröder A. Schwarz A.

They represent the first known structures in the superfamily of large GTPases. The globular G domains of both proteins resemble the G domain of Ras-like small GTPases but exhibit also some specific differences. It is likely that the G domains of Mx proteins have similar architectural features. The C-terminal parts of the molecules are less well conserved among the various members of the dynamin superfamily and serve specific functions. They control self-assembly and association with effector molecules (23.Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin.

Dynamin has additional C-terminal domains that are important for its function. The “pleckstrin homology region” is involved in the association of dynamin with phospholipids, and the “proline-rich domain” mediates binding to partner molecules with a Src homology 3 domain (25.Hinshaw J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These domains are absent in Mx protein family members that do not seem to associate with membranes. Homo-oligomerization into ring-like and helical structures is essential for the biological function of dynamin-like proteins (18.Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L.

Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The conformational change presumably generates the mechanochemical force necessary for the vesiculation of lipid structures (18.Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L.

This interaction requires the presence of GTPγS, 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)GDPβSguanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate)a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, as a stabilizing factor. Most likely GTP-binding leads to a conformational change that favors tight binding to the viral target structures (24.Kochs G. Trost M. Janzen C. Haller O.

We show that recombinant MxA self-assembles into ordered ring- and spiral-like structures. The shape of these structures changed depending on the type of guanosine nucleotide bound. These data suggest that MxA displays different conformations in the course of its GTPase cycle. Histidine-tagged MxA and MxA(T103A) were produced inEscherichia coli and isolated using Ni2+ chelate chromatography as described previously (19.Pitossi F. Blank A. Schröder A. Schwarz A. Hüssi P.

Methods. 1998; 15: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The recombinant histidine-tagged proteins had a concentration of about 3–4 mg/ml and were used for analysis immediately without freezing in all experiments described. Recombinant MxA was diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in HCB300 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol containing 300 mm NaCl) and dialyzed against HCB overnight at 4 °C. When indicated, guanosine nucleotides (100 μm) or GDP/AlF4−(100 μm GDP combined with 5 mm NaF and 500 μm AlCl3) were added to the dialysis buffer or were added directly into the protein solution prior to incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Samples (300 μl) were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C (50,000 rpm in a TLA120 rotor, Beckman Instruments). Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Supernatants (10 μl) and pellets (5 μl) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. MxA was dialyzed under various conditions overnight at 4 °C or incubated in the presence of nucleotides at 37 °C for 10 min as described above. Samples were diluted to 0.1 and 0.05 mg/ml in the appropriate buffer, adsorbed to glow-discharged carbon-coated electron microscopy grids, and negatively stained with 0.75% (w/v) aqueous uranyl formiate before air drying. Samples were viewed in a Hitachi A-7000 (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV. Electron micrographs were recorded on Kodak SO-163 (Eastman Kodak Co.) electron image film at a nominal magnification of 50,000×. To study the conformational changes of MxA protein resulting in oligomer formation, we first determined the salt dependence of protein self-assembly. The oligomerization state of MxA was determined by a sedimentation assay as described by Hinshaw and Schmid (40.Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) and by electron microscopy. For this purpose, recombinant MxA isolated from E. coli in high salt buffer was dialyzed against various salt concentrations at 4 °C. MxA protein was predominantly found in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation in the presence of 300 mm NaCl, whereas only a small part of the protein sedimented into the pellet fraction (Fig. 1A). This suggests that MxA existed predominantly in a low oligomeric state at high salt concentration. Electron micrographs of the protein solution before centrifugation revealed granular as well as some spherical or short fibrillar structures (Fig. 1B, 300 mm). After lowering the salt concentration in the dialysis buffer, MxA appeared in the pellet fraction following ultracentrifugation (Fig. 1A). Electron micrographs confirmed this change in self-assembly of MxA under low salt condition yielding long filamentous structures with a diameter of about 20 nm (Fig. 1B, 50 and 150 mmNaCl). Previous gel filtration studies are in agreement with the polymeric state of MxA under low salt conditions. It was estimated that the molecular weight of these MxA polymers was ∼2 MDa, suggesting that they consist of about 30 monomers (14.Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24.Kochs G. Trost M. Janzen C. Haller O. Methods. 1998; 15: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of nucleotide binding on MxA self-assembly by the sedimentation assay, we used high salt buffer (300 mm NaCl) conditions and various GTP analogs. In a first set of experiments, MxA was dialyzed against HCB300 (see “Experimental Procedures”) with different nucleotides at 4 °C overnight. The nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogs GDPβS and GTPγS that mimic binding of GDP or GTP to MxA showed no effect on the sedimentation behavior (Fig. 2A). However, when MxA was incubated with GDP in the presence AlF4−, the majority of MxA was found in the pellet fraction. It has been shown that AlF4−binds preferentially to the GDP-loaded form of GTP-binding proteins thereby representing the conformation of the transition state during GTP hydrolysis (42.Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 43.Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 44.Ahmadian M.R. Mittal R. Hall A. Wittinghofer A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when MxA was first dialyzed against HCB300 before adding the various nucleotides and following a 10-min incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 2C and data not shown). To confirm the specificity of the GDP/AlF4−-dependent effect, we analyzed the behavior of MxA(T103). This mutant protein has a threonine to alanine exchange at position 103 in the GTP-binding domain that significantly lowers the GTP binding capacity of MxA (20.Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When dialyzed against various salt concentrations, MxA(T103A) behaved like the wild-type protein in the sedimentation assay. Accordingly the mutant protein was found in the pellet fraction in the presence of 150 mm NaCl but in the supernatant when 300 mm NaCl was used (Fig. 2B). Incubation of MxA(T103A) with GDP/AlF4−at 37 °C for 10 min in high salt buffer had no effect on its oligomerization state, whereas the wild-type protein sedimented after binding of GDP/AlF4−as expected (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that oligomerization of MxA in the presence of GDP/AlF4−requires a functional nucleotide-binding domain. The effect of various nucleotides on MxA self-assembly was studied by electron microscopy. MxA was diluted in low salt buffer (50 mm NaCl) on ice, resulting in the formation of the characteristic filamentous structures (Fig. 3A, 50 mmNaCl (4 °C)). When this protein solution was subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, the filaments disassembled into shorter, more condensed aggregates (Fig. 3A, 50 mmNaCl(37 °C)). Using these experimental conditions, MxA was mixed with different types of guanosine nucleotides before incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Incubation of MxA with GDP (not shown) or with the nonhydrolyzable analog GDPβS resulted in the formation of C-shape or ring-like structures with an outer ring diameter of about 60 nm and an inner ring diameter of about 40 nm (Fig. 3B, GDPβS). These ring-like assemblies strikingly resembled the structures first described for mouse Mx1 by Nakayama et al. (27.Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation with GTPγS yielded more complex structures that resembled spirals or stacks of interconnected rings (Fig. 3B,GTPγS). Incubation with GDP/AlF4−resulted in the formation of larger condensed aggregates (Fig. 3B,GDP/ AlF4−). These data demonstrate that binding of guanosine nucleotides leads to the formation of distinct MxA oligomeric structures. We have studied the self-assembly of MxA into high molecular weight structures. Oligomerization of MxA was influenced by salt concentration, temperature, and presence of guanosine nucleotides. Under low salt conditions at 4 °C, MxA formed long fibrillary structures that disintegrated into smaller fragments after incubation at 37 °C. Binding of GDPβS under low salt conditions at 37 °C induced the formation of evenly shaped rings that condensed to spirals or stacks of rings after incubation with GTPγS. A complex of MxA with GDP/AlF4−yielded larger oligomeric granula and may thus mimic the conformation of MxA in a transition state during GTP hydrolysis. Interestingly MxA self-assembled into large filamentous structures with an approximate diameter of about 20 nm when exposed to salt concentrations below 300 mm. This was remarkable because similarly large polymers are formed by dynamin only at salt concentrations below 50 mm (40.Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). At higher salt concentrations, dynamin forms tetramers (34.Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In contrast, MxA forms low molecular weight oligomers such as dimers and trimers only when unphysiological buffer conditions (1 m NaCl, 50% ethylene glycol) are used (32.Melen K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. Vonbonsdorff C.H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that MxA differs markedly from dynamin in its propensity to oligomerize. Therefore, MxA is likely to form large oligomeric structures even at physiological salt concentrations in living cells. MxA has indeed been observed to aggregate into punctate granula in the cytoplasm of interferon-treated human cells or in cells transfected with cDNA expression constructs coding for MxA (45.Pavlovic J. Zürcher T. Haller O. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3370-3375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Frese M. Kochs G. Meier-Dieter U. Siebler J. Haller O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3904-3909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MxA formed ring-like and helical structures after incubation with guanosine nucleotides under low salt condition. An in-creased oligomerization state could also be detected in the sedimentation assay when MxA was incubated with GDP/AlF4−. We could demonstrate that the effect of GDP/AlF4−depends on a functional GTP-binding domain by using MxA(T103A), a mutant form of MxA that has no GTP binding capacity (20.Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AlF4−binds to the GDP-loaded form of GTP-binding proteins thereby mimicking the conformation of a transition state, i.e.GDP·Pi, during hydrolysis of GTP (47.Wittinghofer A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R682-R685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the large aggregates of MxA stabilized in the presence of GDP/AlF4−might reflect the conformational interim during the transition from the GTP-loaded to the GDP-loaded molecule. Interestingly GDP/AlF4−does not have the same effect on dynamin but forms extended spirals similar to those found with GTPγS (48.Carr J.C. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28030-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the case of MxA, GTPγS and GDP/AlF4−appear to stabilize different oligomeric states during MxA self-assembly. This is in agreement with previous findings indicating that GTPγS and GDP/AlF4−block the GTPase cycle at different steps (47.Wittinghofer A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R682-R685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Small GTPases like p21ras have been shown to associate with AlF4−in their GDP-bound form only in the presence of their respective GTPase-activating proteins (44.Ahmadian M.R. Mittal R. Hall A. Wittinghofer A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The strong effect of GDP/AlF4−on MxA oligomerization supports the view that large GTPases such as Mx proteins and dynamins harbor an intrinsic GTPase-activating function and hence are able to hydrolyze GTP without additional cofactors (33.Schwemmle M. Richter M.F. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 34.Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 35.Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Homo-oligomerization into ring-like and helical structures appears to be essential for the biological function of dynamin-like proteins and their membrane fission activities (18.Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2000; 1: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 36.McNiven M.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 151-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). What might be the function of MxA self-assembly? It was recently demonstrated that oligomerization stimulates the GTPase activity of MxA and prevents proteolytic degradation of the protein (49.Flohr F. Schneider-Schaulies S. Haller O. Kochs G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 50.Janzen C. Kochs G. Haller O. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8202-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The MxA mutant MxA(L612K), having an amino acid exchange from leucine to lysine at position 612 within the leucine zipper motif, has lost both its GTPase activity and its ability to self-assemble into oligomers (30.Schumacher B. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28365-28370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 50.Janzen C. Kochs G. Haller O. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8202-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 51.DiPaolo C. Hefti H.P. Meli M. Landis H. Pavlovic J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32071-32078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This mutant is rapidly degraded when expressed in transfected cells, whereas wild-type MxA is stable (50.Janzen C. Kochs G. Haller O. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8202-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that the high molecular weight MxA oligomers found in interferon-treated human cells represent a storage form of MxA. Constant hydrolysis of GTP might induce the release of antivirally active MxA monomers from these intracellular storages. We have further postulated that, in infected cells, the free MxA monomers bind to specific viral structures and subsequently oligomerize around their viral targets (50.Janzen C. Kochs G. Haller O. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8202-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Previous cosedimentation experiments with MxA and viral nucleocapsids demonstrated that only GTP-bound MxA was able to interact with viral targets, whereas nucleotide-free MxA or GDP-bound MxA was not (41.Kochs G. Haller O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4370-4376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This led us to propose that GTP-MxA is in an interactive conformation that is able to recognize viral target structures and that this active conformation is stabilized by GTPγS (24.Kochs G. Trost M. Janzen C. Haller O. Methods. 1998; 15: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Once associated with the viral structure, oligomerization might stimulate the hydrolysis of GTP, which in turn would lead to a conformational change in the molecule that may have a deleterious effect on the viral target. The present data support such a scenario. MxA formed ring-like structures after incubation with GDP or GDPβS. These rings (of about 60 nm for the outer diameter and 40 nm for the inner ring diameter) resemble in dimension and appearance the ring-like structures formed by dynamin (38.Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 39.Stowell M.H.B. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 40.Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Addition of GTPγS increased the oligomerization state of MxA, inducing the transition of the rings into spirals and stacks of interconnected rings. Therefore, we propose that MxA exists in three different conformational and functional states within the cell. MxA homo-oligomers may represent an inactive storage form, while MxA monomers are most likely antivirally active and able to form helical polymers around viral target structures. We are currently trying to elucidate whether virus infection quantitatively influences the ratio between these different states. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the human MxA GTPase is able to self-assemble into higher ordered oligomers under physiological conditions that may stabilize the protein within interferon-treated cells. We have further shown that nucleotide binding induces gross conformational changes, resembling those described for dynamin, supporting the view that MxA may function as a mechanochemical molecular machine after binding to viral target structures. Studies are now under way to confirm this concept for the action of MxA in virus-infected cells. We thank Simone Gruber for excellent technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2051336083,"Mannose-binding proteins (MBPs) are C-type animal lectins that recognize high mannose oligosaccharides on pathogenic cell surfaces. MBPs bind to their carbohydrate ligands by forming a series of Ca2+ coordination and hydrogen bonds with two hydroxyl groups equivalent to the 3- and 4-OH of mannose. In this work, the determinants of the orientation of sugars bound to rat serum and liver MBPs (MBP-A and MBP-C) have been systematically investigated. The crystal structures of MBP-A soaked with monosaccharides and disaccharides and also the structure of the MBP-A trimer cross-linked by a high mannose asparaginyl oligosaccharide reveal that monosaccharides or α1–6-linked mannose bind to MBP-A in one orientation, whereas α1–2- or α1–3-linked mannose binds in an orientation rotated 180° around a local symmetry axis relating the 3- and 4-OH groups. In contrast, a similar set of ligands all bind to MBP-C in a single orientation. The mutation of MBP-A His189 to its MBP-C equivalent, valine, causes Manα1–3Man to bind in a mixture of orientations. These data combined with modeling indicate that the residue at this position influences the orientation of bound ligands in MBP. We propose that the control of binding orientation can influence the recognition of multivalent ligands. A lateral association of trimers in the cross-linked crystals may reflect interactions within higher oligomers of MBP-A that are stabilized by multivalent ligands.

Serum mannose-binding proteins (MBPs)1 are C-type lectins that function in immune surveillance by recognizing high mannose structures present on pathogenic organisms such as bacteria and fungi (1Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). MBPs trigger cell killing by activating the complement pathway, leading to opsonization or direct lysis of the target cell (2Ikeda K. Sannoh T. Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7451-7454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kuhlman M. Joiner K. Ezekowitz R.A.B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1733-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 4Super M.

Immunity. 1995; 3: 485-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The ability of these proteins to distinguish foreign from self through the recognition of unique carbohydrate structures thereby contributes to host defense independent of an antibody response. Rodents and some other mammals (6Mogues T. Ota T. Tauber A.I. Sastry K.N. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) express two related MBPs in the serum and the liver in which the rat are designated MBP-A and MBP-C, respectively (7Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins can fix complement, although the biological role of the liver-associated MBP is unclear at present. Each MBP consists of a cysteine-rich N-terminal domain followed by a collagenous region, an α-helical “neck” and a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (7Drickamer K. Dordal M.S. Reynolds L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6878-6886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CRD mediates recognition of target cells, and the collagenous domain interacts with MBP-associated serine proteases that trigger the downstream complement response (8Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). MBP polypeptides are assembled into trimeric building blocks that contain collagenous triple helices. Trimer formation requires the presence of the neck region, which associates into an α-helical coiled-coil structure (9Sheriff S. Chang C.Y. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 10Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Disulfide bonds formed between cysteine-rich domains of MBP-A mediate higher order oligomerization of the trimeric building block, a property associated with more efficient complement fixation (8Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). MBPs have a broad carbohydrate specificity concordant with their need to recognize a variety of pathogenic cell surfaces. This specificity includes d-mannose,N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, and l-fucose (12Lee R.T. Ichikawa Y. Fay M. Drickamer K. Shao M.-C. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4810-4815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The common feature of these sugars is the presence of vicinal equatorial hydroxyl groups in the stereochemistry of the 3- and 4-OH groups of d-mannose, and these sugars are referred to herein as “Man-type” ligands. The structural basis of MBP carbohydrate specificity has been investigated by high resolution x-ray crystallographic analysis of rat MBP-A (13Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) and MBP-C (14Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The MBP CRD structure consists of a compactly folded domain that contains a series of loops stabilized by two Ca2+. Carbohydrate binding occurs through direct coordination of one of the Ca2+, which is designated the principal Ca2+, and hydrogen bond interactions with side chains of amino acids that also serve as ligands for this Ca2+, thereby forming an intimately linked ternary complex of protein Ca2+ and sugar (Fig. 1). Similar to most lectins, MBPs display only weak affinity for monovalent sugar ligands, with dissociation constants Kd in the millimolar range (12Lee R.T. Ichikawa Y. Fay M. Drickamer K. Shao M.-C. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4810-4815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Iobst S.T. Wormald M.R. Weis W.I. Dwek R.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15505-15511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but bind avidly to target cell surfaces. This property allows discrimination between foreign cells and host cells, both of which display Man-type ligands on their surfaces. The trimeric structures of fragments of rat and human MBPs comprising the CRD plus α-helical neck regions reveal that the sugar binding sites on the trimer are spaced too far apart to bind to different branches of typical vertebrate high mannose oligosaccharides (9Sheriff S. Chang C.Y. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 10Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, they are presumably able to bind multivalently to the dense, repetitive arrays of Man-type ligands present on bacterial and fungal cell surfaces. The CRDs of MBP-A and MBP-C share 56% amino acid sequence identity, and x-ray analysis has shown that they have very similar structures (14Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The CRDs also show similar specificity for monosaccharide ligands, but differ in their affinities for oligosaccharides. MBP-C binds best to the trimannosyl core structures of N-linked carbohydrates, whereas MBP-A preferentially binds to terminal sugars of oligosaccharide chains (16Childs R.A. Feizi T. Yuen C.-T. Drickamer K. Quesenberry M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20770-20777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lee and co-workers (17Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Quesenberry M.S. Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2724-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have reported that the linear trisaccharide Manα1–2Manα1–6Man (17Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and a bivalent mannose-terminated glycopeptide (18Quesenberry M.S. Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2724-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) bind with significantly higher affinity to MBP-C than either monosaccharides or other oligosaccharides, whereas MBP-A does not show such differences. The structural basis for these differences has not been apparent from the available crystal structures of MBP complexes, which are MBP-A bound to an asparaginyl oligosaccharide (13Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) and MBP-C bound to a series of monosaccharides (14Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The major difference in the mode of sugar binding by MBP-A and MBP-C observed in these structures is that the orientation of the sugar ring is reversed in the two cases (Fig. 1). To assess whether this difference is related to the fine specificity of these two proteins, we have determined high resolution crystal structures of MBP-A and MBP-C bound to various carbohydrate ligands. The results indicate that a single residue in the binding site can influence the mode of ligand binding, which is likely to impact on the ability of the protein to interact with oligosaccharides. We also report the structure of trimeric MBP-A cross-linked by an oligosaccharide and discuss the implications of this structure for multivalent cell surface recognition and complement activation. The O-methylglycosides of mannose,N-acetylglucosamine and fucose, and also Manα1–2Man, Manα1–3Man, and Manα1–6Man were obtained from Sigma. Man6GlcNAc2Asn, Manα1–3[Manα1–6]Man, and GlcNAc-β1–2Manα1–3[GlcNAc-β1–2Manα1–6]Man were purchased from V-Labs, Inc. Manα1–2Manα1–6Man and the bivalent glycopeptideN-Ac-Tyr-Asp-(Gly-Gly-NH-(CH2)6-O-Man)2were gifts from Dr. Reiko Lee (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). A trimeric fragment of MBP-A, designated cl-MBP-A (10Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and a dimeric fragment of MBP-C (14Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were expressed, purified, and crystallized as described previously. The His189 → Val mutant of MBP-A was generated by replacing appropriate restriction fragments with synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides in the expression plasmid (10Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The sequence of the MBP-A cDNA was altered to GTG at positions 658–660. The His189 → Val/Ile207 → Val double mutant of MBP-A was created by combining restriction fragments from the two singly mutated expression plasmids. The mutant proteins were expressed and purified as for the wild-type proteins. Crystals of the wild-type and mutant MBP-A trimer and MBP-C dimer were grown at 20–22 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion. MBP-A crystals were prepared by mixing equal volumes of 12 mg ml−1 MBP-A in 10 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2 with reservoir solution consisting of 8–13% polyethylene glycol 3350 or 8000, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, and 2 mmNaN3. For data collection, crystals were adapted into 2,4-methylpentanediol (MPD) by serial transfer into synthetic mother liquor consisting of the reservoir solution and 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% MPD at 10–15-min intervals. Sugar ligands were included in last two cryopreservation solutions at the concentrations indicated in Table I. MBP-C crystals were grown by mixing equal volumes of 12–20 mg ml−1 protein in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 12 mm CaCl2 with reservoir solution containing 11–14% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mmCaCl2, and 2 mm NaN3. The crystals were adapted into MPD by serial transfer into synthetic mother liquor consisting of the reservoir solution and 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% MPD at 10-min intervals for data collection. Sugar ligands were included in the last two cryopreservation solutions at the concentrations indicated in Table II. The crystals were flash-frozen in a 100 K nitrogen gas stream for data collection.Table IData collection and refinement statistics for MBP-A trimer soaked with ligandsLigandResolution (last shell)Data collectionRefinementRsym1-aRsym = ∑h∑i(‖Ii(h)‖ − ‖〈I(h)〉‖)/∑h∑iIi(h), where Ii(h) = observed intensity and 〈I(h)〉 = mean intensity obtained from multiple measurements.% > 3σ(I)% completeAverage redundancyRfree1-bR and Rfree = ∑||Fo‖ − ‖Fc||/∑‖Fo‖, where ‖Fo‖ = observed structure factor amplitude and ‖Fc‖ = calculated structure factor amplitude for the working and test sets, respectively.R1-bR and Rfree = ∑||Fo‖ − ‖Fc||/∑‖Fo‖, where ‖Fo‖ = observed structure factor amplitude and ‖Fc‖ = calculated structure factor amplitude for the working and test sets, respectively.Bond length rmsdAngle rmsdRamachandran plot: most favored/ disallowed1-cAs defined in Procheck (26).ÅÅ°%Native (MPD)1.950.04582.195.42.80.2340.1980.0071.489.5/0.3(2.01–1.95)(0.296)(55.3)(83.9)(2.5)αMe-O-Man1.95 .03979.394.11.90.2410.2070.0071.389.5/0.0(2.01–1.95)(0.257)(49.0)(88.9)(1.8)αMe-O-GlcNAc2.000.05278.798.62.80.2490.2120.0071.389.2/0.0(2.07–2.00)(0.270)(45.8)(97.3)(2.6)αMe-O-Fuc1.900.05089.086.02.30.2240.1890.0071.390.2/0.3(1.96–1.90)(0.186)(65.9)(65.2)(1.5)βMe-O-Fuc2.000.04485.498.23.00.2290.2000.0081.490.5/0.3(2.07–2.00)(0.218)(60.5)(94.5)(2.8)Manα1–3Man2.000.04787.198.82.90.2310.1980.0091.489.7/0.3(2.07–2.00)(0.169)(59.6)(95.0)(2.4)Manα1–3Man1.900.06385.794.62.90.2520.2230.0081.490.0/0.5 (H189V mutant)(1.94–1.90)(0.307)(49.1)(83.0)(2.4)Manα1–3Man2.000.04682.993.22.50.2320.2010.0081.389.0/0.0 (H189V/I207V mutant)(2.05–2.00)(0.244)(51.2)(92.0)(2.4)The ligand concentration in the soak solution was 200 mm.

Data were measured on an RAXIS-IIc-imaging plate detector mounted on a rotating Cu anode x-ray generator operating at 4.5 kilowatts. For MBP-A, between 90 and 180° of data were measured with typical exposures of 60–75 min/1.2° image. For MBP-C, 100–120° of data were measured with exposures of 15–20 min/1–1.5° image. Data were integrated and scaled with Denzo and Scalepack (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Data collection statistics are presented in Tables I and II. In all cases, the crystals were sufficiently isomorphous to the unliganded MBP-A (10Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) or MBP-C (14Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) structures to permit direct solution by rigid body refinement. All water and other solvent molecules were removed as were the alternate side chain conformations. Ca2+ and the refined individual temperature factors were retained in the starting models. All refinement calculations were performed in crystallography NMR system (20Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Before any refinement commenced, a subset of the data was removed as the test set for the calculation of the free R-value (21Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). The oligomer structures (MBP-A trimer or MBP-C dimer) were first refined as a single rigid body, and then the individual protomers were used as rigid bodies at 4 Å resolution. The resolution was then moved to 2.8 Å where another round of rigid body refinement of the protomers was run before switching to standard positional refinement. Refinement proceeded in several rounds of increasing resolution and consisted of alternate positional and individual temperature factor refinement. An overall anisotropic temperature factor (22Sheriff S. Hendrickson W.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1987; 43: 118-121Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and bulk solvent correction (23Jiang J.-S. Brünger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) were applied throughout. For the first four structures of each protein, water molecules were independently identified inFo − Fcmaps and refined. The water molecules common to the four structures were then identified to generate a common set that could be added to subsequent structures without repicking them individually (275 for MBP-A, 192 for MBP-C). Use of these sets allowed the remaining waters and other solvent molecules to be found rapidly and the structures to be completed. Refinement statistics are presented in Tables I and II. Hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C was used to prepare crystals of the MBP-A trimer-Man6GlcNAc2Asn complex. A 5 mg ml−1 solution of cl-MBP-A in 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mmCaCl2 and 1.1 mmMan6GlcNAc2Asn was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm NaN3. The oligosaccharide was required for the growth of the crystal, and crystallization was sensitive to the precise ratio of protein to sugar. grow in two habits: hexagonal plates and hexagonal rods with missing corners. The latter form was used for structure determination. A single crystal of dimensions 0.50 × 0.35 × 0.15 mm3 was transferred directly to a containing the reservoir plus 20% MPD for <1 min and then flash-cooled in a 100 K nitrogen stream. Data were measured on an RAXIS-IIc-imaging plate detector mounted on a Cu-rotating anode operating at 4.5 kilowatts and equipped with a graphite monochromator. The crystal-to-detector distance was 250 mm, and the detector was swung 10° off axis. A He-filled diffracted beam path was mounted between the crystal and detector. The exposure times were 150 min/2° oscillation. The data were processed with Denzo and Scalepack. The postrefined unit cell is a = 61.80 Å, b = 255.56 Å, c = 61.79 Å, and β = 119.6°. The diffracted spots could be predicted and integrated on a hexagonal lattice, but the data reduction indicated that the space group is monoclinic, P21(Rsym in P21 = 4.4%,Rsym in the supergroup P63 = 52.4%). The final data set had a Rsym of 4.4% (50–2.8 Å) and 16.3% (2.93–2.80 Å) with 83.0% > 3σ(I) (60.7% last shell). Data were measured an average of 1.9 times (1.4 × last shell). The data are 94.4% complete overall (last shell 75.9%). Based on the typical protein partial specific volume of 1.21 Å3/Da, the asymmetric unit could have between 1 and 4 trimers. A self-rotation function revealed a 3-fold noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) axis oriented 18° from the b axis and 60° from the a axis, and three 2-fold NCS axes perpendicular to the 3-fold axis. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the MBP-A trimer (10Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) with Ca2+, solvent molecules, and alternate conformations removed as a search model. All molecular replacement calculations were performed using X-PLOR (24Brünger A.T. X-PLOR manual, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). A cross-rotation function calculated using data in the resolution range of 10–4 Å and a maximum Patterson integration radius of 45 Å produced six solutions of approximately the same height that were significantly higher than any other solution (a range of the six solutions 6.2–6.7 standard deviations (σ) over the mean, next solution 4.9 σ over the mean). Patterson-correlation refinement (25Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1990; 46: 46-57Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar) of the top 20 cross-rotation function peaks was carried out in two steps for each solution, first using the trimer as a rigid body and then using the three protomers as individual rigid bodies. The six most significant solutions from the cross-rotation function remained as such after this procedure. The six peaks fell into two groups of three. Within each group, the three peaks are related by the 3-fold NCS, and the two groups are related by the 2-fold NCS, implying that the asymmetric unit contains two trimers (64% solvent content). Translation searches (10–4 Å) run separately on the two trimers gave one significant peak (10.3 σ, next peak 2.9 σ over the mean). After placing one trimer, the second trimer was placed with respect to the first in a one-dimensional search along the y axis calculated for the four possible choices of origin. This procedure gave a single solution 8.9 σ (next peak 2.6 σ). The two placed trimers were initially refined as separate rigid bodies, and then as six individual protomers, first using data from 10–4 Å and then using data from 10–2.9 Å. The R-value at the end of this procedure was 0.385. The trimers are packed to give a hexagonal unit cell geometry, but because the trimer axes are tipped 18° off of the b axis, the space group is P21 rather than its supergroup P63. Refinement of the structure was performed in CNS using positional and individual temperature factor refinement. The trimers do not obey perfect NCS, and free R value tests indicated that there was no advantage in imposing NCS restraints. After the first round of refinement, most of the Man6GlcNAc2Asn could be built into the model. The final model comprises 894 amino acids, 14 sugar residues (only the terminal sugars are visible in one of the three copies; in the others, the six mannose residues are visible), and 18 Ca2+. The R and Rfreevalues are 24.4 and 28.9%, respectively. The bond and angle root-mean-square deviation from ideality were 0.007 Å and 1.3°, respectively. A total of 82.2% of the amino acids are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and 0.6% are in disallowed regions. The previously determined structure of the MBP-A CRD complexed with Man6GlcNAc2Asn (13Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) defined the binding of terminal mannose groups to the CRD through the 3- and 4-OH groups (Fig.1, left). Each of these OH groups forms a coordination bond with the principal Ca2+and two hydrogen bonds with amino acids that are also Ca2+ligands. The CRDs in these crystals are cross-linked by the oligosaccharide, precluding experiments in which other ligands are soaked into the crystal. The crystals of the homologous MBP-C CRD grow in the absence of sugar and were used to examine the structures of a series of cognate monosaccharides (14Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the orientation of monosaccharides bound to MBP-C is reversed relative to MBP-A (14Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, right). Although the monosaccharides are asymmetric structures, the two orientations can be generated by rotation around a local 2-fold symmetry axis that relates the equatorial 3- and 4-OH groups of mannose or their stereochemical equivalents. In this paper, we define the orientation observed in the MBP-A-Man6GlcNAc2Asn (i.e. with the 3-OH of mannose or its equivalent bound to Glu185 and Asn187) as orientation I (Fig. 1, left) and the reverse as orientation II in which the 4-OH occupies this position (Fig. 1, right). Unlike the MBP-A CRD bound to Man6GlcNAc2Asn, the trimeric fragment containing the neck and CRD crystallizes in the absence of sugar (10Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Therefore, the crystals of the trimeric fragment were used to visualize the binding of Man-type ligands to MBP-A. The original structure determination of this fragment employed 25% glycerol as a cryoprotectant (10Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In that structure, a molecule of glycerol was bound at the Ca2+ site through vicinal OH groups in a manner identical to that observed in sugars bound to MBPs. Therefore, high concentrations glycerol or any other compound containing vicinal OH groups cannot be used as cryoprotectants, because they would compete with sugar ligands for binding. The compound MPD, which does not have vicinal OH groups, was found to be an effective cryoprotectant. A “"
https://openalex.org/W2077047894,"p58/ERGIC-53 is an animal calcium-dependent lectin that cycles between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex and appears to act as a cargo receptor for a subset of soluble glycoproteins exported from the ER. We have determined the crystal structure of the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of p58, the rat homologue of human ERGIC-53, to 1.46 Å resolution. The fold and ligand binding site are most similar to those of leguminous lectins. The structure also resembles that of the CRD of the ER folding chaperone calnexin and the neurexins, a family of non-lectin proteins expressed on neurons. The CRD comprises one concave and one convex β-sheet packed into a β-sandwich. The ligand binding site resides in a negatively charged cleft formed by conserved residues. A large surface patch of conserved residues with a putative role in protein-protein interactions and oligomerization lies on the opposite side of the ligand binding site. Together with previous functional data, the structure defines a new and expanding class of calcium-dependent animal lectins and provides a starting point for the understanding of glycoprotein sorting between the ER and the Golgi. p58/ERGIC-53 is an animal calcium-dependent lectin that cycles between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex and appears to act as a cargo receptor for a subset of soluble glycoproteins exported from the ER.

Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). This is followed by the critical step of selection of cargo proteins to be exported from the ER to the Golgi complex via the ERGIC (ER-Golgi intermediate compartment). Export is then mediated by COPII vesicles (2Klumperman J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although many proteins may become incorporated into COPII vesicles by default (bulk-flow transport), it is now generally believed that export is an active regulated process, whereby cargo molecules are first localized to ER exit sites and then selectively incorporated into COPII vesicles by one of several mechanisms (2Klumperman J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 3Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G.

The lumenal domain can be divided into two subdomains, an N-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (residues 31–285) and a membrane-proximal α-helical coiled domain (residues 290–460) (10Lahtinen U. Svensson K. Pettersson R.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail contains a KKFF sequence at its extreme C terminus that is essential for both ER exit and Golgi retrieval (11Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R.Ch. Foguet M. Paccaud J.-P. Hauri H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31802-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (226) Google Scholar), meaning that p58/ERGIC-53/MR60 cycles between the ER and Golgi compartment (12Klumperman J. Schweizer A. Clausen H. Tang B.L. Hong W. Oorschot V. Hauri H.-P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3411-3425PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of MR60 as a mannose-binding protein (8Arar C.

Roche A.-C. Monsigny M. Hauri H.-P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), support the suggestion that p58/ERGIC-53 serves as a mammalian intracellular lectin (14Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1994; 77: 625-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This proposition was also based on the similarity between ERGIC-53 and VIP-36, a membrane protein isolated from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (15Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Etzold T. Simons K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), shown to bind mannose, and localized in the early secretory pathway (16Fullerkrug J. Scheiffele P. Simons K. J.

It was proposed that p58/ERGIC-53 and VIP-36 constituted a new class of animal lectins (14Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1994; 77: 625-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Blocking the export of ERGIC-53 from the ER impaired but did not block export of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin C and cathepsin Z-related protein (18Vollenweider F. Kappeler F. Itin C. Hauri H.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ERGIC-53 could be cross-linked to a cathepsin Z-related protein. The glycan structure binding to ERGIC-53 in the ER was suggested to be a nine-mannose form (Man9),i.e. the asparagine-linked core glycan from which three terminal glucose residues have been trimmed (19Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.-P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Efficient secretion of coagulation factors V and VIII requires a functional ERGIC-53 (20Moussalli M. Pipe S.W. Hauri H.-P. Nichols W.C. Ginsburg D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32539-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and mutations in the gene coding for ERGIC-53 cause a rare hereditary bleeding disorder, a combined deficiency of factors V and VIII (21Nichols W.C. Seligsohn U. Zivelin A. Terry V.H. Hertel C.E. Weatley M.A. Moussalli M. Hauri H.P. Ciavarella N. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Cell. 1998; 93: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that p58/ERGIC-53/MR60 functions as a lectin-like receptor involved in facilitating export from the ER of a subset of secretory glycoproteins (22Hauri H.-P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step toward a better understanding of how glycans on cargo molecules interact with the lectin receptor, we have determined the crystal structure of the CRD of p58. The structure reveals a link between leguminous and animal lectins and defines a new class of animal calcium-dependent lectins that function in the secretory pathway. The CRD of rat p58/ERGIC-53 (residues 31–285) was defined by a combination of sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction, and limited proteolysis. The CRD (including the N-terminal signal sequence comprising residues 1–30 and a 6xHis tag) was produced in insect cells using a baculovirus vector and purified as described elsewhere (23Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Lahtinen U. Schneider G. Pettersson R.F. Linqvist Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 536-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The region encompassing residues 286–478, which is not present in the construct whose structure is described here, is the oligomerization domain of p58/ERGIC-53 and is required for dimerization and formation of hexamers (10Lahtinen U. Svensson K. Pettersson R.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, the CRD is monomeric in solution as assayed by native gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion from hanging drops containing equal volumes of a 10 mg/ml protein solution in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmCaCl2, and well solution. The drops were equilibrated against 1 ml of well solution that consisted of 100 mmNa-HEPES, pH 7.25, 1.6 m Li2SO4, and 10 mm EDTA, as described previously (23Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Lahtinen U. Schneider G. Pettersson R.F. Linqvist Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 536-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group I222, with cell dimensionsa = 49.6 Å, b = 86.1 Å, andc = 128.1 Å, and they have one monomer in the asymmetric unit (23Velloso L.M. Svensson K. Lahtinen U. Schneider G. Pettersson R.F. Linqvist Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 536-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). X-ray data used for the structure determination were collected on a MAR 300mm Image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku R200 x-ray generator, operating at 50 kV and 90 mA at 110 K. Crystals were transferred to a solution containing 1.2m Li2SO4, 0.1 mNa-HEPES, pH 7.25, and 20% PEG400, allowed to equilibrate for a few seconds, and frozen in a stream of nitrogen. The high-resolution data set used for refinement was collected at beamline 711 at the MAX Laboratory (Lund, Sweden) synchrotron radiation source. The crystal was transferred to mother liquor containing 20% ethylene glycol before freezing. All data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (24Otwinowski Z. Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1993: 56-62Google Scholar). The structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement based on five heavy metal derivatives (Table I). Location of metal binding sites and phase calculations were performed using SOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) with a native data set collected at the home source as a reference. The initial electron density map calculated at 2.7 Å was of sufficient quality to allow automated model building of most residues in the structure and phase extension to 1.46 Å using wARP (26Perakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). This procedure was followed by multiple cycles of refinement in crystallography NMR software (CNS) (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Found. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The final cycles of refinement were performed using Refmac5 (29Murshudov G.N. Lebedev A. Vagin A.A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) because it led to faster convergence and lower R factor and Rfreevalues.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of the CRD of p58 was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement (TableI). The initial electron density map was of sufficient quality to allow tracing of most residues in the structure. The model was subsequently refined to Rwork/Rfree values of 19.1 and 21.1%, respectively. All data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The final model contains residues 50–277 of p58, 197 water molecules and 2 sulfate ions. The region corresponding to residues 1–30 constitutes the signal sequence, which is cleaved upon secretion of the protein into the medium and is therefore not present in the mature form of the protein. Residues 31–49 and the 6xHis tag inserted between residues 34 and 35 (23) are not visible in the electron density maps. There is also no density for the final 8 residues of the construct and for residues 165–169 of the p58 sequence, which presumably are part of a flexible loop. The CRD domain of p58 has an overall globular shape and is composed of 15 β-strands, a small α helix, and one turn of 310 helix (Fig. 1). Two major twisted antiparallel β-sheets, one seven-stranded (major) β-sheet, and one six-stranded (minor) β sheet pack against each other, forming a β-sandwich, in a variation of the jelly roll fold. The N terminus starts with two short β-strands (β1a and β1b) separated by a turn of 310 helix. This structural motif is replaced by a single and longer strand in other lectin structures; therefore, we refer to it as β1 in p58. This is the first strand of the minor β-sheet. It is followed by a long loop and the first strand (β2) of the major β-sheet. A β-hairpin (strands β3 and β4) is inserted between β2 and the second strand of the major β-sheet (β5). From here, the chain makes an excursion into the opposite (minor) β-sheet, contributing one strand (β6) before returning to the major β-sheet and forming four antiparallel strands (β7−β10). A loop followed by an α helix of two turns is inserted between β9 and β10. The chain then crosses over to the minor β-sheet, contributing three antiparallel strands (β11−β13). The last pair of strands is split between the two sheets, with β14 in the major β-sheet and β15 in the minor β-sheet. The N and C termini of the polypeptide chain are close to each other in space. The two β-sheets are curved, giving rise to a concave surface of the molecule on the side of the major β-sheet and a convex surface on the side of the minor β-sheet. A cleft is formed by a 15-residue-long loop between strands β7 and β8 of the major β-sheet, by the α helix and the loop preceding it. Residues Cys198 (strand β-10, major β-sheet) and Cys238 (strand β13, minor β-sheet) form a disulfide bond. Two peptide bonds are observed in cis-conformation: one between residues Ala128 and Asp129 at the entrance of strand 9, and the other between Gly62 and Pro63at the beginning of the loop joining strands β1b and β2. Based on their weak homology to plant lectins, it has been proposed (14Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1994; 77: 625-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) that ERGIC-53 and VIP-36 define a new class of animal lectins in the secretory pathway. It is thought that these proteins function as sorting receptors for glycoproteins exiting the ER (22Hauri H.-P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Orthologues of this gene have been found in several organisms. Moreover, two other genes named ERGIC-53-like (ERGL) and GP36b have recently been identified as displaying significant homology to p58/ERGIC-53 (30Yerushalmi N. Keppler-Hafkemeyer A. Vasmatzis G. Liu X.F. Olsson P. Bera T.K. Duray P. Lee B. Pastan I. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), 2E. Hartmann, B. Reimann, D. Goerlich, T. A. Rapoport, and S. Prehn, unpublished results, GenBankTMaccession number U10362.suggesting that their products might also act as cargo receptors for glycoproteins. The fold observed here is most likely conserved in all ERGIC-53-like proteins recognized thus far because they share significant sequence identity (25–35%) and align very well in the region spanning the CRD (Fig. 2). Comparisons of the structure described here against the PDB data base using the DALI server (32Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar) and the program TOP (33Lu G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 176-183Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) revealed that the CRD of p58 is structurally most similar to the leguminous lectins (TableII). Most leguminous lectins have a core structure composed of a β-sandwich with a concave face comprising seven β-strands and a convex face comprising six β-strands (Table II). Despite the fact that the sequence identities between p58/ERGIC-53 and leguminous lectins are generally <20%, the core of these structures shares the same basic architecture, and the secondary structure elements of p58 superimpose quite well with those of the leguminous lectins. The sugar binding sites in these lectins are all located on the concave β-sheet, with most of the residues that participate in ligand binding coming from the loops between strands at the top of the sheet.Table IIStructural homologues to p582-aThe structures were compared to that of p58 using the TOP program; the default parameters were used.ProteinCα2-bNumber of Cα atoms superimposed between the two structures.Rmsd2-cRmsd, root mean square deviation of superimposed Cα atoms.Identity2-dThe sequence identity is given between the number of Cα atoms superimposed.Concave β-sheetConvex β-sheetPDB code (ref. no.)Å%Pea lectin1461.3218.5761RIN(37Bourne Y.

Open table in a new tab Similarity is also found between p58 and other animal proteins, including lectins such as calnexin and galectin-3, as well as the ligand-binding domain of neurexin 1β (Table II). Calnexin is also a calcium-dependent lectin that resides in the ER and is involved in quality control mechanisms (34Schrag J.D. Li J.J.M. Bergeron Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). When compared, p58 and calnexin have a CRD where the β-sheets have similar arrangements and show helical insertions in the same region. Despite the low sequence identity between the two proteins (Table II), 2 aspartate residues, which coordinate Ca2+ in the leguminous lectin structures, are conserved and occupy similar positions in both animal lectin structures. Galectin-3 belongs to a family of calcium-independent animal lectins that are predominantly cytoplasmic (35Seetharaman J. Kanigsberg A. Slaaby R. Leffler H. Barondes S. Rini J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13047-13052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Compared with p58, the β-sheets and loops of galectin-3 are smaller, despite their similar arrangement. Neurexin 1β belongs to a family of proteins expressed in hundreds of isoforms in neuronal tissues and thought to function as cell recognition molecules. Although ligands for these molecules have still not been identified, it has been proposed that they use the same binding fold and surface as the leguminous lectins to interact with cell surface molecules (36Rudenko G. Nguyen T. Chelliah Y. Sudhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. Cell. 1999; 99: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, p58 and neurexin 1β superimpose poorly in the region of the putative ligand binding site, and there is no similarity between residues thought to be involved in ligand binding in p58/ERGIC-53 and the corresponding residues of neurexin 1β. Alignment of p58/ERGIC-53 and related sequences from different organisms within the animal kingdom reveals a high degree of sequence identity (Fig. 2). The sequence conservation is well distributed throughout the polypeptide chain. Highly conserved residues include: (i) tryptophans (Trp51, Trp78, Trp110, and Trp128) forming a hydrophobic ladder that runs through the hydrophobic core of the protein, (ii) glycines in loops between the β-strands, (iii) the two disulfide-bonded cysteines, and (iv) the proline observed incis-conformation in p58/ERGIC-53 and conserved in all sequences of this domain family. It is therefore likely that the overall structure observed here is conserved in other p58/ERGIC-53-like domains. Two patches of conserved residues on opposite sides of the molecule are evident, indicating that conserved residues are not confined to the hydrophobic core of the protein (Fig.3).Figure 3Surface features of p58.

Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.-P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Rather, it is thought that p58/ERGIC-53 recognizes Man9 on glycoproteins (6Pimpaneau V. Midoux P. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 213: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Hauri H.-P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have implicated 2 residues, Asp129 and Asn164, to be required for binding of ERGIC-53 to mannose-substituted resins (13Itin C. Roche A.-C. Monsigny M. Hauri H.-P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Due to the presence of EDTA in the crystallization conditions, no Ca2+ ions are observed in the putative ligand binding site of the p58 structure when compared with those of leguminous lectins. However, similarities are observed between these binding site structures (Fig.4): residues Asp129 and Asp160 in p58 are in positions similar to those of the equivalent Asp81 and Asp121 from theLathyrus ochrus and pea lectin structures in complex with mannose (PDB codes 1RIN and 1LOB, respectively; hereafter, we refer to these two proteins by their PDB codes) (37Bourne Y.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10126-10132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both these residues coordinate the Ca2+ ion, and Asp81 also binds mannose in these complexes. The peptide bond between residues Ala128 and Asp129 is in thecis-conformation in p58, as in the leguminous lectins. This is essential for the correct geometry of the Ca2+ binding site and for sugar binding in these lectins (37Bourne Y. Roussel A. Frey M. Rouge P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. Proteins. 1990; 8: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Major differences observed between the binding sites from p58, 1LOB, and 1RIN include: (i) a different conformation of Asn170 in p58 as compared with the equivalent Asp129 in 1RIN and1LOB, due mostly to a disordered region between residues 165 and 169 of p58 (Fig. 1), (ii) positioning of the side chain of Asn164∼12.0 Å away from the equivalent Asn125 in 1RIN and 1LOB(Fig. 4), and (iii) substitution of residues Glu119 and His136, which are involved in Mn2+ coordination in leguminous lectins, by Phe158 and Ala172 in p58, which probably renders it unable to bind Mn2+ ions. Of the other residues of 1LOB and 1RIN that interact with mannose, Ala210 and Glu211 superimpose well on the equivalent residues Gly259 and Gly260 from p58, whereas the third residue is part of a loop and is located around 6 Å from its counterpart in 1LOB and 1RIN. Recent data indicate that ERGIC-53 acts as a cargo receptor for a subset of glycoproteins through recognition of mannose residues in their sugar moieties (19Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.-P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22Hauri H.-P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because this is a selective process, and all glycoproteins have identical sugar structures while still in the ER, specific recognition of a small subset of glycoproteins is most likely also dependent in part on characteristics intrinsic to the recognized proteins other than their sugar structure. Electrostatic surface charge calculations show a marked charge polarity on the surface of p58. A deep, negatively charged pocket is situated adjacent to the residues that are thought to be involved in calcium coordination and mannose binding (Fig. 3A). The presence of a Ca2+ ion would reduce the negative charge in this pocket, but electrostatic calculations suggest that it would still have a predominantly negative character (data not shown). The sequence conservation in the vicinity as well as inside of the negatively charged pocket is quite strong (Fig. 3B), suggesting that this region and its intrinsic electrostatic character are important for protein-protein interactions. On the side of p58 opposite to the ligand binding site, there is a surface patch made up of residues conserved only in p58/ERGIC-53 orthologues (Fig. 3D). It maps to the convex β-sheet in p58 and has well-balanced charge distribution (Fig. 3C). Due to its conservation only in p58/ERGIC-53 orthologues, it may be involved in protein-protein interactions that are unique to p58/ERGIC-53, such as receptor-cargo binding or contacting neighboring molecules in the formation of oligomers. Cargo proteins might use two different and opposing faces of the p58 β-sandwich for complex formation. Whereas the carbohydrate moiety interacts with the negatively charged pocket on one side of p58/ERGIC-53, another region, conferring specificity for the cargo protein, could bind to the conserved surface patch on the other side of p58/ERGIC-53. This would be reminiscent of the interactions between calnexin and its substrates using both its arm and lectin domains (34Schrag J.D. Li J.J.M. Bergeron Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). p58/ERGIC-53 oligomerizes into dimers and hexamers in contrast to other members of this family, which are monomeric. Therefore, involvement of this surface patch in oligomerization would also explain its conservation only in p58/ERGIC-53 orthologues. In summary, we have demonstrated that the CRD of p58/ERGIC-53 is an example of the utilization of the plant lectin fold within the quality control system in the ER. The fold of the structure reported here is a versatile scaffold for carbohydrate-mediated ligand-receptor interactions. The structural conservation between the CRD domain of p58 and calnexin highlights the importance of quality control mechanisms for the proper maturation of proteins in the ER. It is therefore likely that this domain was present in evolution before the separation of the plant and animal kingdoms. The structure presented here, together with functional data on p58/ERGIC-53, suggests that the leguminous lectin fold is also used for Ca2+-dependent recognition of carbohydrate structures in animals, reinforcing the proposition that these proteins constitute a new class of animal calcium-dependent lectins.

Diffusivity enhances the conductivity of olivine anisotropically, making the a axis the most conductive of the three axes. Therefore, the hypothesis that plate motion induces lattice-preferred orientation of olivine can be tested with the use of long-period electromagnetic array measurements. Here, we compared electrical anisotropies below the slow-moving Fennoscandian and fast-moving Australian plates. The degree of olivine alignment is greater in the mantle below the Fennoscandian plate than below the Australian plate. This finding may indicate that convection rather than plate motion is the dominant deformation mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2129790600,"The VirB protein is a key regulator of virulence gene expression in the facultative enteroinvasive pathogen Shigella flexneri. While genetic evidence has shown that it is required for activation of transcription of virulence genes located on a 230-kb plasmid in this bacterium, hitherto, evidence that VirB is a DNA-binding protein has been lacking. Although VirB shows extensive homology to proteins involved in plasmid partitioning, it does not resemble any known conventional transcription factor. Here we show for the first time that VirB binds to the promoter regions of the virulence genes in vivo. We also show that VirB forms dimeric and higher oligomeric structures both in vivo and in vitro and that this property is independent of DNA binding. The oligomerization activity of VirB is distributed over two domains: a leucine zipper-like motif and a carboxyl-terminal domain likely to form triple coiled structures. VirB possesses a helix-turn-helix motif, which is required for DNA binding. The amino-terminal domain of the protein is also required for DNA binding and virulence gene activation. The possibility that VirB requires a co-factor for specific interaction with target promoters in vivo is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2059059155,"In this study, the role of interdomain interactions involving the C1 and C2 domains in the mechanism of activation of PKC was investigated. Using an in vitro assay containing only purified recombinant proteins and the phorbol ester, 4β-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), but lacking lipids, it was found that PKCα bound specifically, and with high affinity, to a αC1A-C1B fusion protein of the same isozyme. The αC1A-C1B domain also potently activated the isozyme in a phorbol ester- and diacylglycerol-dependent manner. The level of this activity was comparable with that resulting from membrane association induced under maximally activating conditions. Furthermore, it was found that αC1A-C1B bound to a peptide containing the C2 domain of PKCα. The αC1A-C1B domain also activated conventional PKCβI, -βII, and -γ isoforms, but not novel PKCδ or -ɛ. PKCδ and -ɛ were each activated by their own C1 domains, whereas PKCα, -βI, -βII, or -γ activities were unaffected by the C1 domain of PKCδ and only slightly activated by that of PKCɛ. PKCζ activity was unaffected by its own C1 domain and those of the other PKC isozymes. Based on these findings, it is proposed that the activating conformational change in PKCα results from the dissociation ofintra-molecular interactions between the αC1A-C1B domain and the C2 domain. Furthermore, it is shown that PKCα forms dimers via inter-molecular interactions between the C1 and C2 domains of two neighboring molecules.

Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In common with many signaling proteins, the structure of PKC is modular, consisting of a C-terminal catalytic region containing the active site, and a regulatory region with conserved domains that mediate membrane association and activation. PKC isozymes are classified according to the structural and functional differences in these conserved domains (8Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 48: 28495-28498Google Scholar, 9Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). In the case of the “conventional” PKCα, -βI/βII, and -γ isozymes, these include the activator-binding C1 domains, and the Ca2+-binding C2 domain. The C1 domains consist of a tandem C1A and C1B arrangement, each of which can potentially bind the endogenous activator, diacylglycerol and exogenous activators including phorbol esters. The “novel” PKCδ, -ɛ, -η, -θ, and -μ isozymes, contain C2 domains that lack Ca2+ binding ability, while retaining functional C1A and C1B domains. The “atypical” PKCζ, -ι, and -λ regulatory domains also lack a functional C2 domain and contain a single C1 domain that lacks the ability to bind activators, the function of which remains obscure. Each isozyme becomes catalytically competent by undergoing multiple serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylations that are either autocatalytic, or catalyzed by “PKC kinases” such as the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase, PDK1 (7Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Parekh D.B. Ziegler W.

The mechanism by which the conventional PKC isozymes become membrane associated, and thus activated, involves two sequential steps. The first involves an initial Ca2+- and anionic phospholipid-dependent interaction of the C2 domain with the membrane, which is then followed by binding of diacylglycerol or phorbol esters to the C1 domains (12Newton A.C.

Mutagenesis studies have identified a number of critical hydrophobic residues within the C1 domains of PKCδ and PKCα that appear to have distinct roles in ligand binding and membrane association (16Medkova M.

Based on the x-ray crystallographic structure of the C1B domain of PKCδ, it has been suggested that activator binding to the C1 domain facilitates membrane-insertion by “capping” a hydrophilic groove to form a contiguous hydrophobic surface that can interact with the membrane interior (19Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). However, it would appear from our studies that the interaction of the phorbol ester induces a conformational change in the C1 domain, the extent of which is reflected in the activity of the enzyme, implying a more active role for phorbol ester-C1 domain interactions beyond that of presenting a hydrophobic surface to the interior of the membrane (20Ho C.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10334-10341Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The interaction of diacylglycerol with the C1 domains also results in an increased stereo- and regiospecificity of both membrane association and activation for PS (13Johnson J.E. Giorgione J.

Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 11: 11Google Scholar). The combined interactions of the C1 and C2 domains with the membrane provides the free energy required for structural rearrangements that lead to the dissociation of the N-terminal pseudosubstrate from the active site to allow substrate binding (25House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 26Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol.

This process is thought to be further facilitated by a weak interaction of the released pseudosubstrate with anionic head groups at the membrane surface (28Mosior M. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 149-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence supporting the notion that the existence of two C1 domains affords a complex modulatory role in the regulation of PKC activity. Phorbol esters have been shown to interact with both of the C1A and C1B domains, with distinct low and high affinities (29Slater S.J. Kelly M.B. Ho J.D. Larkin C. Mazurek A. Taddeo F.J.

Furthermore, we have shown that diacylglycerol inhibits the low affinity phorbol ester interaction while enhancing high affinity phorbol ester binding, indicating that the diacylglycerol has a higher affinity for the low affinity phorbol ester-binding site than does phorbol ester itself (30Slater S.J.

Additional support for the non-equivalence of the interaction of diacylglycerol, phorbol esters, and also other activators with the two C1 domains has been provided by other studies that have observed non-equivalent roles of the domains with respect to membrane association and activation (34Shieh H.L.

Studies from this laboratory showed that the increased level of phorbol ester binding that results from interaction of diacylglycerol with the low affinity phorbol ester-binding site on conventional PKC isozymes corresponded to an elevated level of enzyme activity that was greater than that induced by either phorbol ester or diacylglycerol alone (30Slater S.J.

The above, and recent data suggesting that the C1A of PKCα is the diacylglycerol-binding site, while the C1B domain binds phorbol ester (16Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 11: 11Google Scholar), are compatible with the C1A and C1B domains containing the low and high affinity phorbol ester-binding sites, respectively. Inter-domain interactions are important in PKC regulation, although detailed features of these interactions remain obscure. The conformational change that leads to the displacement of the pseudosubstrate of membrane-associated PKC isozymes involves pronounced rearrangements of the individual domains that constitute the enzyme molecule. In a recent study, it was shown that the rate of translocation of GFP-tagged PKCγ in RBL cells was markedly slower when compared with that of a truncation mutant lacking the N-terminal V1 region (14Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Based on this, it was suggested that membrane association and activation resulting from binding of diacylglycerol to the C1 domains of this isozyme first requires the release of a “V1 clamp,” which holds the C1 domain between the catalytic and V1 region, due to an interaction of the pseudosubstrate with the active site. In another study, the mutation of a single aspartate (Asp55) residue in the C1A domain of PKCα was shown to result in a marked reduction in both the PS and Ca2+ concentration requirements for membrane association and activation, implicating a tethering of the C1A domain to a neighboring region within the PKCα molecule (15Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 24Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 11: 11Google Scholar). It was suggested that such an interaction might retain the isozyme in an inactive conformation by preventing the penetration of the C1A domain into the membrane and thus its interaction with diacylglycerol (24Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 11: 11Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to determine the role of interdomain interactions in the mechanism of activation of PKCα. Using in vitro activity and binding assays, it was found that PKCα engaged in a phorbol ester-dependent, high affinity and specific interaction with a fusion protein that contained its own C1A and C1B domains (αC1A-C1B). The level of activity induced by interaction with the αC1A-C1B domain was found to be comparable with that resulting from membrane association induced under maximally activating conditions. Also, the αC1A-C1B domain interacted with a fusion protein containing the C2 domain of PKCα. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for the existence of an interdomain interaction between the C1 and C2 domains, the dissociation of which is a rate-determining step in the mechanism of activation of PKCα.

To provide structural stability, solubility, and to aid purification, fusions peptides were tagged with glutathione S-transferase (GST) at the N terminus and with (His)6 at the C terminus. An expression vector containing the GST-tagged C1A and C1B domains of PKCδ (δC1A-C1B) was a kind gift from Dr. Peter M. Blumberg.

PKC isozyme activities were assayed by measuring the rate of phosphate incorporation into a peptide substrate as previously described (30Slater S.J. Kelly M.B. Taddeo F.J. Rubin E. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the “conventional” PKC isoforms and the their catalytic subunits, a peptide corresponding to the phosphorylation site domain of myelin basic protein (QKRPSQRSKYL, MBP4–14) was used as the substrate, whereas assays of novel PKC and atypical PKCζ activity used a peptide corresponding to the pseudosubstrate region of novel PKCɛ (ɛ-peptide), in which the single alanine residue was replaced by serine (25House C.

Briefly, the assay (75 μl) consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.40), 0.1 mm EGTA or CaCl2, 50 μm MBP4–14, or 50 μm ɛ-peptide, TPA (500 nm or as indicated) or varying levels of DiC8, and fusion proteins containing the appropriate PKC domains present at a fixed concentration of 10 nm unless otherwise indicated. Where added, POPC and BPS were present at a total concentration of 150 μm as large unilamellar vesicles, prepared as described previously (43MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). After thermal equilibration to 30 °C, assays were initiated by the simultaneous addition of the required PKC isoform (0.3 nm) along with 5 mm Mg2+, 15 μm ATP, 0.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and terminated after 30 min with 100 μl of 175 mm phosphoric acid. Following this, 100 μl was transferred to P81 filter papers, which were washed three times in 75 mm phosphoric acid. Phosphorylated peptide was determined by scintillation counting. Binding of C1 domain peptides to PKC isozymes was determined using SPR from measurements of the accompanying increase in refractive index as a function of time using a BiacoreTM2000 (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). All measurements were performed at 25 °C. Initially, the αC1A-C1B or ɛC1A-C1B domains were captured through the respective (His)6 tag to the nickel/NTA surface of an NTA sensor chip, prepared according to the manufacturers instructions (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ), to a level of 75 response units. Solutions containing either PKCα isozymes or fusion peptides at the required concentrations, in the presence or absence of 500 nm TPA were then injected over this surface and the response was measured as a function of time. The surface was regenerated after each injection by two 10-s injections of 100 mm NaOH, followed by a single 10-s injection of 10 mm HCl. After subtraction of the contribution of bulk refractive index changes and nonspecific interactions of PKC isozymes with the nickel-NTA surface, which were typically less than 1% of the total signal, the individual association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants were obtained by global fitting of data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluationTM (Biacore, Inc.). These values were then used to calculate the dissociation constant (KD). The values of average squared residual (χ2) obtained were not found to be significantly improved by fitting data to models that assumed bivalent or heterogeneous interactions between PKC isozymes and C1 domain peptides. In a separate control experiment (results not shown), it was found that the contribution of mass transport to the observed values of KD was negligible, based on the observation that these values were independent of flow rate within a range encompassing that used (10 to 50 μl min−1). To investigate the role of domain-domain intramolecular interactions in the mechanism of activation of PKC, the assumption was made that if such interactions occur within the isozyme molecule, and are involved in the activating conformational change, then peptides corresponding to the isolated domains might compete for these interactions and modulate the activity of the isozyme. To address this, various fusion proteins containing regions of the regulatory domain spanning the C1A and C1B domains were prepared, as shown in Fig.1. Binding of these domains to PKC, and the effects on PKC isozyme activities, were determined using assay systems that contained only purified proteins along with the required peptide substrates, cofactors, and activators. By excluding membranes from the assay systems, effects could be unambiguously ascribed to direct protein-protein interactions between these domains and PKC. Based on measurements of SPR, it was found that, in the presence of TPA, PKCα bound to an immobilized fusion peptide containing the isolated αC1A-C1B domain in a reversible, concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The interaction was phorbol ester-dependent since it was found that the level of binding in the absence of TPA was negligible. The value of KD, calculated from the ratio of the association and dissociation rate constants, indicated a high affinity interaction (Table I). Furthermore, the value of the maximal level of PKCα binding at equilibrium (Rmax) is consistent with a PKCα-αC1A-C1B binding stoichiometry of 1:1, assuming maximal occupancy of ligand-binding sites. PKCα was also found to interact with the ɛC1A-C1B domain (Fig. 2B), although with a markedly reduced affinity, as shown by the ∼500-fold increase in the value ofKD (Table I).Table IKinetic analysis of the interaction of intact PKCα or the αC1A-C1B-C2 peptide with the αC1A-C1B or the ɛC1A-C1B domains using SPRInteractionkakdKDχ2m−1s−1s−1mPKCα → αC1A-C1B(9.15 ± 0.60) × 105(4.74 ± 0.18) × 10−3(5.18 ± 0.54) × 10−91.91PKCα → ɛC1A-C1B(3.06 ± 0.28) × 103(8.23 ± 0.16) × 10−3(2.69 ± 0.29) × 10−62.41αC1A-C1B-C2 → αC1A-C1B(4.30 ± 0.11) × 105(5.31 ± 0.08) × 10−3(12.4 ± 1.2) × 10−90.69αC1A-C1B-C2 → ɛC1A-C1B(2.87 ± 0.80) × 103(1.28 ± 0.02) × 10−2(4.40 ± 1.20) × 10−61.10The αC1A-C1B and ɛC1A-C1B domains were initially immobilized on the surface of a nickel/NTA sensor chip and PKCα, or the αC1A-C1B-C2 peptide, were then injected over these surfaces in the presence of 500 nm TPA. The dissociation constants (KD) were obtained from the ratio of the association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants, derived from global fits of response against time data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model.

It has been suggested in a previous study that the C1A of PKCα may interact with residues within the C2 domain, and thereby impede the activating conformational change (24Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 11: 11Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the results shown in Fig. 2C indicate that in the presence of TPA, the αC1A-C1B domain binds to a fusion protein containing the C2 domain of PKCα (αC1A-C1B-C2). Similar to the interaction of PKCα with the αC1A-C1B, the binding of the αC1A-C1B-C2 peptide to the αC1A-C1B domain was found to be TPA-dependent. Note that in this experiment the αC1A-C1B domain was initially bound to the sensor chip surface through the (His)6 tag to a level corresponding to saturation. Under these conditions, any interactions of the αC1A-C1B with itself were also saturated,"
https://openalex.org/W1996284427,"We have previously identified compstatin, a 13-residue cyclic peptide, that inhibits complement activation by binding to C3 and preventing C3 cleavage to C3a and C3b. The structure of compstatin consists of a disulfide bridge and a type I β-turn located at opposite sides to each other. The disulfide bridge is part of a hydrophobic cluster, and the β-turn is part of a polar surface. We present the design of compstatin analogs in which we have introduced a series of perturbations in key structural elements of their parent peptide, compstatin. We have examined the consistency of the structures of the designed analogs compared with compstatin using NMR, and we have used the resulting structural information to make structure-complement inhibitory activity correlations. We propose the following. 1) Even in the absence of the disulfide bridge, a linear analog has a propensity for structure formation consistent with a turn of a 310-helix or a β-turn. 2) The type I β-turn is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for activity. 3) Our substitutions outside the type I β-turn of compstatin have altered the turn population but not the turn structure. 4) Flexibility of the β-turn is essential for activity. 5) The type I β-turn introduces reversibility and sufficiently separates the two sides of the peptide, whereas the disulfide bridge prevents the termini from drifting apart, thus aiding in the formation of the hydrophobic cluster. 6) The hydrophobic cluster at the linked termini is involved in binding to C3 and activity but alone is not sufficient for activity. 7) β-Turn residues Gln5(Asn5)-Asp6-Trp7(Phe7)-Gly8are specific for the turn formation, but only Gln5(Asn5)-Asp6-Trp7-Gly8residues are specific for activity. 8) Trp7 is likely to be involved in direct interaction with C3, possibly through the formation of a hydrogen bond.

Finally we propose a binding model for the C3-compstatin complex. Compstatin, a 13-residue cyclic peptide, is a novel complement inhibitor with the potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent (1.Sahu A. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. Lambris J.D. Holers V.M. Therapeutic Interventions in the Complement System. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 75-112Google Scholar). Compstatin binds to C3, which is a central complement component, through which all three pathways of complement activation, the classical, alternative, and lectin, converge (2.Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Although complement is part of the innate immune system while acting as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems, and its activation is an important line of defense against invading foreign pathogens (3.Lambris J.D. Reid K.B. Volanakis J.E. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 207-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4.Walport M.J. N. Engl. J.

Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar), its inappropriate activation can result in host cell damage (6.Lambris J.D. Holers V.M. Therapeutic Interventions in the Complement System. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000Crossref Google Scholar). This is the case in more than 25 pathological conditions, including a number of autoimmune diseases, burn injuries, ischemia reperfusion injuries, stroke, dialysis, and cardiopulmonary bypass (see Ref. 7.Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar for a complete list and references). The following have been shown. (a) Compstatin inhibits complement activation in vitro in human serum (8.Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 884-891PubMed Google Scholar). (b) Compstatin totally inhibits in vivo heparin/protamine-induced complement activation in primates without side effects, in a situation that is typical in cardiac surgery (9.Soulika A.M. Khan M.M. Hattori T. Bowen F.W. Richardson B.A. Hack C.E. Sahu A. Edmunds Jr., L.H. Lambris J.D. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 96: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). (c) Compstatin inhibits complement activation without toxicity in whole blood, in models of extracorporeal circuits, which resemble those used in cardiopulmonary bypass, dialysis, and plasmapheresis (10.Nilsson B. Larsson R. Hong J. Elgue G. Ekdahl K.N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Blood. 1998; 92: 1661-1667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (d) Compstatin prolongs the lifetime of porcine-to-human ex vivo perfused kidney xenograft model with human blood (11.Fiane A.E. Mollnes T.E. Videm V. Hovig T. Hogasen K. Mellbye O.J. Spruce L. Moore W.T. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Xenotransplantation. 1999; 6: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). (e) Finally, compstatin does not appear to have significant cytotoxicity as it showed little or no inhibition of clotting (12.Furlong S.T. Dutta A.S. Coath M.M. Gormley J.J. Hubbs S.J. Lloyd D. Mauger R.C. Strimpler A.M. Sylvester M.A. Scott C.W. Edwards P.D. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 48: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Compstatin was first identified as a 27-residue peptide using combinatorial phage-displayed random peptide library and was subsequently truncated, without loss of activity, to a 13-residue peptide (8.Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 884-891PubMed Google Scholar). An attempt to further truncate the 13-residue peptide yielded inactive fragments (13.Sahu A. Soulika A.M. Morikis D. Spruce L. Moore W.T. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The sequence of compstatin is Ile1-Cys2-Val3-Val4-Gln5-Asp6-Trp7-Gly8-His9-His10-Arg11-Cys12-Thr13-NH2, where Cys2 and Cys12 are disulfide-bonded. Reduction and alkylation of the two cysteines result in loss of inhibitory activity (8.Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 884-891PubMed Google Scholar). We have determined previously the three-dimensional structure of compstatin in solution using NMR and a restrained hybrid distance geometry/simulated annealing methodology (14.Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and an alternative refinement methodology using global optimization (15.Klepeis J.L. Floudas C.A. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. J. Comp. Chem. 1999; 20: 1354-1370Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Compstatin forms a type I β-turn spanning residues Gln5-Asp6-Trp7-Gly8. Measurements of inhibitory activities of compstatin analogs designed using an alanine scan in the sequence between residues Cys2and Cys12 have shown that Val3 and the four residues of the β-turn are essential for retaining activity (14.Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Alanine replacement for each one of the remaining residues resulted in reduced but not lost inhibitory activity (14.Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, A and C, shows the hydrophobic character of the structure of compstatin. We observe a hydrophobic clustering forming a patch at the linked termini involving residues Ile1, Cys2, Val3, Val4, Cys12, Thr13, whereas the ring of Trp7 caps the β-turn with orientation toward the hydrophobic clustering. We have hypothesized that this hydrophobic clustering may be essential for structural stability and inhibitory activity of compstatin (1.Sahu A. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. Lambris J.D. Holers V.M. Therapeutic Interventions in the Complement System. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 75-112Google Scholar, 14.Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows the electrostatic character of compstatin. Positive charges from His9, His10 (each about 50% protonated at the experimental pH), and Arg11 and a negative charge from Asp6 are observed at the opposite side of the hydrophobic cluster. However, a positive charge from the amino terminus is disrupting the hydrophobic cluster. This charge was neutralized by acetylation of the amino terminus in our effort to avoid cleavage of the peptide bond between Ile1 and Cys2 during the biotransformation of compstatin (13.Sahu A. Soulika A.M. Morikis D. Spruce L. Moore W.T. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Interestingly, upon acetylation activity of compstatin was increased by a factor of 3 (13.Sahu A. Soulika A.M. Morikis D. Spruce L. Moore W.T. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We then designed our subsequent studies using the more effective sequence of Ac-Ile1-Cys2-Val3-Val4-Gln5-Asp6-Trp7-Gly8-His9-His10-Arg11-Cys12-Thr13-NH2. Because of its activity, low toxicity, and structural simplicity compstatin is a promising candidate for drug development (1.Sahu A. Morikis D. Lambris J.D. Lambris J.D. Holers V.M. Therapeutic Interventions in the Complement System. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 75-112Google Scholar, 12.Furlong S.T. Dutta A.S. Coath M.M. Gormley J.J. Hubbs S.J. Lloyd D. Mauger R.C.

Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is not unusual for a short cyclic peptide to become an oral drug; a successful example is the widely used immunosuppressant cyclosporin (16.Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Also, it is known that several immunogenic peptides adopt functional β-turn structures (17.Dyson H.J. Lerner R.A. Wright P.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18.Dyson H.J. Rance M. Houghten R.A. Lerner R.A. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 161-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). In an earlier study we designed and tested a number deletion analogs of compstatin in an attempt to truncate further the 13-residue peptide, but none of them was active (13.Sahu A. Soulika A.M. Morikis D. Spruce L. Moore W.T. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Neither a retro-inverso analog nor β-turn analogs, with substitutions that we expected to enhance a type I or a type II β-turn, were active (13.Sahu A. Soulika A.M. Morikis D. Spruce L. Moore W.T. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). With the goal to improve on the activity of compstatin, we have initiated the rational design of compstatin analogs based on the available solution structure and function data. We have constructed 7 analogs by introducing perturbations in the key components of the structure of compstatin, which we have studied using homonuclear two-dimensional NMR spectra. Our goal is to classify which residues are essential for structural stability, activity, or both. Also, we aim to elucidate the roles of the disulfide bridge, of the hydrophobic patch, and of the charges of compstatin in both structural stability and binding/inhibitory activity. Certain substitutions have resulted in retaining or slightly increasing the inhibitory activity while maintaining the structural stability. Other substitutions have resulted in loss of inhibitory activity while maintaining the characteristic β-turn found in compstatin. Finally, some substitutions have resulted in loss of both structural stability and activity. We present here the design of the 7 analogs, one of which is slightly more active than compstatin and one that is equally as active as compstatin. Despite the presence of multiple conformations (due to flexibility) of small peptides in solution, NMR has been widely used to determine the presence of conformers with distinguishable populations in linear and cyclic peptides, peptide fragments derived from protein sequences, immunogenic peptides, and peptides of de novo design (e.g. see Refs. 17.Dyson H.J.

Peptide synthesis and purification was performed as described previously (8.Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 884-891PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Inhibitory activity of compstatin and its analogs on the complement system was studied by measuring their effect on the alternative pathway. Complement activation inhibition was assessed by measuring the lysis of rabbit erythrocytes in normal human serum, as described previously (8.Sahu A. Kay B.K. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 884-891PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All analogs were examined by mass spectroscopy and found to be monomeric. The analogs of compstatin used for NMR studies were acetylated with the exception of the C2A/C12A analog. The NMR samples were prepared in 90% H2O, 10% D2O buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm potassium chloride, 0.1% sodium azide, and 10 μm EDTA. Sample pH was ∼6 for the C2A/C12A, Ac-V3A, Ac-W7F, Ac-Q5G/D6A/W7A, and Ac-Q5G/D6P/W7F analogs and 6.5 for the Ac-H9A and Ac-V4A/H9A/T13I analogs. Peptide concentrations were in the range of 1.5–5 mm, depending on the analog. NMR spectra were recorded at 5 °C. NMR spectra for the Ac-V3A, Ac-W7F, Ac-H9A, C2A/C12A, Ac-V4A/H9A/T13I, and Ac-Q5G/D6A/W7A analogs were collected using Bruker DMX 500 MHz spectrometer and for the Ac-Q5G/D6P/W7F were collected using a Bruker AMX 400 MHz spectrometer. DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were collected for all analogs using standard pulse sequences (see Ref. 24.Ernst R.R. Bodenhausen G. Wokaun A. Principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance in One and Two Dimensions. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990Google Scholarand references therein). All spectra were collected using the 3-9-19 pulse sequence with gradients for water suppression (25.Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar). The NOE mixing time was 500 ms and the TOCSY mixing time was 60 ms for the Ac-V3A, Ac-W7F, Ac-H9A, C2A/C12A, Ac-V4A/H9A/T13I, and Ac-Q5G/D6A/W7A analogs. The NOE mixing time was 400 ms, and the TOCSY mixing time was 75 ms for the Ac-Q5G/D6P/W7F analog. Spectral processing was performed using matNMR, which is a toolbox for processing NMR/EPR data (www.nmr.ethz.ch/matnmr; written by Jacco van Beek) under MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA) and for the Ac-Q5G/D6P/W7F analog using Felix (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). In t 2 dimension apodization was performed using Gaussian window functions for the DQF-COSY and NOESY spectra and cosine squared window functions for the TOCSY spectra. Int 1 dimension cosine squared window functions were used for all spectra. The solvent was deconvoluted from the spectra using the time domain convolution method of Marion et al. (26.Marion D. Ikura M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 84: 425-430Google Scholar) with a sine bell function. Table I shows the analogs of compstatin we have studied by NMR and their inhibitory activities. These are the single replacement analogs Val3 → Ala (Ac-V3A), Trp7 → Phe (Ac-W7F), and His9 → Ala (Ac-H9A), the double replacement analog Cys2 → Ala/Cys12 → Ala (C2A/C12A), and the triple replacement analogs Val4 → Ala/His9 → Ala/Thr13 → Ile (Ac-V4A/H9A/T13I), Gln5 → Gly/Asp6 → Ala/Trp7 → Ala (Ac-Q5G/D6A/W7A), and Gln5 → Gly/Asp6 → Pro/Trp7→ Phe (Ac-Q5G/D6P/W7F). Given that we know the solution structure of compstatin (14.Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) we can now examine by using NMR the following: 1) if the designed analogs form structures consistent with the type I β-turn of compstatin or with some other type of turn or secondary structure; 2) the role of the disulfide bridge in the formation of structure in compstatin; 3) the role of the hydrophobic and polar surfaces in the structural stability of compstatin; and 4) which of the above structural characteristics are essential for function.Table IInhibitory activities of compstatin analogs studied by NMR and their parent peptides1-aUnderlined residues are points of amino acid replacement or acetyl group addition.1-b Ac stands for acetylated N terminus.1-c Asterisks on the left and right of Cys2 and Cys12, respectively, denote disulfide-linked cysteines.1-d Complement activities were determined by measuring alternative pathway-mediated erythrocyte lysis.1-e From Morikis et al.(14.Morikis D.

J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 1-g Not available. We begin our analysis by focusing on the two major types of β-turns, type I and II. We test the consistency of the observed NOEs with the expected NOEs for type I and type II β-turns. This can be accomplished by examining the following NOEs: HN(2)-HN(3), HN(3)-HN(4), Hα(2)-HN(3), Hα(3)-HN(4), and Hα(2)-HN(4), where the numbers in parentheses refer to residues 2, 3, and 4 of the β-turn (20.Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). NOEs Hα(2)-HN(3) and Hα(3)-HN(4) should always be present in the case of a β-turn, but they are also generic NOEs in the case of extended structure. The weak NOE Hα(2)-HN(4) is characteristic of the presence of a β-turn of both types, type I and type II. A strong HN(3)-HN(4) NOE is also characteristic of the presence of a β-turn of both types, type I and type II. The NOE that distinguishes a type I from a type II β-turn is the HN(2)-HN(3), which has strong intensity in the case of a type I β-turn and weak intensity in the type II β-turn. The turn assignment can be further refined by looking at the intensities of the Hα(2)-HN(3) NOE, which should be medium for a type I β-turn and strong for type II β-turn (20.Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). In the C2A/C12A analog the two cysteines are replaced by alanines, making it a linear peptide. This is an inactive peptide (Table I). The rationale for the design of the linear C2A/C12A analog was to test the significance of the disulfide bridge in restricting the conformational space of compstatin and in the formation of the type I β-turn. Fig. 2 A shows the Hα/side chain(δ1)-HN(δ2) region of the TOCSY spectrum of the C2A/C12A analog, where all residues with the exception of Ile1 have been identified. (Note that this analog is not acetylated which makes the amide of the of the first residue unobservable because of fast exchange with the solvent.) Chemical shift overlaps in both the Hα and HN of Val3/Val4, and to a lesser extent Arg11/Ala12 are present. Also, chemical shift overlaps in the Hα of Trp7/His9, and to a lesser extent Asp6/Trp7/His9 are present. Finally, chemical shift overlaps in the HN of Ala2/His10 are present. These overlaps are characteristic of the flexibility of this analog. Fig. 2 B shows the Hα/Hβ(δ1)-HN(δ2) region of the NOESY spectrum of the C2A/C12A analog. Sequential connectivities corresponding to intra-residue Hα(i)-HN(i) and short range Hα(i)-HN(i + 1) NOE cross-peaks are marked in Fig. 2 B, but only the intra-residue cross-peaks are labeled for simplicity. Unfortunately, because of the overlap of the Hαs of Asp6/Trp7, we cannot distinguish the presence of a weak Hα(i)-HN(i + 2) cross-peak for the Asp6 Hα-Gly8 HN NOE from the strong Trp7Hα-Gly8 HN cross-peak (Fig. 2 B, arrow), which would be consistent with β-turn of the parent peptide, compstatin. This led us to look closer at the Hβ(δ1)/HN(δ2) region of the spectrum where indeed a very weak Hβ(i)-HN(i + 2) cross-peak is present corresponding to the Asp6Hβ-Gly8 HN NOE (Fig. 2,B and C). This cross-peak is consistent with the presence of a turn population in the segment Gln5-Asp6-Trp7-Gly8 as in parent peptide compstatin. Further examination of HN(δ1)-HN(δ2) region of the NOESY spectrum (Fig. 2 D) reveals a medium Trp7 HN-Gly8 HNcross-peak. An Asp6 HN-Trp7HN cross-peak is also present but somehow obscured by the diagonal (Fig. 2 D). These two cross-peaks are consistent with the presence of a type I β-turn in the segment Gln5-Asp6-Trp7-Gly8, as in parent peptide compstatin. Closer examination of the spectra in Fig. 2, B and D, reveals the presence of Gln5 Hα-Trp7 HN and Gln5 HN-Asp6 HNcross-peaks, which in combination with the Asp6HN-Trp7 HN cross-peak are characteristic of the presence of a type I β-turn in the segment Val4-Gln5-Asp6-Trp7. Alternatively, we can say that two fused type I β-turns are present in the segment Val4-Gln5-Asp6-Trp7-Gly8. A weak Hα(i)-HN(i + 3) cross-peak, Gln5 Hα-Gly8HN (Fig. 2 B), in combination with the Hα(i)-HN(i + 2) and HN(i)-HN(i + 1) cross-peaks mentioned above for the fused β-turns, is suggestive of the presence of a population forming a turn of a 310-helix (20.Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley Interscience, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) in the segment Gln5-Asp6-Trp7-Gly8. Based on the observed NOEs for the C2A/C12A analog and the β-turn forming analogs (see below), we conclude that the linear sequence of compstatin has a propensity to form a 310-helix, which upon formation of the disulfide bond is reduced to a β-turn. Interestingly, a type III β-turn is classified as a turn of a 310-helix (19.Rose G.D. Gierasch L.M. Smith J.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 101-109Google Scholar, 27.Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3068) Google Scholar). A type III β-turn has characteristic dihedral angles for residues 2 and 3 of the turn (φ2, ψ2) = (−60o, −30o) and (φ3, ψ3) = (−60o, −30o) compared with a type I β-turn which has dihedral angles (φ2, ψ2) = (−60o, −30o) and (φ3, ψ3) = (−90o, 0o). However, because there is a statistical variation associated with dihedral angles of ±30o (which is also the error of calculated dihedral angles from NMR data), the type III β-turn is often classified under the type I β-turn category. In this report we do not distinguish a type III from a type I β-turn. The structure of the C2A/C12A analog is not sufficient for C3 binding and activity (Table I), which makes the disulfide bridge necessary for activity. Based on the structure of compstatin (Fig. 1), we propose that the disulfide bridge brings together the termini of compstatin thus contributing to the formation of the hydrophobic patch, which in turn is necessary for recognition and binding to C3. In the Ac-H9A analog the His9, right outside the C-terminal residue of the β-turn, is replaced by Ala. This is an analog slightly more active than its parent peptide, Ac-compstatin (Table I). The rationale for the design of the Ac-H9A analog was to introduce additional conformational freedom at one end of the type I β-turn by removing the bulky histidine and replacing it with the smaller alanine. This accomplishes a test for the turn stability without losing activity, given that a non-acetylated ring-only form of this analog (with missing residues Ile1 and Thr13 outside the peptide ring) was active, although less active than its parent peptide ring-only compstatin (Table I of Ref.14.Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows the Hα(δ1)-HN(δ2) region of the DQF-COSY spectrum of the Ac-H9A analog, where all residues have been identified. Chemical shift overlaps in the Hα are observed for Cys2/Cys12and Gln5/Ala9. Chemical shift overlaps in the HN are observed for of Ala9/Arg11and Gln5/Thr13. Fig. 3 B shows the Hα(δ1)-HN(δ2) region of the NOESY spectrum of the Ac-H9A analog. Sequential connectivities corresponding to intra-residue Hα(i)-HN(i) and short range Hα(i)-HN(i + 1) NOE cross-peaks are marked in the figure. In addition, a weak Hα(i)-HN(i + 2) cross-peak corresponding to Asp6Hα-Gly8 HN is observed (circled in Fig. 3 B), which is consistent with the presence of a β-turn. Fig. 3 C shows the HN(δ1)-HN(δ2) region of the NOESY spectrum of the Ac-H9A analog where observed HN(i)-HN(i + 1) cross-peaks are labeled. Medium intensity cross-peaks corresponding to Asp6 HN-Trp7HN and Trp7 HN-Gly8HN NOEs are observed which are consistent with the presence of a type I β-turn in the segment Gln5-Asp6-Trp7-Gly8, as in compstatin. In compstatin, a very weak Hβ(i)-HN(i + 2) NOE of Asp6 Hβ-Gly8 HN was also observed (14.Morikis D. Assa-Munt N. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which is absent in the Ac-H9A analog (data not shown). This suggests a slightly increased flexibility or alternatively slightly reduced population of the type I β-turn in Ac-H9A analog compared with compstatin. The above NOE data are consistent with the presence of a weak (with small but observable population) type I β-turn in the se"

It interacts with origins of DNA replication in chromosomal DNA and recruits additional replication proteins to form functional initiation complexes. These processes have not been well characterized at the biochemical level except in the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORC. We report here the expression, purification, and initial characterization of Schizosaccharomyces pombeORC (SpORC) containing six recombinant subunits. Purified SpORC binds efficiently to the ars1 origin of DNA replication via the essential Nterminal domain of the SpOrc4 subunit which contains nine AT-hook motifs. Competition binding experiments demonstrated that SpORC binds preferentially to DNA molecules rich in AT-tracts, but does not otherwise exhibit a high degree of sequence specificity. The complex is capable of binding to multiple sites within the ars1 origin of DNA replication with similar affinities, indicating that the sequence requirements for origin recognition in S. pombe are significantly less stringent than in S. cerevisiae. We have also demonstrated that SpORC interacts directly with Cdc18p, an essential fission yeast initiation protein, and recruits it to the ars1 origin in vitro. Recruitment of Cdc18p to chromosomal origins is a likely early step in the initiation of DNA replication in vivo. These data indicate that the purified recombinant SpORC retains at least two of its primary biological functions and that it will be useful for the eventual reconstitution of the initiation reaction with purified proteins.

These data indicate that the purified recombinant SpORC retains at least two of its primary biological functions and that it will be useful for the eventual reconstitution of the initiation reaction with purified proteins. In bacteria, bacteriophage, and animal viruses the initiation of DNA replication takes place at defined nucleotide sequences known as origins of replication (1.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Initiator proteins bind to such origin sequences and promote the biochemical steps leading to the establishment of replication forks. The interaction of initiator proteins with origins is less well understood in the case of eukaryotic cells where initiation of DNA replication occurs at multiple sites along chromosomal DNA (2.Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The best characterized eukaryotic chromosomal origins of replication are those of the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Like the origins of prokaryotes and animal viruses, budding yeast origins are modular in nature and are composed of several short, well defined sequence blocks distributed over a region of ∼100–150 bp (3.Campbell J.L.

The most highly conserved sequence block of budding yeast origins is the A domain which contains an essential 11-bp ARS consensus sequence. An additional, less well conserved sequence block, referred to as the B domain, serves to enhance the efficiency of origin utilization (3.Campbell J.L. Newlon C.S. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W.

Genetic and biochemical studies have established that ORC plays a central role in the initiation of DNA replication and that it functions, at least in part, to recruit essential replication factors to origins of DNA replication to form the pre-replication complex (7.Coleman T.R.

One such factor is Cdc6p which is required, together with ScORC, to load the MCM complex, a putative DNA helicase, onto DNA (10.Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K.

In addition, protein complexes containing ORC-related subunits have been identified in extracts of Xenopus laevis eggs, Drosophila melanogaster embryos, Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells, and human HeLa cells (14.Gossen M.

Thus, ORC has been highly conserved during evolution, suggesting the existence of common mechanisms for initiating DNA replication in all eukaryotes. However, it is not yet clear whether the interaction of ORC with origins of DNA replication in other species is similar to that in S. cerevisiae. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that the initiation of DNA replication in metazoans can occur at many sites within broad replication zones, suggesting that the sequence requirements for initiation may be more relaxed than in budding yeast (18.DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor NY1996: 45-86Google Scholar, 19.Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Methods. 1999; 18: 418-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).In previous studies we and others have shown that fission yeast origins of DNA replication differ dramatically from their budding yeast counterparts (20.Dubey D.D. Zhu J. Carlson D.L. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3638-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21.Clyne R.K. Kelly T.J.

Biol. 1996; 6: 467-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fission yeast origins have a minimal size of 500 to 1000 bp and are very rich in AT base pairs. However, they do not share a common consensus sequence comparable to the ARS consensus sequence of S. cerevisiae replication origins. In addition,S. pombe origins are characterized by a high degree of functional redundancy. Sequence blocks that are important for origin function appear to be composed of smaller AT-rich sequence elements that can be deleted individually without significantly affecting origin activity (23.Clyne R.K. Kelly T.J. Methods. 1997; 13: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Several genetic properties of S. pombeorigins can be rationalized by the finding that the S. pombehomologue of one of the ORC subunits (SpOrc4p) contains an N-terminal DNA-binding domain consisting of nine AT-hook motifs (24.Chuang R. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We have suggested that binding of the N-terminal domain of SpOrc4p to appropriately spaced AT-tracts serves to tether the ORC complex toS. pombe origins of DNA replication. Consistent with this possibility, we have demonstrated that the isolated SpOrc4 subunit can bind to DNA containing a known S. pombe origin (24.Chuang R. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the DNA binding properties of the SpORC holo-complex have not been reported.To understand origin recognition and the assembly of initiation complexes in S. pombe, it will be essential to characterize the biochemical properties of SpORC. For this purpose, we have expressed all six SpORC subunits in insect cells using the baculovirus system, and we have purified the complex to near homogeneity. The purified SpORC binds with high affinity to a known origin of DNA replication in S. pombe (ars1). Our data indicate that SpORC recognizes multiple sites within ars1 DNA, consistent with the hypothesis that origin selection in S. pombe is less sequence-specific than in S. cerevisiae. The binding of SpORC to ars1 DNA is mediated by the N-terminal domain of the SpOrc4 subunit. We have demonstrated that this domain is essential for the viability of S. pombe. Finally, we have shown that SpORC interacts directly with Cdc18p, a key regulator of the initiation of DNA replication. This interaction recruits Cdc18p to origin DNA, which is a likely early step in the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication. Thus, the expression and purification of SpORC should facilitate biochemical analysis of the initiation reaction.DISCUSSIONTo understand the initiation of DNA replication at the molecular level, it will be necessary to reconstitute the initiation complex with purified proteins. Toward this end we have purified recombinantS. pombe ORC and characterized two of its primary functions, origin binding and recruitment of Cdc18p. The SpORC was produced by co-expression of recombinant subunits in the baculovirus expression system. We have developed a simple affinity purification scheme to obtain SpORC from chromatin extracts of infected insect cells. This scheme relies on epitope tags placed at the N terminus of SpOrc4p where they do not interfere with SpORC function in vivo. We have obtained highly purified SpORC and demonstrated that it consists of a stable complex of six subunits analogous to ORCs of budding yeast,X. laevis, D. melanogaster, and Homo sapiens (6.Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar,14.Gossen M. Pak D.T. Hansen S.K. Acharya J.K. Botchan M.R.

Previous genetic studies have shown that S. pombe origins differ significantly from those of S. cerevisiae, suggesting that there may be substantial differences in the mechanisms of origin recognition employed by the two species (20.Dubey D.D. Zhu J. Carlson D.L. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3638-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21.Clyne R.K. Kelly T.J.

S. pombe origins are large, highly AT-rich sequences composed of functionally redundant elements. Importantly, they lack a common consensus sequence analogous to the ARS consensus sequence element recognized by ScORC. These properties have raised the question of whether origin recognition in fission yeast is less specific than in budding yeast. Our studies of the interaction of purified SpORC strongly suggest that this is the case. The binding of SpORC to ars1 DNA is governed by the SpOrc4 subunit, as demonstrated by the fact that the binding of the isolated SpOrc4 subunit is indistinguishable from that of the complete SpORC holo-complex. We have previously shown that the N-terminal domain of SpOrc4p, which contains nine AT-hook motifs, is necessary and sufficient for DNA binding by the isolated subunit (24.Chuang R. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and the present study has shown that this domain is essential for viability of fission yeast. The binding of SpORC to ars1 origin DNA appears to have a relatively low level of sequence specificity. The protein is capable of binding to multiple sites within ars1DNA with similar affinity. Although the protein binds with the highest affinity to AT-rich DNA, we also observed detectable binding to a control DNA with significantly lower AT content than that generally found in S. pombe origins. Our data are consistent with a model in which SpORC is targeted preferentially to long AT-rich regions within the S. pombe chromosomal DNA without regard to the specific nucleotide sequence of such regions. We expect that such regions would contain multiple and potentially overlapping binding sites for SpORC as in the case of ars1. One consequence of this model is that SpORC would be expected to be targeted preferentially to non-coding regions of the genome which have a higher average AT content than coding sequences. Obviously, our data do not rule out the possibility that the pattern of SpORC binding and initiation of DNA replication in vivo may be modulated by other factors such as chromatin organization and local transcriptional activity (38.Gomez M. Antequera F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5683-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is likely that origin recognition inS. pombe is significantly less constrained by primary nucleotide sequence than in S. cerevisiae. It is possible that the same is true for metazoans, but further work will be required to assess this possibility (18.DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor NY1996: 45-86Google Scholar, 19.Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Methods. 1999; 18: 418-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).It has been demonstrated that binding of ScORC to origin DNA is strictly dependent upon binding of ATP to Orc1, and it seems likely that ATP binding and hydrolysis plays an important role in the assembly and function of the initiation complex (6.Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 39.Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The binding of SpORC toars1 DNA does not require ATP, but it is possible that there are additional interactions between SpORC and DNA that are dependent on ATP. Such interactions could be difficult to detect in the presence of the strong ATP-independent binding mediated by SpOrc4p, especially if they are weak or transient in nature. One function of the N-terminal domain of SpOrc4p may be to facilitate additional protein-DNA interactions by tethering the complex to origins, thereby increasing its local concentration in the vicinity of the DNA. While such interactions may not directly contribute to origin selection, they may be critical for the downstream steps in initiation of DNA replication. This possibility is currently under investigation.Cdc6p/Cdc18p plays a key role in the initiation of S. pombeDNA replication and appears to be essential for the loading of the putative MCM helicase at origins (40.Kearsey S.E. Montgomery S. Labib K. Lindner K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 41.Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that Cdc18p is targeted to origins via interactions with ORC, but there have been few biochemical studies to probe this interaction directly.In vitro studies with X. laevis egg extracts have shown that ORC is required for the association ofXenopus Cdc6p with chromatin (7.Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). More recently, biochemical studies with purified S. cerevisiae proteins have demonstrated interactions between Cdc6p and ScORC that alter the conformation of ScORC and modulate its DNA binding properties (11.Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that purified S. pombe ORC interacts specifically and efficiently with Cdc18p in the presence or absence of origin DNA. This finding differs from the results of studies inS. cerevisiae demonstrating that the Cdc6p-ScORC interaction is stabilized by the presence of origin DNA (11.Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar). This difference could be due to species variation or may simply reflect differences in experimental conditions, since special washing conditions were required to observe origin dependence of the Cdc6p-ORC interaction in S. cerevisiae, and the dependence was not observed in other studies (34.Liang C. Weinreich M. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 36.Wang B. Feng L. Hu Y. Huang S.H. Reynolds C.P. Wu L. Jong A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8291-8298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Neither the binary SpORC-Cdc18p complex nor the ternary SpORC-Cdc18p-ars1 complex requires ATP for formation. As noted above, the possible role of ATP in the interaction betweenS. cerevisiae Cdc6p and ScORC is not yet clear, although it has been demonstrated that mutations in the nucleotide-binding motifs of Cdc6p do not abolish the interaction in vitro (11.Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar).It appears that Cdc18p has some affinity for ars1 DNA in the absence of SpORC. This observation may be related to the recent finding that S. cerevisiae Cdc6p has an intrinsic nonspecific DNA binding activity (42.Feng L. Wang B. Driscoll B. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1673-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but further work will be required to assess this possibility, since we cannot yet completely rule out the presence of a contaminating DNA-binding protein in our purified Cdc18p. In any case, the association of Cdc18p with ars1 DNA is greatly enhanced by the presence of SpORC, consistent with the hypothesis that ORC functions to recruit Cdc18p to origins via direct interactions. The ability to form ternary complexes of SpORC, Cdc18p, and ars1 in vitro should facilitate the further biochemical analysis of the assembly of initiation complexes. In bacteria, bacteriophage, and animal viruses the initiation of DNA replication takes place at defined nucleotide sequences known as origins of replication (1.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Initiator proteins bind to such origin sequences and promote the biochemical steps leading to the establishment of replication forks. The interaction of initiator proteins with origins is less well understood in the case of eukaryotic cells where initiation of DNA replication occurs at multiple sites along chromosomal DNA (2.Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The best characterized eukaryotic chromosomal origins of replication are those of the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Like the origins of prokaryotes and animal viruses, budding yeast origins are modular in nature and are composed of several short, well defined sequence blocks distributed over a region of ∼100–150 bp (3.Campbell J.L.

DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 873-914Google Scholar). The most highly conserved sequence block of budding yeast origins is the A domain which contains an essential 11-bp ARS consensus sequence. An additional, less well conserved sequence block, referred to as the B domain, serves to enhance the efficiency of origin utilization (3.Campbell J.L. Newlon C.S. Broach J.R. Pringle J.R. Jones E.W.

Genetic and biochemical studies have established that ORC plays a central role in the initiation of DNA replication and that it functions, at least in part, to recruit essential replication factors to origins of DNA replication to form the pre-replication complex (7.Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 8.Cocker J.H. Piatti S. Santocanale C. Nasmyth K. Diffley J.F.

One such factor is Cdc6p which is required, together with ScORC, to load the MCM complex, a putative DNA helicase, onto DNA (10.Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K.

In addition, protein complexes containing ORC-related subunits have been identified in extracts of Xenopus laevis eggs, Drosophila melanogaster embryos, Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells, and human HeLa cells (14.Gossen M. Pak D.T. Hansen S.K. Acharya J.K. Botchan M.R. Science. 1995; 270: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15.Rowles A. Chong J.P. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J.

Thus, ORC has been highly conserved during evolution, suggesting the existence of common mechanisms for initiating DNA replication in all eukaryotes. However, it is not yet clear whether the interaction of ORC with origins of DNA replication in other species is similar to that in S. cerevisiae. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that the initiation of DNA replication in metazoans can occur at many sites within broad replication zones, suggesting that the sequence requirements for initiation may be more relaxed than in budding yeast (18.DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor NY1996: 45-86Google Scholar, 19.Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Methods. 1999; 18: 418-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In previous studies we and others have shown that fission yeast origins of DNA replication differ dramatically from their budding yeast counterparts (20.Dubey D.D. Zhu J. Carlson D.L. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3638-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21.Clyne R.K. Kelly T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6348-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22.Dubey D.D. Kim S.M. Todorov I.T. Huberman J.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 467-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fission yeast origins have a minimal size of 500 to 1000 bp and are very rich in AT base pairs. However, they do not share a common consensus sequence comparable to the ARS consensus sequence of S. cerevisiae replication origins. In addition,S. pombe origins are characterized by a high degree of functional redundancy. Sequence blocks that are important for origin function appear to be composed of smaller AT-rich sequence elements that can be deleted individually without significantly affecting origin activity (23.Clyne R.K. Kelly T.J. Methods. 1997; 13: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Several genetic properties of S. pombeorigins can be rationalized by the finding that the S. pombehomologue of one of the ORC subunits (SpOrc4p) contains an N-terminal DNA-binding domain consisting of nine AT-hook motifs (24.Chuang R. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We have suggested that binding of the N-terminal domain of SpOrc4p to appropriately spaced AT-tracts serves to tether the ORC complex toS. pombe origins of DNA replication. Consistent with this possibility, we have demonstrated that the isolated SpOrc4 subunit can bind to DNA containing a known S. pombe origin (24.Chuang R. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the DNA binding properties of the SpORC holo-complex have not been reported. To understand origin recognition and the assembly of initiation complexes in S. pombe, it will be essential to characterize the biochemical properties of SpORC. For this purpose, we have expressed all six SpORC subunits in insect cells using the baculovirus system, and we have purified the complex to near homogeneity. The purified SpORC binds with high affinity to a known origin of DNA replication in S. pombe (ars1). Our data indicate that SpORC recognizes multiple sites within ars1 DNA, consistent with the hypothesis that origin selection in S. pombe is less sequence-specific than in S. cerevisiae. The binding of SpORC to ars1 DNA is mediated by the N-terminal domain of the SpOrc4 subunit. We have demonstrated that this domain is essential for the viability of S. pombe. Finally, we have shown that SpORC interacts directly with Cdc18p, a key regulator of the initiation of DNA replication. This interaction recruits Cdc18p to origin DNA, which is a likely early step in the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication. Thus, the expression and purification of SpORC should facilitate biochemical analysis of the initiation reaction. DISCUSSIONTo understand the initiation of DNA replication at the molecular level, it will be necessary to reconstitute the initiation complex with purified proteins. Toward this end we have purified recombinantS. pombe ORC and characterized two of its primary functions, origin binding and recruitment of Cdc18p. The SpORC was produced by co-expression of recombinant subunits in the baculovirus expression system. We have developed a simple affinity purification scheme to obtain SpORC from chromatin extracts of infected insect cells. This scheme relies on epitope tags placed at the N terminus of SpOrc4p where they do not interfere with SpORC function in vivo. We have obtained highly purified SpORC and demonstrated that it consists of a stable complex of six subunits analogous to ORCs of budding yeast,X. laevis, D. melanogaster, and Homo sapiens (6.Bell S.P.

Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar,14.Gossen M. Pak D.T. Hansen S.K. Acharya J.K. Botchan M.R.

Except for the well studied case of S. cerevisiae, the nature of origins of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells remains poorly understood. Previous genetic studies have shown that S. pombe origins differ significantly from those of S. cerevisiae, suggesting that there may be substantial differences in the mechanisms of origin recognition employed by the two species (20.Dubey D.D. Zhu J. Carlson D.L. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3638-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21.Clyne R.K. Kelly T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6348-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 37.Dubendorff J.W. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). S. pombe origins are large, highly AT-rich sequences composed of functionally redundant elements. Importantly, they lack a common consensus sequence analogous to the ARS consensus sequence element recognized by ScORC. These properties have raised the question of whether origin recognition in fission yeast is less specific than in budding yeast. Our studies of the interaction of purified SpORC strongly suggest that this is the case. The binding of SpORC to ars1 DNA is governed by the SpOrc4 subunit, as demonstrated by the fact that the binding of the isolated SpOrc4 subunit is indistinguishable from that of the complete SpORC holo-complex. We have previously shown that the N-terminal domain of SpOrc4p, which contains nine AT-hook motifs, is necessary and sufficient for DNA binding by the isolated subunit (24.Chuang R. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and the present study has shown that this domain is essential for viability of fission yeast. The binding of SpORC to ars1 origin DNA appears to have a relatively low level of sequence specificity. The protein is capable of binding to multiple sites within ars1DNA with similar affinity. Although the protein binds with the highest affinity to AT-rich DNA, we also observed detectable binding to a control DNA with significantly lower AT content than that generally found in S. pombe origins. Our data are consistent with a model in which SpORC is targeted preferentially to long AT-rich regions within the S. pombe chromosomal DNA without regard to the specific nucleotide sequence of such regions. We expect that such regions would contain multiple and potentially overlapping binding sites for SpORC as in the case of ars1. One consequence of this model is that SpORC would be expected to be targeted preferentially to non-coding regions of the genome which have a higher average AT content than coding sequences. Obviously, our data do not rule out the possibility that the pattern of SpORC binding and initiation of DNA replication in vivo may be modulated by other factors such as chromatin organization and local transcriptional activity (38.Gomez M. Antequera F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5683-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is likely that origin recognition inS. pombe is significantly less constrained by primary nucleotide sequence than in S. cerevisiae. It is possible that the same is true for metazoans, but further work will be required to assess this possibility (18.DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor NY1996: 45-86Google Scholar, 19.Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Methods. 1999; 18: 418-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that binding of ScORC to origin DNA is strictly dependent upon binding of ATP to Orc1, and it seems likely that ATP binding and hydrolysis plays an important role in the assembly and function of the initiation complex (6.Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 39.Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The binding of SpORC toars1 DNA does not require ATP, but it is possible that there are additional interactions between SpORC and DNA that are dependent on ATP. Such interactions could be difficult to detect in the presence of the strong ATP-independent binding mediated by SpOrc4p, especially if they are weak or transient in nature. One function of the N-terminal domain of SpOrc4p may be to facilitate additional protein-DNA interactions by tethering the complex to origins, thereby increasing its local concentration in the vicinity of the DNA. While such interactions may not directly contribute to origin selection, they may be critical for the downstream steps in initiation of DNA replication. This possibility is currently under investigation. Cdc6p/Cdc18p plays a key role in the initiation of S. pombeDNA replication and appears to be essential for the loading of the putative MCM helicase at origins (40.Kearsey S.E. Montgomery S. Labib K. Lindner K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 41.Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that Cdc18p is targeted to origins via interactions with ORC, but there have been few biochemical studies to probe this interaction directly.In vitro studies with X. laevis egg extracts have shown that ORC is required for the association ofXenopus Cdc6p with chromatin (7.Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). More recently, biochemical studies with purified S. cerevisiae proteins have demonstrated interactions between Cdc6p and ScORC that alter the conformation of ScORC and modulate its DNA binding properties (11.Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that purified S. pombe ORC interacts specifically and efficiently with Cdc18p in the presence or absence of origin DNA. This finding differs from the results of studies inS. cerevisiae demonstrating that the Cdc6p-ScORC interaction is stabilized by the presence of origin DNA (11.Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar). This difference could be due to species variation or may simply reflect differences in experimental conditions, since special washing conditions were required to observe origin dependence of the Cdc6p-ORC interaction in S. cerevisiae, and the dependence was not observed in other studies (34.Liang C. Weinreich M. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 36.Wang B. Feng L. Hu Y. Huang S.H. Reynolds C.P. Wu L. Jong A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8291-8298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Neither the binary SpORC-Cdc18p complex nor the ternary SpORC-Cdc18p-ars1 complex requires ATP for formation. As noted above, the possible role of ATP in the interaction betweenS. cerevisiae Cdc6p and ScORC is not yet clear, although it has been demonstrated that mutations in the nucleotide-binding motifs of Cdc6p do not abolish the interaction in vitro (11.Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that Cdc18p has some affinity for ars1 DNA in the absence of SpORC. This observation may be related to the recent finding that S. cerevisiae Cdc6p has an intrinsic nonspecific DNA binding activity (42.Feng L. Wang B. Driscoll B. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1673-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but further work will be required to assess this possibility, since we cannot yet completely rule out the presence of a contaminating DNA-binding protein in our purified Cdc18p. In any case, the association of Cdc18p with ars1 DNA is greatly enhanced by the presence of SpORC, consistent with the hypothesis that ORC functions to recruit Cdc18p to origins via direct interactions. The ability to form ternary complexes of SpORC, Cdc18p, and ars1 in vitro should facilitate the further biochemical analysis of the assembly of initiation complexes.

We examined Ca2+ signaling in hepatoma cells expressing the hepatocyte gap junction protein connexin32 (cx32) or the cardiac gap junction protein cx43, plus a fluorescently tagged V1avasopressin receptor (V1aR). Release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) in wild type cells increased Ca2+ in the injected cell but not in neighboring cells, while the Ca2+ signal spread to neighbors when gap junctions were expressed. Photorelease of caged Ca2+ rather than InsP3 resulted in a small increase in Ca2+that did not spread to neighbors with or without gap junctions. However, photorelease of Ca2+ in cells stimulated with low concentrations of vasopressin resulted in a much larger increase in Ca2+, which spread to neighbors via gap junctions. Cells expressing tagged V1aR similarly had increased sensitivity to vasopressin, and could signal to neighbors via gap junctions. Higher concentrations of vasopressin elicited Ca2+ signals in all cells. In cx32 or cx43 but not in wild type cells, this signaling was synchronized and began in cells expressing the tagged V1aR. Thus, intercellular Ca2+ signals in epithelia are organized by three factors: 1) InsP3 must be generated in each cell to support a Ca2+ signal in that cell; 2) gap junctions are necessary to synchronize Ca2+ signals among cells; and 3) cells with relatively increased expression of hormone receptor will initiate Ca2+ signals and thus serve as pacemakers for their neighbors. Together, these factors may allow epithelia to act in an integrated, organ-level fashion rather than as a collection of isolated cells.

Excitation-contraction coupling in the heart is coordinated by anatomically defined pacemaker cells, and is mediated by cytosolic Ca2+ signaling in individual myocytes. Intercellular Ca2+ waves can be observed in the intact heart (1Kaneko T. Tanaka H. Oyamada M. Kawata S. Takamatsu T. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and these Ca2+ signaling patterns spread from cell to cell via gap junctions (2Lamont C. Luther P.W. Balke C.W. Wier W.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 669-676Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and may relate to normal and abnormal cardiac function (1Kaneko T. Tanaka H. Oyamada M. Kawata S. Takamatsu T. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In individual myocytes, intracellular Ca2+ release occurs principally via the ryanodine receptor (RyR)1(3Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6164) Google Scholar). Although RyR are spread throughout myocytes, focal clusters generate Ca2+ sparks that can initiate cell-wide Ca2+ signals (4Cheng H. Lederer W.J. Cannell M.B. Science. 1993; 262: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar, 5Blatter L.A. Hüser J. Ríos E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Intra- and intercellular Ca2+ signaling follows a different paradigm in non-excitable cells (3Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6164) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signaling in epithelial organs and in many other tissues instead occurs principally via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and the InsP3 receptor (InsP3R) (3Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6164) Google Scholar). As in the heart, cell-to-cell spread of Ca2+ waves has been observed in epithelial organs, including the liver (7Nathanson M.H. Burgstahler A.D. Mennone A. Fallon M.B. Gonzalez C.B. Saez J.C. Am. J.

Intercellular Ca2+ signaling follows a complex pattern in the liver, much as it does in the heart. For example, vasopressin induces Ca2+ waves that spread from pericentral to periportal hepatocytes, opposite to the direction of blood flow (7Nathanson M.H. Burgstahler A.D. Mennone A. Fallon M.B.

Altered intercellular Ca2+ signaling may contribute to the pathophysiology of certain disease states, since agents that block gap junction conductance also alter tissue function (12Meda P. Bosco D.

Here we examined the conditions necessary to organize intercellular Ca2+ signals in a cell system in which Ca2+ signaling is mediated entirely via InsP3 and the InsP3R. [Arg8]vasopressin, tetracycline, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Sigma; fluo-3/AM, fluo-4/AM, fura-2/AM, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, and caged compounds (NPE-caged InsP3 and DM-nitrophen-EDTA) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Liebovitz 15 (L-15) medium, and other tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Basel, Switzerland). All other chemicals were of the highest quality commercially available. InsP3 receptors were labeled using an antibody from affinity-purified specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the 18 COOH-terminal residues of the rat type II InsP3 receptor (16Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Richard Wojcikiewicz (SUNY, Syracuse, NY). Vasopressin V1areceptors were labeled using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed against the rat hepatocyte V1a receptor (7Nathanson M.H. Burgstahler A.D. Mennone A. Fallon M.B.

Commercially available monoclonal antibodies (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were used to label connexin32 (cx32) and connexin43 (cx43). Wild type SkHep1 cells, SkHep1 cells stably transfected with cx32 (17Fishman G.I. Gao Y. Hertzberg E.L. Spray D.C. Cell Adhes.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were plated onto glass coverslips, and experiments were performed 2–3 days after plating. Coverslips containing the cells were transferred to L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum 1 h before each experiment, then loaded with a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator and studied as described below. Expression of cx32 was under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive promoter (17Fishman G.I. Gao Y. Hertzberg E.L. Spray D.C. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), so tetracycline (1 μg/ml) was either added to or removed from the medium 24 h before experiments using these cells. Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were isolated from liver by collagenase perfusion, then plated onto glass coverslips and used within 2–4 h as described previously (20Schlosser S.F. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9948-9953Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Wild type and SkHep1 cells transfected with cx32 or cx43 were harvested, dissolved in SDS, and the protein concentration of cell homogenate was determined as described previously (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Proteins collected from the cells were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 10% polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to protein nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked at 4 °C overnight and probed for 2 h with the primary antibody. The membranes then were washed, incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Bioscience, Arlington Heights, IL). Total RNA from SkHep1 cells was isolated using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). First strand cDNA was synthesized using the primer oligo-d(T)16 and Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase. Degenerate primers were used to amplify a 530-bp product from a portion of the 3′ region common to the three known RyRs (22Leite M.F. Dranoff J.A. Gao L. Nathanson M.H. Biochem.

PCR amplification was performed in a PTC-100 automated thermocycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA) using 2 μl of the first-strand cDNA reaction, 200 nm of each degenerate primer, 200 μm dNTPs, 2.5 mmMgCl2, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase for a total volume of 100 μl. The PCR samples were subjected to a hot start (2 min at 94 °C), followed by 30 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The reaction was followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The gene encoding the V1a vasopressin receptor (V1aR) was fused in-frame to the amino terminus of red fluorescence protein (RFP) in a pDsRed1-N1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The V1aR open reading frame initially was amplified by PCR from a plasmid containing the full-length cDNA using oligonucleotide primers to introduce HindIII/Kozak consensus and BamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ end of the cDNA, respectively. A typical Kozak consensus sequence (underlined) was introduced into the receptor coding sequence to improve translation. The forward primer was 5′-GCGCAAGCTTGCCGCCACCATGAGTTTCCCGCGAGGCTCC-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-CGGTGGATCCCGGAATAAGAAGTCTGTCTTTCGGCTCATGC-3′. To generate the V1aR-RFP chimera construct, the resulting PCR product was digested with HindIII and BamHI and ligated into the HindIII and BamHI site of pDsRed-N1 followed by transformation in Escherichia coliDH5α. Positive clones were identified by miniplasmid preparation and restriction enzyme analysis. Selected clones were used for maxiplasmid preparation and subsequent transfection. Subconfluent monolayers of SkHep1 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pV1aR-RFP DNA using effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were examined by time lapse confocal microscopy 48 h after transfection. To obtain a pV1aR construct expressing the V1a receptor without fusion to RFP, the pV1aR-RFP plasmid was digested withNotI, followed by gel purification of the linearized band for further digestion with BamHI. The final digestion product was purified and the extremities were turned blunt through Klenow DNA polymerase treatment. After ligation and E. coliDH5α transformation, positive clones were identified by loss of theBamHI restriction site. The selected clone was transfected into 5 × 105 CHO cells using effectene, and suspensions of fura-2-loaded cells were used for cytosolic Ca2+ measurements 48 h after transfection. Immunofluorescence was performed on SkHep1 cells 2–3 days after plating, and on isolated rat hepatocyte couplets 2–4 h after isolation. SkHep1 cells were fixed with acetone, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, then labeled with primary antibody for 1 h. SkHep1 cells were labeled with anti-InsP3R antibodies to determine the subcellular distribution of InsP3Rs, or with anti-cx32 or anti-cx43 antibodies to confirm that transfected SkHep1 cells expressed the intended gap junction protein. Primary rat hepatocytes were fixed with Bouin’s fixative for labeling with anti-V1a receptor antibodies (7Nathanson M.H. Burgstahler A.D. Mennone A. Fallon M.B. Gonzalez C.B. Saez J.C. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1995; 269: G167-G171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but were otherwise processed similarly. After primary antibody incubation the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Specimens were co-labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin to facilitate the identification of the plasma membrane. Negative controls were stained with secondary antibodies alone, along with rhodamine-phalloidin. Specimens were examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser (Thornwood, NY). To ensure specificity of staining, images were obtained using confocal machine settings at which no Alexa 488 fluorescence was detectable in negative control samples labeled with secondary antibodies alone. Specimens were serially excited at 488 nm and observed at 505–550 nm to detect Alexa 488, then excited at 568 nm and observed at >585 nm to detect rhodamine. This approach eliminated bleed-through of Alexa 488 fluorescence into the longer wavelength (rhodamine) detection channel. Cytosolic Ca2+ was measured in wild type SkHep1 cells and in SkHep1 stably transfected with cx32 or cx43 using time lapse confocal microscopy (20Schlosser S.F. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Proc.

Coverslips containing the cells were transferred to a custom-built perfusion chamber on the stage of a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and observed using a ×63, 1.4 N.A. objective. The 488 nm line of a krypton/argon laser was used to excite the dye, and emission signals between 505 and 550 nm were collected. In experiments in which some cells expressed V1aR-RFP, the 568-nm line of the laser was used to excite RFP, while emission signals above 585 nm were collected. Using this approach, cells expressing the V1aR-RFP could be identified while Ca2+ signaling in those and other cells could be monitored simultaneously. Neither autofluorescence nor background signals were detectable at the machine settings that were used. Cells were stimulated either by perfusion with vasopressin, or else by flash photolysis (uncaging) of second messengers, and were observed at a rate of 2–10 frames/s. During two-photon flash photolysis, software constraints limited data collection to a rate of 1 frame/s. Cytosolic Ca2+ was measured in wild type CHO cells and in CHO cells transiently transfected with pV1aR or pV1aR-RFP using spectrofluorometry (26Hagar R.E. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1998; 396: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For these Ca2+ measurements, CHO cells were loaded with fura-2/AM (5 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell suspensions loaded with fura-2 were then transferred to a cuvette to monitor changes in the fura-2 fluorescence ratio in response to addition of vasopressin (100 nm), using an Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer (Danbury, CT). The mechanical stimulation associated with microinjection induces transient Ca2+ signals in epithelial cells (20Schlosser S.F. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9948-9953Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), including in SkHep1 cells. 2A. D. Burgstahler and Michael H. Nathanson, unpublished observation. Therefore, cells here were loaded with a caged rather than the active form of InsP3 or Ca2+. Caged InsP3 was microinjected into cells, then uncaged by UV flash photolysis, while a cell-permeant form of caged Ca2+ was loaded into cells, then uncaged by two-photon flash photolysis. For InsP3studies, NPE-InsP3 (1 mm) was dissolved in an intracellular-like buffer (150 mm KCl plus 1 mmHepes), along with Texas Red (0.4 mg/ml) as a marker of successful microinjection. A series 5171 Eppendorf micromanipulator (Westbury, NY) was used for positioning, and an Eppendorf series 5242 microinjector was used for pressure microinjections. Injected cells were allowed to recover for at least 5 min before flash photolysis. NPE-InsP3 was photolyzed using a mercury arc lamp (75 W) coupled to a 1-mm quartz fiberoptic cable through a high-speed shutter and filterwheel (26Hagar R.E. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1998; 396: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The flash duration varied from 100 to 200 ms, to permit maximal uncaging. For caged Ca2+ experiments, cells were loaded for 1 h with the Ca2+ cage DM-nitrophen (2 μm) plus fluo-4/AM (6 μm). Ca2+was uncaged by two-photon flash photolysis using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope (Hercules, CA) adapted for two-photon excitation with a Spectra-Physics Tsunami titanium:sapphire laser and a Millenia X pump laser (Mountain View, CA). The titanium:sapphire laser was mode-locked with a pulse width of 90 fs and tuned to a wavelength of 730 nm, since that wavelength is optimal for two-photon release of Ca2+ from DM-nitrophen (27Brown E.B. Shear J.B. Adams S.R. Tsien R.Y. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A pump laser power of 7.2 W was used, which resulted in a power level of 600 mW exiting the titanium:sapphire laser. The beam was passed through a 32% neutral density filter, and a power level of 2–4 mW was detected at the focal plane. The calculated volume of uncaging at the focal point was 0.02–0.03 fl, so caged Ca2+ was photoreleased at multiple adjacent points to elevate cytosolic Ca2+ in predetermined subcellular regions (28Leite M.F. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 415-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signals induced by uncaged InsP3 or Ca2+ were monitored by time lapse confocal microscopy as described previously (25Hirata K. Nathanson M.H. Sears M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8381-8386Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,26Hagar R.E. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1998; 396: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Values listed are mean ± S.E., except where otherwise noted. Statistical comparisons were made using Student’s t test, or paired t test where appropriate. Expression of the InsP3R was examined in SkHep1 cells by immunoblot (Fig. 1a). SkHep1 cells were found to express the type II InsP3R, which is the most prevalent isoform in liver (16Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 29Dufour J.-F. Luthi M. Forestier M. Magnino F. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The subcellular distribution of the InsP3 receptor was investigated by confocal immunofluorescence. SkHep1 cells were labeled with the InsP3R antibody used for immunoblots, and co-labeled with rhodamine phalloidin to identify the actin cytoskeleton (Fig.1b). The InsP3R was diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol. No labeling was seen in negative control tissues stained with secondary but not primary antibodies. In contrast, reverse transcriptase-PCR failed to detect RyR expression in SkHep1 cells (Fig. 1, c and d). These findings demonstrate that the InsP3R is the only intracellular Ca2+ release channel in this cell type. This in turn suggests that SkHep1 cells are a model system in which intracellular Ca2+ release is mediated entirely by InsP3Rs, and that Ca2+ signaling in these cells would not be influenced by subcellular gradients in InsP3R expression, as occur in some epithelia (30Hirata K.

The SkHep1 hepatoma cell line normally is communication deficient, but was stably transfected with cx32 under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive promoter (17Fishman G.I. Gao Y. Hertzberg E.L. Spray D.C. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or with cx43 (19Fishman G.I. Spray D.C. Leinwand L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), as described previously. We verified expression levels of cx32 and cx43 in these cell lines by immunoblot (Fig. 2, a and b). Single bands were detected at 32 kDa in cx32-transfected cells and at 43 kDa in cx43-transfected cells, and cx32 expression occurred only in the absence of tetracycline. The subcellular location of cx32 and cx43 in these cells was verified by confocal immunofluorescence (Fig.2c). Both connexin isoforms were detected in a punctate distribution almost entirely along cell-to-cell borders, which is the appropriate location for gap junctions (15Fallon M.B. Nathanson M.H. Mennone A. Saéez J.C. Burgstahler A.D. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1995; 268: C1186-C1194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-to-cell transmission of microinjected Lucifer Yellow was examined as a functional measure of gap junction expression in each transfected cell line (Fig.2, d and e). This small fluorescent dye is biologically inactive and is transmitted across cx32 and cx43 gap junctions with similar efficacy (34Elfgang C. Eckert R. Lichtenberg-Fraté H. Butterweck A. Traub O. Klein R.A. Hülser D.F. Willecke K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Lucifer Yellow injected into cx32 cells spread to 3.04 ± 0.37 neighboring cells within 3 min (mean ± S.E.; n = 26), whereas Lucifer Yellow injected into cx43 cells spread to 3.80 ± 0.45 neighboring cells during the same time interval (n = 40;p > 0.2). Lucifer Yellow injected into non-transfected (wild type) SkHep1 cells spread to no (0.0 ± 0.0) neighboring cells (n = 30; p < 10−8relative to both cx32 and cx43 cells), while Lucifer Yellow injected into cx32 cells in tetracycline spread to only 0.29 ± 0.07 cells (n = 49; p < 10−7relative to cx32 cells without tetracycline). These studies confirm functional expression of cx32 and cx43 in SkHep1 cells, and suggest that intercellular communication is established in nearly all of these cells. NPE-caged InsP3 was injected into wild type and cx43- and cx32-transfected SkHep1 cells, then the InsP3 was liberated by UV flash photolysis. The resulting increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in the injected and neighboring cells was detected by time lapse confocal microscopy (Fig.3). The Ca2+increase spread to 3.2 ± 1.6 cells in the cx32 group (n = 17), 2.0 ± 1.3 cells in the cx43 group (n = 9; p > 0.5 relative to the cx32 group), and to 0.8 ± 0.9 cells in the wild type SkHep1 cells (n = 11; p < 0.0001 relative to both transfected cell lines). The Ca2+ increase did not spread to any other cells in cx32 cells treated with tetracycline (n = 8; p < 0.0001 relative to cx32 cells without tetracycline), similar to what was observed in the wild type. InsP3-induced Ca2+ signals spread to neighboring cells within 0.60 ± 0.13 s (n = 26). These findings demonstrate that InsP3 can mediate the spread of Ca2+ signals among SkHep1 cells via gap junctions, similar to what has been shown previously in other cell lines (35Boitano S. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. Science. 1992; 258: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Furthermore, InsP3-mediated Ca2+signals can spread across either cx32 or cx43, similar to what has been observed in other cell types as well (36Saez J.C. Connor J.A. Spray D.C. Bennett M.V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 37Charles A.C. Naus C.C. Zhu D. Kidder G.M. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The next group of studies investigated whether Ca2+ can act directly as an intercellular messenger. DM-nitrophen-EDTA (caged Ca2+) was loaded into wild type and cx43- and cx32-transfected SkHep1 cells, then the Ca2+ was liberated by two-photon flash photolysis as Ca2+ was observed by time lapse confocal microscopy (Fig. 4,a and b). Use of two-photon excitation allowed uncaging of Ca2+ to be restricted to individual cells, even though all cells were loaded with caged Ca2+ (28Leite M.F. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 415-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast to what was observed after photolysis of NPE-InsP3, uncaged Ca2+ never spread to adjacent cells in either the cx32 group (n = 13) or the cx43 group (n = 16). This is consistent with the idea that the range of action of InsP3 is greater than that of Ca2+ (38Allbritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). To examine the effective range of action of Ca2+ in this system in more detail, Ca2+ was uncaged in discrete 40 (6.3 × 6.3) μm2 regions in SkHep1 cells, and the spread of Ca2+ to elsewhere within the cell was monitored (Fig. 5,a and b). Increases in cytosolic Ca2+dissipated rapidly, and extended no more than 8.7 ± 1.1 (n = 8) μm away from the site of uncaging. Together, these findings suggest that InsP3 rather than Ca2+ acts as an intercellular messenger in unstimulated epithelial cells.Figure 5Ca2+ does not act as a glob"

In this study, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) was identified in p73, which is required for p73 nuclear import and which could promote the nuclear import of a heterologous, cytoplasmic protein. Mutants lacking the NLS localized to the cytoplasm and displayed diminished transcriptional activity.

This NES was sensitive to leptomycin B and could function as an independent export signal when fused to a heterologous protein. Interestingly, p73 mutant proteins lacking the NLS or the NES were more stable than wild-type p73, suggesting that nuclear import and nuclear export are required for efficient p73 degradation. Our results indicate that p73 localization is controlled by both nuclear import and export and suggest that the overall distribution of p73 is likely to result from the balance between these two processes.

Each of these three proteins share a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity and contain common functional domains, including an N-terminal transactivation domain, a central DNA binding domain, and a C-terminal oligomerization domain (1.Kaghad M.

Given these similarities, it is of interest to determine whether members of the p53 family function in similar or distinct metabolic pathways. p53, p63, and p73 can each activate transcription from reporter genes harboring p53 responsive elements in transient expression assays (1.Kaghad M.

Despite these similarities, the consequence of loss of p53, p63, and p73 on development and cancer susceptibility are strikingly different. p53 loss-of-function mutations are observed in over 50% of all human cancers, and p53-deficient mice are highly susceptible to the development of cancer (8.Donehower L.A.

Further, Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients are born with germ line mutations in p53 and display an increased susceptibility to multiple cancers. These findings and others have confirmed the role of p53 as a bona fide tumor suppressor. In contrast, mutations in p63 and p73 are not commonly associated with cancer, and p63- and p73-deficient mice display various developmental deficiencies without an apparent increased cancer incidence. p63-deficient mice have severe defects in limb and skin development (11.Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R.T. Tabin C. Sharpe A. Caput D. Crum C. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar), while p73 deficiency leads to neurological, pheromonal, and inflammatory defects (12.Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M.

Mechanisms that regulate the levels and activity of p53 family members have not been fully clarified. Given their ability to function as transcription factors, one would predict the activity of the p53 family may be tightly correlated with their nuclear localization. Indeed, p53 contains three nuclear localization signals (NLSs) 1The abbreviations used are: NLS(s)nuclear localization signal(s)NES(s)nuclear export signal(s)MDMmurine double minuteLMBleptomycin BHAhemagglutininGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPKpyruvate kinaseCHXcycloheximideYFPyellow fluorescent protein located in the C terminus of the protein, and mutation or deletion of these NLSs leads to the cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 and a consequent decrease in p53 transcriptional activity (15.Liang S.H.

In addition to nuclear import, the active export of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm has also emerged as an important determinant of activity. p53 contains two nuclear export signals (NESs), one located in its C terminus and the other located in its N terminus (19.Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 20.Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Disruption of the C-terminal NES causes p53 to display a more pronounced nuclear localization (20.Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Murine double minute (MDM) 2, the product of a p53-inducible gene, can bind p53 and promote its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (21.Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 22.Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the ability of MDM2 to ubiquitinate p53 promotes the export of p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where p53 can then be degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes (23.Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 24.Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In this case, the addition of ubiquitin moieties to p53 is thought to expose the C-terminal NES of p53 to the nuclear export machinery. Mechanisms that regulate the subcellular localization of other p53 family members have not been determined. nuclear localization signal(s) nuclear export signal(s) murine double minute leptomycin B hemagglutinin green fluorescent protein pyruvate kinase cycloheximide yellow fluorescent protein The purpose of the current study was to examine the nuclear import and export of p73. Toward this end, a bipartite NLS was identified in the C terminus of p73, which is required for p73 nuclear import and which can promote nuclear import when fused to a heterologous, cytoplasmic protein. Mutants lacking the NLS localized to the cytoplasm and displayed less transcriptional activity than wild-type p73 in transfected cells. An NES was also identified in the C terminus of p73, the deletion of which caused p73 to display a more nuclear localization pattern. This NES was sensitive to the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) and could function as an independent export signal when fused to a heterologous protein. These results indicate that p73 localization is controlled by both nuclear import and nuclear export and suggest that the overall distribution of p73 results from the balance between these two processes. Interestingly, p73 mutant proteins lacking either the NLS or the NES were more stable compared with wild-type p73, suggesting that both nuclear import and nuclear export are required for efficient p73 degradation. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type p73α expression DNA was obtained from Frank McKeon (Harvard Medical School). Wild-type MDM2 DNA was obtained from Steve Grossmann (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). HA-tagged p73α Δ1–90 and HA p73α Δ1–138 were generated by PCR using HA wild-type p73α as a template. The 3′ primer for PCR was the SP6 primer, and the 5′ primers were 5′-GGCGGATCCATGTACCCTTACGATGTACCGGATTACGCAGCCAGCGTGCCCACCCACTCG-3′ for HA p73α Δ1–90 and 5′-GGCGGATCCATGTACCCTTACGATGTACCGGATTACGCATCAGCCACCTGGACGTACTCC-3′ for HA p73α Δ1–138. HA p73α 1–348 and HA p73α 1–344 were also made by PCR using HA wild-type p73α as a template. The 5′ primer for PCR was the T7 primer, and the 3′ primers were 5′-GGCTCTAGATCACCGCCGCTTCTTCACACCGG-3′ for HA p73α 1–348 and 5′-GGCTCTAGATCACACACCGGCACCAAGGGC-3′ for HA p73α 1–344. DNAs encoding HA p73α NNII (K345N, K346N, R347I, R348I) and HA p73α NES− (L375A, L377A) were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). HA wild-type p73α was used as a template, and the following oligonucleotides and their complementary oligonucleotides were used for the mutagenesis: for HA p73α NNII, 5′-GGTGCCGGTGTGAATAATATTATTCATGGAGACGAGGAC-3′; for HA p73α NES−, 5′-GCTGAAAGAGAGCGCTGAGGCGATGGAGTTGGTGC-3′. The double mutant HA p73α NNII NES− was similarly constructed using HA p73α NES− as a template and the same oligonucleotides used for making HA p73α NNII. To construct green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged wild-type p73α and p73α NES−, the HA wild-type p73α and HA p73α NES− DNAs were used as PCR templates with the following primers: 5′-GTACGCTAGCAGATCTACCATGGCCCAGTCCACCGCC-3′ as the 5′ primer and 5′-GGCGGATCCAAGTGGATCTCGGCCTCCG-3′ as the 3′ primer. The resulting PCR products were digested with BglII andBamHI and cloned into the corresponding sites in the pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH laboratories). Myc-tagged chicken muscle PK expression DNA was obtained from Gideon Dreyfuss (Howard Hughes Medical Institute) (25.Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). DNA fragments corresponding to amino acids 327–348, 327–344, 329–348, and 91–138 of wild-type p73α were generated by PCR. The resulting PCR products were digested with KpnI and XbaI and subsequently cloned into the corresponding sites in the C terminus of the Myc-PK expression plasmid. The p2YFP vector was obtained from Yanping Zhang (University of Texas). DNA fragments corresponding to amino acids 337–355 of wild-type p53 or p53 NES− (L348A, L350A) (23.Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), amino acids 364–382 of wild-type p73α or p73α NES−, or amino acids 7–27 of wild-type p73α were made by PCR. The resulting PCR products were digested with NheI and AgeI and subcloned into the corresponding sites in the p2YFP vector. U2OS, Saos-2, or 35–2 cells were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Transfections for U2OS and Saos-2 cells were done using the calcium phosphate method in 35 mm2 dishes when the cells were ∼80% confluent. Sixteen h after addition of the DNA precipitate, cells were washed and refed with minimum essential medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell extracts were prepared 8 h later. To measure p73 half-life, cycloheximide (CHX) was added to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml after washing and refeeding, and cell lysates were prepared at various time points after CHX addition. For immunofluorescence staining, cells were plated on glass coverslips and were transfected using the calcium phosphate method for U2OS and Saos-2 cells or using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 35–2 cells according to the manufacturer's instruction. 16 h after transfection, cells were either untreated or treated with 30 ng/ml of LMB (Sigma) for 8 h. Cells were then fixed and stained as described previously (26.Inoue T. Geyer R.K. Howard D. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45255-45260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for immunostaining of HA p73α and Myc-PK fusion proteins were the anti-HA monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Babco) and the anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody Ab-1 (Calbiochem) as the primary antibody, respectively, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Labs) as the secondary antibody. Antibodies used for MDM2 staining were the anti-MDM2 polyclonal antibody N-20 (Santa Cruz) as the primary antibody and rhodamine red-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson Labs) as the secondary antibody. Cell lysates were prepared as described elsewhere (26.Inoue T. Geyer R.K. Howard D. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45255-45260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PolyScreen polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membrane was probed with either an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11 from Babco), an anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody (SMP-14 from Santa Cruz), or an anti-p21 monoclonal antibody (PharMingen). Mechanisms that regulate the subcellular distribution of p73 have not been determined. To address this question, epitope-tagged (HA-tagged) wild-type p73 and various N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of p73 were transiently expressed in U2OS cells. Localization of the HA-tagged p73 proteins was then determined by immunofluorescence staining using an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B, HA wild-type p73α localized exclusively to the nucleus in ∼75% of cells in which it was expressed, while in the majority of other cases HA wild-type p73α localized mostly to the nucleus with only weak cytoplasmic staining. To identify sequences that may affect p73 localization, we first examined the p73 primary amino acid sequence for the presence of a potential nuclear localization signal, characterized by a clustering of the basic residues arginine or lysine (Fig. 1 A). This analysis revealed a potential NLS (KKRR) located between residues 345 and 348 (Fig. 1 A). To test whether this sequence contributed to p73α nuclear import, two deletion mutants were generated that lacked the C-terminal amino acids 349–636 (HA p73α 1–348) or 345–636 (HA p73α 1–344), and their localization patterns were assessed. As shown in Fig. 1 B, HA p73α 1–348 localized almost exclusively to the nucleus, similar to wild-type p73α. In contrast, HA p73α 1–344 localized equally to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that residues 345–348 contribute to p73 nuclear import. To test this further, the KKRR sequence between residues 345 and 348 were converted to asparagine and isoleucine to create the clone HA p73α NNII, and localization of this clone was examined. As shown in Fig. 1 B, HA p73α NNII localized exclusively to the cytoplasm of cells in which it was expressed, confirming a role for the KKRR sequence motif in p73 nuclear import. We also examined whether N-terminal sequences might affect p73 localization. Toward this end, deletion mutants of p73α were generated that lacked the N-terminal 90 (HA p73α Δ1–90) or 138 (HA p73α Δ1–138) amino acids, and the localization patterns of these mutants were tested. As shown in Fig. 1 B, HA p73α Δ1–90 localized almost exclusively to the nucleus, similar to HA wild-type p73α. In contrast, HA p73α Δ1–138 localized equally to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These results suggested that deletion of one or more sequence elements between residues 91 and 138 can inhibit proper p73 nuclear localization. However, amino acid analysis of residues 91–138 did not reveal any putative NLSs characterized by a clustering of basic amino acids. Recent studies indicate that the primary NLS of p53 is bipartite in structure and includes basic amino acid residues between positions 316–322, as well as basic residues at positions 305 and 306 (15.Liang S.H. Clarke M.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16.Liang S.H. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32699-32703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Alignment of the p53 and p73 sequences suggested that the p73 NLS may also have a bipartite structure that includes the basic residues between positions 345 and 348, as well as basic residues at positions 327 and 328 (Fig. 2 A). To test this possibility, p73 residues from 327–348 were fused to the cytoplasmic protein PK, and localization of the PK·p73 fusion proteins was determined. In these experiments, the PK·p73 fusion proteins were Myc-tagged, allowing analysis of their localization by immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against the Myc-epitope (25.Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, Myc-tagged PK localized almost entirely to the cytoplasm of cells in which it was expressed. In contrast, the Myc-tagged PK protein was relocalized to the nucleus when fused to p73 residues 327–348. To test whether residues 345–348 were required for this effect, these residues were deleted from the Myc-PK·p73 fusion protein to generate the clone Myc-PK·p73-(327–344). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the Myc-PK·p73-(327–344) fusion protein failed to enter the nucleus, providing further proof that residues 345–348 are required for the function of the p73 NLS. To test whether residues 327 and 328 also contribute to p73 NLS function, these two residues were deleted from the PK·p73 fusion protein to generate the clone PK·p73-(329–348). As shown in Fig. 2 B, this fusion protein also failed to enter the nucleus. Taken together, these results confirm that residues 327–348 can function as an independent NLS when fused to the cytoplasmic protein PK and that residues 327 and 328, as well as residues 345–348, are required for this activity. The ability of residues 91–138 to function as an NLS when fused to PK was also tested. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the Myc-tagged PK protein remained cytoplasmic when fused to p73 residues 91–138. These results indicate that p73 residues 91–138 do not contain any independent nuclear import sequences. Given these results, we suspect that deletion of p73 residues between positions 91–138 may inadvertently affect p73 protein structure in such a way that inhibits its proper nuclear localization. p53 contains a leucine-rich NES located in its C terminus (20.Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Mutations within this NES inhibit p53 nuclear export, and thus mutants lacking the NES display a more pronounced nuclear localization (20.Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 23.Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar,24.Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). p73 contains a sequence similar to the p53 NES in its C terminus (Fig. 3 A). However, it has not yet been clarified whether p73 is subject to active nuclear export and whether this putative NES in p73 plays a role in this process. To address these questions, we utilized the nuclear export inhibitor LMB. First, U2OS cells were transfected with DNAs encoding either HA-tagged or GFP-tagged p73α and were subsequently untreated or exposed to LMB to inhibit nuclear export. Localization of the transfected p73 proteins was then determined by immunofluorescence staining. In these experiments, HA-tagged p73α localized exclusively to the nucleus in ∼60% of untreated cells in which it was expressed, and GFP-tagged p73α localized to the nucleus in ∼75% of transfected cells (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the percentage of cells in which the HA-tagged p73α displayed an exclusively nuclear staining pattern increased to ∼80% following LMB treatment, and the percentage of cells in which GFP-tagged p73α localized to the nucleus only increased to ∼95%. These results suggested that p73α is actively exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and that this occurs in a LMB-sensitive manner. To investigate this further, the putative NES in the C terminus of p73 was mutated to generate the clone HA p73α NES−, and localization of the resulting mutant protein was monitored in transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, HA p73α NES− displayed a more pronounced nuclear staining pattern than did HA wild-type p73α (97% nuclear only for HA p73α NES−versus 62% nuclear only for HA wild-type p73α). Similarly, GFP p73α NES− also displayed a more nuclear staining pattern than did GFP wild-type p73α (99% versus 75%). These results suggested that p73 nuclear export requires an intact NES in the p73 C terminus. To gain further evidence for the role of the C-terminal NES in p73 nuclear export, we made use of the p73 mutant HA p73α NNII (Fig. 1 B), which localizes exclusively to the cytoplasm but maintains an intact NES. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the HA p73α NNII mutant localized almost exclusively to the cytoplasm when expressed in either U2OS or 35–2 (p53-null/MDM2-null) cells. In contrast, LMB-treatment caused a marked shift of this mutant toward a more nuclear localization pattern in both cell types. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic localization of HA p73α NNII results from both diminished nuclear import and continued nuclear export that is mediated by the NES. To test this further, we mutated the NES in the HA p73α NNII mutant, to generate the double-mutant HA p73α NNII NES−. As shown in Fig. 3 C, mutation of the NES also caused the HA p73α NNII mutant to shift toward a more nuclear localization pattern. Taken together, the results in Fig. 3 indicate that p73 undergoes active nuclear export in transfected cells and that this export depends on the p73 NES. We next wished to test whether the p73 NES can function as an autonomous export signal when fused to another protein. Toward this end, expression DNAs were generated in which wild-type or mutated NES sequences from p53 or p73 were fused to tandem copies of the YFP(2YFP) (19.Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Localization of the resulting fusion proteins was then examined in transiently transfected U2OS cells. As shown in Fig. 4, 2YFP alone displayed a diffuse localization pattern in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of individual cells, with slightly more nuclear accumulation. When residues 337–355 of wild-type p53 (p53 wild-type NES) was fused to 2YFP, this fusion protein was exported from the nucleus and relocalized to the cytoplasm in greater than 50% of cells in which it was expressed, consistent with previous studies (19.Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In contrast, a fusion protein of 2YFP with residues 337–355 of p53 in which leucines 348 and 350 were converted to alanines (p53 NES−) was not exported, confirming the importance of these two leucines in the functionality of the p53 C-terminal NES (20.Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Similarly, fusion of 2YFP with residues 364–382 of wild-type p73 (p73 wild-type NES) resulted in striking nuclear export of the fusion protein in greater than 80% of transfected cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, conversion of leucines 375 and 377 in the p73 NES to alanines inhibited export of the 2YFP fusion protein, and LMB treatment also inhibited export of the 2YFP·p73 NES fusion protein. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the p73 NES can function as an autonomous export signal when fused to 2YFP. Similar results were obtained using 35–2 cells (p53 null/MDM2 null), indicating that the autonomous activity of this p73 C-terminal NES requires neither p53 nor MDM2 (data not shown). A recent study demonstrated that p53 contains a second NES in its N terminus between residues 11 and 27 (19). We fused the corresponding region of p73 (residues 7–27) to 2YFP to test whether this region of p73 can also function as an autonomous NES. As shown in Fig. 4, the N-terminal residues 7–27 in p73 failed to promote nuclear export when fused to 2YFP, indicating that these residues cannot function as an autonomous NES. MDM2 can bind the N terminus of both p53 and p73 and has been shown to promote p53 nuclear export. Given that p73 undergoes active nuclear export, we wished to test the effect of MDM2 on the nuclear export of p73. Accordingly, U2OS cells were transfected with DNAs encoding HA wild-type p53 or HA wild-type p73α alone or co-transfected with DNAs encoding MDM2. p53 and p73 localization was then examined by immunofluorescence staining using an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 A, HA wild-type p53 was largely nuclear when expressed alone but was exported from the nucleus and relocalized to the cytoplasm with co-expression of MDM2. This effect was inhibited by treatment of transfected cells with LMB, consistent with previous reports (23.Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 24.Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). HA wild-type p73α also localized to the nucleus when expressed alone. Interestingly, however, HA p73α was relatively resistant to MDM2-mediated nuclear export, remaining mostly nuclear in cells in which it was expressed with MDM2 (Fig. 5 B). It should be noted that p73 and MDM2 could form a complex in cells expressing both proteins as determined by co-immunoprecipitation studies (data not shown), indicating that the resistance of p73 to nuclear export by MDM2 did not result from an inability of these two proteins to interact. In a high percentage of cells, HA p73α appeared to co-localize in nuclear aggregates with MDM2 (Fig. 5 B), consistent with previous studies (27.Gu J. Nie L. Kawai H. Yuan Z.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6703-6707PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of nuclear aggregate formation between p73 and MDM2 is unknown. Nonetheless, these results indicate that p73 is a relatively poor substrate for MDM2-dependent nuclear export when compared with p53 and suggests therefore that the nuclear export of p53 and p73 may be regulated through different mechanisms. Finally, we wished to determine whether the stability and/or activity of p73 was correlated with its subcellular localization. To examine p73 protein stability, U2OS cells were transfected with either HA wild-type p73α, HA p73α NES−, or HA p73α NNII. Transfected cells were then treated with CHX to inhibit de novo protein synthesis, and the steady-state levels of p73α were monitored at different time points after CHX addition. The rate at which p73 levels decrease under these conditions is a measure of protein stability. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the half-life (t 1/2) of HA wild-type p73α was less than 3 h, similar to previous studies which have reported the half-life of p73α to be between 0.5–2 h (28.Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 29.Lee C.W. La Thangue N.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4171-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast, HA p73α NES− and HA p73α NNII were more stable than HA wild-type p73α, with half-lives in each case between 6 and 9 h. The fact that both mutants are more stable than wild-type p73 suggests that nuclear import and nuclear export are both required for efficient p73 degradation. p73 can bind to p53-responsive elements and activate transcription of p53-responsive genes, including the genes encoding p21 and MDM2. Accordingly, p21 and MDM2 protein levels were monitored in cells expressing either HA wild-type p73α, HA p73α NES−, HA p73α NNII, or HA p73α NNII NES− to determine the relative ability of these nuclear and cytoplasm-localized HA p73α proteins to activate gene transcription. As shown in Fig. 6 B, p21 and MDM2 protein levels were low in mock-transfected cells. Expression of HA wild-type p73α induced the expression of p21 and MDM2, indicating that p73α could activate transcription of the endogenous p21 and MDM2 genes in these transfected cells. In contrast to wild-type p73α, HA p73α NNII localized largely to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B) and was markedly less able to induce p21 and MDM2 expression (Fig. 6 B). These results are consistent with nuclear localization being required for efficient p73α transactivation function. Interestingly, HA p73α NES− was also less active than HA wild-type p73α at inducing p21 and MDM2 expression (Fig. 6 B), despite the fact that HA p73α NES− had a more nuclear localization pattern (Fig. 3 B) and longer half-life (Fig. 6 A) than the wild-type p73 protein. The double mutant HA p73α NNII NES− was also less able to induce p21 and MDM2 expression than HA p73α NNII (Fig. 6 B), although HA p73α NNII NES− displayed a more nuclear localization than HA p73α NNII (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that mutations in the NES of p73α may have a secondary effect on p73α transcriptional activity in addition to inhibiting nuclear export. Wild-type p53 is expressed at low levels in most normal cells and, at least in some cell types, is localized in the cytoplasm (20.Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 30.Zaika A. Marchenko N. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27474-27480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage and various other stresses, p53 levels increase and the p53 protein accumulates in the nucleus. The stress-induced, nuclear accumulation of p53 is likely to result from both diminished nuclear export and continued nuclear import. Two NESs have been identified in p53, one located within the C-terminal oligomerization domain and the second located within the N-terminal MDM2-binding domain (19.Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 20.Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Various studies have suggested that each of these p53 NESs may be susceptible to inhibition following DNA damaging stress. For example, DNA damage-induced phosphorylations in the C terminus of p53 have been reported to increase the formation of p53 tetramers (31.Sakaguchi K. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Anderson C.W. Erickson J.W. Appella E. Xie D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10117-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This tetramerization of p53, in turn, is predicted to render the C-terminal NES inaccessible to the export machinery and thus unable to promote nuclear export (20.Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). More recent studies have demonstrated that amino acid residues within the N-terminal NES of p53 become phosphorylated following DNA damaging stress and that this phosphorylation inhibits the NES function (19.Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that the nuclear accumulation of p53 following DNA damage may result, at least in part, from an inhibition of nuclear export mediated by either the N-terminal or C-terminal NESs. p73 is a member of the p53-family of proteins, and shares a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity with p53. Given the similarity between these two proteins, it is of interest to determine whether p73 and p53 are regulated through common or distinct pathways. Like p53, the p73 protein is stabilized and activated in response to certain DNA damaging agents. For example, p73 activation has been demonstrated following exposure to either cisplatin or ionizing radiation, and stabilization of the p73 protein has been reported in response to cisplatin treatment (28.Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 32.Yuan Z.M. Shioya H. Ishiko T. Sun X. Gu J. Huang Y.Y. Lu H. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The stabilization and activation of p73 in response to these treatments is thought to require its phosphorylation by the tyrosine kinase c-Abl (28.Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). In the current study, we identified a bipartite NLS, which is required for p73 nuclear localization and which can promote the nuclear localization of a normally cytoplasmic protein. In addition, we demonstrate that p73 undergoes active nuclear export and that this export is mediated, at least in part, by an NES located in the p73 C terminus. Presumably, p73 modifications that either promote nuclear import or inhibit nuclear export could also contribute to the activation of p73 in cisplatin or ionizing radiation-treated cells. In this regard, it will be interesting to determine whether the activation and stabilization of p73 in response to these agents is accompanied by its nuclear accumulation, as is the case for p53. Gu et al. (27.Gu J. Nie L. Kawai H. Yuan Z.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6703-6707PubMed Google Scholar) have generated p53·p73 chimeric proteins to examine the functional differences between various p53 and p73 protein domains. In that study, it was found that a p53·p73 chimera in which the C-terminal p53 NES was replaced by the p73 NES was resistant to MDM2-mediated nuclear export. Based on these findings it was proposed that the p73 NES is non-functional. In the current study, we find that p73 displays a more nuclear localization pattern when its C-terminal NES is disrupted by mutation or when nuclear export is inhibited by LMB treatment. We further show that the p73 C-terminal NES can function as an autonomous nuclear export signal when fused to a heterologous protein. In these experiments the p73 C-terminal NES was a stronger NES when compared with the C-terminal NES of p53 (Fig. 4). These results clearly demonstrate that the NES of p73 is functional and that the p73 protein is subject to active nuclear export. However, the factors and conditions which regulate nuclear export of p53 and p73 are likely to be different. For example, p53 is efficiently exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm when expressed with MDM2, whereas p73 forms nuclear aggregates with MDM2 and is largely resistant to MDM2-mediated nuclear export (Fig. 5). Why p73 is resistant to nuclear export by MDM2 is not clear. In this regard, a recent study demonstrated that p53 contains a second NES located in its N terminus between residues 11 and 27. Mutations in this NES inhibited p53 nuclear export, and this NES could function as an autonomous export signal when fused to a heterologous protein (19.Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In contrast, the corresponding N-terminal region of p73 (residues 7–27) lacked nuclear export function when fused to 2YFP (Fig. 4). Therefore, lack of an active NES in the N terminus of p73 may account, at least in part, for the resistance of p73 to MDM2-mediated nuclear export. A second possibility is that nuclear aggregate formation between p73 and MDM2 may inhibit p73 nuclear export. In any event, the fact that MDM2 is relatively inefficient at promoting p73 nuclear export raises the possibility that the export of p73 is normally mediated by a novel, as yet unidentified factor. Given that p73 can function as a transcription factor, we considered that nuclear import and export might affect p73 transactivation function. Not surprisingly, a nuclear import-deficient form of p73 was less able to activate gene expression in transfected cells (Fig. 6). However, a p73 protein deficient in nuclear export displayed a more nuclear localization pattern but was less able to activate gene expression. These results indicate that mutations within the NES of p73 affect the transactivation function of p73 in addition to blocking nuclear export. p53 binds DNA as a tetramer, and mutations in the p53 NES also inhibit the transactivation function of p53 by blocking or preventing the efficient formation of p53 tetramers (20.Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). We suspect that mutations in the p73 NES probably have a similar inhibitory effect on p73 tetramerization and that this might account for the relatively low transcriptional activity of the p73 NES− mutant. We also considered that nuclear import and export may play an important role in regulating p73 protein stability. It has been suggested that p73α is degraded through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, though factors which might promote p73α degradation through this pathway have not been recognized (29.Lee C.W. La Thangue N.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4171-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the current study, p73 mutant proteins deficient in either nuclear import or nuclear export were more stable than wild-type p73. These results suggest that both nuclear import and nuclear export are required for efficient p73 protein degradation. This may be analogous to p53 in which it has been proposed that p53 is ubiquitinated in the nucleus and then exported to the cytoplasm for degradation by cytoplasmic proteasomes (23.Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 24.Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). p73 degradation may occur through a similar mechanism in which p73 enters the nucleus where it is ubiquitinated, followed by its export and degradation in the cytoplasm. Such a model may explain the requirement for nuclear import and nuclear export in p73 degradation. Our results indicate that p73 localization is controlled by both nuclear import and export signals and suggest that the overall distribution of p73 is likely to result from the balance between these two processes. Proper control of nuclear import and export is likely to be an important regulatory determinant of p73."

We investigated the role of PG in the replication of HIV-1 in primary macrophages. The cyPG, PGA1 and PGA2, inhibited HIV-1 replication in acutely infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Because PGA1 and PGA2 have previously been shown to be peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists, we examined the effect of synthetic PPARγ agonists on HIV replication. The PPARγ agonist ciglitazone inhibited HIV-1 replication in a dose-dependent manner in acutely infected human MDM. In addition, cyPG and ciglitazone reduced HIV replication in latently infected and viral entry-independent U1 cells, suggesting an effect at the level of HIV gene expression. Ciglitazone also suppressed HIV-1 mRNA levels as measured by reverse transcriptase PCR, in parallel with the decrease in reverse transcriptase activity. Co-transfection of PPARγ wild type vectors and treatment with PPARγ agonists inhibited HIV-1 promoter activity in U937 cells. Activation of PPARγ also decreased HIV-1 mRNA stability following actinomycin D treatment. In summary, our experimental findings implicate PPARγ as an important factor in the suppression of HIV-1 gene expression in MDM by cyPG. Thus natural and synthetic PPARγ agonists may play a role in controlling HIV-1 infection in macrophages.

AIDS is characterized by numerous immunological abnormalities, alterations in lymphocyte populations, and immunosuppression with subsequent development of opportunistic infections (1.Poli G.

Fujiwara M. Fukushima M. Narumiya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has been shown that cyPG have different biological activities from the primary PG. CyPG are actively incorporated into cells independent of PG receptors and are transferred to the nucleus. In the nucleus cyPG lead to cell cycle arrest at the G1phase and inhibit the replication of a variety of viruses including both DNA and RNA viruses (19.Santoro M. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 276-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). There are several reports of cyPG inhibiting HIV-1 replication in vitro in T-cell lines (VB cells and CEM-SS cells), and in chronically infected macrophages (20.Hughes-Fulford M. McGrath M. Hanks D.

PPARs are ligand-inducible transcription factors belonging to the family of nuclear transcription factors that includes the classical steroid and thyroid hormone receptors (25.Escher P. Wahli W. Mutat. Res. 2000; 448: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). There are three PPAR isotypes, namely PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ. When activated by ligand binding, PPARs can bind to promoters in target genes and modulate gene expression (25.Escher P. Wahli W. Mutat.

PPARγ is expressed upon activation of PBM and their subsequent differentiation into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). These nuclear receptors have been implicated in the regulation of glucose metabolism (27.Nolan J. Ludvik B. Beerdsen P. Joyce M. Olefsky J. N. Engl. J.

Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar). We have found that cyPG can inhibit HIV-1 replication following acute infection of human MDM. Furthermore, these natural PPARγ agonists suppressed HIV-1 replication following phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induction of latent HIV-1 infection in the monocytic U1 cell line. The synthetic PPARγ agonist ciglitazone also inhibited the replication of HIV-1 following acute infection of human MDM with HIV-1 and in U1 cells. Mechanisms for the suppression of viral replication by cyPG and synthetic PPARγ agonists include inhibition of HIV-1 transcription as well as a reduction in HIV-1 mRNA stability. PGA1, PGA2, and ciglitazone (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) were dissolved in ethanol at 1 mg/ml and stored at −70 °C. WY-14643 (Cayman Chemical) was dissolved in Me2SO at 100 μm and stored at −20 °C. PMA (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO at 1 mmand stored at −20 °C. Blood was drawn from healthy donors using heparin as an anticoagulant and layered on Ficoll-Hypaque (density 1.077 g/ml) (Amersham Biosciences). After centrifugation at 20 °C for 45 min at 800 × g, plasma was aspirated, and the interface layer was harvested and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (without Ca2+ or Mg2+, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The cell pellet was resuspended to 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in cold DMEM (Invitrogen) with antibiotics/antimycotic and without FBS. Cells were plated at 5 × 105/well for 96-well plates or 3.125 × 106/well for 6-well plates. Plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 2 h to allow PBM to adhere. Plates were rinsed three times with DMEM prewarmed to 37 °C. Plates were refed with DMEM (10% FBS) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. MDM culture viability was assessed by reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) using a commercially available MTT assay kit (Roche Diagnostics Inc.) (31.Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46885) Google Scholar, 32.Hardwick S. Hegyi L. Clare K. Law N. Carpenter K. Mitchinson M. Skepper J. J. Pathol. 1996; 179: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). PBM were differentiated to MDM, because of their greater susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in vitro, by incubation in culture for 5 days. The M-tropic strain, HIV-1BAL, was used to infect MDM. MDM cultures in 96-well plates were refed with 200 μl of the treatment compound diluted in DMEM (10% FBS) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 16–24 h. 20 μl of virus stock were added per well (estimated multiplicity of infection, 0.01), and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Medium was aspirated, and the wells were refed. MDM cultures were refed (50% replacement) at intervals of 2–3 days. The monocytic cell line U1 is a clone of the cell line U937 and is latently infected with HIV-1 (33.Folks T. Justement J. Kinter A. Schnittman S. Orenstein J. Poli G. Fauci A. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1117-1122PubMed Google Scholar). U1 cells were plated in 96-well plates at 1 × 105cells/well in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 (10% FBS). 20 μl of the treatment compound (10×) were added per well followed by incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h. Induction of latent infection was accomplished by adding 20 μl of PMA) diluted in RPMI 1640 (10% FBS) to a final concentration of 0.1 μm (33.Folks T. Justement J. Kinter A. Schnittman S. Orenstein J.

The cultures were incubated for an additional 72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Samples (3 μl) were mixed with 12 μl of RT assay buffer containing 1 μCi/ml [32P]dTTP. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h. 3.5 μl of each sample was blotted on DEAE paper and air-dried. Blots were washed (with gentle agitation) three times in 2× SSC. Blots were then washed with 95% ethanol and air-dried (35.Goff S. Traktman P. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1981; 38: 239-248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of [32P]dTTP was measured using the PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics) (36.Johnston R. Pickett S. Barker D. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). MDM, U937, and U1 cell lines were treated for 3 h with PGE2 prior to treatment with PMA (final concentration 107m). At 40 h post-treatment cells were harvested and RNA extracted and purified (RNEasy 96 Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The platinum quantitative RT-PCR Thermoscript One-Step System reagents was used (Invitrogen). The primer sequences used were GCC TGG GCG GGA CCG and GTA CAG GCA GAA AGC AGC. The probe sequence is FAM-TGG CGA GCC CTC AGA TGC TGC-TAMRA. The ABI PRISM 7700 was cycled at 60 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 15 s (45 cycles), and 60 °C for 1 min (37.Orlando C.

MDM, U937, or U1 cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well (in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS) and treated with PGE2 for 3 h (36 replicates for each treatment). U1 cells were subsequently stimulated with PMA at 0.1 μm. At 16 h post-PMA treatment, we added actinomycin D at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml to 18 wells of each treatment (and untreated control) to block further transcription. Three wells of each treatment (and untreated control) were harvested immediately and at intervals of 2 h (i.e. 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h). Next, we extracted and purified RNA (RNEasy 96 Kit). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (39.Pang J. Wu C. Chau L. Biochem.

Menezes J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). U937 and HeLa cell transfections were performed as described previously (42.Burke J. Davern L. Gregor K. Owczarczak L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 43.Kusumawat I.A. Commes T. Liautard J. Widada J. Anal.

Briefly, the U937 cell concentration was adjusted to 2 × 108 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 (with 10% FBS), and the plasmid DNA was mixed with 500 μl of U937 cell suspension in electroporation cuvette (Invitrogen). A typical transfection was with 5 μg of plasmid, e.g. LTR.luciferase with “carrier” DNA from salmon testes added to a total of 40 μg of DNA. Electroporation was performed at room temperature using a single-pulse Invitrogen Electroporator II set at 300 V and 1000 microfarad capacitance. The transfected cells were cultured overnight in 10 ml of RPMI 1640. The cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 to 2 × 105 viable cells/ml. Cells were plated in a 24-well tissue culture plate (1 ml/well) and treated with cyPG or ciglitazone for 3 h. Next they were stimulated with PMA at 0.1 μm to induce expression of luciferase from the LTR.luciferase plasmid. Cells were harvested, cell lysates prepared, and luciferase assay performed at 48 h post-treatment. The PPARγ wild type (WT PPARγ1) and dominant negative (PPAR.af2) vectors (46.Gurnell M. Wentworth J.M. Agostini M. Adams M. Collingwood T.N. Provenzano C. Browne P.O. Rajanayagam O. Burris T.P. Schwabe J.W. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5754-5759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) were transfected into U937 or HeLa cells. PBM were incubated for 3–5 days in medium containing serum prior to infection with HIV-1BAL. Treatment of MDM cultures with PGA1 and PGA2 at a concentration of 10−6 M at 16–24 h prior to infection with HIV-1 resulted in a significant decrease in viral replication as assessed by RT assay (Fig. 1). The inhibitory effect of PGA1 and PGA2 was dose-dependent. The addition of cyPG after HIV-1 infection was also effective in suppressing viral replication but to a lesser degree (data not shown). There was no significant decrease in cell viability between treatment groups (data not shown), as assessed by MTT assay. One mechanism by which cyPG could regulate HIV-1 replication would be at the level of viral entry and fusion with the cell membrane. Furthermore, other investigators have shown that other PG can down-regulate the expression of CCR5, the HIV-1 co-receptor (47.Thivierge M. Le Gouill C. Tremblay M.J. Stankova J. RolaPleszczynski M. Blood. 1998; 92: 40-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of cyPG on CCR5 expression. We determined that cyPG had no significant effect on CCR5 expression with the mean fluorescence index of 48.8 ± 1.3 for untreated cells and 57.7 ± 10.5 for PGA2treated cells (n = 3, p = ns). We next chose a cell type in which HIV-1 replication was fusion/entry-independent. In this system, we determined that treatment of the latently infected monocytic cell line, U1 cells, with PGA1 and PGA2, at a concentration of 10−5 M 3 h prior to PMA induction of latent HIV-1 infection resulted in suppression of viral replication as assessed by RT assay (Fig. 2). There was no significant decrease in cell viability between treatment groups (data not shown) as assessed by MTT assay. These data with the U1 cells suggest that the effect of PGA1 and PGA2 on viral replication was not likely to be at the fusion/entry of HIV-1 but at a post-integration level, e.g. gene regulation. Because cyPG are natural agonists of PPARγ, we next examined whether synthetic PPARγ agonists would also suppress HIV-1 BAL replication in MDM. PBM were incubated for 3–5 days in medium containing serum prior to infection with HIV-1. Treatment of MDM cultures with the PPARγ agonist ciglitazone resulted in a dose-dependent suppression of HIV replication, with the maximal effect occurring at 40 μm (Fig. 3 A). The PPARα agonist WY-14643 (50 μm) added 16–24 h prior to infection with HIV-1 demonstrated no effect on HIV-1 replication (Fig. 3 B). This was also true at higher concentrations (data not shown). Having demonstrated that the natural PPARγ agonists cyPG suppressed HIV-1 replication in U1 cells, we next examined the ability of the synthetic PPARγ agonist to suppress HIV-1 replication in the same cells. The PPARγ agonist ciglitazone inhibited HIV-1 replication in PMA-stimulated U1 cells, whereas even higher doses of the PPARα agonist WY-14643 had no effect (Fig. 4). There was no significant decrease in cell viability between treatment groups (data not shown) as assessed by MTT assay. Because cyPG and PPARγ agonists are able to block induction of HIV-1 from latency in the U1 model, we next wanted to determine whether the effect of PGA1 and PGA2treatment was at the level of gene expression. Treatment of U1 cells with PGA1 and PGA2 decreased levels of HIV mRNA as measured by RT-PCR, in parallel with the decrease in RT activity (Fig. 5, A andB). Next we examined the effect of synthetic PPAR agonists on the levels of HIV mRNA in U1 cells. Ciglitazone, the PPARγ agonist, but not the PPARα agonist WY-14643, suppressed HIV mRNA levels (Fig. 5 B). These data strongly suggest that the effects of the natural and synthetic PPARγ agonists occur at the level of HIV gene expression. We next wanted to determine whether PPARγ agonists regulated HIV-1 promoter activity. U937 cells were transfected with LTR.luciferase, which was used as a measure of HIV-1 promoter activity. Ciglitazone treatment of U937 cells suppressed LTR.luciferase expression (Fig. 6 A). The PPARγ WT vector, which promotes PPARγ activity, was co-transfected with the LTR.luciferase vector (Fig. 6 B). Transfection of the PPARγ WT vector alone into U937 cells in the absence of another stimulus suppressed HIV-1 promoter activity. When U937 cells co-transfected with LTR.luciferase and PPARγ WT were subsequently treated with ciglitazone, PGA2, or 15dPGJ2, there was further suppression of HIV-1 promoter activity. These observations confirm that there is base-line PPARγ expression in U937 cells, as indicated by the ability of ciglitazone to suppress LTR.luciferase expression in the absence of transfection with PPARγ WT vector. These findings also support the hypothesis that increased expression of PPARγ inhibits HIV gene expression, probably through regulation of HIV-1 promoter activity. To further confirm that PPARγ expression is responsible for the regulation of HIV-1 promoter activity, we utilized the PPARγ dominant negative vector, PPAR.af2, to block endogenous PPARγ activity in U937 cells. Co-transfection of U937 cells with PPARγ dominant negative vector and LTR.luciferase augmented HIV-1 promoter activity (Fig. 7 A). In addition, the PPARγ dominant negative vector boosted HIV-1 promoter activity in U937 cells stimulated with PMA (Fig. 7 B).Figure 7HIV-1 promoter activity is reversed by inhibition of PPAR γ activity. U937 cells were transfected by electroporation with the LTR.luciferase vector (100 ng) with the PPARγ dominant negative vector, PPAR.af2, and stimulated with (B) or without (A) PMA as described in the legend for Fig. 6. Luciferase expression was determined by measuring relative light units (RLU)/μg of protein. The data are normalized for total protein and β-galactosidase expression. A, the data shown are the means ± S.E. luciferase expression expressed as a percentage of LTR.luciferase alone. *, p = 0.05,n = 3. B, mean data from an experiment performed in triplicate are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because cyPG have PPARγ-independent effects and U937 cells have endogenous expression of PPARγ, we next studied HeLa cells, which do not have any PPARγ expression (48.Straus D. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J. Ricote M. Hsiang C. Sengchanthalangsy L. Ghosh G. Glass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). In the absence of PPARγ transfection, both cyPG and ciglitazone did not demonstrate suppression of HIV-1 promoter activity as measured by levels of LTR.luciferase expression (Fig. 8). Upon co-transfection of HeLa cells with PPARγ WT and LTR.luciferase, in the absence of another stimulus, there was suppression of HIV-1 promoter activity. Following treatment with either cyPG or ciglitazone there was further inhibition of HIV-1 promoter activity. These observations suggest that the suppression of HIV-1 promoter activity by cyPG is PPARγ-dependent. Furthermore, it confirms that the suppression of HIV-1 promoter activity by ciglitazone is through PPARγ activation. Having demonstrated that natural and synthetic PPARγ agonist treatment suppresses HIV mRNA levels, we next wanted to determine whether there was also suppression at a post-transcriptional effect. If PPARγ agonist pretreatment resulted in reduced mRNA levels (RT-PCR) upon treatment with actinomycin D, which blocksde novo mRNA synthesis, this would suggest that it was having an effect on HIV mRNA stability. The kinetics of the effect of ciglitazone pretreatment on HIV mRNA levels in U1 cells are demonstrated in Fig. 9 A. From the early time points, ciglitazone suppressed HIV mRNA levels compared with untreated cells. Furthermore, ciglitazone pretreatment suppressed HIV-1 mRNA levels in U1 cells following the addition of actinomycin D, suggesting that it did reduce mRNA stability (Fig. 9, A and B). This observation suggests that the effect of ciglitazone on HIV-1 gene expression occurs both at the level of transcription and at the level of mRNA stability. In view of the antiviral effects of PG and the known increase in PG levels in macrophages in HIV-1 disease, we examined the effect of cyPG on HIV-1 replication. Our findings demonstrate the following. 1) Treatment with cyPG (i.e. PGA1 and PGA2) results in a significant decrease in HIV-1 replication in MDM and in latently HIV-1 infected U1 cells. 2) The mechanism of HIV-1 suppression replication did not appear to be at the fusion/entry level because cyPG also suppressed HIV-1 replication in the latently infected U1 cell line and reduced HIV-1 mRNA levels. 3) CyPG likely suppressed HIV-1 replication by activation of PPARγ. 4) Synthetic PPARγ agonists also suppress HIV-1 replication. 5) Finally, the mechanism of suppression of HIV-1 replication is at both the HIV-1 promoter level, as well as at the level of HIV-1 mRNA stability. PPARs are ligand-inducible transcription factors that belong to the family of nuclear transcription factors. PPARα is expressed in freshly isolated PBM and is found in many tissues including the liver, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, lung, and adipose tissue. PPARγ is expressed abundantly in adipose tissue but also in skeletal muscle, liver, heart, and bone marrow stromal cells. PPARγ exists as three isomers, PPARγ1 being expressed predominantly in macrophages. PPARγ is also expressed upon activation of PBM and their differentiation into macrophages. The expression of PPARγ occurs at 48–72 h after the culture of PBM in vitro (30.Ricote M. Li A. Willson T. Kelly C. Glass C.

Oncol. 1999; 15: 1027-1031PubMed Google Scholar). When activated by ligand binding, PPARs can activate promoters and modulate gene expression (25.Escher P. Wahli W. Mutat.

PGA1 and PGA2 are natural ligands for PPARα and PPARγ (23.Yu K. Bayona W. Kallen C.B. Harding H.P. Ravera C.P. McMahon G. Brown M. Lazar M.A. J. Biol.

PGD2 can undergo dehydration to PGJ2 and ultimately Δ12-PGJ2, which is produced in significant quantities in the human body (53.Hirata Y. Hayashi H. Ito S. Kikawa Y. Ishibashi M. Sudo M. Miyazaki H. Fukushima M. Narumiya S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16619-16625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CyPG, which includes PGA1 and PGA2, can down-regulate gene transcription by a variety of effects that can be PPARγ-dependent or -independent. PGA1 is reported to inhibit NF-κB activation in Jurkat, CEM-SS, and HeLa cells (54.Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and has been demonstrated to increase I-κBα expression. Increased expression of I-κBα would result in an increased association of I-κBα and NF-κB, which would prevent the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (55.Thomas S. Ryan M. Shanley T. Wong H. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PGA1 and PGJ2 have been shown to inhibit I-κB kinase, which increases I-κBα levels and prevents the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (56.Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). In our model the effect of PGA1 and PGA2 on the suppression of HIV-1 infection appears to be PPARγ-dependent. The synthetic PPAR agonist WY-14643 is a specific PPARα activator (23.Yu K. Bayona W.

A thiazolidinedione compound, ciglitazone, has been shown to be a specific PPARγ activator (58.Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). Both specific PPARα agonists and PPARγ agonists up-regulate and down-regulate gene expression (25.Escher P. Wahli W. Mutat. Res. 2000; 448: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar,26.Vamecq J. Latruffe N. Lancet. 1999; 354: 141-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Our observation that both the natural PPARγ agonists PGA1 and PGA2 and the synthetic specific PPARγ agonist ciglitazone cause a decrease in HIV-1 replication in MDM and the U1 cell line suggests that PPARγ is an important factor in the regulation of HIV-1 replication. One mechanism appears to be the inhibition of HIV-1 promoter activity. This could come about through a number of scenarios. Activation of PPARγ is known to inhibit gene expression by antagonizing the transcription factors AP-1, STAT, and NF-κB (30.Ricote M. Li A. Willson T. Kelly C. Glass C. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar, 59.Wang P. Anderson P. Chen S. Paulsson K. Sjogren H. Li S. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, PPARγ may suppress HIV-1 replication by inactivation of NF-κB (60.Nakajima A. Wada K. Miki H. Kubota N. Nakajima N. Terauchi Y. Ohnishi S. Saubermann L. Kadowaki T. Blumberg R. Nagai R. Matsuhashi N. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 460-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Another potential mechanism of inhibition of HIV-1 promoter activity by PPARγ is through down-regulation of macrophage cytokine production, e.g.tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, which are known to augment transcription of HIV-1 (61.Jiang C. Adrian T. Seed T. Seed B. Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). There is a dearth of information on the effect of PPARγ on mRNA stability. The predominant effect of PPARγ is on transcriptional regulation. In the studies that investigated the role of PPARγ on post-transcriptional regulation, there was no effect on mRNA stability (62.Takeda K. Ichiki T. Tokunou T. Funakoshi Y. Iino N. Hirano K. Kanaide H. Takeshita A. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 63.Sugawara A. Takeuchi K. Uruno A. Ikeda Y. Arima S. Kudo M. Sato K. Taniyama Y. Ito S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3125-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that PPARγ activation reduces HIV-1 mRNA stability. Furthermore there is little information available on the regulation of HIV-1 replication by affecting viral mRNA stability. Expression of the Rev protein affects stability and transport of viral (HIV-1) mRNA (64.Felber B. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Copeland T. Pavlakis G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar,65.Nasioulas G. Zolotukhin A. Tabernero C. Solomin L. Cunningham C. Pavlakis G. Felber B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2986-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of such proteins by PPARγ activation may be the mechanism by which ciglitazone reduces HIV-1 mRNA stability. Both the cyPG (and their derivatives) and thiazolidinedione compounds have been investigated as possible therapeutic agents for the treatment of a number of clinical disorders, e.g. diabetes mellitus and neoplasms (50.Asou H. Verbeek W. Williamson E. et al.Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 1027-1031PubMed Google Scholar, 66.Sasaki H. Niimi S. Akiyama M. Tanaka T. Hazato A. Kurozumi S. Fukushima S. Fukushima M.

Thiazolidinediones, which include troglitazone, ciglitazone, and rosiglitazone (BRL49653) are in clinical use for the treatment of insulin-resistant diabetes (67.Willson T. Cobb J. Cowan D. Wiethe R.

In addition, there are data in the literature suggesting that natural PPARγ agonists suppress replication of viruses other than HIV. PGA is reported to inhibit Sendai virus replication in African green monkey kidney cells (69.Santoro M. Carruba G. Garcia E. Jaffe B. Benedetto A. J. Gen. Virol. 1981; 53: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PGE1 and PGE2, which can be converted to PGA1 and PGA2, respectively, have also been demonstrated to inhibit measles virus replication in Vero cells (70.Dore-Duffy P. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Med. 1982; 8: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Herpes simplex virus replication is reported to be inhibited by PGD2, Δ7-PGA1, and Δ12-PGJ2(71.Tanaka A. Matsuoka H. Nishino H. Imanishi J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Med. 1986; 25: 131-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 72.Yamamoto N. Fukushima M. Tsurumi T. Maeno K. Nishiyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 1987Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In summary, PG are produced by macrophages infected with HIV-1 and are known to be elevated in patients with AIDS (6.Delemarre F. Stevenhagen A. Kroon F. van Eer M. Meenhorst P.L. van Furth R. AIDS. 1995; 9: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate for the first time that cyPG, which are natural PPARγ agonists, decrease replication of HIV-1 in MDM. These PG, generated by HIV-1 infection of macrophages, may in turn act to decrease viral replication in these same cells by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Another exciting possibility is that synthetic PPARγ agonists, already on the market for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, may be utilized as agents in the fight against HIV-1. We thank Dr. V. Chatterjee, Cambridge, UK, for providing the PPARγ expression vectors."

Theoretical studies have predicted that protonic diffusion will dominate at high pressures in ice. We measured the protonic diffusion coefficient for the highest temperature molecular phase of ice VII at 400 kelvin over its entire stable pressure region. The values ranged from 10(-17) to 10(-15) square meters per second at pressures of 10 to 63 gigapascals. The diffusion coefficients extrapolated to high temperatures close to the ice VII melting curve were less by a factor of 10(2) to 10(3) than a superionic criterion of approximately 10(-8) square meters per second, at which protons would diffuse freely."

Moreover, gel shift assays with nuclear extracts from these cell lines revealed that decreased HSD11B2expression is related to a decreased binding activity with oligonucleotides containing the putative regulatory elements.

The phenotype is characterized by increased tubular sodium retention with low renin, low aldosterone hypertension. Moreover, some studies suggest that variations in HSD11B2 gene expression may play a role in the development of essential hypertension and explain salt sensitivity of blood pressure in humans (10.Poch E.

Control of the constitutive pattern of gene expression in different cells and tissues occurs most commonly at the level of gene transcription. Typically, regulatory DNA elements locatedcis to the target gene, in cooperation with a distinct and sometimes gene-specific array of trans-acting DNA-binding proteins, control the processes of transcription initiation and elongation by the RNA polymerase II enzyme. The transcriptional activity is highly dependent on the presence and activity of these DNA-binding proteins, encompassing the number of molecules and their transcription activation status. With respect to the HSD11B2proximal promoter sequence, little information is available on the basal and/or tissue-specific transcriptional regulation. The highly GC-rich promoter lacks a TATA-like element but contains several putative Sp1 binding sites. Two Sp1 elements at positions −80 and −145 were previously analyzed using in vitro techniques, including EMSA, DNase I footprinting, and transient transfections of promoter reporter constructs (12.Agarwal A.K. White P.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the HSD11B2 promoter by in vivodimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprinting via ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR). This technique allows a view of gene-regulatory regions during transcription in an intact chromosomal environment, so it may be the most relevant and informative method to locate regulatory sites. We compared protein binding events in a number of appropriate cell lines that differentially express the HSD11B2 gene to uncover the transcriptional mechanisms that may govern cell-specific regulationin vivo.

The pre-run cycling conditions were 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C. Thermal cycling involved 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 1 min at 60 °C (15.Aarskog N.K. Vedeler C.A. Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16.Pfaffl P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25131) Google Scholar). Approximately 150,000 trypsinized cells from each cell line were resuspended in reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 250 mm sucrose and subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles. Enzymatic activity was determined in vitro by measuring the rate of conversion of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone. Cellular lysates were mixed with 100 μm NAD, 5 nm corticosterone, and 1.26 nm [3H]corticosterone (specific activity 79 Ci/mmol) in 20 μl of reaction buffer and incubated for different time periods at 37 °C. As a control, 0.2% Triton X-100 was added to inhibit 11βHSD2 activity. The reactions were stopped by the addition of an excess of corticosterone and dehydrocorticosterone (10 μg). Finally, the steroids were separated by thin-layer chromatography and analyzed as described previously (3.Escher G. Galli I. Vishwanath B.S. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Genomic footprinting analysis was carried out using DMS methylation and the ligation-mediated PCR method (17.Mueller P.R. Wold B.

Biochem. 1999; 272: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Nested primer sets were selected to cover about 500 bp of the 5′-flanking region and exon 1 of theHSD11B2 gene. The primer sequences were as follows: PA.-1, 5′-GGGCTCTTCATAAGCTCG-3′; PA.-2, 5′-AGGGCGAGCAGAGAAAGCGAGT-3′; PA.-3, 5′-AGGGCGAGCAGAGAAAGCGAGTGTCCCTCT-3′; PB.1, 5′-TGGCACAGCCAGTCGA-3′; PB.2, 5′-AGACGCAGGTCTGAGCGCAGCA-3′; PB.3, 5′-ACGCAGGTCTGAGCGCAGCAGCTGCAGCA-3′; PC.-1, 5′-ATGCCGGTTGTGCGTGT-3′; PC.-2, 5′-CGAACAAGCGTGAGTGGCATGTG-3′; PC.-3, 5′-CAAGCGTGAGTGGCATGTGCTCACCTGAG-3′; PD.-1, 5′-TCCTCGAGCGCAGCAA-3′; PD.-2, 5′-GCAACTTTGGGACTTTGTTCCGGC-3′; PD.-3, 5′-CCGGCTTTTTCCAAATCGAATCTGGTCGAGGGGG-3′; PE.1, 5′-GGAGAGAGAGCTTCTAGG-3′, PE.2, 5′-AGAGGGACACTCGCTTTCTCTGCT-3′; and PE.3, 5′-TTTCTCTGCTCGCCCTCGGGCCGAGCTTAT-3′. Footprinting results were visualized on a PhosphorImager screen (Cyclone; Canberra Packard) and analyzed with ScionImage software. Nuclear protein extractions were carried out as described previously (20.Israel N. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Aillet F. Virelizier J.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3386-3393PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences (top strand) of synthetic complementary oligonucleotides used were as indicated in Figs. 9, 10, and 12, with the exception of GSIV, which was 5′- GCTCCTCGAGCGCAGCAACTTTGGGACTTTGTTCC- 3′. Nuclear extracts (3–4 μg) were incubated with 35 fmol of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotides for 10 min at room temperature in a final reaction volume of 10 μl. Binding buffer contained 4% Ficoll, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 35 mm NaCl, 60 mmKCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Where indicated, specific binding was competed with unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides at a 100-fold molar excess. For antibody supershift experiments, 1 μl of the corresponding antibody solution (TransCruz Gel Supershift reagents; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the nuclear extracts, and then the extracts were kept on ice for 10 min before mixing them with the labeled oligonucleotides. DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide/0.5× Tris-borate EDTA gels, dried, and analyzed on a PhosphorImager.Figure 10Scheme of HSD11B2 deletion mutant reporter vectors.

Genomic DNA was isolated from SW620 cells and amplified using forward primer 5′-CTCCTCGAGCGCAGCAACT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGGCACAGCCAGTCGA-3′. The PCR product was subcloned into the pCRII-TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and transferred into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) by KpnI/EcoRV digestion and ligation via KpnI/SmaI sites. Deletion mutants p−400/+260ΔGCI and p−400/+260ΔGCII are derivatives of plasmid p−400/+260 and were generated via PCR-based whole plasmid synthesis using Vent polymerase with proofreading activity and the following primers: for deletion GCI, forward primer 5′-CTGCAGCTGCTGCGCTCAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAGGCCAGCGCTCCATGG-3′; and for deletion GCII, forward primer 5′-ATGGAGCGCTGGCCTTGGCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGAGAGAGCTTCTAGGCGG-3′. Parental templates were digested with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzymeDpnI, and the remaining PCR products were circularized with T4 DNA ligase. Plasmid DNA was prepared using QIAfilter columns (Qiagen). Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's recommendations. FuGENE 6 (1.2 μl) and 0.8 μg of plasmid DNA were incubated in serum-free medium for 15 min before application on subconfluent cells in 24-well plates. The reporter plasmids were co-transfected with 0.05 μg of a pCMV-LacZ control plasmid to correct for transfection efficiency. After a 24-h incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer, and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using the Dual-Light system (Tropix). Chemiluminescence was measured with a MediatorsPhL luminometer (Mediators Diagnostic Systems). The normalized values from triplicate samples varied by <10%. A selection of human epithelial-like carcinoma cell lines were tested for their HSD11B2transcriptional activity by a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR method (TaqMan) (15.Aarskog N.K. Vedeler C.A. Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The results are listed in Table I. The lowest HSD11B2 mRNA levels were measured in the lung-derived SUT cell line. Thus, we used SUT values as a reference for calculation of the relative transcript number in other cell types. The SW620 colon carcinoma cell line contained the highest HSD11B2 mRNA levels (∼50-fold higher than SUT) and was therefore included for in-depth analyses. A physiologically relevant locus for 11βHSD2 activity is the kidney; accordingly, we selected two kidney cell lines, HCD derived from the cortical collecting duct and HK-2 from the proximal tubule. Both cell types expressed intermediate amounts of HSD11B2 transcripts (∼16-fold higher than SUT). Similar intermediate levels were found in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (Table I).Table IRelative quantification of HSD11B2 mRNA levels in different human cell typesCell typeOriginHSD11B2 mean CtS 18 rRNA mean CtHSD11B2 N relative to SUT1-aThe results are representative of several experiments.SW620Colon26.03 ± 0.0614.62 ± 0.1553.71-bHSD11B2N values derive from the formula 2−ΔΔCt, where ΔΔCt is ΔCt (CtHSD11B2 − Ct S 18) of the respective cell type minus ΔCt of the SUT cells.

Open table in a new tab To establish a correlation between the relative number of transcripts and the occurrence of functional proteins, we measured the oxidative activity of 11βHSD2 in lysates of the five cell types mentioned above. Conversion of radiolabeled corticosterone into 11-dehydrocorticosterone was assayed as a function of various incubation periods at constant protein concentrations (Fig. 1). In SW620 cells, high mRNA expression levels were translated into a high rate of substrate conversion, which reached about 80% after 4 h of incubation. HCD and HK-2 cells expressed a relatively small catalytic activity with up to 20% conversion. MCF-7 extracts converted about 52% of substrate in 4 h. In contrast to the HSD11B2mRNA, which was virtually absent, we measured 64% substrate conversion in SUT extracts. Finally, residual oxidative activity of related enzymes such as the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 isoform was established in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100. Such treatment was observed to completely eradicate 11βHSD2 activity, but not 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 activity (21.Escher G. Vogt B. Beck T. Guntern D. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Upon addition of Triton X-100, the conversion rate could be reduced to <10% in all cellular extracts except those of SUT (Fig. 1, ▪), suggesting that the 11β-dehydrogenase activity in SW620, MCF-7, HCD, and HK-2, but not SUT cells, is attributable to the 11βHSD2 isoform. Therefore, the factual 11βHSD2 activity in SUT cells was estimated as the difference between the conversion rates in the absence and presence of Triton X-100 and was very low (around 10%). Because of the probable transcriptional nature of the control of HSD11B2 gene expression, we investigated the potential of its upstream sequences to induce transcription in the five cell lines. Approximately 1800 bp of the 5′-flanking region of theHSD11B2 gene were cloned in front of a luciferase marker gene and analyzed using classical transient transfection assays. In addition, a set of progressive deletion mutants was generated and analyzed. As expected, the overall luciferase activity was highest in SW620 cells, intermediate in MCF-7 cells, and relatively low in HCD, HK-2, and SUT cells (data not shown). Consistent with previous observations (12.Agarwal A.K. White P.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a fragment ranging from −210 to +117 was sufficient for maximal promoter activity, and critical transcriptional-enhancing elements were localized to a region between −220 and −45 relative to the kidney transcription start site of the HSD11B2 gene (data not shown) (22.Agarwal A.K. Rogerson F.M. Mune T. White P.C. Genomics. 1995; 29: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). DMS in vivo footprinting was used to determine the regions that contribute to the differential expression pattern in human tissues in an in vivo setting. Using this method, we analyzed chromosomal protein-DNA contacts occurring at the HSD11B2locus in intact cells. In principle, the small molecule DMS diffuses rapidly into the nuclei of living cells and methylates guanine residues in the major groove of DNA and, to a lesser extent, adenine residues in the minor groove (17.Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 23.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9008) Google Scholar). Transcription factors binding to the DNA inhibit or stimulate guanine methylation, leading to protection or hypermethylation, respectively. Such genomic footprints were visualized by comparing samples of DNA that have been exposed to the methylating agent DMS in the living cell (in vivo) with samples treated with this agent, in the absence of proteins, after the DNA has been extracted from the cells (in vitro). Using LMPCR allows for single copy gene control regions to be analyzed from a whole genome. We have selected several sets of nested primers (PA, PB, PC, PD, and PE) to map ∼500 bp of the HSD11B2 proximal promoter and exon 1 sequence (Fig. 2). A modified LMPCR procedure was employed for the amplification of highly GC-rich regions, such as those found in this sequence (19.Nawrocki A. Goldring C.E. Frey B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Throughout the HSD11B2 upstream region and the first exon, we detected multiple differences in the guanine-specific DNA ladders obtained from different cell types. Initially, using primer set PA to amplify the bottom strand, we identified a prominent hypersensitive band within a GC-rich region referred to as region I (nt +153) (Fig. 3). Moving from 3′ to 5′, we detected an assembly of footprinted guanines within a second highly GC-rich region (designated region II). Region II encompasses several overlapping consensus binding sites for proteins from the Sp1 transcription factor family. In region II, protein occupancy was discovered by three protected guanines and one hypersensitive guanine (nt +84, +88, and +93 and nt +90, respectively) (Fig. 3). Furthermore, when amplifying the top strand with primer set PB, we detected a protected guanine (nt +92), along with two hypersensitive guanines at positions +81 and +97 within region II (Fig. 4 A). To better visualize these differences, the guanine ladders were analyzed by densitometry (histograms in Fig. 4 B). Variations in the methylation pattern were discovered not only between in vitro- and in vivo-treated DNA but also within the different cell types. For example, protection at guanine +92 and both hypermethylations guanine +81 and guanine +97 were clearly visible in SW620 cells (Fig. 4, A and B; compare lanes 1 and 2), which express high levels ofHSD11B2. Histograms from cells expressing intermediate (MCF-7, HCD, and HK-2) and low levels (SUT) of 11βHSD2 exhibited a similar, albeit less pronounced, pattern (Fig. 4 B, comparelane 3 with lanes 4–7). Similar cell type dependence was seen with primer set PA, where a decreasing intensity of footprints was accompanied by decreasing HSD11B2 transcript levels (Fig. 3). These observations strongly suggest cell line-specific differences in the quantity and/or the quality of the factors binding to these sites.Figure 4Top strand analysis of regions I and II within the first exon of HSD11B2.

Indicative for protein binding, we found a strong footprint covering an Sp1 and an overlapping nuclear factor κB motif in region III, where a hypersensitive guanine (nt −89) was located next to two protected guanine residues (nt −86 and nt −91) (Fig. 5 A). These differences could be best resolved with primer set PC for bottom strand analysis and were confirmed using primer set PD (Fig. 5, A and B). Additional evidence for protein occupancy in this region came from two neighboring adenine residues, which were hypermethylated (Fig. 5; nt −101 and nt −115). Region IV is characterized by a consensus RFX1 and an overlapping Ikaros-2 motif and was identified by a series of hypermethylated guanine and adenine residues on the bottom strand (Fig. 5 B; nt −186 to nt −199). These footprints were complementary to a single hypersensitive adenine (nt −200) that could be observed by top strand analysis with primer set PE (Fig. 6). The sum of DMS in vivo footprints identified by our experiments and their exact position on the HSD11B2 genomic sequence are summarized in Fig. 7.

We detected this gene silencing as a reduction in the ratio of cells expressing the exogenous gene rather than a reduction in the average expression levels, indicating that down-regulation occurs in an all-or-none manner. Retroviral gene expression was protected from silencing and maintained in Brm-deficient host cells by exogenous expression of Brm but not BRG1, an alternative ATPase subunit in the SWI/SNF complex. Introduction of exogenous Brm to these cells suppressed recruitment of protein complexes containing YY1 and histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and 2 to the 5′-long terminal repeat region of the integrated provirus, leading to the enhancement of acetylation of specific lysine residues in histone H4 located in this region. Consistent with these observations, treatment of Brm-deficient cells with HDAC inhibitors but not DNA methylation inhibitors suppressed retroviral gene silencing. These results suggest that the Brm-containing SWI/SNF complex subfamily (trithorax-G) and a complex including YY1 and HDACs (Polycomb-G) counteract each other to maintain transcription of exogenously introduced genes.

One problem limiting development of retroviral vectors with long term expression, however, is gene silencing (1Bestor T.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). DNA methylation has been reported as the major epigenetic DNA modification that occurs in conjugation with provirus down-regulation (2Stewart C.L. Stuhlmann H. Jahner D. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4098-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 3Lorincz M.C. Schuebeler D. Goeke S.C. Walters M. Groudine M. Martin D.I.K. Mol. Cell.

Virol. 1991; 65: 904-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and serves as a signal for association with methyl-CpG-binding protein 2, which together form large protein complexes containing histone deacetylases (HDACs)1 (5Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Therefore, silenced retroviral genes sometimes have been reactivated by treating cells with either the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, 5-azacytidine (5-aza-C) and 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-azadC), or HDAC inhibitors, such as trichostatin A (TSA). In many cell types that exhibit gene silencing, however, it is not clear whether provirus methylation is the primary cause or simply reflects transcriptional repression. Gene silencing that is not mediated by DNA methylation has been suggested (6Cherry S.R. Biniszkiewicz D. van Parijs L. Baltimore D. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7419-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 7Chen W.Y. Bailey E.C. McCune S.L. Dong J.-Y. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In multicellular organisms, epigenetic regulation of transcription supports distinct cell type-specific gene expression. For example inDrosophila and mammalian cells, the Polycomb group (Pc-G) protein complex and trithorax group (trx-G) protein complex epigenetically regulate the expression of essential developmental genes such as Hox (10Gebuhr T.C. Bultman S.J. Magnuson T. Genesis. 2000; 26: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The proteins required to maintain a repressed state are Pc-G complex, whereas those required for persistence of expression are trx-G complex. Pc-G and trx-G protein complexes do not contribute to the initiation of specific target genes but instead counteract each other to repair previously established chromosomal domains of specific genes throughout development (10Gebuhr T.C. Bultman S.J. Magnuson T. Genesis. 2000; 26: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Insight into the role of the trx-G protein complex in transcriptional regulation has came from studies of the Drosophila Brahmagene and its mammalian homologues Brm and BRG1. The products of these genes have DNA-dependent ATPase activity and are classified as SWI2/SNF2 family proteins. The mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex contains either Brm or BRG1 but not both (11Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The differences in biochemical function between Brm and BRG1 are largely unknown; however, we observed the Brm or BRG1 subunit has distinct target specificity to facilitate gene activation through AP-1 (12Ito T.

These findings provide mechanistic links between epigenetic transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. We herein describe retroviral gene silencing, which occurs very rapidly in a discontinuous and stochastic manner, in certain human tumor cell lines, and we show that this phenomenon is caused by lack ofBrm gene expression in the cell. In addition, we present biochemical evidence suggesting that a trx-G protein complex (Brm-containing SWI/SNF subfamily) and a Pc-G protein complex (containing YY1 and HDACs) counteract each other to maintain expression of retrovirally introduced exogenous genes as was reported for endogenous genes (10Gebuhr T.C.

Total RNA was prepared from cells with ISOGEN RNA isolation reagent (Wako Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). RT-PCR was performed within the linear range with Superscript One-step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq Kit (Invitrogen). The primer sets were as follows: 5′-ctggcccttcccctggagccatgct-3′ and 5′-agggccgggtcctgttgcggacac-3′ for BRG1, and 5′-ctgcaagagcgggaatacagacttcaggcccg-3′ and 5′-ggctgcctgggcttgcttgtgctcccaaacc-3′ for Brm, and 5′-tcattgacctcaactacatggtttac-3′ and 5′-ggcatggactgtggtcatgagtc-3′ for GAPDH. RNA was reverse-transcribed for 30 min at 50 °C. Amplification conditions are as follows: an initial denaturation of 94 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles (for Brm and BRG1) of 94 °C for 30 s, 67 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min or 25 cycles (for GAPDH) at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. ChIP assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) except that the sonication condition was changed to five times for 20 s each at 10% output (Branson model 250). Specific antibodies for immunoprecipitations were anti-BAF60a (Transduction Laboratories), anti-YY1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HDAC1 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-HDAC2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-histone H1 (clone AE4, Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies. The antibody to tetra-acetylated histone H4 (on residues 5, 8, 12, and 16) (pan-acetylated H4) or antibodies to H4 acetylated on individual residues (H4-Lys-5, H4-Lys-8, and H4-Lys-12, respectively) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. After protein-DNA cross-links in the immunoprecipitates were reversed, DNA was extracted for the PCR. Conditions for semi-quantitative PCR were 32 cycles of 95 °C for 30s, 60 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min.

PCR products were visualized with SYBR Green I after 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The band density was semi-quantified by densitometry (ATTO Printgraph). We reported previously (17Ui M. Mizutani T. Takada M. Arai T. Ito T. Murakami M. Koike C. Watanabe T. Yoshimatsu K. Iba H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Arai T. Ui M. Takada M. Iba H. Virology. 1999; 260: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that transduction efficiency by VSV-G pseudotyped vector is quite high in cell lines originated from human solid tumors as well as murine fibroblasts. Throughout this work, multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) is defined as the ratio of input infectious units (titrated on the corresponding cell line) to the number of cells used for the transduction. With the LacZ virus, we showed that the proportion of LacZ-expressing cells was dependent upon vector dosage following the equation 1 −e1/m.o.i in 3Y1, NIH3T3, and MIA PaCa-2 (18Arai T. Ui M. Takada M. Iba H. Virology. 1999; 260: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as well as several other human solid tumors (17Ui M. Mizutani T. Takada M. Arai T. Ito T. Murakami M. Koike C.

Watanabe, and H. Iba, unpublished observations. Interestingly, however, we observed that in C33A and SW13 cells, the observed dose dependence differed from that predicted by the equation and leveled off before the entire culture population expressed LacZ. To examine closely why a significant cellular population in these C33A and SW13 cultures failed to express LacZ, these cells as well as MDA-MB435 (as positive control) were transduced with LacZ virus at a low m.o.i. (about 0.4) to minimize the introduction of multiple proviral copies into a single cell. The transduced cell cultures were grown for 1 day to complete the retroviral integration and then were seeded at a low cellular concentration for single colony formation. The colonies formed 3 days after seeding were stained for LacZ to assess LacZ expression. An MDA-MB435 cell that was transduced with LacZ virus formed a colony in which all the progeny cells express lacZ (Fig.1A). We define such colony as a “positive colony” (Fig. 1B). The cell that escaped from the transduction formed a colony that is exclusively composed of expression-negative cells. We define such colony as a “negative colony” (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, most of the colonies formed by LacZ-virus transduced C33A and SW13 cells were composed of mixed populations of positive and negative cells (Fig. 1A). Such a colony was defined as a “mosaic colony” (Fig.1B). When several C33A colonies were isolated in penicillin cups, separated into single cells by trypsinization, and cloned into 96-well plates, the cellular colonies produced either all provirus-positive progeny clones or all provirus-negative progeny clones as judged by genomic PCR. These results negate the possibility that the mosaic colonies were formed by a mixed population of proviral-positive and -negative cells; the differences in LacZ expression in the mixed colonies are likely to represent retroviral gene silencing that occurred in a discontinuous and stochastic manner during cell proliferation as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1B. To semi-quantify the extent of gene silencing, we tentatively defined “mosaic colony ratio” of a seeded culture after the transduction by dividing the number of mosaic colony by the sum of the number of positive colony and the number of mosaic colony. We determined the mosaic colony ratios for C33A, SW13, and MDA-MB435 and several other human tumor cell lines as well as murine fibroblast cell lines using the same LacZ virus. In most cell lines examined, including MDA-MB435, H1299, and SW620, HeLa S3 and 3Y1, the mosaic colony ratios were low and ranged from 0.02 to 0.15. C33A and SW13 cells, however, exhibited a high mosaic colony ratio (Fig.2A). Two other cell lines, Saos2 and G401, showed similar properties to C33A and SW13 cells, although the mosaic colony ratio was lower. Comparison of gene expression patterns among these cell lines might reveal host factors that inhibit or accelerate retroviral gene silencing. We were interested in Brm and BRG1, which are the essential subunits of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and have DNA-dependent ATPase activity, as candidates for inhibitory factors. Expression of both proteins is reported to be absent or very low in both C33A and SW13 cells (19Muchardt C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 20Khavari P.A. Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R.

Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Therefore, we screened the cell lines listed in Fig. 2A for Brm andBRG1 expression. BRG1 mRNA levels were assessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. BRG1 mRNA was nondetectable in both C33A and SW13 cells under this condition (30 cycles) (Fig. 2B), whereas BRG1 mRNA became detectable only in C33A by increasing the PCR amplification to 40 cycles (data not shown). These findings are consistent with the results of Western blotting analysis; BRG1 protein was not detected in SW13 cells, and was low in C33A cells. All other cell lines were positive for BRG1 mRNA expression; however, H1299 cells were negative for BRG1 protein. These observations are consistent with a recent report (23Swedlund B. Tavtigian S.V. Teng D.H. Lees E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6171-6177PubMed Google Scholar) that H1299 cells have a deletion in bothBRG1 alleles that causes a frameshift in the coding region. The RT-PCR primer pair used here does not cover the deleted region. Brm mRNA was not detected in C33A, SW13, Saos2, or G401 cells, but it was detected in the other cell lines examined here by PCR amplification of the coding region of the Brm gene (Fig.2B) as well as the 3′ non-coding region (data not shown). Saos2 cells were reported previously (21DeCristofaro M.F. Belz B.L. Rorie C.J. Reisman D.N. Wang W. Weisman B.E.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) to produce Brm by Western blotting analysis with a monoclonal antibody raised against Brm, and we were able to reproduce this finding. Since we found this monoclonal antibody to be weakly cross-reactive with BRG1, we used a non-cross-reactive goat polyclonal antibody and confirmed that these cell lines expressed no detectable Brm. Therefore the rapid retroviral gene silencing appears to be correlated with the absence of endogenousBrm expression (Fig. 2A), whereas loss of BRG1 does not appear to be related directly to retroviral gene silencing. Because C33A and SW13 cells have high mosaic colony ratios, we tested the possibility that the Brm deficiency in these cells causes retroviral gene silencing. If initial processes in the retroviral infectious cycle including viral entry, proviral integration, and initiation of LTR-driven exogenous gene expression are not disturbed in these host cells, a retrovirus vector encoding Brm would be expected to prolong viral RNA expression by the Brm protein produced initially in an early stage of infection. An autoregulatory loop would support continuous expression of Brm thereafter. To test this possibility, C33A and SW13 cells were transduced with Brm virus or control virus at a low m.o.i. One day after transduction, cultures were trypsinized and seeded at a low cell number for single colony formation. When viral mRNA levels in C33A cells were examined byin situ hybridization 7 days after transduction with Brm virus using the gag probe (Fig.3) or the Brm probe (data not shown), viral mRNA-positive cells were found predominantly in positive colonies (mosaic colony ratio of 0.32). In contrast, control virus yielded primarily “mosaic colonies” (mosaic colony ratio of 0.71), and BRG1 virus yielded predominantly “mosaic” colonies (mosaic colony ratio of 0.89) when detected by the gagprobe. It is also noteworthy that most of the mosaic colonies formed by Brm virus-transduced C33A mainly consisted of transgene-expressing cells, whereas control virus (or BRG1 virus)-transduced C33A has a much lower population of transgene-expressing cells (Fig. 3). These observations further confirm that Brm expression recovers the retroviral gene silencing very efficiently. The above findings support the hypothesis that Brm expression in host cells is necessary to overcome retroviral gene silencing. Similar results were obtained in SW13 cells; the mosaic colony ratio of SW13 cells transduced with Brm virus and control virus was 35 and 79%, respectively, 7 days after transduction (Fig. 3). BRG1-expressing SW13 cells assumed a flat cellular morphology and formed colonies of less than 10 cells, and therefore mosaic colony ratio was not accessed. This observation is consistent with the previous report (23Swedlund B. Tavtigian S.V. Teng D.H. Lees E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6171-6177PubMed Google Scholar) that BRG-1 has strong growth inhibitor effects in SW13. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in retroviral gene silencing in Brm-deficient cell lines, we used several inhibitors of HDACs (CHAP31 and TSA) or DNA methyltransferase (5-aza-C or 5-azadC). When SW13 cells were treated with CHAP31 for 2 days after transduction with LacZ virus, the percentage of positive colonies in the total colonies increased in a CHAP31 dose-dependent manner, and the percentage of mosaic colonies in the total colonies was slightly increased (Fig. 4). As schematically shown in Fig. 1B, if the retroviral gene silencing were to be partially alleviated by this HDAC inhibitor, the mosaic colony would become a positive colony. At the same time, an “apparently negative colony” (where all the component cells ceased expressing transgene within three circle of cell division) would be present, it will become mosaic colony. Only a slight increase in percentage of mosaic colony observed in Fig. 4 would be explained by this scheme. PCR analysis indicated that 47% of cellular clones derived from a parallel culture of LacZ virus-transduced SW13 cells harbored proviral DNA (Fig. 4, arrow). This observation indicates that not all the SW13 cells harboring the provirus can express LacZ even in the presence of 4 nm of CHAP31, further confirming that this inhibitor did not completely released the gene silencing. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with 60 nm TSA; however, strict quantitation was hampered by the cytotoxic effect of the reagent on diluted cellular clones. On the other hand, treatment with 5-azadC (0.5 μm) or 5-aza-C (2 μm) for 2 days did not increase the percentage of either positive or mosaic colonies among the total colonies. In C33A cells, similar release from gene silencing was also detected by the treatment with 4 nm CHAP31, but treatment with 5-azadC (0.5 μm) or 5-aza-C (2 μm) caused no changes in the percentage of either mosaic colony or positive colony as was shown in SW13 cells. These findings suggest that histone acetylation is involved in retroviral gene silencing in Brm-deficient cell lines and that the process does not involve a mechanism mediated through CpG methylation. Since HDAC inhibitors recovered retroviral gene silencing in Brm-deficient cell lines, it might be possible that SWI/SNF complex normally induces histone acetylation in the 5′-LTR region of the provirus. Because targeted acetylation of histone H4 tails is likely to be one of the major factors in the regulation of either cellular (24Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P.

A. 2000; 97: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) gene expression, we next analyzed whether the acetylation pattern of histone H4 at this locus can be modulated by the exogenous expression of Brm in these cells by using ChIP-PCR assay (Fig. 5). In brief, C33A cells transduced with either control virus or Brm virus were fixed by cross-linking with formaldehyde. Cells were isolated and lysed, and chromatin was sonicated to generate fragments with an average size of approximately 500 bp. Chromatin fragments were then immunoprecipitated with the antibody against tetra-acetylated histone H4 (pan-acetylated H4) or with antibodies specific for individually acetylated lysine residues (Lys-5, Lys-8, or Lys-12) of histone H4. After protein-DNA cross-links in the immunoprecipitates were reversed, DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 5′-LTR using a set of primers that do not detect the 3′-LTR (primers 1 and 2). By using the antibody against tetra-acetylated histone H4, no significant difference was detected between Brm expressing and non-expressing cells. By using antibodies of individually acetylated lysine residues, significant enhancement in acetylation on Lys-5 and Lys-8 was observed in Brm virus-transduced C33A, whereas acetylation on Lys-12 was not significantly modulated by the retrovirally induced Brmexpression. Considering the possibility that SWI/SNF complex counteracts the Pc-G protein complex to suppress gene silencing, we next examined whether recruitment of Pc-G protein complexes to the LTR is modulated by Brm-containing SWI/SNF complex. Among mammalian Pc-G, only YY1 is currently known to have specific DNA binding activity, and a YY1-binding site is present in the 5′-region of the MuLV-LTR (28Flanagan J.R. Becker K.G. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Driggers P.H. Levi B.Z. Appella E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) (Fig.5). By ChIP-PCR assay using the same cellular extracts described above, we examined whether the amount of YY1 in the 5′-LTR is reduced by the expression of Brm. In the immunoprecipitates with anti-YY1 antibody, there was a lower amount of 5′-LTR sequence in C33A cells transduced with Brm virus compared with C33A cells transduced with control virus. Because HDAC1 and HDAC2 have been reported to form large Pc-G protein complexes with YY1 (29Yang W.-M. Yao Y.-L. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seo E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 30van der Vlab J. Otte A.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 4: 474-478Crossref Scopus (443) Google Scholar), we next analyzed these two proteins in the 5′-LTR. In Brm virus-transduced C33A cells, the amounts of HDAC1 and HDAC2 were also reduced. Because the PCR product of the primer pair 1 + 2 does not include the YY1 recognition site, another primer pair 3 + 4 was used to cover the YY1 recognition site, although it cannot distinguish the 5′- and 3′-LTR. The results were similar to those obtained with the primer pair 1 + 2 (Fig. 5). The linker histone, histone H1, known to be associated with inactive chromatin, was also reduced by the introduction of Brm (Fig. 5). These data are consistent with the notion that when the provirus MuLV-LTR integrates into C33A cells, Pc-G protein complexes, including YY1, HDAC1, and HDAC2, are efficiently recruited to silence retroviral gene expression by deacetylating specific lysine residues in histone H4, and this suppressive effect can be efficiently counteracted by functional SWI/SNF complex. In the U3 region of the MuLV-LTR, there are binding sites for transcriptional factors such as C/EBP (31Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and c-Myc (32Cheng S.W. Davies K.P. Yung E. Yu R.J. Beltran J. Kalpana G.V. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), which are reported to recruit SWI/SNF complex. Therefore, we attempted to detect recruitment of SWI/SNF complex subfamily members to the LTR. For chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we used anti-BAF60a antibody to precipitate the SWI/SNF complex because BAF60a was reported to be present in both Brm-containing and BRG1-containing SWI/SNF complexes, and because similar levels of this protein were detected in both C33A cells transduced with control virus and with the Brm virus. We detected greater amounts of LTR sequence in immunoprecipitates of Brm virus-transduced C33A cells than in those from control virus-transduced cells. However, recovery of LTR sequences with anti-BAF60a was much lower than that with Pc-G protein complexes.2 This may be partly because the interaction between the SWI/SNF complex and DNA is not direct and is mediated through transcription factors. Human tumor cell lines deficient in Brm allow retrovirus vectors to enter, integrate, and initiate exogenous gene expression, yet rapid retroviral gene silencing is induced. The Brm-containing SWI/SNF subfamily inhibited recruitment of Pc-G complexes composed of YY1, HDAC1, and HDAC2 to the LTR region of the integrated provirus, leading to the enhancement of histone H4 acetylated on lysine 5 and lysine 8. Consistent with these findings, HDAC inhibitor treatment partially released the retroviral gene silencing observed in Brm-deficient cell lines. Although the biological significance of this phenomenon is not fully clear at this moment, the observation that Brm but not BRG1 is undetectable in mouse embryonic stem cells (33LeGouy E. Tompson E.M. Muchardt C. Renard J.-P. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 212: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) may provide a clue. Because retroviral gene expression is strongly suppressed by both DNA methylation-dependent and -independent pathways in mouse embryonic stem cells (6Cherry S.R. Biniszkiewicz D. van Parijs L. Baltimore D. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7419-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the lack ofBrm gene expression in this cell type contributes to gene silencing in a DNA methylation-independent manner. Gene silencing was observed as a reduction in the ratio of cells expressing exogenous genes in transduced cultures and not as a reduction in the average expression levels in the entire culture, showing that silencing occurs in a discontinuous and stochastic manner as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1B. In C33A and SW13 cells, the mosaic colony ratios were reduced when cells were to transduce with the LacZ virus at higher m.o.i. values,2suggesting that proviral copy number rather than cellular physiology determines the degree of transcriptional down-regulation. Therefore, we believe the variegated gene silencing observed here reflects drastic structural changes that occurred around the proviral LTR and that these structural changes are the all-or-none result of the opposing actions of trx-G and Pc-G protein complexes. Considering the fact that the retroviral gene silencing observed in Brm-deficient cell lines was efficiently suppressed by Brmintroduction (Fig. 3), it is worth pointing out that the silencing was not fully recovered by the treatment with the HDAC inhibitor, CHAP31 alone (Fig. 4). This might suggest the possibility that Brm have some additional biochemical roles other than counteracting HDAC activity as a component of SWI/SNF complex in the chromosome (Fig. 5). The search for such biochemical functions of Brm, an ATPase with a putative helicase motif, would be important. Retrovirus vectors have been designed recently to overcome chromosomal position effects (34Rivella S. Callegali J.A. May C. Tan C.W. Sadelain M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4679-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 35Emery D.W. Yannaki E. Tubb J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9150-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For example, the chicken hypersensitive site 4 of the chicken globin locus control region, which acts as an insulator, was cloned into MuLV-LTR. In some cell lines, the probability of integrated proviral gene expression increased, and the level of de novo methylation of the 5′-LTR in the cells decreased. Insulators are thought to protect adjacent DNA sequences from gene silencing induced by heterochromatin, which is associated with the products of the HP-1 gene family (36Eissenberg J.C. Elgin C.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2000; 10: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, this gene family does not usually overlap with Pc-G or trx-G. Moreover, Pc-G proteins, unlike the HP-1 family proteins, do not appear to favor areas in the nucleus where there are visible compactions of chromatin (37Buchenau P. Hodgson J. Strutt H. Arndt-Jovin D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the molecular mechanisms involving HP-1 family proteins and Pc-G proteins are different. Our finding that the counteraction between Pc-G protein complexes and trx-G protein complexes contributes to retroviral gene silencing is likely to provide information for designing new types of retrovirus vectors for long term expression.

We report that RalA GTPase, which is not ADP-ribosylated by C3, inhibits ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by C3 from C. botulinum (C3bot), Clostridium limosum (C3lim), and Bacillus cereus (C3cer) but not from Staphylococcus aureus (C3stau) in human platelet membranes and rat brain lysate. Inhibition by RalA occurs with the GDP- and guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-bound forms of RalA and is overcome by increasing concentrations of C3. A direct interaction of RalA with C3 was verified by precipitation of the transferase with GST-RalA-Sepharose. The affinity constant (K d) of the binding of RalA to C3lim was 12 nm as determined by fluorescence titration. RalA increased the NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot by about 5-fold. Although RalA had no effect on glucosylation of Rho GTPases by Clostridium difficile toxin B, C3bot and C3lim inhibited glucosylation of RalA by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin. Furthermore, C3bot decreased activation of phospholipase D by RalA. The data indicate that several C3 exoenzymes directly interact with RalA without ADP-ribosylating the GTPase. The interaction is of high affinity and interferes with essential functions of C3 and RalA. RhoA, -B, and -C are ADP-ribosylated and biologically inactivated by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme and related C3-like transferases. We report that RalA GTPase, which is not ADP-ribosylated by C3, inhibits ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by C3 from C. botulinum (C3bot), Clostridium limosum (C3lim), and Bacillus cereus (C3cer) but not from Staphylococcus aureus (C3stau) in human platelet membranes and rat brain lysate. Inhibition by RalA occurs with the GDP- and guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-bound forms of RalA and is overcome by increasing concentrations of C3. A direct interaction of RalA with C3 was verified by precipitation of the transferase with GST-RalA-Sepharose. The affinity constant (K d) of the binding of RalA to C3lim was 12 nm as determined by fluorescence titration. RalA increased the NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot by about 5-fold. Although RalA had no effect on glucosylation of Rho GTPases by Clostridium difficile toxin B, C3bot and C3lim inhibited glucosylation of RalA by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin. Furthermore, C3bot decreased activation of phospholipase D by RalA. The data indicate that several C3 exoenzymes directly interact with RalA without ADP-ribosylating the GTPase. The interaction is of high affinity and interferes with essential functions of C3 and RalA. Rho GTPases including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are pivotal regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and act as molecular switches in various signal transduction pathways (1.Hall A.

C3 and related C3-like transferases ADP-ribosylate RhoA at Asn-41 thereby inhibiting the biological activity of RhoA (15.Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J.

ADP-ribosylation by C. botulinum C3 (C3bot), by the related transferases fromClostridium limosum (C3lim), and Bacillus cereus(C3cer) appear to be highly specific for RhoA, -B, and -C. In vitro, Rac and Cdc42 are poorly or not at all modified by C3-like transferases (17.Just I. Mohr C. Schallehn G. Menard L. Didsbury J.R. Vandekerckhove J. van Damme J. Aktories K. J. Biol.

Moreover, there is no evidence that GTPases other than RhoA, -B, and -C are ADP-ribosylated by C3bot, C3lim, and C3cer in intact cells. Because C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation appears to be highly specific, these transferases are widely used as tools to elucidate the cellular functions of Rho GTPases. Recently, we identified a C3-related transferase (C3stau2) from Staphylococcus aureus that differs in substrate specificity from other C3-like transferases, because it additionally modifies RhoE/Rnd3 (4.Wilde C.

Ral proteins, which belong to the Ras subfamily of low molecular mass GTPases, occur in the two isoforms RalA and RalB, which are about 85% identical. RalA is more than 50% identical with Ras and shares about 33% sequence identity with RhoA. Ral has been implicated in control of cell proliferation and Ras-mediated cell transformation (18.Urano T.

Thus, it is tempting to speculate that both RalA and PLD1 may act in concert to modulate receptor endocytosis and vesicle transport. We report here that C3bot and C3lim directly interact with high affinity with RalA. This interaction inhibits glucosylation of RalA by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin that takes place in the switch I-region of the GTPase. Moreover, C3bot blocked the activation of phospholipase D by RalA, suggesting that the interaction of C3 exoenzymes with RalA has important functional consequences for signal processes mediated by the Ral GTPase. phospholipase D1 glutathione S-transferase phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate epidermal growth factor 1-palmitoyl-2-[3H]palmitoylglycerophosphocholine guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate phospholipase D1 glutathione S-transferase phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate epidermal growth factor 1-palmitoyl-2-[3H]palmitoylglycerophosphocholine guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate The ralA gene was cut from pTacRalA kindly provided by P.

The F169A mutant of C3bot was constructed using the Quick-Change kit (Stratagene, Germany) according the manufacturer's instructions. Human platelet membranes were prepared as described (34.Jakobs K.H. Lasch P. Minuth M. Aktories K. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2829-2833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1-Palmitoyl-2-[3H]palmitoyl-glycerophosphocholine ([3H]PtdCho, 37.5 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled PtdCho and TNM-FH insect medium were obtained from Sigma. PIP2 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. RalA (72 μm) was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 150 μl of a solution containing 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm GTPγS, or GDP and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). After adding 10 mmMgCl2, preloaded GTPases were added to the ADP-ribosylation reaction. ADP-ribosylation of Rho in human platelet lysate by C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme was performed as described (30.Aktories K. Rösener S. Blaschke U. Chhatwal G.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For ADP-ribosylation of Rho in rat brain lysate, 60 μg of total protein were incubated with 10 nm C3bot or as indicated in a solution containing 0.3 μm[adenylate-32P]NAD, 2 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of the indicated recombinant GTPases. ADP-ribosylation assays for C3lim, C3cer, and C3stau2 were performed essentially as described (35.Aktories K. Just I. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and further analyzed by PhosphorImaging. For detection of NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot or C3stau2, toxins were incubated with 200 μm [adenylate-32P]NAD, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 2 mm MgCl2 and different amounts of the indicated GTPases for up to 2 h at 37 °C. Aliquots (5 μl) of the reaction mixture were analyzed by TLC (Silica Gel 60F254, Merck) with 66% 2-propanol and 0.33% ammonium sulfate. The amount of formed [32P]ADP-ribose was calculated from PhosphorImager data. For glucosylation by C. difficile toxin B rat brain lysate (60 μg of total protein) was incubated with increasing concentrations of toxin B in 25 μl of a solution containing 20 μmUDP-[14C]glucose, 100 mm KCl, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 5 μg of RalA (8.3 μm) or 5 μg of bovine serum albumin for 20 min at 37 °C. For glucosylation by C. sordellii lethal toxin, rat brain lysates (60 μg of total protein) were incubated with lethal toxin (250 ng) in 25 μl of a solution containing 10 μmUDP-[14C]glucose, 100 mm KCl, 200 μm MnCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of C3lim for 20 min at 37 °C (31.Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Aktories K. Bacterial Toxins: Tools in Cell Biology and Pharmacology. Chapman & Hall, Weinheim1997: 59-68Google Scholar). PhosphorImager data of the SDS-PAGE are shown. GST-RalA or GST-Rho immobilized to Sepharose beads (1 μg each GTPase) or GST-Sepharose beads as control were incubated with 300 ng of wild-type C3bot or C3bot F169A in a buffer containing 2 mmMgCl2, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (total volume 100 μl) for 45 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, beads were washed three times with the same buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-C3bot antibody. Detection was performed by using ECL. The affinity of the binding of RalA to C3 from C. limosum was measured by fluorescence titration according to Ref. 36.Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, using the tryptophan fluorescence of RalA as readout. The fluorescence of RalA, excited at 290 nm and monitored at 348 nm, decreased significantly after addition of C3. The tryptophan-deficient mutant C3lim W18L was used to minimize the background fluorescence. After the binding is saturated, the fluorescence increases linearly with further addition of C3lim W18L due to the fluorescence of the remaining aromatic residues like tyrosine residues. This linear increase was also measured in the control titration of C3lim W18L to a buffer solution without RalA. The resulting straight line was subtracted from the upper data set in Fig. 6. The subtracted data (lower data set) were fitted according to Equation 1. The upper data set can also be fitted using Equation 1 plus a linear slope. f=Imax−(Imax−Imin)·(0.5·(a+x+Kd)−Equation 1 sqrt(0.25·(a+x+Kd) 2−a·x))where Imax is the maximal fluorescence value; Imin is the minimal fluorescence value; a is the concentration of RalA; x is the concentration of C3lim W18L; and K d is the dissociation constant. Recombinant PLD1 activity was measured in the presence of [3H]PtdCho mixed with PIP2(molar ratio of 8:1) as described previously (29.Schmidt M. Voβ M. Weernink P.A. Wetzel J. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with some modifying cations. In brief, recombinant PLD1 activity (20 μg of protein) was determined with [3H]PtdCho/PIP2 (200 μm/25 μm) as substrate vesicles in the presence or absence of Gpp(NH)p-loaded RalA (8 nm) for 60 min at 37 °C. To measure the effect of C3 transferase, RalA and C3 transferase were preincubated for 5 min at 30 °C at a molar ratio of 1:2. Stopping the reaction and isolating the specific PLD product, [3H]phosphatidylethanl, were as described before (28.Schmidt M. Voβ M. Thiel M. Bauer B. Grannass A. Tapp E. Cool R.H. De Gunzburg J. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7413-7422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Addition of recombinant RalA to human platelet lysates blocked the ADP-ribosylation of Rho by C. botulinum exoenzyme C3 (C3bot). The inhibition by RalA was concentration-dependent and depended on the native structure of the protein, because heat inactivation of RalA (5 min, 95 °C) abolished the effect completely (Fig. 1 A). Fig. 1 C shows the influence of RalA on the time course of the ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by C3bot. Time to inhibition of the ADP-ribosylation of Rho was identical independently whether RalA was present at the start of the reaction or was added during the ADP-ribosylation reaction, suggesting an immediate effect. Several C3 isoforms produced by different bacteria have been described (37.Wilde C. Aktories K. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1647-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the effects of RalA on the ADP-ribosylation of Rho catalyzed by C3-like transferases fromC. botulinum (C3bot), C. limosum (C3lim),B. cereus (C3cer), and S. aureus (C3stau2) in rat brain lysate. Whereas RalA inhibited C3bot-induced ADP-ribosylation by about 90%, ADP-ribosylation by C3lim and C3cer was reduced by 63 and 24%, respectively. By contrast, RalA did not inhibit the ADP-ribosylation of Rho by transferase C3stau2 (Fig. 2). Similar to the observed inhibition of ADP-ribosylation in cell lysate, ADP-ribosylation of recombinant RhoA by C3bot, C3lim, and C3cer was also inhibited by RalA, whereas C3stau-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was not altered by RalA (data not shown).Figure 2Influence of ADP-ribosylation of RhoA in rat brain lysate by C3-like transferases. Rat brain lysates (about 60 μg of total protein) were incubated with the ADP-ribosyltransferases from C. botulinum (C3bot), C. limosum (C3lim),B. cereus (C3cer), or S. aureus (C3stau2) (10 nm each) in the presence (+) or absence (−) of RalA (1.8 μm). Radiolabeled probes were resolved and subjected to SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImaging. ADP-ribosylation is given in % of the maximal incorporation of radiolabel in the absence RalA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ral belongs to the Ras subfamily of GTPases (38.Chardin P. Tavitian A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether other members of this protein family (e.g. Ras and Rap) were capable of inhibiting the C3bot-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of RhoA. As shown in Fig. 3 A, neither Ras (∼1.8 μm) nor Rap (∼1.8 μm) affected C3bot (10 nm)-induced ADP-ribosylation, whereas RalA (∼1.8 μm) blocked labeling of Rho. Also Rac1 and Cdc42 (each ∼1.8 μm) did not inhibit ADP-ribosylation of Rho. Nucleotide binding causes major conformational changes of low molecular mass GTPases. Therefore, we studied whether the RalA-induced inhibition of the C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation depended on the nucleotide-bound state of RalA. To this end, RalA was loaded with GDP or GTPγS before starting the ADP-ribosylation reaction. Fig. 3 B shows that inhibition of the C3bot-catalyzed ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was detected with GDP- and GTPγS-loaded RalA, indicating no major effects of the nucleotide-binding state. To test whether increasing concentration of C3 could overcome the effect of RalA, we studied the ADP-ribosylation of Rho in rat brain lysate without and with 1 μm RalA in the presence of increasing concentrations (10–500 nm) of C3. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the inhibiting effect of RalA depended on the concentrations of C3bot and was overcome by high concentrations of the transferase. Like other bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases C3-like exoenzymes possess NAD glycohydrolase activity (37.Wilde C. Aktories K. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1647-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We studied whether RalA inhibited not only the transferase but also the NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot. Surprisingly, addition of RalA did not inhibit but rather increased NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, the NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3stau2 was not affect by RalA. Also the stimulating effect of RalA on NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot was specific, because Ras protein did not affect the activity of C3bot (Fig. 4 B). Next, we wanted to know whether C3bot directly interacts with RalA to sequester the transferase. For this purpose a precipitation assay with GST-RalA-Sepharose beads was performed. Fig. 5 A shows that GST-RalA-Sepharose beads effectively precipitated C3bot, indicating a direct interaction of RalA with C3bot. Furthermore, we tested whether the presence of NAD did affect the precipitation of C3bot by GST-RalA. Apparently, NAD reduced the affinity of C3bot to RhoA, whereas the precipitation of C3bot by RalA immobilized to GST beads was not altered (Fig. 5 A). Recently, Han and co-workers (39.Han S. Arvai A.S. Clancy S.B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) described a novel ADP-ribosylating toxin-turn-turn motif (ARTT motif) in the crystal structure of C3bot, and they proposed that this motif is involved in the recognition of RhoA. Therefore, we addressed the question whether the ARTT motif is also involved in the recognition of RalA. We changed Phe-169 (note: Phe-169 of C3bot is termed Phe-209 in the report by Han et al. (39.Han S. Arvai A.S. Clancy S.B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)) in C3bot to alanine. Phe-169 is located in the ARTT motif and is suggested to play a major role in RhoA recognition. As shown in Fig. 5 B, GST-RhoA-Sepharose beads precipitated wild-type C3bot but were unable to precipitate the F169AC3bot mutant. By contrast, GST-RalA-Sepharose beads efficiently precipitated wild-type and mutant C3bot, suggesting that in contrast to enzyme-substrate binding, the ARTT motif is not involved in binding of RalA to C3bot. To get quantitative data on the affinity of the interaction of C3 with RalA, we applied fluorescence titration and utilized quenching of the protein fluorescence of RalA by interaction with C3. For these studies W18LC3lim, which has wild-type enzyme activity (not shown), was employed. This mutant has no tryptophan residue and, therefore, minimal protein fluorescence. The data are exhibited in Fig. 6. Addition of W18LC3lim at low concentrations caused reduction of RalA protein fluorescence caused by quenching. Addition of W18LC3lim at high concentrations to RalA resulted in an increase in the protein fluorescence again. This increase in total protein fluorescence was caused by residual protein fluorescence of the mutant C3lim. Therefore, we subtracted the residual protein fluorescence of C3lim from the total fluorescence to get the specific quenching effect. The best fit for the fluorescence quenching data was obtained with a K d value of 12 nm, indicating a high affinity interaction between RalA and C3lim. Rho GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are glucosylated byC. difficile toxin B (6.Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K.

To test the specificity of the effect of RalA on modification of Rho, we studied whether RalA also affected glucosylation of Rho GTPases by toxin B in rat brain lysate. As shown in Fig. 7, addition of RalA neither altered glucosylation of Rho (upper band on SDS-PAGE) nor of Rac/Cdc42 (lower band on SDS-PAGE) by toxin B. These findings indicated that the inhibiting effect of RalA is restricted to C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Rho. To address the question whether the interaction of RalA and C3 has any consequences for the biochemical and/or biological properties of Ral, we used C. sordellii lethal toxin. In addition to Rac, lethal toxin also glucosylates Ras proteins, including Rap and Ral (40.Genth H. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Rex G. Aktories K. Just I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To study whether C3 affects the ability of RalA to serve as a substrate for lethal toxin, we glucosylated RalA in rat brain lysate in the presence of C3lim and C3bot, respectively. In rat brain lysate, lethal toxin radiolabels at least two major bands in the presence of UDP-[14C]glucose. Recently, we showed that the upper band belongs the glucosylation of Ral, whereas the lower band mainly represents the modification of Rac (Cdc42) and Ras (41.Hofmann F. Rex G. Aktories K. Just I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42.Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Green G.A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10149-10153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). C3lim (Fig. 8 A) blocked lethal toxin-catalyzed glucosylation of RalA (upper band). The same was observed in the presence of C3bot (not shown). By contrast, glucosylation of Rac/Cdc42/Ras (lower bands) by lethal toxin was not affected by addition of C3 isoforms, underlining the specificity of the interaction of C3lim and C3bot with RalA. Moreover, these findings suggested that C3lim and C3bot interact with RalA in a region essential for the interaction of RalA with C. sordellii lethal toxin. It has been reported that RalA is able to activate PLD1 (24.Jiang H. Luo J.-Q. Urano T. Frankel P. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied whether C3 has any effect on stimulation of PLD1 by RalA. For this purpose, RalA preloaded with Gpp(NH)p was incubated in the absence and presence of C3bot, which was added at a molar ratio of C3:RalA = 2:1, for 5 min at 30 °C. Thereafter, PLD activity was determined for 60 min at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 9, RalA increased PLD1 activity by about 100%. This increase in enzyme activity was completely prevented after pretreatment of RalA with C3bot, indicating that the binding of C3 to RalA blocks its capacity to stimulate PLD1. C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases are potential virulence factors of various bacteria, including Clostridia, B. cereus, and S. aureus. With the exception of C3stau2 from S. aureus that was shown to modify RhoE/Rnd3 (4.Wilde C. Chhatwal G.S. Schmalzing G. Aktories K. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9537-9542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), C3 from C. botulinum (C3bot), C. limosum (C3lim) andB. cereus (C3cer) appear to ADP-ribosylate only RhoA, -B, and -C but not other GTPases (37.Wilde C. Aktories K. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1647-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This high specificity is important for their use as tools to study Rho functions in eukaryotic signaling. Our data indicate that C3 transferases directly interact with RalA. Interaction was detected with C3bot, C3lim, and C3cer but not with C3stau2. The RalA-C3 interaction caused inhibition of the ADP-ribosylation of RhoA. Inhibition of C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation occurred with Rho in cell lysate and with recombinant RhoA. Ral itself was not ADP-ribosylated by the C3 transferases; however, the precipitation and fluorescence quenching studies indicated that the interaction is of high affinity (K d 12 nm for C3lim). RalA did not inhibit the NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot but caused an approximately 5-fold increase in NAD hydrolase activity. We recently observed a similar but modest increase in NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot with RhoA mutants, which are not substrates for ADP-ribosylation, because they lack the acceptor amino acid Asn-41 (43.Wilde C. Genth H. Aktories K. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16478-16483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We propose that binding of RalA favors a conformation of C3 that facilitates the cleavage of NAD. Inhibition of C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was not observed with Ras and Rap, indicating a Ral-specific effect that is not shared by other Ras subfamily proteins. The finding that both GDP- and GTPγS-bound RalA inhibited C3 ADP-ribosylation suggests that conformational changes caused by nucleotide binding are not essential for the interaction of RalA with C3 transferases. It has been shown that C3 modifies Rho at the acceptor amino acid asparagine 41 (16). RalA contains a serine residue at the equivalent position (serine 50) and is therefore not a substrate for the transferase. Recently, we characterized the structural requirements of the ADP-ribosylation of RhoA in detail, and we identified several amino acid residues pivotal for modification of Rho by C3 (43.Wilde C. Genth H. Aktories K. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16478-16483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We changed several of the equivalent amino acids of RalA to that of RhoA. However, none of these changes resulted in a labeling of S50N-RalA (data not shown). The finding suggests that either C3 binds differently to Ral as compared with Rho or additional amino acid residues not present in Ral are required for ADP-ribosylation. Recently, Han and co-workers (39.Han S. Arvai A.S. Clancy S.B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) analyzed the crystal structure of C3 and described a motif termed ADP-ribosylating toxin turn-turn motif (ARTT motif), which was suggested to be essentially involved in substrate recognition by C3. These authors proposed that Phe-169 (Phe-209 in the nomenclature of Han et al. (39.Han S. Arvai A.S. Clancy S.B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)) is responsible for the affinity of C3 to its substrate RhoA. We changed Phe-169 of C3bot to alanine. The mutant of C3bot was not able to ADP-ribosylate RhoA (not shown) and exhibited a significant reduction in the interaction with RhoA as analyzed by a precipitation assay. However, the interaction of F169AC3bot with Ral was not changed, suggesting that a different or additional region of C3 is responsible for the interaction with RalA. The interaction of RalA with C3 did not only cause sequestration of the transferase to inhibit modification of RhoA but also affected the functional properties of RalA. RalA is a substrate for glucosylation by C. sordellii lethal toxin, which modifies Rac (possibly Cdc42) and Ras proteins including Ral (40.Genth H. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Rex G. Aktories K. Just I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,42.Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Green G.A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10149-10153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Binding of C3 inhibited the ability of RalA to serve as a substrate for glucosylation. In Ras, C. sordellii lethal toxin glucosylates Thr-35 that is located in the switch-I region of the protein and blocks the interaction with Ras effectors (44.Herrmann C. Ahmadian M.R. Hofmann F. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16134-16139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The equivalent amino acid residue in RalA is Thr-46. Thus, interaction of C3 with RalA, which caused inhibition of glucosylation, most likely occurs in the same region of RalA and, therefore, may affect cellular actions of the GTPase. So far, cellular functions of Ral are still largely enigmatic (45.Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Evidence has been presented that Ral is activated by Ras via Ral-guanine nucleotide exchange factors by a signal pathway parallel to the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and may be involved in transformation to act downstream of Ras (18.Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 19.Feig L.A. Urano T. Cantor S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 46.Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Frankel P. Farias E.F. Lu Z. Jiang H. Olsen A. Feig L.A. de Kier Joffe E.B. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4718-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). RalA is suggested to be involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. For example, dominant negative RalA blocks filopodia formation induced by Cdc42 (21.Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). A cross-talk between Ral and Rho subfamily GTPases is also suggested, because the Ral effector RalBP1 (also termed RLIP1 or Rip1) acts as a GTPase-activating protein for Cdc42 and Rac at least in vitro (19.Feig L.A. Urano T. Cantor S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 22.Jullien-Flores V. Dorseuil O. Romero F. Letourneur F. Saragosti S. Berger R.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2349-2355PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, some of these functions may be affected by C3 binding. PLD is one of the best established effectors of RalA (24.Jiang H. Luo J.-Q. Urano T. Frankel P. Lu Z. Foster D.A. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 28.Schmidt M. Voβ M. Thiel M. Bauer B. Grannass A. Tapp E. Cool R.H. De Gunzburg J.

Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Feig L.A. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The activity of PLD1 is increased by direct binding to RalA (48.Kim J.H. Lee S.D. Han J.M. Lee T.G. Kim Y. Park J.B. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed that C3 inhibited the stimulation of PLD1 by RalA supporting our hypothesis that the interaction of Ral and C3 is of functional importance. Notably, some effects of C3 on eukaryotic target cells are not simply explained by ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of Rho. For example, it was reported that C3 activates the stress signaling pathways of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 (49.Beltman J. Erickson J.R. Martin G.A. Lyons J.F. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3772-3780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, C3 was shown to inhibit the activation of the serum-responsive element by EGF. However, this EGF signal pathway is suggested to be independent of Rho (49.Beltman J. Erickson J.R. Martin G.A. Lyons J.F. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3772-3780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As it has been shown recently that PLD and RalA cooperate with the EGF receptor to transform 3Y1 rat fibroblasts (50.Lu Z. Hornia A. Joseph T. Sukezane T. Frankel P. Zhong M. Bychenok S. Xu L. Feig L.A. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), modulation of EGF receptor signaling might be the functional link between C3, RalA, and PLD1, and this hypothesis will be addressed in future studies. Our findings indicate, however, that C3 exhibits potent effects on regulatory GTPases without ADP-ribosylation. This activity of C3 has to be considered when using C3bot as a tool to study Rho signaling, especially when high concentrations of C3bot are applied in microinjection studies."
https://openalex.org/W2012346824,"Chemical cross-linking as a probe of conformation has consistently shown that activators, including Ca2+ ions, of the (αβγδ)4phosphorylase kinase holoenzyme (PhK) alter the interactions between its regulatory α and catalytic γ subunits. The γ subunit is also known to interact with the δ subunit, an endogenous molecule of calmodulin that mediates the activation of PhK by Ca2+ions. In this study, we have used two-hybrid screening and chemical cross-linking to dissect the regulatory quaternary interactions involving these subunits. The yeast two-hybrid system indicated that regions near the C termini of the γ (residues 343–386) and α (residues 1060–1237) subunits interact. The association of this region of α with γ was corroborated by the isolation of a cross-linked fragment of α containing residues 1015–1237 from an α−γ dimer that had been formed within the PhK holoenzyme by formaldehyde, a nearly zero-length cross-linker. Because the region of γ that we found to interact with α has previously been shown to contain a high affinity binding site for calmodulin (Dasgupta, M., Honeycutt, T., and Blumenthal, D. K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17156–17163), we tested the influence of Ca2+ on the conformation of the α subunit and found that the region of α that interacts with γ was, in fact, perturbed by Ca2+. The results herein support the existence of a Ca2+-sensitive communication network among the δ, γ, and α subunits, with the regulatory domain of γ being the primary mediator. The similarity of such a Ca2+-dependent network to the interactions among troponin C, troponin I, and actin is discussed in light of the known structural and functional similarities between troponin I and the γ subunit of PhK."

Roseman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 108-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Among the family Vibrionaceae, Vibrio cholerae is one of the most important with respect to human health and disease. It is a Gram-negative marine bacterium and a human intestinal pathogen that resides in both brackish water and seawater. In the marine environment,V. cholerae is closely associated with copepods, microscopic crustacea that comprise the most abundant animals on earth. Seasonal blooms in the copepod population in inhabited regions, such as the Ganges delta, coincide with blooms in the chitinivorous V. cholerae and outbreaks of cholera in the human residents (2Nalin D.R. Lancet. 1976; 2: 958Abstract PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The bacteria are said to be protected against stomach acids, the major barrier against human infection, by “burrowing” into the copepod cuticles (3Nalin D.R. Daya V. Reid A. Levine M.M. Cisneros L. Infect. Immun. 1979; 25: 768-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although we have acquired a significant body of information on the chitin catabolic cascade in the bacterium V. furnissii, little is known concerning the pathway in V. cholerae. The complete DNA sequence of the V. cholerae genome has recently been reported (4Heidelberg J.F. Eisen J.A. Nelson W.C. Clayton R.A. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D.

Nature. 2000; 406: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar) and, as we shall show elsewhere, there is a high degree of identity in the predicted amino acid sequences of the proteins we have identified in V. furnissii and their presumptive counterparts in V. cholerae. A number of genes identified previously in V. furnissii appeared to be clustered in the genome of V. cholerae, and since they may constitute a chitin degradation operon, we are currently attempting to identify the functions of the other presumptive genes by subcloning them into Escherichia coli, expressing the proteins, and determining their functions. As shown under “Experimental Procedures,” we have cloned a gene, designated gspK (0.8 kb), encoding a glucosamine-specific kinase, GspK (31.6 kDa), from the chromosomal DNA of V. cholerae. Furthermore, analysis of the nucleotide sequence ofgspK and its putative amino acid sequence indicated that the predicted amino acid sequences of GspK from V. cholerae are 100% identical to a hitherto unrecognized gene in V. furnissii. Although the ubiquitous enzyme, hexokinase, phosphorylates many sugars, including glucosamine and mannosamine (5Jourdian G.W. Roseman S. Biochemical Preparations. 1962; 9: 44-47Google Scholar), and although a GlcNAc-specific ATP-dependent kinase (6Asensio C. Ruiz-Amil M.

Ruppender H. Mackinnon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was partially fractionated, and the kinase activity for GlcN was separated from that for Glc. However, no other sugars were assayed with the GlcN active fraction. The following chemicals, reagents, and materials were purchased from the indicated sources: ADP, ATP, P-enolpyruvate,2 NADH, Glc, Fru, Man, Gal, GlcN, GlcNAc, mannosamine (ManN), galactosamine (GalN), and other carbohydrates from Sigma unless otherwise indicated; chitosan oligosaccharides (GlcN)n, n = 1–3, and chitin oligosaccharides (GlcNAc)n, n = 1–2, from Seikagaku America, Inc.

Reagents for molecular biology were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Stratagene, and U. S. Biochemical Corp.

BothVibrios were grown either in high salt LB (LMB, Luria broth supplemented with an additional 10 g of NaCl/liter) or in minimal media 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50% artificial seawater, 0.2% NH4Cl, 0.01% K2HPO4, and 0.5% dl-lactate (7Yu B.L.

Typically,E. coli strains were grown overnight in LB media plus appropriate antibiotics with vigorous shaking. Fresh medium was inoculated with cells from the overnight culture at a 1:20 dilution, and this culture was grown to mid-exponential phase, usually to a density of OD660 = 0.3–0.4 at 37 °C with vigorous aeration. DNA preparations, restriction enzyme digests, ligation, and transformations were performed using standard techniques (8Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1–3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). The glucosamine-specific kinase gene, gspK, located at VC0614 in the V. cholerae genome was amplified by PCR using synthesized primers based on the gene sequence of the chromosomal DNA of V. cholerae. The 5′ PCR primer was designed to contain anNdeI restriction site to facilitate cloning into the start site following a T7 promoter in the overexpression vector pET21a (Novagen, Madison, WI). The primers used to construct the overexpression plasmid were: 5′-AGAAAACATATGCTGTTACTGACCAA-3′ and 5′-GCAAAGCTTATTCGATAACTCAT-3′. The amplified PCR fragment (2.5 kb) contained both the bglA gene (β-1,4-d-glucosidase, 1.7 kb) to be described elsewhere and the gspK gene (0.8 kb). The PCR fragment was transferred into the NdeI (5′ end) and HindIII (3′ end) of pET21a. The 2.5-kb PCR fragment contains BamHI andHindIII restriction enzyme sites, between which is the DNA sequence for the entire gspK (0.8 kb) gene. The fragment was isolated, ligated into pET21a, and transformed into the T7 polymerase-inducible host strain BL21(DE3). Transcription in BL21(DE3) is under control of the T7 promoter. The translation start site for the gene is 79 bp downstream from the BamHI restriction site. Control cells consisted of wild type E. coli and of the same strain transformed with the vector pET21a without the DNA insert. Extracts of the controls exhibited no GspK activity. Protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. A single colony of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring pET:gspK was inoculated into 100 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. Two liters of LB medium supplemented with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) in a 6-liter flask was inoculated with 50 ml of the overnight culture and allowed to grow at 37 °C with aeration until OD600 = 0.3–0.4. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. The cell pellet (4.1 g) was washed twice with 800 ml of 20 mm Tris chloride buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and resuspended in 35 ml of 20 mm Tris chloride buffer with 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. The cells were disrupted by two passages through a Wabash French pressure cell. Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h. Nucleic acids were precipitated using streptomycin sulfate (160 μl of 10% stock solution/ml of crude extract), added dropwise with stirring. The mixture was stirred for an additional 1 h and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Proteins in the streptomycin sulfate-treated supernatant (40 ml) were precipitated by the dropwise addition of saturated ammonium sulfate solution to a final concentration of 55%. The solution was stirred for an additional 1 h and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 50 mmNaCl, pH 7.0, and dialyzed against the same buffer. The 55% ammonium sulfate fraction was transferred to a 200-ml DEAE-Sepharose fast-flow column equilibrated with the phosphate/NaCl buffer in Step 3. After the sample was applied, the column was washed with 2.5 volumes (500 ml) of buffer, and a linear gradient (800 ml) from 50 mm NaCl to 1.0 m NaCl in the 20 mm phosphate buffer was applied. The activity eluted between 0.6 and 0.7 m NaCl; the active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mmTris chloride buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl. The pooled sample from Step 4 was transferred to an immobilized metal affinity (15-ml bed volume) column (Amersham Biosciences), which was pretreated with 0.2 mZnCl2. The column was washed with 10 volumes of water, treated with 20 mm Tris chloride buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl. The sample was then applied, and the column was washed with 2 bed volumes of the same buffer and eluted with a gradient from 0 to 0.1 m imidazole in the same buffer. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed first against 20 mm Tris chloride buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA and then against the same buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol without EDTA. The active pooled fractions from Step 5 were transferred to a Q-Sepharose column (15-ml bed volume), which had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris chloride buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl. After sample loading, the column was washed with 3 volumes (45 ml) of the same buffer, and a gradient (160 ml) from 50 mm NaCl to 1.0m NaCl was applied to elute the column. The activity eluted between 0.2 and 0.3 m NaCl. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris chloride buffer, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Purity was monitored throughout the fractionation by SDS-PAGE. The purified preparation was stored in small aliquots with dithiothreitol (1.0 mm final concentration) at −20 or −80 °C until used for further study. In the absence of dithiothreitol, insoluble aggregates were occasionally observed. Several methods have been used in this laboratory for measuring the rate of sugar-P synthesized by specific kinases and ATP, or, by the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system. These include the use of [γ-32P]ATP or [32P]P-enolpyruvate or 3H- or14C-labeled sugar. The labeled hexose-P is separated from the labeled substrates by paper electrophoresis or TLC or small ion-exchange columns. In the present studies, we elected to measure ADP instead by a spectrophotometric two-step assay because of the availability, stability, and sensitivity of a Cary Bio 100 Varian spectrophotometer kindly made available for our use by Dr. Ernesto Freire of this department. This type of assay has been used frequently for measuring sugar kinase activities. In the first step, GlcN, ATP, and Mg2+ were incubated with the enzyme, and the reaction was stopped by heating. In the second step, the quantity of ADP produced by the kinase was determined with P-enolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, NADH, and lactate dehydrogenase. GlcN was omitted from controls to correct for any ADP formed from contaminating enzymes, such as ATPase. Protein fractions to be assayed were added to the following (final volume, 100 μl): 25 mm Tris chloride buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmATP, 5 mm GlcN, HCl, or other potential sugar substrates. The enzyme reaction was initiated by the addition of the protein fraction to be assayed or of 0.1 μg of the purified enzyme (unless otherwise specified). Incubations were conducted at 25 or 37 °C, depending on the activity, for 0–10 min. When apparently inactive substrates were tested, incubations were conducted overnight at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by boiling for 2 min at 100 °C. The quantity of ADP formed in the kinase reaction was measured by determining either (a) the total quantity of NADH oxidized in the coupled assay or (b) the initial rate of NADH oxidation, which was found to be directly proportional to [ADP]. Step II was conducted at 37 °C in jacketed cell holders. Typically, a 10-μl aliquot from Step I was added to 1 ml containing the following mixture: 25 mm Tris chloride buffer, 0.1m KCl, pH 7.6, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm P-enolpyruvate, 0.15 mm NADH. The reaction was started by adding 0.5 units each of the coupling enzymes, pyruvate kinase and lactic acid dehydrogenase, and the absorbance was measured continuously for 10–15 min or until no change was observed. The initial absorbance at 340 nm was about 0.93. No change in absorbance was observed with boiled enzyme as the negative control or by omission of either of the coupling enzymes. In the alternate and preferred method, the initial rate of NADH oxidation was measured by determining the slope of the line, i.e. the decrease in initial absorbance as a function of time. Although this function is curvilinear over the course of the complete oxidation (10–15 min), the initial rate of oxidation is virtually linear, and a computer linked to the spectrophotometer was used to determine the slopes of these lines. The slopes were found to be proportional to the quantity of ADP in the reaction mixture in the range of 10–100 nmol per incubation. ADP formation was also proportional to incubation time and the quantity of protein used in the first step of the assay (see Fig. 2a) and was glucosamine-dependent. That is, the formation of ADP in the absence of glucosamine was negligible relative to ADP formed in the complete kinase reaction mixture, even when crude extracts were assayed, probably because the kinase constitutes about 5% of the total protein when it is overexpressed. The N-terminal amino acid residues of purified recombinant enzyme glucosamine-specific kinase GspK were determined by Dr. Robert Cole using an Applied Biosystems 475A protein sequencer (Amino Acid Sequencing Facility, Department of Biological Chemistry, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine). These parameters were studied with the purified enzyme at 37 °C to determine the optimal conditions for kinetic characterization. Typically, a substrate concentration of 5 mm glucosamine/HCl (GlcN) was used. The following buffer systems were used for the pH studies: sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.0–6.5; imidazole buffer, pH 6.5–7.7; Tris chloride buffer, pH 7.0–9.0; TAPS buffer, pH 7.7–9.0; and glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 8.5–10.0. Where possible, overlapping pH ranges were used with different buffers. The effect of ionic strength on enzyme activity was determined using 25 mm Tris chloride buffer, pH 7.0, supplemented with 0–0.5 m NaCl or KCl. Two types of temperature studies were conducted: (a) The temperatures of the incubation mixtures were varied between 4 and 60 °C. (b) The thermal stability of the enzyme was measured over the temperature range from 4 to 65 °C using the purified enzyme (0.1–0.5 μg) in 25 μl of 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, incubating at the desired temperature for 30 min, cooling to room temperature, and then initiating reactions by adding the substrates. Enzyme activity was determined as described above. Glucosamine-phosphate (GlcN-P) was purified by ion-exchange column chromatography as described (5Jourdian G.W. Roseman S. Biochemical Preparations. 1962; 9: 44-47Google Scholar). Typically, the following materials (in millimoles) are dissolved in 100 ml of distilled water: d-glucosamine/HCl (5.0), ATP (10.0), and MgCl2 (5.0). The solution was adjusted to pH 7.5 with 0.5n potassium hydroxide, and the reaction was initiated by adding 600 μg of purified kinase. The pH was maintained at 7.5 during the incubation (2 h at 37 °C) by the addition of potassium hydroxide and was stopped by heating to 100 °C for 2 min. Denatured protein was removed by centrifugation, and the mixture was adjusted to pH 2.0 with hydrochloric acid and passed through a column containing 500 ml of Dowex 50 (hydrogen form), 200–400 mesh. The major anionic components (Cl−, ADP, and ATP) passed through the column immediately, whereas the glucosamine phosphate was weakly retained. The column was eluted with water, and fractions were collected and analyzed. Samples of purified sugar phosphate were kindly analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectroscopy in both the negative and positive modes by Dr. Robert Cole, Mass Spectrometry Facility of The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions.1H NMR spectra were obtained with a 300-MHZBrucker Analytic Spectrometer with the sample in D2O. We have reported cloning a periplasmic β-N-acetylhexosaminidase gene (exoI) (9Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33425-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and anN, N′-diacetylchitobiose phosphorylase gene chbP(10Park J.K. Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33077-33083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from V. furnissii. Both exoI andchbP are critical in the chitin degradation cascade. Sequence analysis of the cloned exoI from V. furnissii suggested that there were two putative open reading frames (0.8 and 1.7 kb) upstream of the gene. Since many of the chitin catabolic genes that we have cloned from V. furnissii are also present in the genome of V. cholerae, subsequent studies on the two open reading frames, now designated gspK(0.83 kb) and bglA (1.7 kb), were conducted with V. cholerae. The characterization of bglA will be described elsewhere. In the studies reported here, gspK(glucosamine-specifickinase) was molecularly cloned from V. choleraeE1 Tor N16961 into pET21a, and the protein was successfully expressed and purified. The enzyme was purified about 21-fold (TableI) from crude extracts of E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pET:gspK as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The final product was an apparently homogenous protein (Fig. 1), which migrated at ∼30 kDa relative to the markers. The N-terminal sequence of the final preparation was: Met-Asn-Tyr-Tyr-Val-Gly-Ile-Asp-Gly-Gly-Gly-Thr. This sequence is identical to the N-terminal amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence. The DNA sequence of the gene predicts that the protein, GspK, is 31.6 kDa and contains 294 amino acids.Table IPurification of recombinant glucosamine-specific kinaseStepTotal proteinTotal activity1-aOne unit of enzyme produces 1 μmol ADP/min under the following conditions: 25 °C, 25 mm Tris chloride buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm glucosamine/HCl.Specific activity1-bSpecific activity indicates μmol/mg/min.

Open table in a new tab Enzyme activity was determined as a function of pH, ionic strength, temperature, and other parameters as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In collecting the following results, shown in Fig. 2, assays were conducted so that product formation was proportional to protein concentration and time of incubation. The pH optimum of the purified enzyme was between pH 7.5–8.5. At the pH optimum, enzyme activity was measured as a function of ionic strength with 0–0.5 m NaCl and KCl. There was only a small effect of salts on the enzyme, the activity being inhibited 11–14% at 0.5 m salt concentrations. Purified GspK displayed a temperature optimum from 40–42 °C. However, the enzyme is not very stable to heat. When incubated for 0.5 h in the temperature range 4–30 °C, it retained full activity, and it retained at least 91% of its activity at 37 °C. At 65 °C, it lost 100% of its activity. It should be noted, however, that these temperature stability studies were conducted at low enzyme concentrations, and activity may conceivably have been retained at higher concentrations or in the presence of stabilizing substances, such as albumin and the enzyme substrates. The effects of each substrate concentration on enzymatic activity were systematically investigated. Fig. 3 shows the rate versus substrate concentration of glucosamine, ATP, and Mg2+. The kinetic parameters (Km andVmax) of ATP and Mg2+ (Fig. 3,A and C) and glucosamine (Fig. 3, Band C) were calculated from Woolf-Augustinsson-Hofstee (νversus ν/[S]) plots (11Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 236-264Google Scholar), and were found to be: glucosamine, Km = 0.48 mm,Vmax = 196 nmol/min/μg (or 6.1 nmol/min/pmol); ATP, Km = 1.96 mm,Vmax = 186 nmol/min/μg (5.8 nmol/min/pmol); Mg2+, Km=1.98 mm,Vmax = 190 nmol/min/μg (6 nmol/min/pmol). The results are based on the averages of four separate experiments each. The enzyme was relatively specific for ATP, exhibiting about 10% activity with GTP and no detectable activity with ITP, UTP, or CTP. GspK is specific for glucosamine. The following sugars were inactive (no ADP formation) in assays conducted for as long as 12 h: galactosamine, mannosamine, glucose, 2-deoxyglucose, 2-deoxygalactose,d,l-arabinose, fructose, galactose, mannose, GlcNAc; the disaccharides (GlcN)2, (GlcNAc)2, lactose, maltose, melibiose, sucrose, trehalose, and turanose; the trisaccharide (GlcN)3. It appeared likely that the enzyme could be used for the quantitative determination of glucosamine. Fig.2B shows that the quantity of ADP generated in the assay was directly proportional to the quantity of GlcN added to the incubation in the micromolar range using standard assay conditions. The most persistent analytical problem in hydrolysates of glycans is that many of these substances contain both GlcN and GalN. Galactosamine was therefore added at various concentrations to the standards and was found to have no effect. That is, it neither acted as a substrate nor inhibited the activity of the enzyme toward GlcN (data not shown). Finally, it was important to determine whether GlcN could be determined in glycan hydrolysates. Such hydrolysates contain many byproducts, especially of amino acid/sugar interactions (the so-called “browning reaction”), and sometimes these interfere with the commonly employed colorimetric methods for GlcN. Two different specimens of seagull egg white, containing multiple glycoproteins, were therefore hydrolyzed with 4 m HCl for 6 h at 100 °C, the acid was removed in vacuo, and the residues were dissolved and divided into aliquots. One set of aliquots was analyzed by borate ion-exchange chromatography (Dionex), and the other was analyzed by the kinase procedure. Within experimental error, both methods gave the same results (data not shown). The egg white hydrolysates and ion-exchange analyses were kindly performed by Drs. Noriko Suzuki and Y. C. Lee of this department. These results indicate that the kinase can be used to specifically quantitate GlcN in mixtures of sugars, amino acids, etc. Two methods were used to characterize the product eluted from the ion-exchange resin, MALDI-MS and NMR. The ion-exchange method of purification yields the free acid (12Distler J. Merrick J.M. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 230: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); GlcN-P is a zwitterion. Therefore, the expected molecular mass of the fully protonated acid is 259.2 Da. When MALDI was used in the negative mode, a peak of 258.04 was obtained, as well as an additional small peak at 517.09. In the positive mode, the major peak was at 260.05, and there were two minor peaks, one at 519.10 and one at 778.15. The higher molecular mass peaks are consistent with the dimer and trimer of GlcN-P. The position of the phosphate group in the product was identified by a proton NMR spectroscopy and by comparison with standard GlcN-6-P (12Distler J. Merrick J.M. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 230: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 presents the results and indicates that the samples are identical. The following values and coupling constants were obtained (D2O, 300 MHz):δ 5.433 (d, 0.63 H, J1,2 = 3.4 Hz, H-1α), 4.943 (d, 0.37 H, J1,2 = 8.3 Hz, H-1β), 4.171–3.968 (m, 2H, H-5,6), 3.896 (t, 0.63 H, J2,3 = J3,4 = 9.9 Hz, H-3α), 3.685 (t, 0.37 H, J2,3 = J3,4 = 9.3 Hz, H-3β), 3.583 (t, 0.63 H, J3,4 = J4,5 = 9.5 Hz, H-4α), 3.570 (t, 0.37 H, J3,4 = J4,5 = 9.3 Hz, H-4β), 3.316 (dd, 0.63 H, J1,2 = 8.3 Hz, J2,3 = 9.9 Hz, H-2α), 3.028 (dd, 0.37 H, J1,2= 8.3 Hz, J2,3 = 9.3 Hz, H-2β). Three pieces of evidence show that the phosphoryl group is linked to C-6 of GlcN: (a)The sample showed precisely the same1H NMR spectrum as the standard GlcN-6-P. (b)When dissolved in D2O, the compound was a mixture of α- and β-anomers, showing that C-1 was not derivatized. (c)The signal for the protons at C-6 is in a relatively low field (∼4.1 ppm), indicating substitution at this position. The properties of a specific glucosamine kinase are described in this report. Neither GalN added to the incubation nor a hydrolysate of crude seagull egg white interfered with the assay, and the recovery of GlcN from the egg white proteins was excellent (by comparison with an independent method). The standard assay conditions used in this report can determine 10 nmol of GlcN but are easily modified for much greater sensitivity. For instance, the first step in the coupled assay, in which the ADP is generated, comprises a total volume of 0.1 ml, and in the second step, in which the ADP is measured, the volume is 1.0 ml. In the standard assay, only 10 of 100 μl of the first incubation are added to the second, and this can be increased. Secondly, each of the incubation volumes could be reduced 5-fold or more, which would give a 25-fold increase in sensitivity. The identification of a glucosamine-specific kinase in V. cholerae leads to an important question. What function does it serve? The enzyme is cytoplasmic, but what is the origin of free GlcN in the cytoplasm? Fig. 5 presents the problem. To briefly summarize: (a) Chitin oligosaccharides, (GlcNAc)n, enter the periplasmic space via a specific porin (13Li N.O. Keyhani X. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33068-33076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) designated 1 in the figure. The smaller sizes of monosaccharides and (GlcNAc)2 allow them to penetrate the cell envelope through constitutive porins labeled c in the figure. (b) In the periplasmic space, (GlcNAc)noligomers are converted by two unique enzymes, 2 and3, a chitodextrinase and a β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (9Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33425-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33414-33424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), to two products, GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2. (c) The monosaccharide, GlcNAc, is taken up by the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (15Kundig W. Ghosh S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 16Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), specifically by Enzyme IINag. The gene has been cloned from V. furnissii, and the protein has been characterized (17Bouma C.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33457-33467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The overall reaction of the transport process is: P-enolpyruvatein + GlcNAcout → GlcNAc-6-Pin + pyruvatein. (d) The further metabolism of GlcNAc-6-P involves two steps, 8, a deacetylase, and 9, a deaminase (18Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 115-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Davidson E.A. Blumenthal H.J. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1958; 232: 807-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yielding fructose-6-P, NH3, and acetate. The nag regulon of E. coli, containing the relevant structural and regulatory genes, has been extensively studied by Plumbridge (21Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Plumbridge J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). (e) There are two other possible sources for the key intermediate, GlcNAc-6-P. In V. furnissii, (GlcNAc)2 generated both outside the cell by chitinases and in the periplasm from higher oligosaccharides is taken up unchanged by a specific transporter (24Keyhani N.O. Wang L.-X. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33409-33413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) labeled 4. In the cell, the disaccharide is cleaved by 5, a specific phosphorylase (10Park J.K. Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33077-33083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yielding GlcNAc-1-P and GlcNAc. We presume that the GlcNAc-1-P is converted to the 6-P by a specific mutase, 6, known to occur in Neurospora (25Reissig J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 219: 753-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other cell types (26Fernandez-Sorensen A. Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3485-3493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Carlson D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 179-182Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). (f) The third source of GlcNAc-6-P is a GlcNAc-specific ATP-dependent kinase (6Asensio C. Ruiz-Amil M. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 421-425Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that is found in V. furnissii (7Yu B.L. Bassler C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The free GlcNAc generated from the disaccharide by the phosphorylase (5) is converted to GlcNAc-6-P by this kinase, 7. The final reaction shown in Fig. 5 is labeled 10, the specific glucosamine kinase described in this report. However, in viewing the known pathway in the figure, there is no obvious source for the cytoplasmic GlcN. What is its origin, extracellular GlcN or periplasmic GlcN, or is GlcN generated in the cytoplasm? 3If GlcN is generated intracellularly, there are at least two possibilities: (a) Native chitin is not fullyN-acetylated, i.e.it contains from 10 to 20% free amino groups. These residues would yield free intracellular GlcN if the hydrolases, transporter, and phosphorylase described in Fig. 5, or similar enzymes, are active with substances such as GlcNAc-GlcN. (b) The preferred substrate for the deacetylase, Reaction8, is GlcNAc-6-P. But the E. coli enzyme is also active with free GlcNAc (18Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 115-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which would yield GlcN. However, theE. coli enzyme displayed an inordinately high Km for this substrate, 0.12 m. Conceivably the V. cholerae deacetylase (Reaction 8) may be physiologically active with GlcNAc generated, for instance, by the phosphorylase (Reaction 5). To determine whether extracellular GlcN can be utilized, wild typeV. cholerae, V. furnissii, and E. colicells were tested on MacConkey fermentation plates with GlcN, GlcNAc, and Glc. The three cell types fermented each of the sugars. In a second set of experiments, the three strains were tested in synthetic media, each containing one of the sugars. All of the strains grew well on each of the three sugars as the sole source of carbon. 4These experiments were kindly performed by Dr. Xibing Li. If extracellular GlcN is catabolized via cytoplasmic GspK, then it must enter the cell unchanged. To our knowledge, no such transport system has been reported. In many obligate and facultative anaerobes that utilize GlcN, the phosphotransferase is the transporter (16Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yielding internal GlcN-6-P, which would obviate the need for GspK. 5The major pathway for the uptake of GlcN by the phosphotransferase in E. coli is the relatively non-specific IIMan complex of proteins, which is why it is shown in the plasma membrane in Fig. 5. This complex has been cloned and characterized from V. furnissii and is much more specific than the IIMan complex of E. coli (29Bouma C.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33468-33475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For instance, V. furnissii IIMan does not phosphorylate GlcNAc but is yet to be tested with GlcN. One obvious extension of the present studies is to determine how GlcN enters the V. cholerae cell. In sum, the function(s) of this unique V. cholerae kinase remain to be determined, or more precisely, if the kinase does function in this organism, what is the origin of intracellular GlcN?"

Generation of this antibody repertoire depends on immunoglobulin gene modification events driven by four different molecular processes: V(D)J recombination, somatic hypermutation, class switch recombination, and gene conversion. The enzyme AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase) is known to be involved in somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination.

In addition to the laser scanning confocal microscope, the multiple photon microscope, the spinning disk microscope and deconvolution of wide field light microscope images are now practical options for imaging."
