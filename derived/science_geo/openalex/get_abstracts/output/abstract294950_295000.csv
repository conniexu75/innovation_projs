https://openalex.org/W2051116497,"A large precursory change in seismic body-wave velocities occurred before the earthquake in San Fernando, California. The discovery that this change is mainly in the P-wave velocity clearly relates the effect to the phenomenon of dilatancy in fluid-filled rocks. This interpretation is supported by the time-volume relation obtained by combining the present data with the data from previous studies. The duration of the precursor period is proportional to the square of an effective fault dimension, which indicates that a diffusive or fluid-flow phenomenon controls the time interval between the initiation of dilatancy and the return to a fully saturated condition which is required for rupture."
https://openalex.org/W2066865945,"The oxygen and carbon isotopic signals of planktonic Foraminifera from closely spaced samples from two box cores taken in the western equatorial Pacific change through the glacial-to-Holocene transition as a result of several factors, one of which is the Holocene dissolution pulse starting about 12,000 years ago and reaching full force shortly after. The onset of dissolution comes shortly after the maximum rate of deglaciation but well before the maximum drop in fertility in upper waters. The effect of dissolution is 20 to 30 percent of the amplitude of isotopic change in Globigerinoides sacculifer, at the depth of the present lysocline."
https://openalex.org/W2020690056,"After inoculation of sterile organic materials on the deep-sea floor and in situ incubation for 1 year, relatively minute rates of microbial transformation were recorded. This extremely slow conversion rate, as well as the type and quantity of organic matter normally reaching the ocean floor, appear to characterize microbial life in the deep sea."
https://openalex.org/W2084782371,"Flowers of Chilopsis linearis dispense nectar into pools and grooves. The bumblebee, Bombus sonorus, extracts pool nectar at a rate seven times faster than groove nectar. The result is the coevolution of a plant-pollinator system in which bees, while foraging efficiently, increase the number of flowers visited per calorie of nectar reward provided by the plant."
https://openalex.org/W2061549001,"Previously unrecognized insolation variations on Mars are a consequence of periodic variations in eccentricity, first established by the theory of Brouwer and Van Woerkom (1950). Such annual insolation variations, characterized by both 95,000-year and 2,000,000-year periodicities, may actually be recorded in newly discovered layered deposits in the polar regions of Mars. An additional north-south variation in seasonal insolation, but not average annual insolation, exists with 51,000-year and 2,000,000-year periodicities."

https://openalex.org/W2013115362,"Interspecific hybridization tests between Chrysopa carnea and Chrysopa downesi show that single allele differences at two unlinked autosomal loci cause large differences in photoperiodic responses. These differences produce asynchronous seasonal reproductive cycles, thus forming an effective temporal reproductive barrier between the two sympatric species. The results subserve the development of a genetic model for allochronic speciation."

https://openalex.org/W2029314568,"In the hypothesis advanced here it is supposed that the field, in which rocks at the lunar surface acquired the remanent magnetization found through the Apollo project, arose from permanent magnetization of the deep interior of the moon. This theory involves the assumption that the moon, apart from a surface shell, accreted cold and remained below the Curie point of iron until sometime later than 3 x 10(9) years ago. The magnetization was acquired as the moon formed in a gas sphere in the strong magnetic field of the early sun."
https://openalex.org/W2033781188,Corals and algal pavement produce calcium carbonate more slowly on the windward reef slope of Enewetak Atoll than on the reef flat despite the high standing crop of reef-building organisms on the slope. The capacity of reefs to remain at or near sea level is therefore not determined primarily by growth on the seaward slope.
https://openalex.org/W2055561269,"Localized, paramural wall appositions resembling appositions commonly induced by fungal attack, were induced in kohlrabi (Brassica oleracea L. gongyloides) by mechanical wounding (bending) of the root hairs before the hairs were inoculated with zoospores of a compatible parasitic fungus. The appositions were effective in preventing fungal penetration at the wound sites, which shows that wall appositions can prevent fungal ingress into plant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015122878,"Cubanite (CuFe(2)S(3)), previously unobserved in meteorites, has been discovered in two carbonaceous chondrites, Orgueil and Alais. The association of this mineral with low-copper pyrrhotite suggests that it formed in a low-temperature environment on the meteorite parent body."
