https://openalex.org/W2080249344,"Cultured cells derived from male patients with Burkitt's lymphoma and harboring herpes-type virus particles were lethally irradiated. These irradiated cells induced normal peripheral leukocytes of female infants to grow within 2 to 4 weeks after mixed cultivation. Cells of a line free of this agent failed to stimulate growth. If either type of cell was cultured separately, it did not survive under the experimental conditions. Herpes-type viral antigen and C-group chromosomal marker previously described in cultured Burkitt cells were found in all of the female cell cultures that were obtained."

A relation is suggested between this in vitro phenomenon and other systems believed to be specific manifestations of delayed hypersensitivity.
https://openalex.org/W1524003058,"Abstract The metabolism of fucose has been investigated by administration of tracer amounts of l-fucose-1-14C. In a 6-hour period, 1.6% of radioactivity appeared as 14CO2, 30% appeared in the urine mainly as free fucose, and most of the remainder was associated with tissue and serum glycoproteins. Study of trichloracetic acid-soluble intermediates yielded data suggesting that exogenous fucose is incorporated into glycoproteins by the following sequence of reactions: Fucose → fucose-1-P → GDP-fucose → glycoprotein The proteins of liver, small intestine, and serum were the most highly labeled, but all tissues examined contained some labeled protein-bound fucose. Removal of hepatic tissue greatly reduces the incorporation of fucose into serum glycoproteins but has little effect on protein-bound radioactivity in other tissues. Therefore it is concluded that the peripheral tissues can form glycoproteins without the participation of hepatic tissue. Although the liver is the major site of synthesis of serum glycoproteins, the appearance of protein-bound fucose in the serum of hepatectomized rats indicates that extrahepatic tissues do contribute to the circulating glycoproteins. Incorporation of labeled fucose into body tissues, other than liver and small intestine, was minimal in comparison."

https://openalex.org/W2064968514,"The falling phase of action potentials of lobster giant axons is prolonged by DDT; finally a plateau phase is produced like cardiac action potentials. In axons poisoned with DDT, peak transient (sodium) currents associated with step depolarizations are turned off very slowly, and steady-state (potassium) currents are markedly suppressed. These two changes would cause the prolongation of action potentials and are considered the major ionic mechanisms of DDT action."
https://openalex.org/W1597344314,"Abstract Enzyme-substrate binding constants, K's, for chymotrypsin and specific amide (N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide and N-acetyl-l-phenylalaninamide) and ester (N-acetyl-l-tryptophan ethyl ester) substrates have been measured by a proflavin-displacement method. Also, the rate constant for the formation of one intermediate in the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the ester has been determined at selected pH values. These constants have not previously been determined. The proflavin-displacement method used to measure the enzyme complex concentration has previously been found to yield results in agreement with those obtained by measuring the spectral changes of the enzyme at 290 mµ. These spectral changes at 290 mµ, observed in all chymotrypsin-catalyzed reactions studied, have been shown to arise during the reversible formation of an enzyme-substrate complex which precedes the bond-breaking step. New information important to an understanding of chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis in general has been obtained from this work. It is shown directly, for the first time, that in the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of at least two specific amide substrates, the rate-limiting bond-breaking step follows the reversible formation of an enzyme-substrate complex with a dissociation constant K's, and that K's and the steady state kinetic parameter Km (app) are equivalent. The pH-dependent rate constant (k23) measured in the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the ester we have studied is shown to pertain to a second intermediate detected in this reaction, an intermediate not seen in the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the specific substrate amides. The K's values at pH 8.0 for the complexes of α-chymotrypsin with N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide and N-acetyl-l-phenylalaninamide were found to be 4.7 mm and 29 mm, respectively, in excellent agreement with the steady state kinetic parameter Km (app). In the case of the α-chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of N-acetyl-l-tryptophan ethyl ester, data on the pH dependence of k23 was found to be consistent with a pK (app) value of 6.6 for the group of the enzyme controlling the rate, and with a limiting pH-independent value for k23 of 1800 sec-1. The K's value for this ester and α-chymotrypsin at, for instance, pH 5.0, was found to be 2.3 mm, while Km (app) has been reported as ∼0.08 mm. Values of K's and k23, determined in these experiments, together with previously determined values of the steady state kinetic parameter, kcat, allowed a calculation of Km (app). At pH 5.0, this calculated value is ∼0.06 mm, in reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed value."

https://openalex.org/W2061754732,Saxitoxin at concentrations of 3 x 10(-8) to 3 x 10(-7) mole per liter blocks the conduction of lobster giant axon with no change in resting potential. Recovery of washed axons is faster in those that had been treated with saxitoxin than it is in those that were treated with tetrodotoxin. Peak transient increase in nerve membrane conductance is selectively blocked by saxitoxin with no change in late steady-state increase in conductance. The major mechanism of saxitoxin blockage is the same that of tetrodotoxin blockage.

https://openalex.org/W1539271460,"Abstract The mixed disulfide of lysozyme and cystine can be prepared by reaction of fully reduced lysozyme and cystine at pH 9.5. The mixed disulfide is enzymatically inactive and contains 16 residues of half-cystine per molecule. On reaction with cysteine, mercaptoethylamine, or mercaptoethanol, the mixed disulfide can be converted to active lysozyme. The initial rate of reactivation varies with pH, temperature, concentration of disulfide, and concentration of mercaptan; under the best conditions, 50% of the original activity is regenerated in 6 to 7 min. The extent of reactivation is generally between 70 and 85% under a variety of conditions. On the basis of kinetic measurements and characterization of the lysozyme formed throughout the reactivation process, a tentative mechanism for re-formation of the correct disulfide bonds in lysozyme has been proposed. Chromatographic analysis of the reactivated enzyme shows that it contains two major components. One chromatographic component is indistinguishable from native lysozyme, but the other has about 50 to 60% of the specific activity of native lysozyme and it is not converted to native lysozyme on further reduction and oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1569134572,"The acetyl ester of homoserine was found to be an intermediate in methionine biosynthesis in fungi, where it plays the role that O-succinylhomoserine does in bacteria. The latter is formed from succinyl coenzyme A and homoserine, and is decomposed by the replacement of succinate by cysteine to yield cystathionine. When grown in the presence of labeled homoserine, Neurospora accumulated labeled O-acetylhomoserine as well as larger amounts of the α-hydroxy analogue. A methionine-requiring mutant, me-5, which could grow when given acetylhomoserine in place of methionine, failed to accumulate it or to form labeled cystathionine when grown with labeled homoserine. A sensitive assay for hydroxyamino acid-acylating enzymes was devised, utilizing the observation that these enzymes catalyze exchange between alcohol and ester. Extracts of yeast and Neurospora were shown to catalyze homoserine exchange only with acetylhomoserine; extracts of Salmonella, only with succinylhomoserine. Homoserine acetylase was purified 60-fold from Neurospora. Acetyl-CoA could not be replaced by acetyl derivatives of phosphate, carnitine, or acyl carrier protein. The exchange rate was not affected by end product methionine. Although not leaky nutritionally, the me-5 mutant appears to produce a modified enzyme able to catalyze net acetylation but not exchange. Extracts of both fungi and bacteria can utilize either the succinyl or the acetyl ester of homoserine for cystathionine synthesis. In Salmonella this is due to the low specificity of the cystathionine γ-synthetase, but cystathionine synthesis from succinylhomoserine in Neurospora appears to be catalyzed by γ-cystathionase."
https://openalex.org/W2036050031,"The response to phytohemagglutinin by lymphocytes from eight of fourteen patients with congenital rubella was inhibited, whereas that of lymphocytes from patients with other diseases was not. The response of normal lymphocytes infected in vitro was also inhibited. The results suggest that early association of lymphocytes with virus inhibits the function of the cell and contributes to persistent carrying of virus in congenital rubella. This phenomenon may be a means of detecting viruses not now recognizable by routine methods of tissue culture."
https://openalex.org/W1505343468,"Abstract Steady state kinetic analysis has been used to demonstrate the existence of more than one central complex between aconitase and its substrates, and the interconversion of these complexes as a part of the reaction mechanism. Interconversions of this kind are not ordinarily detected by steady state kinetic studies; however, the branched reaction pathway, by which a given product molecule can arise from either of two substrate molecules, predicts different maximum velocities for formation of the product from the two substrates if different central complexes are involved in the two reactions. If only one complex or identical complexes are involved, these maximum velocities will be equal. Michaelis constants were found to be 200 ± 10 µm for citrate, 7.0 ± 0.5 µm for cis-aconitate, and 34 ± 2 µm for threo-ds-isocitrate. The maximum velocities for conversion of a given substrate to a given product (relative to a value of 1.0 for the maximum rate of conversion of citrate to isocitrate) were 1.04 ± 0.07 for the conversion of citrate to aconitate, 1.71 ± 0.12 for isocitrate to aconitate, 1.66 ± 0.12 for isocitrate to citrate, 3.1 ± 0.3 for aconitate to isocitrate, and 3.14 ± 0.24 for aconitate to citrate. These rates indicate that a unique series of central complexes is involved in the interconversion of any two tricarboxylic acids. The fact that the maximum rates of conversion of a given substrate to each of the other products were equal is at present unexplained, and may either be fortuitous or represent some as yet undiscovered characteristic of the actual mechanism. In order to account for all of the observed data, each substrate must combine with the enzyme to give a different central complex, but there may be more central complexes than three."
https://openalex.org/W1560506894,"Abstract The Na+-dependent uptake of each of eight neutral amino acids by the pigeon red blood cell in vitro is associated with an increase in Na+ influx, whereas three neutral amino acids that have uptakes little affected by Na+ cause no significant stimulation of Na+ movements. No net uptake of Na+ is detectable during incubation with any of these amino acids, and stimulation of Na+ efflux, as well as influx, is seen directly during the uptake of glycine, alanine, and β-alanine. Neither the uptake of alanine nor the associated Na+ movements are inhibited by ouabain at a concentration sufficient to block the normal active extrusion of Na+ from the cell. The stimulation of Na+ influx by alanine and glycine occurs additively when both amino acids are present together. Analysis of the cellular concentrations of several neutral amino acids indicates that all the apparent uptake of glycine and alanine caused by Na+ can be accounted for in terms of homogeneous and heterogeneous exchange with analogous endogenous amino acids. The Na+-dependent increments of influx (Δvs) of glycine, alanine, and β-alanine parallel quantitatively the associated increases of Na+ influx (Δvna) over the concentration ranges tested, although the kinetics and the stoichiometry are different for each amino acid, the mean values of the ratio Δvna:Δvs being 1.53, 2.52, and 0.96, respectively. Possible interpretations of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1556290465,"Abstract The responses of the adaptive enzymes, serine dehydrase (l-serine hydro-lyase (deaminating), EC 4.2.1.13), ornithine transaminase (l-ornithine: 2-oxoacid aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.13), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (d-glucose 6-phosphate:NADP oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49), and glucokinase (ATP:d-glucose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.2), in rat liver were studied in relation to changes in the level of dietary protein and treatments with cortisone. The administration of cortisone markedly altered the responses of the enzymes to the diet, and the effects of the hormone depended both on the route of its administration (intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection) and on the dietary regimen of the rats. The response of each enzyme to the regulatory stimuli (diet and cortisone) showed elements of both uniqueness and similarity with respect to the responses of the other three enzymes to these stimuli. The results indicate that the regulatory system for each enzyme responds to a specific set of effectors (e.g. amino acids or carbohydrate or both, of dietary or endogenous origin) and that cortisone alters the capacity of the regulatory systems to interact with the appropriate effectors."

The purpose of the present experiment was to demonstrate that, when water is freely available, nonthirsty rats will press a lever for thirst. Three satiated rats, bearing permanently implanted electrodes, were trained to press a lever which caused stimulation to be applied to an area of the lateral hypothalamus which induces thirst. The animals were tested with and without water available. Two of the rats pressed the lever to induce thirst only when water was available. Thus, thirst-inducing stimulation was not rewarding by itself, but only in combination with drinking."

However, 17 to 25% of the hexosamine was not reduced to the hexosaminitol and probably was present as a glycopeptide. The Hestrin hydroxylamine method for the determination of esters was applied to bovine, ovine, and porcine submaxillary mucins and to ovalbumin and serum α-glycoprotein. The only materials having ester content were preparations of bovine submaxillary mucin. The characteristics of the acyl function corresponded solely to that of the O-acetyl groups of the constituent sialic acids. After treatment of the bovine mucin with hydroxylamine, the constituent sialic acid could be almost completely removed by neuraminidase."

https://openalex.org/W1483107767,"Abstract Proflavine, in the range of 5 x 10-5 m, markedly inhibited protein synthesis in a subcellular rat liver system. With native messenger ribonucleic acids, leucine incorporation. In was inhibited more than phenylalanine incorporation. In the presence of polyuridylate, however, phenylalanine incorporation was inhibited more than leucine incorporation. Reversal studies indicated that extent, excess transfer ribonucleic acid and, to a lesser extent, excess microsomes, but not polyuridylate, overcame proflavine inhibition. Specific assays indicated that the drug inhibited both the synthesis of phenylalanyl transfer ribonucleic acid as well as the transfer reaction. These results suggest that the biological properties of the aminoacridines may be due not only to their ability to react with deoxyribonucleic acid, but also to their ability to form complexes with transfer ribonucleic acid and thereby directly interfere with protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1560896944,"Abstract A highly purified follicle-stimulating hormone from human pituitary glands has been prepared by ammonium sulfate and ethanol fractionation, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose, zone electrophoresis on cellulose columns, and preparative continuous flow polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

The follicle-stimulating hormone has sedimented as a single boundary in the ultracentrifuge with an s20,w value of 2.04, has shown a single zone in polyacrylamide disc electrophoreses at pH 8.6 and pH 4.3, and has shown a single precipitin line in immunoelectrophoresis in agar against anti-follicle-stimulating hormone sera produced in rabbits. The purified follicle-stimulating hormone contained 185 NIH-FSH-S3 and less than 0.02 NIH-LH-S4 (luteinizing hormone) units per mg, and was free of pituitary, thyrotropic, growth, prolactic, and adrenocorticotropic hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1580497766,"Abstract Spectral changes of chymotrypsin near 290 mµ, previously observed by us in the reaction of chymotrypsin with an inhibitor and with model substrates, have now been shown to accompany the binding to the enzyme of a specific amide substrate, N-acetyl-l-phenylalaninamide. Investigations of these substrate-induced spectral changes by equilibrium experiments and kinetic measurements have yielded the following new information important to an understanding of chymotrypsin-catalyzed reactions. As in the reaction of chymotrypsin with its specific inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate, these spectral changes of the enzyme observed during the amide hydrolysis are associated with an enzyme-substrate complex and not with a covalently bound enzyme-substrate compound. The process associated with these spectral changes precedes the bond-breaking step and is much faster; it has a half-time of less than 3 msec (kobs g 230 sec-1 or g1.1 x 104 m-1 sec-1 for a second order rate constant) at pH 8 and 24°, while the bond-breaking step has a kobs value less than 0.07 sec-1. The dependence of the spectral changes of the enzyme near 290 mµ on substrate concentration allowed the determination of an enzyme-substrate dissociation constant, K's. The dissociation constants pertaining to specific substrates and chymotrypsin have not previously been determined. K's values for N-acetyl-l-phenylalaninamide and δ-chymotrypsin at pH 8 and pH 10 were found to be 15 mm and 51 mm, respectively, while the catalytic rate constant was found to be pH independent in this pH region. This is consistent with our previous experiments which indicate that the pH dependence of the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the specific amide substrate above pH 8 is due to the pH dependence of the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex and not due to the effect of pH on the bond-breaking step. The K's values for N-acetyl-l-phenylalaninamide and α-chymotrypsin determined from measurements of the substrate-induced spectral changes of the enzyme near 290 mµ were checked by an independent method, the proflavin-displacement method, and excellent agreement between these two methods was obtained."

https://openalex.org/W1520652902,"The effects of a series of univalent cation salts on certain properties of pyruvate kinase, including sedimentation behavior, perturbation of tryptophan residues, and stability of the enzyme, have been investigated. Ultraviolet difference spectra of pyruvate kinase in 0.1 m solutions of activator univalent cation chlorides (K+, NH4+, or Na+) in comparison with enzyme in 0.1 m nonactivator univalent cation chlorides (Li+, or trimethylammonium ion, or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane cation) were determined. Tryptophanyl difference spectra with absorbance peaks at 286 mµ and 295 mµ were obtained under these conditions only when the nonactivator cation Tris+ was included in the experiment. Difference spectra of pyruvate kinase in 0.1 m KCl versus enzyme in 0.1 m LiCl with or without various substrates and Mg++ in the reaction showed no absorbance differences characteristic of the perturbation of tryptophan residues. In contrast, different comparisons of univalent cation chlorides at concentrations of 0.5 to 0.86 m showed capacities to perturb tryptophan residues of pyruvate kinase that were inversely correlated with the known capacities of univalent cations to activate the enzyme. A study of the stability of pyruvate kinase in a series of univalent cation salt solutions showed a positive correlation between the capacities of cations to protect against inactivation and known capacities to activate. In addition to the effect of univalent cations, different anion species influenced the extent of perturbation of tryptophan residues and the stability of the enzyme. The perturbation of the tryptophan residues in the presence of Tris+ (cation) was inhibited by the addition of multivalent anions, phosphate, arsenate, and sulfate. Also, the enzyme consistently showed greater stability in buffer solutions containing the multivalent anions phosphate, arsenate, or sulfate than in buffer solutions in which the predominant anions were acetate, chloride, or nitrate. The sedimentation behavior of pyruvate kinase in the ultracentrifuge was not greatly affected by type of univalent cation salt in the environment, with the exception that the s020,w value was lower in a solution of Tris-Cl than in other salts."

Neutral lipolytic activity has currently been shown to be present in a large molecular weight substance, associated with lipid, and separable from most alkaline lipolytic activity by ammonium sulfate precipitation and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. Alkaline lipolytic activity (ALA) has been shown to exist as three separable fractions: ALA-I, ALA-II, and ALA-III. ALA-I represents a small percentage of the total alkaline lipolytic activity, is eluted from Sephadex with neutral lipolytic activity, exists as a lipid-protein complex of ALA-II, and has no mobility during starch gel electrophoresis. ALA-II is a smaller molecule than ALA-I and exists primarily as four electrophoretically separable bands of activity. ALA-III is considerably smaller than ALA-II, is a subunit of ALA-II, and exists primarily as a fifth band of electrophoretically separable activity."

When subjected to horizontal starch gel or horizontal acrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 2.68, the procine and avian M-1 glycoproteins did not exhibit polymorphism, whereas the bovine M-1 glycoprotein was resolved into two zones in the starch gel and into four zones in the acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sedimentation coefficients, s020,w, of the bovine, porcine, and avian M-1 glycoproteins were 2.8, 3.0, and 2.9, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2052546136,"THE widespread use of the term “optical” illusion has implied both that spatial illusions are restricted to vision and that the explanation of illusions is to be sought in terms of the operating characteristics of the visual system. Equivalent visual and haptic illusions are, however, obtained with many of the well known illusion figures1. During haptic inspection a blindfolded subject is required to trace his finger over the raised contours of a figure. Some variables known to affect the magnitude of a visual illusion similarly influence the haptic illusion found with the same figure. Varying the angle of the arrowheads of the Muller–Lyer figure modifies visual and haptic judgments in the same way2. The magnitude of the illusion diminishes over practice trials at the same rate for the two modalities, and crossmodal transfer of the practice decrement is found3. These data suggest that it is unlikely that quite different processes coincidentally produce equivalent spatial illusions in the two modalities. Haptic illusions are found with congenitally blind subjects1,4; thus it cannot be argued that haptic judgments are controlled by a framework developed through visual learning."
