The unidirectional epitaxial growth is guaranteed by large binding energy difference, ~0.23 eV, between A- and B-steps edges on Cu(111) docking with B6N7 clusters, confirmed by density functional theory calculations."
https://openalex.org/W3010473434,"In mammalian cells, mitochondrial dysfunction triggers the integrated stress response, in which the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) results in the induction of the transcription factor ATF41–3. However, how mitochondrial stress is relayed to ATF4 is unknown. Here we show that HRI is the eIF2α kinase that is necessary and sufficient for this relay. In a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen, we identified factors upstream of HRI: OMA1, a mitochondrial stress-activated protease; and DELE1, a little-characterized protein that we found was associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial stress stimulates OMA1-dependent cleavage of DELE1 and leads to the accumulation of DELE1 in the cytosol, where it interacts with HRI and activates the eIF2α kinase activity of HRI. In addition, DELE1 is required for ATF4 translation downstream of eIF2α phosphorylation. Blockade of the OMA1–DELE1–HRI pathway triggers an alternative response in which specific molecular chaperones are induced. The OMA1–DELE1–HRI pathway therefore represents a potential therapeutic target that could enable fine-tuning of the integrated stress response for beneficial outcomes in diseases that involve mitochondrial dysfunction. A genome-wide CRISPR interference screen shows that a signalling pathway involving OMA1, DELE1 and the eIF2α kinase HRI relays mitochondrial stress to the cytosol to trigger the integrated stress response."
https://openalex.org/W3009398305,"Mitochondrial fidelity is tightly linked to overall cellular homeostasis and is compromised in ageing and various pathologies1-3. Mitochondrial malfunction needs to be relayed to the cytosol, where an integrated stress response is triggered by the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) in mammalian cells4,5. eIF2α phosphorylation is mediated by the four eIF2α kinases GCN2, HRI, PERK and PKR, which are activated by diverse types of cellular stress6. However, the machinery that communicates mitochondrial perturbation to the cytosol to trigger the integrated stress response remains unknown1,2,7. Here we combine genome engineering and haploid genetics to unbiasedly identify genes that affect the induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a key factor in the integrated stress response. We show that the mitochondrial protease OMA1 and the poorly characterized protein DELE1, together with HRI, constitute the missing pathway that is triggered by mitochondrial stress. Mechanistically, stress-induced activation of OMA1 causes DELE1 to be cleaved into a short form that accumulates in the cytosol, where it binds to and activates HRI via its C-terminal portion. Obstruction of this pathway can be beneficial or adverse depending on the type of mitochondrial perturbation. In addition to the core pathway components, our comparative genetic screening strategy identifies a suite of additional regulators. Together, these findings could be used to inform future strategies to modulate the cellular response to mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of human disease."
https://openalex.org/W3009146872,"The production of pore-forming toxins that disrupt the plasma membrane of host cells is a common virulence strategy for bacterial pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)1-3. It is unclear, however, whether host species possess innate immune mechanisms that can neutralize pore-forming toxins during infection. We previously showed that the autophagy protein ATG16L1 is necessary for protection against MRSA strains encoding α-toxin4-a pore-forming toxin that binds the metalloprotease ADAM10 on the surface of a broad range of target cells and tissues2,5,6. Autophagy typically involves the targeting of cytosolic material to the lysosome for degradation. Here we demonstrate that ATG16L1 and other ATG proteins mediate protection against α-toxin through the release of ADAM10 on exosomes-extracellular vesicles of endosomal origin. Bacterial DNA and CpG DNA induce the secretion of ADAM10-bearing exosomes from human cells as well as in mice. Transferred exosomes protect host cells in vitro by serving as scavengers that can bind multiple toxins, and improve the survival of mice infected with MRSA in vivo. These findings indicate that ATG proteins mediate a previously unknown form of defence in response to infection, facilitating the release of exosomes that serve as decoys for bacterially produced toxins."
https://openalex.org/W3009231969,"Although it is well-established that reductions in the ratio of insulin to glucagon in the portal vein have a major role in the dysregulation of hepatic glucose metabolism in type-2 diabetes1–3, the mechanisms by which glucagon affects hepatic glucose production and mitochondrial oxidation are poorly understood. Here we show that glucagon stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis by increasing the activity of hepatic adipose triglyceride lipase, intrahepatic lipolysis, hepatic acetyl-CoA content and pyruvate carboxylase flux, while also increasing mitochondrial fat oxidation—all of which are mediated by stimulation of the inositol triphosphate receptor 1 (INSP3R1). In rats and mice, chronic physiological increases in plasma glucagon concentrations increased mitochondrial oxidation of fat in the liver and reversed diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. However, these effects of chronic glucagon treatment—reversing hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance—were abrogated in Insp3r1 (also known as Itpr1)-knockout mice. These results provide insights into glucagon biology and suggest that INSP3R1 may represent a target for therapies that aim to reverse nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type-2 diabetes. A role and mechanism of action are identified for INSP3R1 in the stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial oxidation by glucagon, suggesting that INSP3R1 may be a target for ameliorating dysregulation of hepatic glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3009665504,"Condensin, a key component of the structure maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein complexes, has recently been shown to be a motor that extrudes loops of DNA1. It remains unclear, however, how condensin complexes work together to collectively package DNA into chromosomes. Here we use time-lapse single-molecule visualization to study mutual interactions between two DNA-loop-extruding yeast condensins. We find that these motor proteins, which, individually, extrude DNA in one direction only are able to dynamically change each other’s DNA loop sizes, even when far apart. When they are in close proximity, condensin complexes are able to traverse each other and form a loop structure, which we term a Z-loop—three double-stranded DNA helices aligned in parallel with one condensin at each edge. Z-loops can fill gaps left by single loops and can form symmetric dimer motors that pull in DNA from both sides. These findings indicate that condensin may achieve chromosomal compaction using a variety of looping structures."
https://openalex.org/W3009582182,"Most cortical synapses are local and excitatory. Local recurrent circuits could implement amplification, allowing pattern completion and other computations1–4. Cortical circuits contain subnetworks that consist of neurons with similar receptive fields and increased connectivity relative to the network average5,6. Cortical neurons that encode different types of information are spatially intermingled and distributed over large brain volumes5–7, and this complexity has hindered attempts to probe the function of these subnetworks by perturbing them individually8. Here we use computational modelling, optical recordings and manipulations to probe the function of recurrent coupling in layer 2/3 of the mouse vibrissal somatosensory cortex during active tactile discrimination. A neural circuit model of layer 2/3 revealed that recurrent excitation enhances sensory signals by amplification, but only for subnetworks with increased connectivity. Model networks with high amplification were sensitive to damage: loss of a few members of the subnetwork degraded stimulus encoding. We tested this prediction by mapping neuronal selectivity7 and photoablating9,10 neurons with specific selectivity. Ablation of a small proportion of layer 2/3 neurons (10–20, less than 5% of the total) representing touch markedly reduced responses in the spared touch representation, but not in other representations. Ablations most strongly affected neurons with stimulus responses that were similar to those of the ablated population, which is also consistent with network models. Recurrence among cortical neurons with similar selectivity therefore drives input-specific amplification during behaviour. Computational modelling, imaging and single-cell ablation in layer 2/3 of the mouse vibrissal somatosensory cortex reveals that recurrent activity in cortical neurons can drive input-specific amplification during behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3009584281,"Acetaldehyde is a highly reactive, DNA-damaging metabolite that is produced upon alcohol consumption1. Impaired detoxification of acetaldehyde is common in the Asian population, and is associated with alcohol-related cancers1,2. Cells are protected against acetaldehyde-induced damage by DNA crosslink repair, which when impaired causes Fanconi anaemia (FA), a disease resulting in failure to produce blood cells and a predisposition to cancer3,4. The combined inactivation of acetaldehyde detoxification and the FA pathway induces mutation, accelerates malignancies and causes the rapid attrition of blood stem cells5-7. However, the nature of the DNA damage induced by acetaldehyde and how this is repaired remains a key question. Here we generate acetaldehyde-induced DNA interstrand crosslinks and determine their repair mechanism in Xenopus egg extracts. We find that two replication-coupled pathways repair these lesions. The first is the FA pathway, which operates using excision-analogous to the mechanism used to repair the interstrand crosslinks caused by the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. However, the repair of acetaldehyde-induced crosslinks results in increased mutation frequency and an altered mutational spectrum compared with the repair of cisplatin-induced crosslinks. The second repair mechanism requires replication fork convergence, but does not involve DNA incisions-instead the acetaldehyde crosslink itself is broken. The Y-family DNA polymerase REV1 completes repair of the crosslink, culminating in a distinct mutational spectrum. These results define the repair pathways of DNA interstrand crosslinks caused by an endogenous and alcohol-derived metabolite, and identify an excision-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3010628852,"Although climate change is altering the productivity and distribution of marine fisheries, climate-adaptive fisheries management could mitigate many of the negative impacts on human society. We forecast global fisheries biomass, catch, and profits to 2100 under three climate scenarios (RCPs 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and five levels of management reform to (1) determine the impact of climate change on national fisheries and (2) quantify the national-scale benefits of implementing climate-adaptive fisheries reforms. Management reforms accounting for shifting productivity and shifting distributions would yield higher catch and profits in the future relative to today for 60–65% of countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but for only 35% of countries under the most severe scenario. Furthermore, these management reforms would yield higher cumulative catch and profits than business-as-usual management for nearly all countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but would yield lower cumulative catch for 40% of countries under the most severe scenario. Fortunately, perfect fisheries management is not necessary to achieve these benefits: transboundary cooperation with 5-year intervals between adaptive interventions would result in comparable outcomes. However, the ability for realistic management reforms to offset the negative impacts of climate change is bounded by changes in underlying biological productivity. Although realistic reforms could generate higher catch and profits for 23–50% of countries experiencing reductions in productivity, the remaining countries would need to develop, expand, and reform aquaculture and other food production sectors to offset losses in capture fisheries. Still, climate-adaptive management is more profitable than business-as-usual management in all countries and we provide guidance on implementing–and achieving the benefits of–climate-adaptive fisheries reform along a gradient of scientific, management, and enforcement capacities."
https://openalex.org/W3009320192,"Microbial communities in the gastrointestinal tract influence many aspects of host health, including metabolism and susceptibility to pathogen colonization. These relationships and the environmental and individual factors that drive them are relatively unexplored for free-living wildlife. We quantified the relationships between urban habitat use, diet, and age with microbiome composition and diversity for 82 American white ibises (Eudocimus albus) captured along an urban gradient in south Florida and tested whether gut microbial diversity was associated with Salmonella enterica prevalence. Shifts in community composition were significantly associated with urban land cover and, to a lesser extent, diets higher in provisioned food. The diversity of genera was negatively associated with community composition associated with urban land cover, positively associated with age class, and negatively associated with Salmonella shedding. Our results suggest that shifts in both habitat use and diet for urban birds significantly alter gut microbial composition and diversity in ways that may influence health and pathogen susceptibility as species adapt to urban habitats."
https://openalex.org/W3009372076,"Background Clinical trials have shown beneficial effects of blood pressure (BP) control in reducing the risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, association between BP control and DR in population-based studies is not clear. We aimed to examine the association of hypertension and BP control with DR. Methods We analysed data from a population-based cross-sectional study of Chinese, Malay and Indians adults with diabetes and hypertension (2004–2011, n = 2189, aged 40–80 years) in Singapore. DR severity was assessed from retinal photographs and graded for any- and vision-threatening DR (VTDR) using the modified Airlie House classification. Hypertension status was classified into (1) good control: on treatment (SBP < 130 and DBP < 80 mm Hg), (2) moderate control: on treatment, with BP levels other than group 1 and 3, (3) poor control: on treatment (SBP ≥140 and DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg), (4) untreated hypertension, any BP level. SBP, DBP and pulse pressure (PP) were analyzed as categories and as continuous variables. The association between BP and DR was assessed using multivariable logistic regression models. Results The prevalence of any-DR and VTDR in the study population was 33.8% and 9.0% respectively. Both poorly controlled and untreated hypertension were significantly associated with any-DR with odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 1.97 (1.39–2.83), and 2.01 [1.34–3.05]. Among BP components, SBP and PP were associated with both any-DR and VTDR with OR (95% CI) of 1.45 (1.28–1.65) and 1.61 (1.41–1.84) for any-DR, and 1.44 (1.19–1.76) and 1.67 (1.37–2.06) for VTDR. Conclusion In a population-based sample of Asian adults with diabetes and hypertension, treated but poorly controlled as well as untreated hypertension were significantly associated with any-DR. Among the BP components, higher SBP and PP levels were associated with both any-DR and VTDR. Further longitudinal studies are necessary to confirm our findings."
https://openalex.org/W3009705059,"Cytology is the first pathological examination performed in the diagnosis of lung cancer. In our previous study, we introduced a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to automatically classify cytological images as images with benign or malignant features and achieved an accuracy of 81.0%. To further improve the DCNN's performance, it is necessary to train the network using more images. However, it is difficult to acquire cell images which contain a various cytological features with the use of many manual operations with a microscope. Therefore, in this study, we aim to improve the classification accuracy of a DCNN with the use of actual and synthesized cytological images with a generative adversarial network (GAN). Based on the proposed method, patch images were obtained from a microscopy image. Accordingly, these generated many additional similar images using a GAN. In this study, we introduce progressive growing of GANs (PGGAN), which enables the generation of high-resolution images. The use of these images allowed us to pretrain a DCNN. The DCNN was then fine-tuned using actual patch images. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, we first evaluated the quality of the images which were generated by PGGAN and by a conventional deep convolutional GAN. We then evaluated the classification performance of benign and malignant cells, and confirmed that the generated images had characteristics similar to those of the actual images. Accordingly, we determined that the overall classification accuracy of lung cells was 85.3% which was improved by approximately 4.3% compared to a previously conducted study without pretraining using GAN-generated images. Based on these results, we confirmed that our proposed method will be effective for the classification of cytological images in cases at which only limited data are acquired."
https://openalex.org/W3009712636,"The overuse of antimicrobials in primary care can be linked to an increased risk of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria for individual patients. Although there are promising signs of the benefits associated with Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) in hospitals and long-term care settings, there is limited knowledge in primary care settings and how to implement ASPs in these settings is unclear. In this context, a qualitative study was undertaken to explore the perceptions of primary care prescribers of the usefulness, feasibility, and experiences associated with the implementation of a pilot community-focused ASP intervention in three primary care clinics. Qualitative interviews were conducted with primary care clinicians, including local ASP champions, prescribers, and other primary health care team members, while they participated in an ASP initiative within one of three primary care clinics. An iterative conventional content analyses approach was used to analyze the transcribed interviews. Themes emerged around the key enablers and barriers associated with ASP implementation. Study findings point to key insights relevant to the scalability of community ASP activities with primary care providers."
https://openalex.org/W3010613868,"Dravet syndrome is caused by dominant loss-of-function mutations in SCN1A which cause reduced activity of Nav1.1 leading to lack of neuronal inhibition. On the other hand, gain-of-function mutations in SCN8A can lead to a severe epileptic encephalopathy subtype by over activating NaV1.6 channels. These observations suggest that Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 represent two opposing sides of the neuronal balance between inhibition and activation. Here, we hypothesize that Dravet syndrome may be treated by either enhancing Nav1.1 or reducing Nav1.6 activity. To test this hypothesis we generated and characterized a novel DS zebrafish model and tested new compounds that selectively activate or inhibit the human NaV1.1 or NaV1.6 channel respectively. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate two separate Scn1Lab knockout lines as an alternative to previous zebrafish models generated by random mutagenesis or morpholino oligomers. Using an optimized locomotor assay, spontaneous burst movements were detected that were unique to Scn1Lab knockouts and disappear when introducing human SCN1A mRNA. Besides the behavioral phenotype, Scn1Lab knockouts show sudden, electrical discharges in the brain that indicate epileptic seizures in zebrafish. Scn1Lab knockouts showed increased sensitivity to the GABA antagonist pentylenetetrazole and a reduction in whole organism GABA levels. Drug screenings further validated a Dravet syndrome phenotype. We tested the NaV1.1 activator AA43279 and two novel NaV1.6 inhibitors MV1369 and MV1312 in the Scn1Lab knockouts. Both type of compounds significantly reduced the number of spontaneous burst movements and seizure activity. Our results show that selective inhibition of NaV1.6 could be just as efficient as selective activation of NaV1.1 and these approaches could prove to be novel potential treatment strategies for Dravet syndrome and other (genetic) epilepsies. Compounds tested in zebrafish however, should always be further validated in other model systems for efficacy in mammals and to screen for potential side effects."
https://openalex.org/W3009943258,"Here we describe an industry-wide collaboration aimed at assessing the binding properties of a comprehensive panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), an important checkpoint protein in cancer immunotherapy and validated therapeutic target, with well over thirty unique mAbs either in clinical development or market-approved in the United States, the European Union or China. The binding kinetics of the PD-1/mAb interactions were measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using a Carterra LSA instrument and the results were compared to data collected on a Biacore 8K. The effect of chip type on the SPR-derived binding rate constants and affinities were explored and the results compared with solution affinities from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) and Kinetic Exclusion Assay (KinExA) experiments. When using flat chip types, the LSA and 8K platforms yielded near-identical kinetic rate and affinity constants that matched solution phase values more closely than those produced on 3D-hydrogels. Of the anti-PD-1 mAbs tested, which included a portion of those known to be in clinical development or approved, the affinities spanned from single digit picomolar to nearly 425 nM, challenging the dynamic range of our methods. The LSA instrument was also used to perform epitope binning and ligand competition studies which revealed over ten unique competitive binding profiles within this group of mAbs."
https://openalex.org/W3009478805,"Current targets for protected area network coverage call for increased protection but lack specificity in terms of criteria for parcel type, placement, and landscape connectivity. We assessed land conservation achieved by protected area networks in the contiguous United States, and assessed whether private lands contributed substantially to network coverage and connectivity given species dispersal abilities. On average, states have 4.1% (range: 0.2% to 15.8%, n = 48) protected area coverage with connectivity ≤10 km. Terrain ruggedness, percent farmland, and population density are the primary determinants of protected area placement, leading to biased representation of land features currently under protection. On average, private protected areas contribute <1.1% (range 0.0% to 9.2%) to current protected area coverage across the United States. We conclude that current levels of protection and connectivity are inadequate to support a functional protected area network, and that increased and strategic selection of private protected areas is necessary to meet conservation planning goals."

OGTT glucose concentrations were used to identify women who fulfilled IADPSG and NICE criteria. While cut-offs according to Finnish national criteria partly overlapped with both criteria, a subgroup of IADPSG- or NICE-positive GDM women remained undiagnosed by Finnish criteria and hence non-treated. They were analysed as subgroups and compared to controls who were negative with all cut-offs.GDM prevalence, birth weight SD score (BWSDS), large for gestational age (LGA) and caesarean section (CS) rates.Among the 4,033 women screened for GDM, 1,249 (31.0%) and 529 (13.1%) had GDM according to the IADPSG and NICE criteria, respectively. The LGA rate was similar in both groups. Regardless of the diagnostic criteria, women with GDM had a higher risk of induced delivery and CSs than controls. In IADPSG-positive non-treated women, offspring's BWSDS and CS rate were higher than in controls.GDM prevalence was 2.4-fold higher according to the IADPSG compared with the NICE criteria but the LGA rate did not differ. BWSDS and CS rate were increased already with mild untreated hyperglycaemia."
https://openalex.org/W3010425940,"Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women worldwide. The cardiovascular risk profile deteriorates after women enter menopause. By definition, women diagnosed with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) experience menopause before 40 years of age, which may render these women even more susceptible to develop CVD later in life. However, prospective long-term follow up data of well phenotyped women with POI are scarce. In the current study we compare the CVD profile and risk of middle aged women previously diagnosed with POI, to a population based reference group matched for age and BMI. Methods and findings We compared 123 women (age 49.0 (± 4.3) years) and diagnosed with POI 8.1 (IQR: 6.8–9.6) years earlier, with 123 population controls (age 49.4 (± 3.9) years). All women underwent an extensive standardized cardiovascular screening. We assessed CVD risk factors including waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure, lipid profile, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), in both women with POI and controls. We calculated the 10-year CVD Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and the American Heart Association’s suggested cardiovascular health score (CHS). Waist circumference (90.0 (IQR: 83.0–98.0) versus 80.7 (IQR: 75.1–86.8), p < 0.01), waist-to-hip ratio (0.90 (IQR: 0.85–0.93) versus 0.79 (IQR: 0.75–0.83), p < 0.01), systolic blood pressure (124 (IQR 112–135) versus 120 (IQR109-131), p < 0.04) and diastolic blood pressure (81 (IQR: 76–89) versus 78 (IQR: 71–86), p < 0.01), prevalence of hypertension (45 (37%) versus 21 (17%), p < 0.01) and MetS (19 (16%) versus 4 (3%), p < 0.01) were all significantly increased in women with POI compared to healthy controls. Other risk factors, however, such as lipids, glucose levels and prevalence of diabetes were similar comparing women with POI versus controls. The arterial stiffness assessed by PWV was also similar in both populations (8.1 (IQR: 7.1–9.4) versus 7.9 (IQR: 7.1–8.4), p = 0.21). In addition, cIMT was lower in women with POI compared to controls (550 μm (500–615) versus 684 μm (618–737), p < 0.01). The calculated 10-year CVD risk was 5.9% (IQR: 3.7–10.6) versus 6.0% (IQR: 3.9–9.0) (p = 0.31) and current CHS was 6.1 (1.9) versus 6.5 (1.6) (p = 0.07), respectively in POI versus controls. Conclusions Middle age women with POI presented with more unfavorable cardiovascular risk factors (increased waist circumference and a higher prevalence of hypertension and MetS) compared to age and BMI matched population controls. In contrast, the current study reveals a lower cIMT and similar 10-year cardiovascular disease risk and cardiovascular health score. In summary, neither signs of premature atherosclerosis nor a worse cardiovascular disease risk or health score were observed among middle age women with POI compared to population controls. Longer-term follow-up studies of women of more advanced age are warranted to establish whether women with POI are truly at increased risk of developing CVD events later in life.

https://openalex.org/W3009865719,"We previously showed, in a pilot study with publicly available data, that T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) could be distinguished from adjacent healthy tissue repertoires by the presence of TCRs bearing specific, biophysicochemical motifs in their antigen binding regions. We hypothesized that such motifs might allow development of a novel approach to cancer detection. The motifs were cancer specific and achieved high classification accuracy: we found distinct motifs for breast versus colorectal cancer-associated repertoires, and the colorectal cancer motif achieved 93% accuracy, while the breast cancer motif achieved 94% accuracy. In the current study, we sought to determine whether such motifs exist for ovarian cancer, a cancer type for which detection methods are urgently needed. We made two significant advances over the prior work. First, the prior study used patient-matched TILs and healthy repertoires, collecting healthy tissue adjacent to the tumors. The current study collected TILs from patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and healthy ovary repertoires from cancer-free women undergoing hysterectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy for benign disease. Thus, the classification task is distinguishing women with cancer from women without cancer. Second, in the prior study, classification accuracy was measured by patient-hold-out cross-validation on the training data. In the current study, classification accuracy was additionally assessed on an independent cohort not used during model development to establish the generalizability of the motif to unseen data. Classification accuracy was 95% by patient-hold-out cross-validation on the training set and 80% when the model was applied to the blinded test set. The results on the blinded test set demonstrate a biophysicochemical TCR motif found overwhelmingly in women with HGSOC but rarely in women with healthy ovaries, strengthening the proposal that cancer detection approaches might benefit from incorporation of TCR motif-based biomarkers. Furthermore, these results call for studies on large cohorts to establish higher classification accuracies, as well as for studies in other cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W3009817544,"A citation is deemed as a potential parameter to determine linkage between research articles. The parameter has extensively been employed to form multifarious academic aspects like calculating the impact factor of journals, h-Index of researchers, allocate different research grants, find the latest research trends, etc. The current state-of-the-art contends that all citations are not of equal importance. Based on this argument, the current trend in citation classification community categorizes citations into important and non-important reasons. The community has proposed different approaches to extract important citations such as citation count, context-based, metadata, and textual based approaches. The contemporary state-of-the-art in citation classification community ignores significantly potential features that can play a vital role in citation classification. This research presents a novel approach for binary citation classification by exploiting section-wise in-text citation frequencies, similarity score, and overall citation count-based features. The study also introduces machine learning algorithms based novel approach for assigning appropriate weights to the logical sections of research papers. The weights are allocated to the citations with respect to their sections. To perform the classification, we used three classification techniques, Support Vector Machine, Kernel Linear Regression, and Random Forest. The experiment was performed on two annotated benchmark datasets that contain 465 and 311 citation pairs of research articles respectively. The results revealed that the proposed approach attained an improved value of precision (i.e., 0.84 vs 0.72) from contemporary state-of-the-art approach."
https://openalex.org/W3010015994,"Background and aims Human colonoid cultures maintained under low-calcium (0.25 mM) conditions undergo differentiation spontaneously and, concomitantly, express a high level of tight junction proteins, but not desmosomal proteins. When calcium is included to a final concentration of 1.5–3.0 mM (provided either as a single agent or as a combination of calcium and additional minerals), there is little change in tight junction protein expression but a strong up-regulation of desmosomal proteins and an increase in desmosome formation. The aim of this study was to assess the functional consequences of calcium-mediated differences in barrier protein expression. Methods Human colonoid-derived epithelial cells were interrogated in transwell culture under low- or high-calcium conditions for monolayer integrity and ion permeability by measuring trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) across the confluent monolayer. Colonoid cohesiveness was assessed in parallel. Results TEER values were high in the low-calcium environment but increased in response to calcium. In addition, colonoid cohesiveness increased substantially with calcium supplementation. In both assays, the response to multi-mineral intervention was greater than the response to calcium alone. Consistent with these findings, several components of tight junctions were expressed at 0.25 mM calcium but these did not increase substantially with supplementation. Cadherin-17 and desmoglein-2, in contrast, were weakly-expressed under low calcium conditions but increased with intervention. Conclusions These findings indicate that low ambient calcium levels are sufficient to support the formation of a permeability barrier in the colonic epithelium. Higher calcium levels promote tissue cohesion and enhance barrier function. These findings may help explain how an adequate calcium intake contributes to colonic health by improving barrier function, even though there is little change in colonic histological features over a wide range of calcium intake levels."
https://openalex.org/W3010157669,"Indigenous people have been using local grasses for rearing their animals for centuries. The present study is the first record of traditional knowledge of grasses and livestock feeding system from the Thal desert in Pakistan. A snowball sampling method was used to identify key participants. Information was collected from the respondents from six districts of Thal Desert through semi-structural questionnaire and site visits. The data was analyzed through Smith’s salience index and Composite Salience using ANTHROPAC package in R software. On the whole 61 grasses were recorded from the study area: most of them belong to the Poaceae family (52 species). Based on palatability grasses were categorized into three major groups i.e. (A) High priority, (B) Medium priority and (C) Low priority. Species in Group A, abundantly present in the study area represent a source of highly palatable forage for all ruminants. 232 (141M +91W) local participants were interviewed. Participants were grouped into three major age categories: 20–35 (48 participants), 36–50 (116 participants) and 51–67 years old (68 participants). ANTHROPAC frequency analysis confirmed the Smith’s salience index and Composite Salience; Cynodon dactylon was the favorite species (6.46 SI, 0.6460 CS) followed by Cymbopogon jwarancusa (5.133 SI, 0.5133 CS) and Sorghum sp. was the third most salient species (5.121 SI, 0.5121 CS). Grasses were mostly available during the months of August and October and had also ethnoveterinary importance. This document about the traditional feeding of livestock in Thal Desert can underline the importance of conserving a traditional knowledge, which was poorly documented before."
https://openalex.org/W3009207860,"Variations in childbirth interventions may indicate inappropriate use. Most variation studies are limited by the lack of adjustments for maternal characteristics and do not investigate variations in adverse outcomes. This study aims to explore regional variations in the Netherlands and their correlations with referral rates, birthplace, interventions, and adverse outcomes, adjusted for maternal characteristics.In this nationwide retrospective cohort study, using a national data register, intervention rates were analysed between twelve regions among single childbirths after 37 weeks' gestation in 2010-2013 (n = 614,730). These were adjusted for maternal characteristics using multivariable logistic regression. Primary outcomes were intrapartum referral, birthplace, and interventions used in midwife- and obstetrician-led care. Correlations both between primary outcomes and between adverse outcomes were calculated with Spearman's rank correlations.Intrapartum referral rates varied between 55-68% (nulliparous) and 20-32% (multiparous women), with a negative correlation with receiving midwife-led care at the onset of labour in two-thirds of the regions. Regions with higher referral rates had higher rates of severe postpartum haemorrhages. Rates of home birth varied between 6-16% (nulliparous) and 16-31% (multiparous), and was negatively correlated with episiotomy and postpartum oxytocin rates. Among midwife-led births, episiotomy rates varied between 14-42% (nulliparous) and 3-13% (multiparous) and in obstetrician-led births from 46-67% and 14-28% respectively. Rates of postpartum oxytocin varied between 59-88% (nulliparous) and 50-85% (multiparous) and artificial rupture of membranes between 43-52% and 54-61% respectively. A north-south gradient was visible with regard to birthplace, episiotomy, and oxytocin.Our study suggests that attitudes towards interventions vary, independent of maternal characteristics. Care providers and policy makers need to be aware of reducing unwarranted variation in birthplace, episiotomy and the postpartum use of oxytocin. Further research is needed to identify explanations and explore ways to reduce unwarranted intervention rates."
https://openalex.org/W3009232784,"Background Telehealth services can improve the quality of health services for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management, but the clinical benefits for patients yet not clear. It is crucial to develop a strategy that supports the engagement of healthcare professionals to promote the sustainable adoption of telehealth services further. The aim of the study was to show how variables related to the perception of telehealth services for COPD by different healthcare professionals interact to influence its adoption and to generate advice for future telehealth service implementation. Methods Data was thematically synthesized from published qualitative studies to create causal loop diagrams, further validated by expert interviews. These diagrams visualize dependencies and their polarity between different variables. Results Adoption of telehealth services from the nurse’s perspective is directly affected by change management and autonomous decision making. From the physician’s perspective, perceived value is the most important variable. Physical activity management and positive user experience are considered affecting perceived value for physiotherapists. There is no consensus where self-management services should be positioned in the COPD care pathway. Conclusion Our results indicate how complex interactions between multiple variables influence the adoption of telehealth services. Consequently, there is a need for multidimensional interventions to achieve adoption. Moreover, key variables were identified that require attention to ensure success of telehealth services. Furthermore, it is necessary to explore where self-management services are best positioned in the care pathway of COPD patients."
https://openalex.org/W3010496838,"To determine the influence of the weight of the economic effectiveness evaluation criteria of the major investments of listed enterprises, and provide new management ideas for the development of the follow-up enterprises, firstly, the financial benefit evaluation system of investment projects is analyzed and constructed, and the specific evaluation process is analyzed. Then, on this basis, the evaluation index is refined; the basic structure of BP neural network (BPNN) is introduced, and genetic algorithm is used to improve BP neural network. The cost-benefit analysis model is constructed based on the improved BPNN. The listed company A is taken as an example to analyze its development data in recent years, and then the data of 10 listed companies are taken as the research object. Matlab simulation software is used to train and verify the improved BPNN model, analyze and predict the weight value of the financial benefit index of the investment projects of these 10 companies, and then determine the index to improve the financial benefit of the investment projects. Under the analysis of the development data of listed company A in the past 10 years, it is found that the indicators of the listed company's profitability per share, debt risk operation ability, development, and growth ability in the past 10 years are in relatively stable state. The principal component analysis of its 20 secondary sub-indexes is conducted based on the four primary indicators: profitability, debt risk, operational capacity, and development and growth. A total of eight principal components including return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA), (total asset turnover) TATO, turnover of account receivable (AR), asset-liability ratio, interest protection multiple, income growth rate, and year-on-year rate of increase for complete assets are extracted. The average error between the final output value, the actual value, and the expected value is 0.0304 and 0.0169, respectively. The weight coefficient of the monetary benefits evaluation indicator of investment items is calculated, and the computed results show that year-on-year rate of increase for complete assets, TOTA, ROA, turnover of total capital, and ROE are important indexes in the financial benefit evaluation of investment projects. It indicates that to improve the financial benefit of investment projects of listed enterprises, it is necessary to enhance the year-over-year growth degree of total properties and ROA."
https://openalex.org/W3009578447,"Brucellosis is a ubiquitous zoonotic disease globally. It is endemic among bovines, sheep, and goats in Albania. The national control and eradication programs for brucellosis has been applied on sheep and goat farms as well as large dairy cattle farms, i.e., those with more than ten milking cows. The current study aims at estimating the herd and average individual animal prevalence of brucellosis in the national beef cattle herds, the missing information that was essential to propose the most appropriate control measures for this sub-population. Rose Bengal Test (RBT), Fluorescence Polarization Assay (FPA), and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) were used as serological tests and classical bacteriology for isolation. Results were also used to investigate the difference in sensitivity between the assays used.In total, 655 animals from 38 beef cattle herds from six southern districts of Albania were sampled. Sera were tested using RBT, FPA, and ELISA. Fifteen positive cows and a bull from eight high-prevalence positive herds were slaughtered, and particular tissue samples were collected for bacteriology.The overall herd seroprevalence in the tested beef cattle population was 55%, while the overall average within-herd prevalence (including only positive herds) was 38.3%, 42.7%, and 45.6% determined by the RBT, ELISA, and FPA, respectively. FPA was used for the first time in the diagnosis of bovine brucellosis in Albania, and its sensitivity was higher than RBT and ELISA. Three B. abortus strains were identified, two from the supra-mammary lymph node of two cows and one from the epididymis of a seropositive bull.Brucellosis was highly prevalent in beef cattle in the southern part of Albania, and B. abortus was isolated from this subpopulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first statistically based survey of bovine brucellosis in beef herds in Albania. Using the FPA in parallel with other serological tests improved overall diagnostic sensitivity. Test and slaughter policy is not a rational approach for the control of brucellosis in beef cattle in Albania, and vaccination is only applicable, including strict control of the movement of animals."
https://openalex.org/W3009618442,"Background The ECHO trial has relieved apprehension about intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM), however it is still important to understand how DMPA-IM affects the vaginal environment. We sought to describe how DMPA-IM initiation influences vaginal bacteria associated with HIV acquisition in postpartum women. Methods Vaginal swabs were collected for Nugent score determination and taxon-specific quantitative PCR of eight bacteria. Enrollment occurred at contraceptive initiation (DMPA-IM or non-hormonal contraception (non-HC)) and repeat vaginal swabs were collected after three months. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate changes in Nugent score, total bacterial load, and taxa concentrations among contraceptive groups. Results Women who chose DMPA-IM (n = 33) were more likely to be married (97%vs.67%) and have resumed intercourse since delivery (52%vs.29%) compared to women who chose non-HC (n = 21). After three months, significant decreases in the concentrations of Sneathia species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Parvimonas species Type 1 were seen among non-HC users, however concentrations remained stable among DMPA-IM users; contraceptive method was associated with significantly different changes in M. hominis concentration between groups (p = 0.010). Conclusions Our findings suggest that postpartum use of DMPA-IM and non-HC may have differential impacts on the vaginal concentrations of some bacteria that have previously been associated with HIV acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W3010214713,"Our earlier studies proved that RIPK3-mediated necroptosis might be an important mode of renal tubular cell death in rats with chronic renal injury and the necroptotic cell death can be triggered by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in vitro, but the triggering role of angiotensin II (AngII), which exerts notable effects on renal cells for the initiation and progression of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis, is largely unknown. Here, we identified the presence of necroptotic cell death in the tubular cells of AngII-induced chronic renal injury and fibrosis mice and assessed the percentage of necroptotic renal tubular cell death with the disruption of this necroptosis by the addition of necrostatin-1 (Nec-1). Furthermore, the observation was further confirmed in HK-2 cells treated with AngII and RIPK1/3 or MLKL inhibitors. The detection of Fas and FasL proteins led us to investigate the contribution of the Fas/FasL signaling pathway to AngII-induced necroptosis. Disruption of FasL decreased the percentage of necroptotic cells, suggesting that Fas and FasL are likely key signal molecules in the necroptosis of HK-2 cells induced by AngII. Our data suggest that AngII exposure might trigger RIPK3-MLKL-mediated necroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells by activating the Fas/FasL signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3009624272,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of most common cancers worldwide, however, the treatment for advanced HCC remains unsatisfactory. We focused on the function of the androgen receptor (AR) in HCC and tried to find new treatment strategy based on antiandrogen enzalutamide (Enz). Here, we found that olaparib, a FDA-approved PARP inhibitor, could enhance the cytotoxicity in HCC cells with a lower BRCA1 expression, and suppressing the AR with either Enz or AR-shRNA could further increase the olaparib sensitivity to better suppress the HCC cell growth via a synergistic mechanism that may involve suppressing the expression of BRCA1 and other DNA damage response (DDR) genes. Mechanism studies revealed that Enz/AR signaling might transcriptionally regulate the miR-146a-5p expression via binding to the Androgen Response Elements on its 5' promoter region, which could then lead to suppress the homologous recombination-related BRCA1 expression via direct binding to the mRNA 3'UTR. Preclinical studies using an in vivo mouse model also demonstrated that combining Enz plus olaparib led to better suppression of the HCC progression. Together, these in vitro/in vivo data suggest that combining Enz and olaparib may help in the development of a novel therapy to better suppress the HCC progression."
https://openalex.org/W3009926700,"Literature mentions two types of models describing cyclic movement-theory and data driven. Theory driven models include anatomical and physiological aspects. They are principally suitable for answering questions about the reasons for movement characteristics, but they are complicated and substantial simplifications do not allow generally valid results. Data driven models allow answering specific questions, but lack the understanding of the general movement characteristic. With this paper we try a compromise without having to rely on anatomy, neurology and muscle function. We hypothesize a general kinematic description of cyclic human motion is possible without having to specify the movement generating processes, and still get the kinematics right. The model proposed consists of a superposition of six contributions-subject's attractor, morphing, short time fluctuation, transient effect, control mechanism and sensor noise, while characterizing numbers and random contributions. We test the model with data from treadmill running and stationary biking. Applying the model in a simulation results in good agreement between measured data and simulation values. We find in all our cases the similarity analysis between measurement and simulation is best for the same subjects-[Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. All comparisons between different subjects are [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. This uniquely allows for the identification of each measurement for the associated simulation. However, even different subject comparisons show good agreement between measurement and simulation results of differences δrun = 6.7±4.7% and δbike = 5.1±4.5%."
https://openalex.org/W3010345035,"Various countries have pledged to carry out system-wide energy transitions to address climate change. This requires taking strategic decisions with long-term consequences under conditions of considerable uncertainty. For this reason, many actors in the energy sector develop model-based scenarios to guide debates and decision-making about plausible future energy systems. Besides being a decision support instrument for policy-makers, energy scenarios are widely recognized as a way of shaping the expectations of experts and of influencing energy policy more generally. However, relatively little is known about how energy scenarios shape preferences and expectations of the public. We use an explorative research design to assess the publics’ expectations of future energy systems through an online survey among Swiss residents (N = 797). We identified four significantly different clusters of people with distinct expectations about the future energy system, each seeing different implications for the acceptability of energy policies and the compatibility with projections of techno-economic energy scenarios. Cluster 1 expects a system-wide energy transition towards renewable energy sources that is similar to the policy-relevant national energy scenario. Cluster 2 also expects an energy transition, but believes it will lead to a range of technical challenges, societal conflicts and controversies with neighboring countries. Cluster 3 is the only cluster not expecting significant changes in the future energy system and thus not anticipating an energy transition. Cluster 4’s expectations are between cluster 1 and 2, but it anticipates a huge increase in per capita electricity demand while prices are expected to remain low. The study at hand offers some initial insights into the interdependencies between energy transition pathways outlined in techno-economic energy scenarios and the energy system expectations of the public. These insights are essential for gaining a better understanding of whether and how energy scenarios can contribute to informed public debates about energy futures and how desirable pathways towards them might look like."

Although vaccination and antibiotherapy constitute fundamental and complementary strategies against pneumococcal infections, they present some limitations including the increase in non-vaccine serotypes and the emergence of multidrug-resistances, respectively. Ribosomally-synthesized antimicrobial peptides (i.e. bacteriocins) produced by Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) may represent an alternative or complementary strategy to antibiotics for the control of pneumococal infections. We tested the antimicrobial activity of 37 bacteriocinogenic LAB, isolated from food and other sources, against clinical S. pneumoniae strains. Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius LP90, isolated from Venezuelan water-buffalo milk, was selected because of its broad and strong anti-pneumococcal spectrum. The in vitro safety assessment of S. infantarius LP90 revealed that it may be considered avirulent. The analysis of a 19,539-bp cluster showed the presence of 29 putative open reading frames (ORFs), including the genes encoding 8 new class II-bacteriocins, as well as the proteins involved in their secretion, immunity and regulation. Transcriptional analyses evidenced that the induction factor (IF) structural gene, the bacteriocin/IF transporter genes, the bacteriocin structural genes and most of the bacteriocin immunity genes were transcribed. MALDI-TOF analyses of peptides purified using different multichromatographic procedures revealed that the dairy strain S. infantarius LP90 produces at least 6 bacteriocins, including infantaricin A1, a novel anti-pneumococcal two-peptide bacteriocin."
https://openalex.org/W3010066601,"RNA biogenesis and mRNA transport are an intricate process for every eukaryotic cell. SAGA, a transcriptional coactivator and TREX-2 are the two major complexes participate in this process. Sus1 is a transcription export factor and part of both the SAGA and the TREX-2 complex. The competitive exchange of Sus1 molecule between SAGA and TREX-2 complex modulates their function which is credited to structural plasticity of Sus1. Here, we portray the biophysical characterization of Sus1 from S. cerevisiae. The recombinant Sus1 is a α-helical structure which is stable at various pH conditions. We reported the α-helix to β-sheet transition at the low pH as well as at high pH. Sus1 showed 50% reduction in the fluorescence intensity at pH-2 as compared to native protein. The fluorescence studies demonstrated the unfolding of tertiary structure of the protein with variation in pH as compared to neutral pH. The same results were obtained in the ANS binding and acrylamide quenching studies. Similarly, the secondary structure of the Sus1 was found to be stable till 55% alcohol concentration while tertiary structure was stable up to 20% alcohol concentration. Further increase in the alcohol concentration destabilizes the secondary as well as tertiary structure. The 300 mM concentration of ammonium sulfate also stabilizes the secondary structure of the protein. The structural characterization of this protein is expected to unfold the process of the transportation of the mRNA with cooperation of different proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3009442131,"The role of fathers in (co-)parenting their children among refugee and disadvantaged families in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains poorly understood. This study sought to examine the associations among mothers’ perceptions of their husband’s involvement (hereafter referred to as paternal involvement), and her perceptions of her own well-being and a number of other variables, as well as observed mother-child interactions in families living in refugee and disadvantaged communities in Beirut, Lebanon. We analyzed baseline data from 104 mother-child dyads (mean age of children = 4.34 years; range = 2.05 to 7.93 years of age) who participated in a randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the impact of the Mother-Child Education Program in Beirut. In addition to the mother’s perception of paternal involvement and the videotaped mother-child interactions, data were collected concerning the mother’s well-being and her level of social support, as well as her level of stress as a parent and the way her children were disciplined in the family. Mother-child pairs were videotaped while completing a puzzle together and dyadic interactions were coded. Path analysis showed that paternal involvement was significantly associated with a higher level of maternal well-being and lower distress levels. In addition, higher levels of maternal distress were associated with higher levels of harsh discipline and parenting stress. Correlation analysis showed that higher perceptions of paternal involvement were associated with more positive affect displayed by the child, more positive regard for the child, and better mother-child synchrony during the dyadic interactions. Limitations include the cross-sectional design and the modest sample size, which hinder causal inferences and generalizability of the findings. These preliminary findings suggest that higher levels of paternal involvement may have an impact on markers of maternal mental health and positive mother-child interactions in families living in disadvantaged communities or humanitarian settings. Paternal involvement should be considered when designing and implementing parenting programs in LMICs."

However, certain population strata have reduced prevalence for all three diseases, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We sought to identify the phenotypic, genomic and metabolomic characteristics of the low-prevalence population to gain insights into possible innate non-susceptibility against metabolic diseases. We performed k-means cluster analysis of 16,792 subjects using anthropometric and clinical biochemistry data collected by the Taiwan Biobank. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra-based metabolome analysis was carried out for 217 subjects with normal body mass index, good exercise habits and healthy lifestyles. We found that the gene APOA5 was significantly associated with reduced prevalence of disease, and lesser associations included the genes HIF1A, LIMA1, LPL, MLXIPL, and TRPC4. Blood plasma of subjects belonging to the low disease prevalence cluster exhibited lowered levels of the GlycA inflammation marker, very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, valine and leucine compared to controls. Literature mining revealed that these genes and metabolites are biochemically linked, with the linkage between lipoprotein metabolism and inflammation being particularly prominent. The combination of phenomic, genomic and metabolomic analysis may also be applied towards the study of metabolic disease prevalence in other populations."
https://openalex.org/W3009739197,"HIV disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TW). These populations use alcohol more heavily than the general population, and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are more prevalent among them. Naltrexone (NTX) has documented efficacy and safety as a medication-assisted therapy for AUD. Its use has not been well-examined in persons with HIV (PWH) newly initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) where the possibility of hepatotoxicity may be increased when initating multiple new medications. This study assessed the safety of oral NTX treatment (50 mg daily) initiated concomitantly with antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of NTX in MSM/TW in Lima, Peru among MSM and TW with AUD (AUDIT score ≥ 8). We analyzed adverse event data from ART-naïve participants (N = 155) who were randomized (2:1) to initiate ART plus NTX (N = 103) or ART plus placebo (N = 52). Participants were monitored for 24 weeks while taking ART plus NTX/placebo, followed by 24 weeks receiving ART alone. Over 48 weeks, 135 grade 2 or 3 adverse events were reported, resulting in 1.3 clinical adverse events per participant equally represented in both treatment and placebo arms. Two serious adverse events occurred among two participants receiving NTX; neither was attributed to the study medication. No significant differences were found in the proportion of subjects reporting any adverse events between treatment arms across all time-points. These results suggest NTX is safe in MSM/TW PWH with AUD newly initiating ART, as no excess of clinical adverse events or transaminase elevation was associated with NTX use."

By contrast, little is known about how gay men respond to masculine facial characteristics. One area of disagreement in the emerging literature on this topic is the association between gay men’s partnership status and masculinity preference. One study found that partnered gay men showed stronger preferences for masculine faces than did single gay men, while another study found that partnered gay men showed weaker preferences for masculine faces than did single gay men. We re-examined this issue in a sample of 618 gay men, finding no significant difference between partnered and single gay men’s masculinity preferences. Together with the mixed previous findings, our null result suggests that the effect of partnership status on gay men’s face preferences is not robust."
https://openalex.org/W3009083496,"There is a limited evaluation of an independent linguistic battery for early diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease (MCI-AD). We hypothesized that an independent linguistic battery comprising of only the language components or subtests of popular test batteries could give a better clinical diagnosis for MCI-AD compared to using an exhaustive battery of tests. As such, we combined multiple clinical datasets and performed Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to extract the underlying linguistic constructs from a combination of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s disease (CERAD), Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) Logical Memory (LM) I and II, and the Boston Naming Test. Furthermore, we trained a machine-learning algorithm that validates the clinical relevance of the independent linguistic battery for differentiating between patients with MCI-AD and cognitive healthy control individuals. Our EFA identified ten linguistic variables with distinct underlying linguistic constructs that show Cronbach’s alpha of 0.74 on the MCI-AD group and 0.87 on the healthy control group. Our machine learning evaluation showed a robust AUC of 0.97 when controlled for age, sex, race, and education, and a clinically reliable AUC of 0.88 without controlling for age, sex, race, and education. Overall, the linguistic battery showed a better diagnostic result compared to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), and a combination of MMSE and CDR."
https://openalex.org/W3009935935,"Few reports have described the clinical and prognostic characteristics of endometrial cancer, which is increasing worldwide, in large patient series in Brazil. Our objective was to analyze the clinicopathological characteristics, prognostic factors, and outcomes of patients with endometrial cancer treated and followed at a tertiary Brazilian institution over a 10-year period.This retrospective study included 703 patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer who were treated at a public academic tertiary hospital between 2008 and 2018. The following parameters were analyzed: age at diagnosis, race, body mass index, serum CA125 level before treatment; histological type and grade, and surgical stage. Outcomes were reported relative to histological type, surgical staging, serum CA125, lymph-vascular space involvement (LVSI), and lymph-node metastasis. The median patient age at diagnosis was 63 (range, 27–93) years (6.4% were <50 years). Minimally invasive surgeries were performed in 523 patients (74.4%). Regarding histological grade, 468 patients (66.5%) had low-grade endometrioid histology and 449 patients (63.9%) had stage I tumors. Tumors exceeded 2.0 cm in 601 patients (85.5%). Lymphadenectomy was performed in 551 cases (78.4%). LVSI was present in 208 of the patients’ tumors (29.5%). Ninety-three patients (13.2%) had recurrent tumors and 97 (13.7%) died from their malignant disease. The robust prognostic value of FIGO stage and lymph node status were confirmed. Other important survival predictors were histological grade and LVSI [overall survival: hazard ratio (HR) = 3.75, p < 0.001 and HR = 2.01, p = 0.001; recurrence: HR = 2.49, p = 0.004 and HR = 3.22, p = 0.001, respectively). Disease-free (p = 0.087) and overall survival (p = 0.368) did not differ significantly between patients with stage II and III disease. These results indicate that prognostic role of cervical involvement should be explored further. This study reports the characteristics and outcomes of endometrial cancer in a large population from a single institution, with systematic surgical staging, a predominance of minimally invasive procedures, and well-documented outcomes. Prognostic factors in the present study population were generally similar to those in other countries, though our patients’ tumors were larger than in studies elsewhere due to later diagnosis. Our unexpected finding of similar prognoses of stage II and III patients raises questions about the prognostic value of cervical involvement and possible differences between carcinomas originating in the lower uterine segment versus those originating in the body and fundus. The present findings can be used to guide public policies aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of endometrial cancer in Brazil and other similar countries."
https://openalex.org/W3009997443,"Entamoeba histolytica is a food- and waterborne parasite that causes amebic dysentery and amoebic liver abscesses. Adhesion is one of the most important virulence functions as it facilitates motility, colonization of host, destruction of host tissue, and uptake of nutrients by the parasite. The parasite cell surface adhesin, the Gal/GalNAc lectin, facilitates parasite-host interaction by binding to galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues on host components. It is composed of heavy (Hgl), intermediate (Igl), and light (Lgl) subunits. Igl is constitutively localized to lipid rafts (cholesterol-rich membrane domains), whereas Hgl and Lgl transiently associate with rafts. When all three subunits are localized to rafts, galactose-sensitive adhesion is enhanced. Thus, submembrane location may regulate the function of this adhesion. Rhomboid proteases are a conserved family of intramembrane proteases that also participate in the regulation of parasite-host interactions. In E. histolytica, one rhomboid protease, EhROM1, cleaves Hgl as a substrate, and knockdown of its expression inhibits parasite-host interactions. Since rhomboid proteases are found within membranes, it is not surprising that lipid composition regulates their activity and enzyme-substrate binding. Given the importance of the lipid environment for both rhomboid proteases and the Gal/GalNAc lectin, we sought to gain insight into the relationship between rhomboid proteases and submembrane location of the lectin in E. histolytica. We demonstrated that EhROM1, itself, is enriched in highly buoyant triton-insoluble membranes reminiscent of rafts. Reducing rhomboid protease activity, either pharmacologically or genetically, correlated with an enrichment of Hgl and Lgl in rafts. In a mutant cell line with reduced EhROM1 expression, there was also a significant augmentation of the level of all three Gal/GalNAc subunits on the cell surface and an increase in the molecular weight of Hgl and Lgl. Overall, the study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms governing parasite-host adhesion for this pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W3010313409,"The effects of habitat loss on the distribution of populations are often linked with species specialization degree. Specialist species can be more affected by changes in landscape structure and local patch characteristics compared to generalist species. Moreover, the spatial scale at which different land covers (eg. habitat, cropland, urban areas) affect specialist species can be smaller. Specialization is usually assumed as a constant trait along the distribution range of species. However, for several taxa, there is evidence of higher specialization degree in peripheral populations compared with populations in the core. Hence, peripheral populations should have a higher sensitivity to habitat loss, and strongest effects should be found at a smaller spatial scale. To test these expectations, we implemented a patch-landscape approach at different spatial scales, and compared effects of landscape structure and patch characteristics on occupancy probability among northern peripheral, more specialized populations (Czech Republic) and core populations (Bulgaria) of the eastern green lizard Lacerta viridis. We found that landscape structure and patch characteristics affect differently the occupancy probability of Lacerta viridis in each region. Strongest effects of habitat loss were found at a spatial scale of 150m around patches in the periphery, but at a scale of 500m in the core. In the periphery occupancy probability of populations was principally affected by landscape composition, and the effect of habitat quality was stronger compared to core populations. In the core, persistence of populations was mainly explained by characteristics of the spatial configuration of habitat patches. We discuss possible ecological mechanisms behind the relationship between sensitivity to habitat loss, populations’ specialization degree and position in the distribution range, and suggest conservation measures for L. viridis."
https://openalex.org/W3009116841,"We studied a cohort of 367 healthy related donors who volunteered to donate their hematopoietic stem cells for allogeneic transplantation. All donors were homogeneously cared for at a single institution, and received rhG-CSF as a mobilization treatment prior to undergoing apheresis. Peripheral blood CD34+ cell counts were used as the main surrogate marker for rhG-CSF induced mobilization. We searched whether inter-individual variations in known genetic polymorphisms located in genes whose products are functionally important for mobilization, could affect the extent of CD34+ mobilization, either individually or in combination. We found little or no influence of individual SNPs or haplotypes for the SDF1, CXCR4, VCAM and VLA4 genes, whether using CD34+ cell counts as a continuous or a categorical variable. Simple clinical characteristics describing donors such as body mass index, age and possibly sex are more potent predictors of stem cell mobilization. The size of our cohort remains relatively small for genetic analyses, however compares favorably with cohorts analyzed in previously published reports suggesting associations of genetic traits to response to rhG-CSF; notwithstanding this limitation, our data do not support the use of genetic analyses when the choice exists of several potential donors for a given patient."

Purpose of this study was to determine whether vibration acceleration directly affects cells around the fracture site and promotes endochondral ossification. Four-week-old female Wistar Hannover rats were divided into two groups (vibration [V group] and control [C group]). The eighth ribs on both sides were cut vertically using scissors. From postoperative day 3 to 11, vibration acceleration using Power Plate® (30 Hz, low amplitude [30-Low], 10 min/day) was applied in the V group. Mature calluses appeared earlier in the V group than in the C group by histological analysis. The GAG content in the fracture callus on day 6 was significantly higher in the V group than in the C group. The mRNA expressions of SOX-9, aggrecan, and Col-II in the fracture callus on day 6 and Col-X on day 9 were significantly higher in the V group than in the C group. For in vitro analysis, four different conditions of vibration acceleration (30 or 50 Hz with low or high amplitude [30-Low, 30-High, 50-Low, and 50-High], 10 min/day) were applied to a prechondrogenic cell (ATDC5) and an undifferentiated cell (C3H10T1/2). There was no significant difference in cell proliferation between the control and any of the four vibration conditions for both cell lines. For both cell lines, alcian blue staining was greater under 30-Low and 50-Low conditions than under control as well as 30-High and 50-High conditions on days 7 and 14. Vibration acceleration under 30-L condition upregulated chondrogenic gene expressions of SOX-9, aggrecan, Col-II, and Col-X. Low-amplitude vibration acceleration can promote endochondral ossification in the fracture healing in vivo and chondrogenic differentiation in vitro."

However, the sensory basis of the magnetic compass still remains a puzzle. A large body of indirect evidence suggests that magnetic compass in birds is localized in the retina. To confirm this point, an evidence of visual signals modulation by magnetic field (MF) should be obtained. In a previous study we showed that MF inclination impacts the amplitude of ex vivo electroretinogram (ERG) recorded from isolated pigeon retina. Here we present the results of an analysis of putative MF effect on one component of ERG, the photoreceptor's response, isolated from the total ERG by adding sodium aspartate and barium chloride to the perfusion solution. Photoresponses were recorded from isolated retinae of domestic pigeons Columba livia. The retinal samples were placed in MF that was modulated by three pairs of orthogonal Helmholtz coils. Light stimuli (blue and red) were applied under two inclinations of MF, 0° and 90°. In all the experiments, preparations from two parts of retina were used, red field (with dominant red-sensitive cones) and yellow field (with relatively uniform distribution of cone color types). In contrast to the whole retinal ERG, we did not observe any effect of MF inclination on either amplitude or kinetics of pharmacologically isolated photoreceptor responses to blue or red half-saturating flashes. A possible explanations of these results could be that magnetic compass sense is localized in retinal cells other than photoreceptors, or that photoreceptors do participate in magnetoreception, but require some processing of compass information in other retinal layers, so that only whole retina signal can reflect the response to changing MF."
https://openalex.org/W3010576805,"The prolonged manifestation of concurrent leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and normal C-reactive protein (CRP) (named as SFTS prediction score) in febrile diseases is not usual and may be used to make an initial differential diagnosis, which is a characteristic finding of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS).The dynamics of SFTS prediction scores was investigated in SFTS patients. The study subjects for the comparison were febrile patients aged ≥ 16 years with SFTS scores of 2 (S2) or 3 (S3) who visited an emergency room for a 4-year study period. The dynamic distribution of S2 and S3 at presentation with regards to onset of illness, the characteristics of responsible diseases and the predictability of SFTS in both groups were described.In 104 patients with SFTS, the daily proportion of S2 or S3 ranged from 58.3 to 100% from day (D) 1 to D12 after the onset of illness. The S2 subtype of 'leukopenia plus thrombocytopenia' and S3 represented 72.7-100% of all scores. In contrast, for the 130 patients in the febrile cohort, 73.8% of evaluations were distributed between D1 and D4 after the onset of illness, and 68.8% of patients had the S2 subtype of 'leukopenia plus normal CRP'. Upper respiratory infection was the most frequent (50.0%) cause of diseases. Pneumonia (13.8%) and urosepsis (6.2%) initially presented with either S2 with normal CRP or S3 but had poor prognosis. The presence of S2 or S3 predicted SFTS with sensitivity and specificity of 0.85 (0.42-0.99; 95% CI) and 0.98 (0.98-0.98; 95% CI), respectively.The temporal distribution and composition of S2 or S3 were unique in several febrile diseases including SFTS, and the SFTS prediction score may be useful for differentiating febrile diseases in primary care settings of SFTS endemic areas."
https://openalex.org/W3010083099,"Determination of hepatic volume is an important preoperative procedure and is done through imaging exams or standard liver volume (SLV) formulas developed based on the biotype of each population. In the absence of a specific SLV formula for the Brazilian Eastern Amazon population, the measurement of liver volume is made with reference values from other populations. The aim of study was to compare the hepatic volume in healthy residents from the Brazilian Eastern Amazon population obtained with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and recommended SLV formulas validated to other populations. This was a Observational, cross-sectional study. Anthropometric data of 42 healthy individuals aged 18-60 years of both sexes was collected to measure the liver volume through SLV formulas calculations and MRI. MRI shows similarity with the Western European SLV liver volume values and significant differences with the Japan SLV formula, mainly for women, with a moderate-to-weak correlation with the MRI measurements. There was a strong correlation between weight and body surface area in male patients analysed with measurements of the liver volume by the MRI and SLV formulas. The SLV formula based on the Western European population could be used in the absence of a specific formula for individuals living in the Amazon region. The results suggest that liver measurement formulas should take into consideration the sex of individuals, as well as the development of a specific SLV formula for the Eastern Amazon population and the conduction of similar studies in other Brazilian regions."
https://openalex.org/W3010449570,"Simplification of stand structure of forests and woodlands through human-induced modification is a serious threat to biodiversity. Restoring lost habitat complexity and heterogeneity, such as woody debris, requires an understanding of the relationships between different elements that contribute to stand structure. In this study, we examine the structure and composition of a critically endangered box-gum grassy woodland in south-eastern Australia and relationships with woody debris loads. We found that: (1) despite modification by humans and differing susceptibility to dieback, the two dominant tree species, Blakeley’s red gum, Eucalyptus blakelyi and yellow box, E. melliodora, occurred in similar proportions irrespective of vegetation density; (2) E. blakelyi had the largest number of stems and basal area, but while E. melliodora had fewer stems, it had a similar basal area to E. blakelyi. E. melliodora also showed fewer signs of dieback than E. blakelyi with between 40–50% trees in good condition compared to 2% for the latter species; (3) woody debris loads were low compared to other studies in woodland, but there were levels of heterogeneity indicating ‘natural’ accumulation was occurring; (4) tree basal area and woody debris loads had a 1:1 relationship across all sites and vegetation densities. Overall, our study indicated that ecosystem recovery was taking place (i.e. with many young trees), but there were fewer large trees that are known to supply most woody debris. Our findings highlight the slow accumulation of this critical resource because the volumes were lower than expected. Based on our results, we recommend: (1) aiming for approximately a 50:50 ratio of yellow box to Blakely's red gum basal area in woodland restoration projects; (2) to accelerate the recovery of woodland structure, addition of woody debris should be added at a minimum ratio of 1:1 to standing basal area (i.e. a basal area of 5.99 m2 requires a minimum volume of 3.11 m3) (3) managing for both volume and heterogeneity of woody debris loads; (4) preserving large diameter trees to harness proportionally higher woody debris and litter inputs."
https://openalex.org/W3010238885,"Background Cytotoxic drugs constitute an important workplace hazard in the hospital environment. Our aim was to conduct an environmental assessment of hazardous drugs in the Oncology Center of Cyprus. Methods Wipe samples were obtained from 42 workplace areas of the Oncology Center including two pairs of gloves in an initial assessment, while 10 samples were obtained at follow-up 3 years later. Potential contamination with cyclophosphamide (CP), ifosphamide (IF) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and other cytotoxic medications was examined using the GC-MSMS system (CP, IF) and the HPLC system with UV detection (5-FU) method, respectively. Results Wipe sample contamination was detected at 11.9% and 15% in the initial and follow-up assessment, respectively. Both pairs of gloves assessed were free from contamination. The results showed contamination with cyclophosphamide on the work space inside the isolator, on a day-care office phone and on the central pharmacy bench. Ifosphamide was only detected on the floor of a patient's room. Contamination with 5-fluorouracil was found only on the surface of a prepared IV infusion bag. The levels of contamination in the positive samples ranged from 0.05 to 10.12 ng/cm2. Conclusions The overall percentage of sample contamination at the Oncology Center was very low compared to other centers around the world. In addition, the detected levels of contamination with cytotoxic drugs were relatively low with the exception of the workspace inside the biological safety cabinet. These results in both assessments may reflect the implementation of comprehensive control measures including employee training, technological equipment and effective cleaning procedures."
