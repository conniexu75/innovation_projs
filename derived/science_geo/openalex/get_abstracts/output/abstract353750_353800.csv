https://openalex.org/W2044063309,"TH17 cells (a subset of interleukin (IL)-17-producing T helper cells) are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of a number of human autoimmune diseases. This study examines which cytokines are required for the production of IL-17A by memory and naive human CD4 T cells. The data demonstrate that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is critical for the differentiation of TH17 cells from highly purified naive CD4+ T cells, but not necessary for induction of IL-17 from committed memory CD4+ T cells. The TH17 pathway is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of a number of human autoimmune diseases. This study examines which cytokines are required for the production of IL-17A by memory and naive human CD4+ T cells. The recent discovery of CD4+ T cells characterized by secretion of interleukin (IL)-17 (TH17 cells) and the naturally occurring regulatory FOXP3+ CD4 T cell (nTreg) has had a major impact on our understanding of immune processes not readily explained by the TH1/TH2 paradigm. TH17 and nTreg cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis1,2. Our recent data and the work of others demonstrated that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and IL-6 are responsible for the differentiation of naive mouse T cells into TH17 cells, and it has been proposed that IL-23 may have a critical role in stabilization of the TH17 phenotype3,4,5. A second pathway has been discovered in which a combination of TGF-β and IL-21 is capable of inducing differentiation of mouse TH17 cells in the absence of IL-6 (refs 6–8). However, TGF-β and IL-6 are not capable of differentiating human TH17 cells2,9 and it has been suggested that TGF-β may in fact suppress the generation of human TH17 cells10. Instead, it has been recently shown that the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-23 are capable of driving IL-17 secretion in short-term CD4+ T cell lines isolated from human peripheral blood11, although the factors required for differentiation of naive human CD4 to TH17 cells are still unknown. Here we confirm that whereas IL-1β and IL-6 induce IL-17A secretion from human central memory CD4+ T cells, TGF-β and IL-21 uniquely promote the differentiation of human naive CD4+ T cells into TH17 cells accompanied by expression of the transcription factor RORC2. These data will allow the investigation of this new population of TH17 cells in human inflammatory disease."

We analyzed an engineered mouse strain carrying a chromosomal deficiency spanning a segment syntenic to the human 22q11.2 locus. We uncovered a previously unknown alteration in the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) and identified a subset of brain miRNAs affected by the microdeletion. We provide evidence that the abnormal miRNA biogenesis emerges because of haploinsufficiency of the Dgcr8 gene, which encodes an RNA-binding moiety of the 'microprocessor' complex and contributes to the behavioral and neuronal deficits associated with the 22q11.2 microdeletion."
https://openalex.org/W2071534620,"The existence of a small population of 'cancer-initiating cells' responsible for tumour maintenance has been firmly demonstrated in leukaemia. This concept is currently being tested in solid tumours. Leukaemia-initiating cells, particularly those that are in a quiescent state, are thought to be resistant to chemotherapy and targeted therapies, resulting in disease relapse. Chronic myeloid leukaemia is a paradigmatic haematopoietic stem cell disease in which the leukaemia-initiating-cell pool is not eradicated by current therapy, leading to disease relapse on drug discontinuation. Here we define the critical role of the promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) tumour suppressor in haematopoietic stem cell maintenance, and present a new therapeutic approach for targeting quiescent leukaemia-initiating cells and possibly cancer-initiating cells by pharmacological inhibition of PML."

https://openalex.org/W2006193439,"As a model for defining the role of lysosomal cathepsins in apoptosis, we characterized the action of the lysosomotropic agent LeuLeuOMe using distinct cellular models. LeuLeuOMe induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization, resulting in release of lysosomal cathepsins that cleave the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid and degrade the antiapoptotic member Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1. The papain-like cysteine protease inhibitor E-64d largely prevented apoptosis, Bid cleavage, and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Mcl-1 degradation. The pancaspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)fluoromethyl ketone failed to prevent Bid cleavage and degradation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologues but substantially decreased cell death, suggesting that cathepsin-mediated apoptosis in these cellular models mostly follows a caspase-dependent pathway. Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that one or more of the cysteine cathepsins B, L, S, K, and H could cleave Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Bak, and BimEL, whereas no Bax cleavage was observed. On the basis of inhibitor studies, we demonstrate that lysosomal disruption triggered by LeuLeuOMe occurs before mitochondrial damage. We propose that degradation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members by lysosomal cathepsins synergizes with cathepsin-mediated activation of Bid to trigger a mitochondrial pathway to apoptosis. Moreover, XIAP (X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) was also found to be a target of cysteine cathepsins, suggesting that cathepsins can mediate caspase-dependent apoptosis also downstream of mitochondria.

Moreover, XIAP (X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) was also found to be a target of cysteine cathepsins, suggesting that cathepsins can mediate caspase-dependent apoptosis also downstream of mitochondria. The major mechanism for removal of superfluous and potentially dangerous cells in eukaryotic organisms is apoptotic cell death. One of the central points of regulation of apoptotic cell death is mitochondria. They serve as sensors of cellular damage, and after mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) 4The abbreviations used are: MMP, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization; AC27P, acetyl-calpastatin 27-peptide; BH, Bcl-2 homology domain; ΔΨm, mitochondrial membrane potential; E-64d, L-trans-epoxysuccinyl(OEt)-Leu-3-methylbutylamide; LeuLeuOMe, L-leucyl-l-leucine methyl ester; LMP, lysosomal membrane permeabilization; PARP, poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase; z-VAD-fmk, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)fluoromethyl ketone; 7-AAD, 7 aminoactinomycin D; XIAP, X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis; NHDF, normal human dermal fibroblasts; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine. 4The abbreviations used are: MMP, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization; AC27P, acetyl-calpastatin 27-peptide; BH, Bcl-2 homology domain; ΔΨm, mitochondrial membrane potential; E-64d, L-trans-epoxysuccinyl(OEt)-Leu-3-methylbutylamide; LeuLeuOMe, L-leucyl-l-leucine methyl ester; LMP, lysosomal membrane permeabilization; PARP, poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase; z-VAD-fmk, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)fluoromethyl ketone; 7-AAD, 7 aminoactinomycin D; XIAP, X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis; NHDF, normal human dermal fibroblasts; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine. they release a number of factors, such as cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo, which are critically involved in cell death signaling (1Green D.R.

As such, they are also centrally involved in the activation of caspases, a family of cysteine proteases that cleave a subset of cellular proteins, thereby signaling the execution phase of the apoptotic cell death program. Although caspases can also be activated in the absence of mitochondria after death receptor activation, in type 2 cells (cells in which Fas-mediated apoptosis can be blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2) the signal is amplified through caspase 8-mediated activation of Bid and subsequent MMP, thereby linking the extrinsic (death receptor pathway) and the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways (3Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6211) Google Scholar). Regulation of apoptosis is achieved through the action of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members upstream of mitochondria (4Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 5Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar).In addition to mitochondria, there is considerable evidence that also other organelles, such as lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum, are tightly linked with cell death (8Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 9Bredesen D.E. Rao R.V. Mehlen P. Nature. 2006; 443: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Lysosomes are acidic organelles containing a wide spectrum of hydrolytic enzymes that have a major role in intracellular protein recycling. Among them the most abundant and the best characterized are the cathepsins (10Turk B. Turk D. Turk V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 11Turk V.

Most of the cathepsins are cysteine proteases, such as cathepsins B, L, S, V, C, F, K, X, and H, whereas cathepsin D is an aspartic protease, and cathepsin G a serine protease (12Turk B. Stoka V. Rozman-Pungerčar J. Cirman T. Droga-Mazovec G. Oresič K. Turk V. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although cysteine cathepsins were long believed to be unstable at neutral pH, it is now clear that a number of them remain active at neutral pH for a certain amount of time, varying from minutes (cathepsin L (14Turk B. Dolenc I. Turk V. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)) to hours (cathepsins S (12Turk B. Stoka V. Rozman-Pungerčar J. Cirman T. Droga-Mazovec G. Oresič K. Turk V. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)).Initially lysosomes and lysosomal proteases were believed to be mainly involved in terminal steps of necrotic and autophagic cell death (15Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2928) Google Scholar, 16Kroemer G. Jäättelä M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). However, more recently they were also found to be associated with apoptotic cell death (17Guicciardi M.E. Deussing J. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Svingen P.A. Peters C. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. J. Clin.

Rozman-Pungerčar J. Cirman T. Droga-Mazovec G. Oresič K. Turk V. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A critical step in the pathway is lysosomal rupture, often referred to as small-scale lysosomal leakage, which is followed by the release of lysosomal cathepsins into the cytosol (12Turk B. Stoka V.

FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2761-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It has been shown that lysosomes are particularly sensitive toward oxidative stress (21Ollinger K. Brunk U. Free Radic.

Several studies suggest that lysosomal membrane permeabilization-induced cathepsin leakage leads to MMP and subsequent release of proapoptotic factors followed by caspase activation (19Brunk U.T.

Initial studies in a cell-free system suggested Bid cleavage by lysosomal cathepsins as a possible link, as cathepsins failed to activate executioner caspases directly (34Stoka V. Turk B. Schendel S.L. Kim T.H. Cirman T. Snipas S.J. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Freeze H. Abrahamson M. Bromme D. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Yin X.M. Turk V. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol.

This was later confirmed in several cellular models such as LeuLeuOMe-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, with multiple cysteine cathepsins suggested to be responsible for the cleavage of Bid (32Cirman T.

However, apoptosis was found to be induced also in the absence of Bid cleavage in cellular models (35Boya P. Gonzalez-Polo R.A. Poncet D. Andreau K. Vieira H.L. Roumier T. Perfettini J.L. Kroemer G.

Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that cathepsins can induce apoptosis through cleavage of other cytosolic proteins, which however, remained unidentified.To address these questions we have focused on the mechanism of cell death triggered by the lysosomotropic reagent LeuLeuOMe, currently in phase II clinical trials for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a number of different cell lines. Lysosomal rupture was found to precede mitochondrial membrane permeabilization accompanied by major ultrastructural changes of mitochondria and subsequent cytochrome c release. In addition to cleavage of Bid in different cell models, we show here that the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 are also substrates for cathepsins. Moreover, XIAP was also found to be a target of multiple cysteine cathepsins in several cell lines, suggesting that cathepsins can mediate caspase-dependent apoptosis both upstream and downstream of mitochondria.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The following antibodies were used: anti-Bcl-xL (H-62), anti-Bcl-2 (C-2), and anti-Bak (H-211) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-Mcl-1 (RC13) from Abcam, anti-cytochrome c from BD PharMingen, anti-actin from Sigma, anti-PARP antibodies recognizing caspase-cleaved PARP from Promega, anti-Bid from R&D Systems, anti-XIAP from BD Transduction Laboratories, and anti-cathepsin L, which were prepared in the laboratory (41Kopitar-Jerala N.

Prestained protein markers were from Bio-Rad and Fermentas. All other reagents were of analytical grade.Cell Cultures—The following cell lines were used in the experiments: human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, human immortalized keratinocytes HaCaT, human adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa, human hepatoma cell line HepG2, human colon carcinoma cell line CaCo-2, and human embryonic kidney fibroblasts HEK293, purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 purchased from the German Resource Centre for Biological Material (DSMZ), and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) purchased from CAMBREX Bio Science Walkersville. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% or 20% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) under standard conditions.Induction of Apoptosis, Cell Lysis, and Western Blotting—Cells were cultured at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 6-well plates overnight before the treatment with the lysosomotropic agent LeuLeuOMe at the final concentration of 1-2 mm depending on the cell line.

Proteins were then visualized with ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. To confirm equal protein loading, all immunoblots were also probed with actin. All experiments were repeated at least three times.Apoptosis Quantification—Apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry measurements of phosphatidylserine exposure and 7-AAD incorporation to measure membrane integrity and by measurements of the DEVDase activity of the caspases. Briefly, 100-μl aliquots of cells were labeled with annexin V-PE and 7-AAD according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then subjected to flow cytometry analysis using a FACS-calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with the CellQuest software. Alternatively, 50 μg of protein of untreated and LeuLeuOMe-treated cells in the presence or absence of inhibitors were used to determine caspase activity by measuring the proteolytic cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Bachem) as previously described (32Cirman T. Orešić K. Droga-Mazovec G. Turk V. Reed J.C. Myers R.M. Salvesen G.S. Turk B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3578-3587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Microscopy and Flow Cytometry Quantification of Mitochondria and Lysosomes—The integrity of mitochondria and lysosomes was monitored based on uptake of Mitotracker Red CMXRos and Lysotracker Green DND-26, respectively. Briefly, Mitotracker CMXRos was added to the cells at a final concentration of 30 nm. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, cells were viewed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71; excitation 516-555 nm, emission 574-648 nm). In parallel, red fluorescence of 5000 cells per sample, corresponding to mitochondria, was determined by flow cytometry using the FL3 channel. Alternatively, Lysotracker Green DND-26 was added to the cells at a final concentration of 35 nm, and cells were observed after 5 min of incubation at 37 °C under fluorescence microscope (excitation 461-500 nm, emission 511-560 nm). Green fluorescence of 5000 cells per sample, corresponding to lysosomes, was determined by flow cytometry using the FL1 channel.Transmission Electron Microscopy—Growth medium was removed from the attached cells followed by a washing step with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in Epon812. Ultrathin sections were cut, counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then viewed in Philips CM 100 electron microscope. Essentially the same procedure was used also for detached cells, which were gently spun down before the washing step with phosphate-buffered saline.DNA Constructs—The expression constructs for Bcl-xL (pcDNA3-FLAG-Bcl-xL) and Bak (pcDNA3-HA-Bak) were a gift from Dr. Lawrence Banks (The International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology), whereas pCAGGSh-Bcl-2 was a gift from Dr. Peter Vandenabeele (University of Ghent) (accession number LMBP 4633). Bcl-2 cDNA was excised from pCAGGS using the two EcoRI sites and cloned into the pcDNA3 (Promega) vector at the same site. Bax, Bim EL, and Mcl-1 clones were all a gift from Dr. David Huang (The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute). Expression construct for Bax (pcDNA3-Bax) was made by excising Bax cDNA from pBSIISK using EcoRI and KpnI and cloning it into pcDNA3 at the same sites. Bim EL was cloned into pcDNA3 at EcoRI and NotI restriction sites after excising its cDNA from pBSIISK. Mcl-1 was cloned into pcDNA3 at cloning sites HindIII and EcoRI after excising Mcl-1 cDNA from pEF-FLAG.In Vitro Transcription/Translation and in Vitro Cleavages of the Bcl-2 Homologues—In vitro transcription/translation of the Bcl-2 homologues Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bak, and Bax was performed using wheat germ lysate-TNT T7 Coupled Extract System and [35S]methionine. The efficiency of expression was monitored by analyzing the translates by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Cleavage assays of Bcl-2 homologues with different cathepsins were performed as described previously (32Cirman T. Orešić K. Droga-Mazovec G. Turk V. Reed J.C. Myers R.M. Salvesen G.S. Turk B. J.

The reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.RESULTSLeuLeuOMe Triggers Cathepsin-dependent Apoptosis in Eight Different Cell Lines—LeuLeuOMe accumulates in lysosomes, where it is converted to a membranolytic compound causing loss of lysosomal membrane integrity and subsequent apoptosis (46Thièle D.L. Lipsky P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 47Uchimoto T. Nohara H. Kamehara R. Iwamura M. Watanabe N. Kobayashi Y. Apoptosis. 1999; 4: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). LeuLeuOMe was initially shown to be extremely effective in killing various immune and myeloid tumor cells of bone-marrow origin and to efficiently protect against graft-versus-host disease in a mouse model of bone marrow transplantation (29Charley M. Thiele D.L. Bennett M. Lipsky P.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 78: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 48Thièle D.L. Lipsky P.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3950-3957PubMed Google Scholar). Later studies suggested that other cell types are susceptible to the compound but with lower sensitivity (32Cirman T. Orešić K. Droga-Mazovec G. Turk V. Reed J.C. Myers R.M. Salvesen G.S. Turk B.

Commun. 2000; 272: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism was not clarified, in HeLa cells apoptosis was found to proceed through cathepsin-dependent Bid cleavage and subsequent caspase activation (32Cirman T. Orešić K.

To investigate the generality of this mechanism, the effect of LeuLeuOMe was investigated on eight cancerous or noncancerous cell lines from different tissues to ensure wide coverage. Initially, all cell lines were incubated with 0.25-5.0 mm LeuLeuOMe for 10-24 h followed by measurements of lactate dehydrogenase release using CytoTox-One™ assay (Promega) to investigate for its ability to induce cell death. All cells were found to be sensitive to LeuLeuOMe, which at higher concentrations and prolonged incubation induced necrotic cell death (not shown). LeuLeuOMe at 1 mm was found optimal to induce apoptotic cell death in all cell lines except in HeLa and CaCo-2 cells, where 2 and 3 mm concentration, respectively, was needed for the same effect. The optimal incubation time was found to be between 12-17 h, depending on cell line, and these conditions were used in all subsequent experiments. All cells exposed to LeuLeuOMe exhibited typical apoptotic morphology, such as cell shrinkage, rounding, and detachment from the surface, as observed by light microscopy (supplemental Fig. 1). In agreement with a previous study (32Cirman T. Orešić K. Droga-Mazovec G. Turk V. Reed J.C. Myers R.M. Salvesen G.S. Turk B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3578-3587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), E-64d and to a considerable extent also z-VAD-fmk, blocked apoptotic morphology, whereas the aspartic protease inhibitors pepstatin A and the specific calpastatin inhibitor AC27P had no effect on cellular morphology as well as on the increase of DEVDase activity (data not shown). Apoptotic cell death was confirmed by flow cytometry studies of phosphatidylserine exposure and membrane integrity (Fig. 1A; supplemental Fig. 2), measurements of DEVDase activity representative of caspase activation (Fig. 1B), and by the generation of a specific PARP fragment, generated by caspases during apoptosis (Fig. 1C). Typically, 15-25% cells were apoptotic based on flow cytometry measurements (Fig. 1A; supplemental Fig. 2). Increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells, caspase activity, and PARP cleavage could be completely prevented by both E-64d and z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1, A-C), consistent with an essential role of cysteine cathepsins and the caspases in this model of cell death.A further goal was to address the contribution of cathepsin B, the most abundant cysteine cathepsin in most cells, to LeuLeuOMe-induced apoptosis using a selective cell-permeable cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074Me. As can be seen in Fig. 1D, pretreatm"
https://openalex.org/W2011277283,"Temperature pervasively affects all cellular processes. In response to a rapid increase in temperature, all cells undergo a heat shock response, an ancient and highly conserved program of stress-inducible gene expression, to reestablish cellular homeostasis. In isolated cells, the heat shock response is initiated by the presence of misfolded proteins and therefore thought to be cell-autonomous. In contrast, we show that within the metazoan Caenorhabditis elegans , the heat shock response of somatic cells is not cell-autonomous but rather depends on the thermosensory neuron, AFD, which senses ambient temperature and regulates temperature-dependent behavior. We propose a model whereby this loss of cell autonomy serves to integrate behavioral, metabolic, and stress-related responses to establish an organismal response to environmental change."
https://openalex.org/W2162045495,"The mammary gland epithelium comprises two major cell types: basal and luminal. Basal cells interact directly with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and express higher levels of the ECM receptors, integrins, than luminal cells. We show that deletion of β1 integrin from basal cells abolishes the regenerative potential of the mammary epithelium and affects mammary gland development. The mutant epithelium was characterized by an abnormal ductal branching pattern and aberrant morphogenesis in pregnancy, although at the end of gestation, the secretory alveoli developed from β1 integrin-positive progenitors. Lack of β1 integrin altered the orientation of the basal-cell division axis and in mutant epithelium, in contrast to control tissue, the progeny of β1 integrin-null basal cells, identified by a genetic marker, was found in the luminal compartment. These results reveal, for the first time, the essential role of the basal mammary epithelial cell–ECM interactions mediated by β1 integrins in the maintenance of a functional stem cell population, mammary morphogenesis and segregation of the two major mammary cell lineages."
https://openalex.org/W1974572321,"Here, we report that diesel exhaust particles (DEPs), a major constituent of urban air pollution, affect blood-brain barrier function at the tissue, cellular, and molecular levels. Isolated rat brain capillaries exposed to DEPs showed increased expression and transport activity of the key drug efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (6 h EC(50) was approximately 5 microg/ml). Up-regulation of P-glycoprotein was abolished by blocking transcription or protein synthesis. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase or pretreatment of capillaries with radical scavengers ameliorated DEP-induced P-glycoprotein up-regulation, indicating a role for reactive oxygen species in signaling. DEP exposure also increased brain capillary tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. DEP-induced P-glycoprotein up-regulation was abolished when TNF-receptor 1 (TNF-R1) was blocked and was not evident in experiments with capillaries from TNF-R1 knockout mice. Inhibition of JNK, but not NF-kappaB, blocked DEP-induced P-glycoprotein up-regulation, indicating a role for AP-1 in the signaling pathway. Consistent with this, DEPs increased phosphorylation of c-jun. Together, our results show for the first time that a component of air pollution, DEPs, alters blood-brain barrier function through oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine production. These experiments disclose a novel blood-brain barrier signaling pathway, with clear implications for environmental toxicology, CNS pathology, and the pharmacotherapy of CNS disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1978559606,"The transcription factor snail represses epithelial gene expression and thereby promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and tumor invasion. The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is also involved in EMT and was shown to activate snail. Here, we demonstrate that snail increases Wnt reporter gene activity induced by beta-catenin, LRP6 or dishevelled, and also promotes transcription activated by GAL4-beta-catenin fusion proteins. Snail mutants lacking the transcriptional repressor domain also stimulate beta-catenin-dependent transcription indicating that downregulation of snail target genes is not required for this activity. Snail interacts with beta-catenin in immunoprecipitation experiments at its N-terminus, which is required for activation by snail. In colorectal cancer cell lines, overexpression of snail leads to increased expression of Wnt target genes, whereas downregulation of endogenous snail by siRNA reduces target gene expression. Our data indicate a positive feedback stimulation of the Wnt pathway by activation of snail."
https://openalex.org/W2011521010,"What neural changes underlie individual differences in goal-directed learning? The lateral amygdala (LA) is important for assigning emotional and motivational significance to discrete environmental cues, including those that signal rewarding events. Recognizing that a cue predicts a reward enhances an animal's ability to acquire that reward; however, the cellular and synaptic mechanisms that underlie cue-reward learning are unclear. Here we show that marked changes in both cue-induced neuronal firing and input-specific synaptic strength occur with the successful acquisition of a cue-reward association within a single training session. We performed both in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological recordings in the LA of rats trained to self-administer sucrose. We observed that reward-learning success increased in proportion to the number of amygdala neurons that responded phasically to a reward-predictive cue. Furthermore, cue-reward learning induced an AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole propionic acid)-receptor-mediated increase in the strength of thalamic, but not cortical, synapses in the LA that was apparent immediately after the first training session. The level of learning attained by individual subjects was highly correlated with the degree of synaptic strength enhancement. Importantly, intra-LA NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate)-receptor blockade impaired reward-learning performance and attenuated the associated increase in synaptic strength. These findings provide evidence of a connection between LA synaptic plasticity and cue-reward learning, potentially representing a key mechanism underlying goal-directed behaviour."

We found that doubling the chromosome number added approximately 10 min to a 20 min division, whereas doubling the number of centrosomes added approximately 30 min more. Extra centrosomes and/or chromosomes prolong mitosis by delaying satisfaction of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Thus mitosis can be prolonged by non-genetic means and extra chromosomes and centrosomes probably contribute to the elevated mitotic index seen in many tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2106210309,"Chemoresistance represents a major problem in the treatment of many malignancies. Overcoming this obstacle will require improved understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. The progenitor cell marker NG2/melanoma proteoglycan (MPG) is aberrantly expressed by various tumors, but its role in cell death signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target are largely unexplored. We have assessed cytotoxic drug-induced cell death in glioblastoma spheroids from 15 patients, as well as in five cancer cell lines that differ with respect to NG2/MPG expression. The tumors were treated with doxorubicin, etoposide, carboplatin, temodal, cisplatin and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α. High NG2/MPG expression correlated with multidrug resistance mediated by increased activation of α3β1 integrin/PI3K signaling and their downstream targets, promoting cell survival. NG2/MPG knockdown with shRNAs incorporated into lentiviral vectors attenuated β1 integrin signaling revealing potent antitumor effects and further sensitized neoplastic cells to cytotoxic treatment in vitro and in vivo. Thus, as a novel regulator of the antiapoptotic response, NG2/MPG may represent an effective therapeutic target in several cancer subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2151801593,"Post-translational sumoylation, the covalent attachment of a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), regulates the functions of proteins engaged in diverse processes. Often associated with nuclear and perinuclear proteins, such as transcription factors, it is not known whether SUMO can conjugate to cell-surface receptors for growth factors to regulate their functions. Here we show that the type I transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor, TβRI, is sumoylated in response to TGF-β and that its sumoylation requires the kinase activities of both TβRI and the type II TGF-β receptor, TβRII. Sumoylation of TβRI enhances receptor function by facilitating the recruitment and phosphorylation of Smad3, consequently regulating TGF-β-induced transcription and growth inhibition. TβRI sumoylation modulates the dissemination of transformed cells in a mouse model of TβRI-stimulated metastasis. TβRI sumoylation therefore controls responsiveness to TGF-β, with implications for tumour progression. Sumoylation of cell-surface receptors may regulate other growth factor responses."
https://openalex.org/W2159441837,"In postnatal rodent brain, certain NG2-expressing oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs) are contacted by synaptic terminals from local neurons. However, it has remained elusive whether and when NG2(+) cells are integrated into neuronal circuits. Here we use patch-clamp recordings from mitotic cells in murine brain slices to show that, unlike any other cell in the central nervous system (CNS), cortical NG2(+) cells divide and relocate while being linked to synaptic junctions. Together with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling, our recordings imply that cellular processes that bear synaptic junctions are surprisingly kept during cytokinesis and are inherited by the daughter cells. Cell cycle time (78 h) and relocation speed (5 microm/day) are slowed, and NG2(+) cells largely divide symmetrically. Inheritance of synapses enables newborn glial cells to establish synaptic connections much faster than newborn neurons and ensures that the entire population of NG2(+) cells is exposed to synaptic signals from local axons. The results suggest that synapses do not only transmit neuronal activity but also act as environmental cues for the development of glial cells. Inheritance of synapses allows for the direct transfer of environmental interactions to clonal descendants of OPCs, which might be important for effective colonization and myelination of the developing brain."

https://openalex.org/W2063356497,"In eukaryotes, the single strand DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), is essential for DNA replication, repair, and recombination. RPA is composed of the following three subunits: RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3. The RPA1 subunit contains four structurally related domains and is responsible for high affinity ssDNA binding. This study uses a depletion/replacement strategy in human cells to reveal the contributions of each domain to RPA cellular functions. Mutations that substantially decrease ssDNA binding activity do not necessarily disrupt cellular RPA function. Conversely, mutations that only slightly affect ssDNA binding can dramatically affect cellular function. The N terminus of RPA1 is not necessary for DNA replication in the cell; however, this region is important for the cellular response to DNA damage. Highly conserved aromatic residues in the high affinity ssDNA-binding domains are essential for DNA repair and cell cycle progression. Our findings suggest that as long as a threshold of RPA-ssDNA binding activity is met, DNA replication can occur and that an RPA activity separate from ssDNA binding is essential for function in DNA repair."

In addition to its role as a chemotropic molecule, netrin-1 also acts as a survival factor3,4,5,6,7. Both UNC5 (that is, UNC5A, UNC5B, UNC5C or UNC5D) and DCC are transmembrane receptors for netrin-1 (Refs 8, 9). In the absence of netrin-1, DCC and UNC5 act as dependence receptors and trigger apoptosis3,6,10. However, how netrin-1 suppresses the apoptotic activity of the receptors remains elusive. Here we show that netrin-1 induces interaction of UNC5B with the brain-specific GTPase PIKE-L. This interaction triggers the activation of PtdIns-3-OH kinase signalling, prevents UNC5B's pro-apoptotic activity and enhances neuronal survival. Moreover, this process relies strongly on Fyn because PIKE-L is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to netrin-1, and the netrin-1-mediated interaction of UNC5B with PIKE-L is inhibited in Fyn-null mice. Thus, PIKE-L acts as a downstream survival effector for netrin-1 through UNC5B in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2024858251,"Paclitaxel (PTX) and other microtubule inhibitors cause mitotic arrest. However, low concentrations of PTX (low PTX) paradoxically cause G1 arrest (without mitotic arrest). Here, we demonstrated that unexpectedly, low PTX did not cause G1 arrest in the first cell cycle and did not prevent cells from passing through S phase and entering mitosis. Mitosis was prolonged but cells still divided, producing either two or three cells (tripolar mitosis), thus explaining a sub G1 peak caused by low PTX. Importantly, sub G1 cells were viable and non-apoptotic. Some cells fused back and then progressed to mitosis, frequently producing three cells again before becoming arrested in the next cell-cycle interphase. Thus, low PTX caused postmitotic arrest in second and even the third cell cycles. By increasing concentration of PTX, tripolar mitosis was transformed to mitotic slippage, thus eliminating a sub G1 peak. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that prolonged mitosis ensured a p53-dependent postmitotic arrest. We conclude that PTX directly affects cells only in mitosis and the duration of mitosis determines cell fate, including p53-dependent G1-like arrest."

The GAS strain NS88.2 was isolated from a case of bacteremia from the Northern Territory of Australia, a region with high rates of GAS invasive disease. Mutagenesis of the NS88.2 plasminogen binding M protein Prp was undertaken to examine the contribution of plasminogen binding and cell surface plasmin acquisition to virulence. The isogenic mutant NS88.2prp was engineered whereby four amino acid residues critical for plasminogen binding were converted to alanine codons in the GAS genome sequence. The mutated residues were reverse complemented to the wild-type sequence to construct GAS strain NS88.2prpRC. In comparison to NS88.2 and NS88.2prpRC, the NS88.2prp mutant exhibited significantly reduced ability to bind human plasminogen and accumulate cell surface plasmin activity during growth in human plasma. Utilizing a humanized plasminogen mouse model of invasive infection, we demonstrate that the capacity to bind plasminogen and accumulate surface plasmin activity plays an essential role in GAS virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2145080831,"The removal of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) has proven to be notoriously complicated due to the involvement of multiple pathways of DNA repair, which include the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway, homologous recombination and components of the nucleotide excision and mismatch repair pathways. Members of the SNM1 gene family have also been shown to have a role in mediating cellular resistance to ICLs, although their precise function has remained elusive. Here, we show that knockdown of Snm1B/Apollo in human cells results in hypersensitivity to mitomycin C (MMC), but not to IR. We also show that Snm1B-deficient cells exhibit a defective S phase checkpoint in response to MMC, but not to IR, and this finding may account for the specific sensitivity to the cross-linking drug. Interestingly, although previous studies have largely implicated ATR as the major kinase activated in response to ICLs, we show that it is activation of the ATM-mediated checkpoint that is defective in Snm1B-deficient cells. The requirement for Snm1B in ATM checkpoint activation specifically after ICL damage is correlated with its role in promoting double-strand break formation, and thus replication fork collapse. Consistent with this result Snm1B was found to interact directly with Mus81-Eme1, an endonuclease previously implicated in fork collapse. In addition, we also show that Snm1B interacts with the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex and with FancD2 further substantiating its role as a checkpoint/DNA repair protein."

For double-stranded RNA viruses of the family Reoviridae and negative strand RNA viruses of the order Mononegavirales, all of the enzymatic activities have been detected in single large multidomain proteins (5Hercyk N.

By contrast, the N7 and 2′-O MTase activities contained in the L protein of vesicular stomatis virus (VSV) share a common binding site for AdoMet (10Li J. Fontaine-Rodriguez E.C. Whelan S.P. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 13373-13384Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This unusual MTase enzyme architecture has recently been proposed to be common to the flavivirus NS5 protein, which exhibits both N7 and 2′-O MTase activities but has only a single AdoMet binding site (11Ray D.

The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV types 1–4) are members of the Flavivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae along with a number of other medically important viruses such as West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. The DENVs are transmitted by mosquitoes and infect up to 50 million individuals annually in subtropical and tropical regions of the world. Dengue is currently the most important arthropod-borne viral disease of humans and is described as an emerging disease because of its dramatic resurgence in recent years (13Gubler D.J. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 100-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). At present there is neither a safe and effective vaccine nor suitable anti-viral treatments to control dengue disease. Recent studies have shown that enzymes involved in viral capping have potential as anti-viral targets (14Benarroch D. Egloff M.P. Mulard L. Guerreiro C. Romette J.L. Canard B. J. Biol.

DENV, like other flaviviruses, has a single, positive-stranded RNA genome of ∼11 kilobases that contains a type I cap structure at the 5′ end but lacks a 3′ polyadenylate tail. The viral RNA contains a single long open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein that is cleaved by a combination of cellular signal peptidase and the virally encoded two component serine protease NS2B/NS3. Proteolysis yields three structural (C, prM, and E) and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins; NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 (17Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 991-1042Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of the flavivirus NS3 protein has been shown to possess triphosphatase activity (18Li H.T. Clum S. You S.H. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J.

The N-terminal 296 amino acids of DENV-2 NS5 were initially shown to possess 2′-O MTase activity and the ability to bind GTP (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the MTase domains of WNV, DENV, and yellow fever virus NS5 were found to also possess N7 MTase activity (11Ray D. Shah A. Tilgner M. Guo Y. Zhao Y. Dong H. Deas T.S. Zhou Y. Li H.

Based on genetic and structural data, the structures of the WNV MTase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domains were assembled in silico, providing a hypothetical overall structural view of the flavivirus NS5 protein (31Malet H. Egloff M.P. Selisko B. Butcher R.E. Wright P.J. Roberts M. Gruez A. Sulzenbacher G. Vonrhein C. Bricogne G. Mackenzie J.M. Khromykh A.A. Davidson A.D. Canard B. J. Biol.

Although the flavivirus MTase is now one of the best structurally characterized viral MTase structures, little is still known concerning the mechanisms by which the NS5 protein carries out its multifunctional roles in RNA capping. To obtain further insight into the regions of the flavivirus NS5 protein that participate in N7 and 2′-O MTase activities, we have introduced a number of mutations into the DENV NS5 MTase domain, targeting either residues involved directly in AdoMet binding or proposed to be involved in NS5 conformation and/or charged interactions. The effects of these mutations on (i) N7 and 2′-O MTase activities using biochemical assays based on bacterially expressed forms of the NS5 MTase domain and (ii) viral replication has been examined using a DENV-2 infectious cDNA clone. Using this approach we have identified a number of amino acid mutations that commonly and differentially affect N7 and 2′-O MTase activities and regions of the protein that are likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions or overall stability of the protein. Cells Lines and Virus Titration—The growth of BHK-21, Aedes albopictus C6/36, and Vero cells and the production of DENV-2 stocks in C6/36 cells have all been described previously (32Gualano R.C. Pryor M.J. Cauchi M.R. Wright P.J. Davidson A.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33Pryor M.J. Carr J.M. Hocking H. Davidson A.D. Li P. Wright P.J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 65: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The titer of recombinant viruses in tissue culture media was determined either by (a) plaque assay in C6/36 cells at 28 °C or Vero cells at 37 °C as described previously (32Gualano R.C. Pryor M.J. Cauchi M.R. Wright P.J. Davidson A.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) or (b) TCID50 assay in Vero cells as follows. Viral stocks were serially diluted 10-fold in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Aliquots of each dilution were added to 1 × 104 Vero cells in the same medium in each of 12 wells of a 96-well plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 7–8 days and then examined for cytopathic effect. The TCID50 was calculated according to the method of Reed and Muench (34Reed L.J. Muench H. Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). Viral titers were calculated either as plaque forming units (pfu) or TCID50/ml of initial virus inoculum, respectively. Introduction of NS5 Mutations into Genome Length DENV cDNA—Mutations encoding changes in NS3 and NS5 amino acids were introduced into the genomic length DENV-2 strain New Guinea C (NGC) cDNA clone pDVWS601, which yields the virus v601 (32Gualano R.C. Pryor M.J. Cauchi M.R. Wright P.J. Davidson A.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33Pryor M.J. Carr J.M. Hocking H. Davidson A.D. Li P. Wright P.J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 65: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mutations were first introduced into DENV-2 subgenomic cDNA fragments by overlap-PCR (OL-PCR) using specifically designed mutagenic primers (details are available from the author upon request). The OL-PCR fragments were then transferred into the pDVWS601 background either directly or via the intermediate vector pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen) using appropriate combinations of the unique restriction sites, NsiI4700, HpaI7406, StuI7874, and AatII8570 (the cleavage site in the DENV-2 genome (GenBank™ accession number AF038403) for each restriction enzyme is denoted in superscript). The strategies used to produce the mutant constructs are as follows. The mutations K46A/R47A/E49A, K76A/D79A and G81A/G83A/G85A (each NS5 amino acid targeted for mutagenesis is numbered followed by the substituted amino acid) were engineered into 1001-bp OL-PCR fragments (DENV-2 nt 7165–8165) that were HpaI7406/StuI7874-digested and introduced into the corresponding sites of pDVWS601 to produce pDVWS601-NS5K46A,R47A,E49A, pDVWS601-NS5K76A,D79A, and pDVWS601-NS5G81A,G83A,G85A, respectively. The mutations E138A/K139A/D141A, D146A/E149A and E192A/K193A/E195A were engineered into 1363-bp OL-PCR fragments (DENV-2 nt 7393–8755) that were StuI7874/AatII8570-digested and introduced into the corresponding sites of pDVWS601 to produce pDVWS601-NS5E138A,K139A,D141A, pDVWS601-NS5D146A,E149A, and pDVWS601-NS5E192A,K193A,E195A, respectively. The NS5 mutation K101I was engineered into a 1573-bp fragment (DENV-2 nt 7200–8772) that was HpaI7406/AatII8570-digested and introduced into the corresponding sites of pDVWS601 and pDVWS601-NS5E138A,K139A,D141A to produce pDVWS601-NS5K101I and pDVWS601-NS5K101I,E138A,K139A,D141A, respectively. The NS3 mutation A70G was introduced into a 3438-bp fragment (DENV-2 nt 4132–7569) that was NsiI4700/HpaI7406-digested and introduced into the corresponding sites of pDVWS601 and pDVWS601-NS5E192A,K193A,E195A to produce pDVWS601-NS3A70G and pDVWS601-NS3A70G-NS5E192A,K193A,E195A, respectively. The mutation D79A/L80I was engineered into a 3951-bp fragment (DENV-2 nt 6772–10723) contained in the vector pALTER-1 using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). The mutated plasmid was HpaI7406/StuI7874-digested, and the released fragment introduced into the corresponding sites of pDVWS601 to produce pDVWS601-NS5D79A,L80I. The mutations G48A, G48P, S56A, S56T, W87I, W87K, W87Y, D131A, D131E, and D131N were engineered into 2100-bp OL-PCR fragments (DENV-2 nt 7201–9100) that were blunt end-cloned into the vector pCR-Blunt II-TOPO. cDNA fragments containing the NS5 mutations G48A, G48P, S56A, S56T, W87I, W87K, W87Y or D131A, D131E, and D131N were digested with HpaI7406/AatII8570 or StuI7874/AatII8570, respectively, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pDVWS601 to produce pDVWS601-NS5G48A, pDVWS601-NS5G48P, pDVWS601-NS5S56A pDVWS601-NS5S56T, pDVWS601-NS5W87I, pDVWS601-NS5W87K, pDVWS601-NS5W87Y, pDVWS601-NS5D131A, pDVWS601-NS5D131E, and pDVWS601-NS5D131N. To confirm the introduction of the mutations and verify the integrity of the PCR derived regions, the region covering the introduced inserts was sequenced in the mutagenized pDVWS601 plasmid. Introduction of Mutated cDNA Fragments into pQE-30—cDNA fragments containing the NS5 mutations and encoding the first 296 amino acids of NS5 were amplified from the respective pCR-Blunt II-TOPO or pDVWS601 clones using the primers NS5-MT1 (5′-CACGGATCCGGAACTGGCAACATAGGAGAGACG-3′; DENV-2 nt 7571–7593 are underlined) and NS5-MT296 (5′-CTGCAGGTCGACTTATTGGTCATAGTGCCATGATGTTTC-3′; DENV-2 nt 8457–8434 are underlined, and the stop codon is in bold). The 890-bp cDNA fragments were then digested with BamHI/SalI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pQE30 (Qiagen). The parental clone was termed pQE30-NS5. The sequence of the mutated DENV-2 cDNA insert in each clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Production of Virus from Genomic Length DENV cDNA Clones—RNA was transcribed in vitro as described previously (32Gualano R.C. Pryor M.J. Cauchi M.R. Wright P.J. Davidson A.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and transfected into BHK-21 cells either by electroporation or using the TransMessenger Transfection kit (Qiagen). For the latter procedure two μg of RNA was used to transfect an 80% confluent cell monolayer contained in a single well of a 6-well tray following the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection, the cells were incubated at either 33 or 37 °C. Medium from BHK-21 cells incubated at both temperatures was passaged twice in C6/36 cells at 28 °C to produce virus stocks. Confirmation of the introduced mutations and the identification of second site mutations in the viral genome was performed by RT-PCR and sequencing as described previously (31Malet H. Egloff M.P. Selisko B. Butcher R.E. Wright P.J. Roberts M. Gruez A. Sulzenbacher G. Vonrhein C. Bricogne G. Mackenzie J.M. Khromykh A.A. Davidson A.D. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10678-10689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Infectious Center Assay—BHK-21 cells were transfected with 2 μg of in vitro transcribed viral RNA transcripts as described above, detached after transfection, and adjusted to 1 × 105 cells/ml of culture medium. A 10-fold dilution series of the transfected BHK cells was prepared in minimal essential medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 1 × 105 Vero cells. Aliquots of each dilution, containing 1 × 104 cells, were dispensed into 96-well plates, grown for 5–7 days, and examined for cytopathic effect. The TCID50 was determined and used to calculate the number of infectious centers produced per 105 transfected cells. Viral Competition Assay—Mutant and wild type recombinant viruses were mixed at a ratio of 10:1 (TCID50/ml) and used to infect Vero cells at a multiplicity of infection of 3. Each infection was allowed to proceed until there was extensive cytopathic effect. An aliquot of the culture supernatant was used to infect a second Vero cell monolayer. This procedure was repeated until the virus mixture had been passaged three times in Vero cells. RNA was extracted from the culture supernatants after each passage, and the presence of the introduced mutations was verified by RT-PCR and sequencing as described above. Expression and Purification of Wild Type and Mutant DENV-2 NGC NS5 MTase—Competent Escherichia coli strain M15(pREP4) (Qiagen) was transformed with wild type or mutant pQE30-NS5 MTase expression vectors and grown overnight on Luria broth (LB) agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml kanamycin. A single colony was picked and grown overnight in 5 ml of LB medium. This was inoculated into 500 ml of LB media (100 μg/ml ampicillin, 10 μg/ml kanamycin), and the cells were incubated with shaking (220 rpm) at 37 °C until the A595 was ∼0.5. Cultures were induced with 0.4 mm isopropanol-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and growth was continued for a further 5 h at 30 °C for the wild type MTase and 12 h at 16 °C for the mutant MTase proteins. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 15 ml of cold buffer A (50 mm Bicine, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol) per liter. Cells were sonicated, and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 50,000 g for 30 min. The protein solution was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap chelating HP (Amersham Biosciences) column, equilibrated, washed, and eluted with buffer A and a linear gradient concentration of imidazole from 5 to 500 mm. The eluted proteins were concentrated and stored in 50 mm Bicine, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. N7 and 2′-O MTase Activity Assays—The determination of the N7 MTase activities of the wild type and mutant NS5 MTase proteins was performed in duplicate in a reaction mixture containing 1–5 μCi of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (64–72Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), 1–5 μg of GTP-capped RNA comprising nt 1–211 of the DENV-2 5′-UTR (in vitro transcribed in the presence of biotinylated CTP using the T7 RiboMax Express kit from Promega), and 100 nm enzyme in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% CHAPS, and 5 units of RNasin inhibitor (11Ray D.

The extent of methylation at the N7 and 2′-O positions of the capped RNA transcript was determined by removal of the cap from the RNA by tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) digestion as follows. The RNA in the reaction mixtures was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Half of each purified RNA sample was then treated with TAP in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 1× TAP reaction buffer and 10 units of TAP (Epicenter Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) for 2 h at 37 °C before the addition of 2× stop solution (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 100 mm EDTA, 600 mm NaCl, and 125 μm cold S-adenosyl-l-methionine) containing 8 mg/ml streptavidin scintillation proximity assay beads. As a control, the remaining half of the purified RNA sample was similarly treated but in the absence of TAP. All TAP-treated and untreated samples were transferred to a 96-well white opaque plate (Corning Costar, Acton, MA), shaken for 30 min at 750 rpm, and centrifuged for 2 min at 1200 rpm before analysis of 3H incorporation in a microbeta counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a counting time of 1 min/well. The determination of 2′-O MTase activity was performed in duplicate in a reaction mixture containing 1 μCi of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine, 40 nm RNA substrate, GpppAGAACCUG-biotin (Trilink Biotechnologies, Inc.), and 20 nm enzyme in assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.05% (v/v) CHAPS, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 units of RNasin inhibitor. 3S.

The reactions were stopped with 25 μl of 2× stop solution containing 8 mg/ml streptavidin scintillation proximity assay beads, and the plates treated and analyzed as described above. All data points were measured in triplicate. Selection of Amino Acid Mutations for Introduction into the NS5 MTase Domain—Structural analysis has revealed that the DENV-2 MTase contains three subdomains (12Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B.

Here we report the crystal structure of the PPARγ ligand-binding domain bound to rosiglitazone and to a large PGC-1α fragment that contains two LXXLL-related motifs. The structure reveals critical contacts mediated through the first LXXLL motif of PGC-1α and the PPARγ coactivator binding site. Through a combination of biochemical and structural studies, we demonstrate that the first LXXLL motif is the most potent among all nuclear receptor coactivator motifs tested, and only this motif of the two LXXLL-related motifs in PGC-1α is capable of binding to PPARγ. Our studies reveal that the strong interaction of PGC-1α and PPARγ is mediated through both hydrophobic and specific polar interactions. Mutations within the context of the full-length PGC-1α indicate that the first PGC-1α motif is necessary and sufficient for PGC-1α to coactivate PPARγ in the presence or absence of rosiglitazone. These results provide a molecular basis for specific recruitment and functional interplay between PPARγ and PGC-1α in glucose homeostasis and adipocyte differentiation.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) 3The abbreviations used are: PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; SRC, steroid receptor coactivator; PGC-1α, PPARγ coactivator 1α; LBD, ligand-binding domain; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ERRα, estrogen-related receptor α. and its two related receptors, PPARα and β/δ, comprise a subfamily of ligand-regulated nuclear receptors involved in many aspects of human physiology. PPARγ is a key regulator involved in adipocyte differentiation, glucose homeostasis, and inflammatory responses (1Lehrke M. Lazar M.A. Cell. 2005; 123: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 2Feige J.N. Gelman L. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 120-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). PPARγ also is the molecular target of pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone (Avandia), a class of thiazolidinedione drugs used for treating type 2 diabetes patients. These drugs improve insulin sensitivity and increase glucose and fatty acid metabolism. PPARγ ligands may also have application in the treatment of inflammation and cancer (3Glass C.K. Ogawa S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 4Girnun G.D. Naseri E. Vafai S.B. Qu L. Szwaya J.D. Bronson R. Alberta J.A. Spiegelman B.M. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, the clinical use of PPARγ ligands is clearly tempered by side effects such as edema, weight gain, and increased incidence of heart attack. The undesired side effects of thiazolidinedione drugs are possibly associated with the cross-reactivity of these ligands with two other PPARs because of low selectivity and/or the inherent PPARγ activation because of multiple functions of PPARγ (5Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1756-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Nissen S.E. Wolski K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 2457-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (4108) Google Scholar). The pharmacological actions of rosiglitazone are mediated through the PPAR ligand-binding domain (LBD), which binds ligands and then recruits nuclear receptor coactivators (or corepressors) to regulate the expression of downstream target genes. Currently there are ∼300 nuclear receptor coregulators, including the steroid receptor coactivators (SRC) 1, 2, and 3 and the nuclear corepressors N-CoR and SMRT (7Lonard D.M. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 691-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 8Lonard D.M. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The functional profile of PPARγ in response to ligand binding is largely determined by the selective use of transcriptional coregulators because ligand-specific recruitment of coregulators ultimately controls the transcriptional output of the target genes. Thus, ligand-bound PPARγ may show diverse pharmacological functions depending on the specific binding of coactivators. Analogous to many other nuclear receptors, the ligand-dependent recruitment of coactivators by PPARγ is primarily determined by the interaction of coactivator LXXLL motifs with the receptor LBD. Crystal structures of various LBD·coactivator complexes reveal a conserved binding mode for coactivator LXXLL motifs by nuclear receptors (9Li Y. Lambert M.H. Xu H.E. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 741-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 10Nettles K.W. Sun J. Radek J.T. Sheng S. Rodriguez A.L. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Greene G.L. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Upon the binding of an agonist, nuclear receptors use a charge-clamp pocket, in part composed of the C-terminal activation function 2 helix, to form a hydrophobic groove for binding the LXXLL motif of the coactivators. However, there are numerous coactivators with distinct functions, each containing multiple LXXLL motifs. The precise mechanism for recruitment of specific coactivators by PPARγ remains poorly defined. The PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) is a nuclear coactivator that interacts with many transcription factors, including most members of the nuclear hormone receptor family. PGC-1α was originally identified as a coactivator that interacts with PPARγ in a ligand-independent manner (11Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3086) Google Scholar). Besides PPARγ, PGC-1α is also able to coactivate a number of other nuclear receptors through conserved LXXLL motifs, including glucocorticoid receptor, PPARα, estrogen receptor, and estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) (12Knutti D. Kaul A. Kralli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 13Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell.

PGC-1α is expressed in brown adipose tissue, brain, heart, kidney, and cold-exposed skeletal muscle (17Lin J. Handschin C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). In white adipose tissue, the expression of PGC-1α is substantially increased by treatment with the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone, suggesting the importance of PGC-1α in rosiglitazone-regulated PPARγ activity (18Wilson-Fritch L. Nicoloro S. Chouinard M. Lazar M.A. Chui P.C. Leszyk J. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Mapping of PGC-1α defined one nuclear receptor interaction domain with a consensus LXXLL motif (residues 144-148, ID1) and an LLKYL motif (residues 210-214, ID2) that are important for binding nuclear receptors. For example, both biochemical data and the crystal structure of the ERRα LBD bound to the PGC-1α LLKYL motif (ID2) reveal the specific binding of this inverted leucine-rich motif to ERRα (15Huss J.M. Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 19Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I. Schilb A. Riou V.

However, the molecular basis for the interaction between PPARγ and PGC-1α remains unclear. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of rosiglitazone-regulated PPARγ activity, we first determined the preferred coactivator motifs for PPARγ in response to rosiglitazone using biochemical peptide profiling. Among the coactivator motifs tested, the PGC-1α ID1 motif was shown to have the highest binding affinity to PPARγ. To uncover the molecular mechanism for the binding selectivity of PPARγ to PGC-1α, we went on to solve the crystal structure of the PPARγ LBD bound to a large fragment of PGC-1α containing both ID1 and ID2 LXXLL-related motifs. The structure revealed that only ID1 is capable of binding to PPARγ. Mutations within the context of the full-length PGC-1α indicate that the first PGC-1α motif is necessary and sufficient for PGC-1α to coactivate PPARγ in the presence or absence of rosiglitazone. These results provide a structural and biochemical basis for specific recruitment of PGC-1α by the rosiglitazone-bound PPARγ. Protein Preparation—Both the human PPARγ LBD (residues 206-477) and the human PGC-1α fragment (residues 101-220), each containing a His6 tag, were expressed from the expression vector pETDuet1 (Novagen). BL21(DE3) cells transformed with this expression plasmid were grown in LB broth at 25 °C to an A600 of 1 and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 400 ml of extract buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 25 mm imidazole) per 12 liters of cells, and passed three times through a French press with pressure set at 1000 pascals. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The column was washed with extract buffer, and the protein was eluted with a 300-ml gradient to the buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 500 mm imidazole). Both human PPARγ LBD and the PGC-1α fragment were further purified on a Q-Sepharose column. The purified PPARγ and the PGC-1α fragment that contains both LXXLL motifs were mixed at a ratio of 1:2 with a 5-fold excess of the PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone. The ternary complex was further purified by gel filtration (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT) and filter-concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—The PPARγ·rosiglitazone·PGC-1α crystals were grown at room temperature in hanging drops containing 1.0 μl of the above protein solution and 1.0 μl of well solution containing 0.2 m ammonium iodide (pH 6.2) and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350. The crystals were directly frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. The PPARγ·rosiglitazone·PGC-1α crystals formed in the C2 space group, with a = 95.11, b = 53.89, and c = 64.89 Å, α = β = 90°, and γ = 105°, and contained one molecule/crystallographic asymmetric unit. A full 360° of data were collected from a single crystal using 1° oscillation by a MAR165 CCD detector at the ID line of sector 32 of the Advanced Photon Source. The observed reflections were reduced, merged, and scaled with the HKL2000 package (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The structures were determined with the AmoRe program by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of PPARγ LBD (21Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Miller A.B. Bledsoe R.K.

AlphaScreen Binding Assays—The binding of various peptide motifs to PPARγ was determined by AlphaScreen assays using a hexahistidine detection kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, as described recently for other nuclear receptors (24Xu H.E.

The experiments were conducted with ∼20 nm His tag receptor LBD and 20 nm biotinylated SRC2-3 peptide or other coactivator peptides in the presence of 5 μg/ml donor and acceptor beads in a buffer containing 50 nm MOPS, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm CHAPS, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, all adjusted to pH 7.4.

The relative binding affinity of peptide LXXLL motifs was determined using unlabeled peptides at 500 nm to compete with the binding of biotinylated SRC2-3 to PPARγ LBD. The sequences of unlabeled peptides used in Fig. 1B are as before (26Li Y. Suino K. Daugherty J. Xu H.E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). IC50 values for various coactivator LXXLL motifs were determined from a nonlinear least squares fit of the data based on an average of three repeated experiments from the dose-response curves. Transient Transfection Assays—COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Twenty-four-well plates were plated 24 h prior to transfection (5 × 104 cells/well). For mammalian two-hybrid assays, cells were transfected with 200 ng of Gal4-PGC-1α (residues 101-220), 200 ng of VP16-PPARγ LBD (residues 206-477), and 200 ng of pG5Luc (Promega). For full-length PPARγ reporter assays, the cells were transfected with plasmids encoding full-length PPARγ, coactivators, and PPRE-luciferase. Eighteen h after transfection, ligands were added in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Cells were harvested 24 h later for luciferase assays. Luciferase data were normalized to Renilla activity as an internal control. PGC-1α LXXLL Motif Binding Affinity for PPARγ in Response to the Ligand Rosiglitazone—The recruitment of specific coactivators by PPARγ is the major factor that determines the transcriptional profile of target genes and the pharmacological actions of rosiglitazone (27Guan H.P. Ishizuka T. Chui P.C. Lehrke M. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 28Yu S. Reddy J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 936-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To characterize the binding properties of various coactivators in response to rosiglitazone, we measured the direct interactions of purified PPARγ LBD with a panel of biotinylated peptide motifs from coactivators using AlphaScreen assays (26Li Y. Suino K. Daugherty J. Xu H.E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 29Li Y. Choi M. Cavey G. Daugherty J. Suino K. Kovach A. Bingham N.C. Kliewer S.A. Xu H.E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In this assay, the coactivator peptides and the PPARγ LBD protein were attached to donor and acceptor beads, respectively. Upon interaction between the coactivator peptides and the PPARγ LBD, excitation with a laser beam at 680 nm causes the donor beads to emit single oxygen molecules that activate fluorophores in the acceptor beads, and the light is recorded at 520-620 nm. As shown in Fig. 1A, the rosiglitazone-bound PPARγ LBD induced a strong interaction with various coactivator LXXLL motifs from the SRC family of coactivators, CBP, TRAP220, and the PGC-1α ID1 motif. These data are in agreement with the agonist property of rosiglitazone. Notably, even in the absence of rosiglitazone, PPARγ showed significant interactions with several coactivator motifs (particularly the PGC-1α ID1 motif), consistent with the high basal activation properties of PPARγ. To determine which coactivators are preferentially recruited, we performed a peptide profiling experiment using a panel of unlabeled peptides to compete off the binding of the biotinylated third LXXLL motif of SRC2 (SRC2-3) to the rosiglitazone-bound PPARγ LBD (Fig. 1B). In this experiment, all unlabeled peptides were applied at a uniform concentration of 500 nm under identical experimental conditions. Thus the relative binding affinity of individual peptides to PPARγ LBD can be measured by the degree of its inhibition of the binding of the biotinylated SRC2-3 motif to the PPARγ LBD. In the absence of any competing peptides, interaction between the biotinylated SRC2-3 motif and the PPARγ LBD yielded a count of 27,000 photons (Fig. 1B). Most unlabeled peptide motifs gave little competition to coactivator binding of PPARγ at a concentration of 500 nm; the PGC-1α ID1 motif showed the most significant competition. The high binding affinity of PPARγ toward the PGC-1α ID1 motif was further determined by IC50 values from quantitative competition experiments using unlabeled peptides (Fig. 2). Consistent with the peptide profiling, PPARγ bound to the PGC-1α ID1 motif with higher affinity than to ID2 (IC50 of 1.7 μm versus 87 μm) (Fig. 2A). Relative to the IC50 of LXXLL motifs from SRC families, the PGC-1α ID1 motif also displayed stronger binding affinity to PPARγ (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, rosiglitazone increased the binding affinity of PPARγ with most coactivator motifs tested. The remarkable selectivity of PPARγ toward PGC-1α is consistent with the fact that PGC-1α is a well established coactivator for PPARγ in adipogenesis and glucose metabolism (30Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). Together, these results demonstrate that rosiglitazone promotes the interaction of coactivator motifs with PPARγ and that PGC-1α ID1 preferentially binds to PPARγ with the highest affinity among all coregulator motifs tested. Structure of the PPARγ LBD·Rosiglitazone·PGC-1α Complex—Because the first LXXLL motif of PGC-1α (ID1) binds to PPARγ with the highest affinity, we wanted to know the molecular mechanism underlying the binding selectivity of PPARγ toward PGC-1α. To determine the roles of the two receptor-interacting motifs (ID1 and ID2) of PGC-1α in binding to PPARγ, we purified a PGC-1α fragment (residues 101-220) containing both ID1 and ID2 interacting motifs and complexed it with the PPARγ LBD for crystallization studies (Fig. 3A). The PPARγ LBD and the PGC-1α fragment were purified individually, mixed to form the complex with PGC-1α in excess, and then further purified through a gel filtration column (Fig. 3, B and C). In the gel filtration profile, the PGC-1α·PPARγ complex is shifted left because of its greater size, whereas PGC-1α alone eluted out in the volume of smaller size. We collected and concentrated the complex peak to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml for crystallization trials, and PPARγ·rosiglitazone·PGC-1α crystals were readily obtained at room temperature (Fig. 3D). The PPARγ·rosiglitazone·PGC-1α complex crystallized in the C2 space group with one complex in each asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the PPARγ LBD bound to rosiglitazone and the SRC1-2 motif as the initial model (21Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Miller A.B. Bledsoe R.K. Milburn M.V. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Xu H.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The calculated electron density map using the initial molecular replacement solution showed clear features of the PPARγ LBD, the bound ligand rosiglitazone, and a single PGC-1α LXXLL motif. Although a large PGC-1α fragment (120 amino acids) was used in crystallization, most sequences except the ID1 motif are invisible because of very low and ambiguous electron density.

Open table in a new tab The overall structure of the PPARγ·rosiglitazone·PGC-1α complex is shown in Fig. 4A. Specifically, the PPARγ LBD is composed of 13 α helices and four short β strands that are folded into a three-layer helical sandwich. The C-terminal activation function 2 helix is positioned in the active conformation by packing tightly against the main domain of the LBD. In this conformation, the activation function 2 helix, together with helices H3, H4, and H5, forms a charge-clamp pocket where the PGC-1α LXXLL motif is docked. Functional Interaction of PGC-1α and PPARγ through the PGC-1α ID1 Motif—Despite both the ID1 and ID2 motifs being in the PGC-1α fragment used for crystallization, the structure of the PPARγ LBD·PGC-1α complex shows that only the ID1 motif is bound in the coactivator binding site. The LKKLL sequence of the PGC-1α ID1 motif can be clearly identified by the distinguishing features of the electron density map, where the core LKKLL motif adopts a two-turn α helix with its hydrophobic leucine side chains directed toward the hydrophobic surface of the coactivator binding groove of PPARγ (Fig. 4, B and C). The overall structure of the PPARγ coactivator binding site and the docking mode of PGC-1α ID1 resemble those observed in other nuclear receptor coactivator complexes (9Li Y. Lambert M.H. Xu H.E. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 741-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Beside the core LKKLL motifs, several flanking residues are also clearly visible in the electron density map (Fig. 4B). Thus, the structure of the PPARγ LBD·PGC-1α complex and the biochemical Alpha-Screen results both indicate that the binding of PGC-1α to PPARγ is through the PGC-1α ID1 LXXLL motif. To further establish the role of PGC-1α ID1 and ID2 in binding to PPARγ, we performed mammalian two-hybrid assays using the PGC-1α fragment that contains both these motifs. The PGC-1α fragment was fused with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, and the PPARγ LBD was fused with the VP16 activation domain (Fig. 4, D and E). We mutated individual LXXLL motifs of PGC-1α to AXXLA, resulting in PGC-1αM1 and PGC-1αM2, and tested the ability of these mutated coactivators to potentiate the PPARγ-mediated activation in response to rosiglitazone. Mutations in the ID2 motif of PGC-1α decreased the interaction with PPARγ, whereas the activation in response to rosiglitazone remained unchanged (Fig. 4D). However, mutation of the ID1 motif completely abolished the ability of PGC-1α to bind PPARγ, consistent with the dominant role of ID1 in binding to PPARγ as revealed by the structure and the AlphaScreen assays. PGC-1α is also able to coactivate a number of other nuclear receptors, including ERRα, a constitutively active receptor. To compare PGC-1α interactions between PPARγ and ERRα, we performed similar mammalian two-hybrid experiments on PGC-1α and ERRα. As expected, ERRα interacts with PGC-1α in the absence of any ligand treatment, consistent with the high constitutive activity of ERRα (Fig. 4E). In contrast to PPARγ, mutations in the ID1 or ID2 motifs of PGC-1α both substantially reduced ERRα-PGC-1α interactions. These results suggest that PGC-1α uses different interacting domains (ID1 or ID2) in its preferential binding to various nuclear receptors: PPARγ prefers ID1, and ERRα requires both ID1 and ID2. To further determine the functional significance of PGC-1α ID1 in the ligand-regulated activity of PPARγ, we mutated either the ID1 or ID2 motifs of PGC-1α within the context of the full-length PGC-1α coactivator and tested the effect of these mutated coactivators on PPARγ-mediated activation in cell-based assays (Fig. 5). The plasmid encoding full-length PPARγ and a PPARγ response reporter were transiently cotransfected into cells, and the assays were performed in the presence or absence of rosiglitazone. Fig. 5 shows that wild-type PGC-1α substantially elevates the transcriptional activity of PPARγ with or without rosiglitazone. Although no effect on reporter activity was observed upon cotransfection with the PGC-1α ID2 mutant, the mutation in the ID1 motif completely abolished the ability of PGC-1α to coactivate PPARγ-mediated transcription. These results further demonstrate the functional significance of the PGC-1α ID1 in binding to PPARγ and highlight a crucial role of the PGC-1α ID1 motif in the coactivation of PPARγ. Molecular Determinants for the Preferential Recruitment of PGC-1α by PPARγ—The PPARγ LBD·PGC-1α structure is the first structure of a nuclear receptor with the PGC-1α ID1 motif, and it reveals a molecular basis for the preferential binding of this motif to the PPARγ receptor. In addition to the hydrophobic interactions with PPARγ by its core LXXLL motif, which is conserved for the binding of nuclear receptors (Fig. 6A), PGC-1α contains two unique features within the structure that define its high affinity binding to PPARγ (Fig. 6, B-D). The first feature is that Lys145 in the core region of PGC-1α ID1 forms a direct hydrogen bond with Asn312 in PPARγ (Fig. 6, B and C). This hydrogen bond stabilizes the binding of PPARγ and PGC-1α in addition to the hydrophobic interactions between these two molecules. The second feature is the remarkable stability of the PGC-1α ID1 helix through its intramolecular interactions. In the structure, Ser142 forms a direct hydrogen bond that caps the backbone amide of Glu140 of the LXXLL helix (Fig. 6D). These intramolecular interactions are likely to stabilize the overall helical structure of the PGC-1α ID1 motif, thus facilitating the hydrophobic docking of this helix into PPARγ. Together, these unique intermolecular and intramolecular contacts serve as a basis for the high affinity and specific binding of PPARγ toward PGC-1α. To assess the importance of these interactions in the PGC-1α-mediated enhancement of PPARγ activity, we made the mutations S142A and K145A in PGC-1α ID1 and tested these mutants in cell-based assays using full-length PPARγ and a PPARγ response reporter (Fig. 5). In the absence of ligand, the S142A mutation substantially reduced PGC-1α-mediated coactivation of PPARγ. PGC-1α-mediated coactivation was also impaired by this mutation in the presence of rosiglitazone. Similar results were also observed for the K145A mutant, suggesting that both Ser142 and Lys145 of PGC-1α contribute to its ability to coactivate PPARγ. Together, these results reveal that the strong interaction of PGC-1α with PPARγ is due to hydrophobic binding of its ID1 LXXLL motif and also to specific interactions between the two molecules. As a master regulator of adipose differentiation, PPARγ serves as a key transcriptional factor that links obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases through selective recruitment of various coregulatory proteins with distinct functions. The various transcriptional coactivators display many distinct physiological roles, such as enzymatic activities like histone acetylation and deacetylation. For instance, SRC1 and SRC2 (also known as GRIP1/TIF2) have been shown to play opposite roles in energy metabolism in mouse knock-out studies (31Picard F. Gehin M. Annicotte J. Rocchi S. Champy M.F. O'Malley B.W. Chambon P. Auwerx J. Cell. 2002; 111: 931-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). SRC1-/- mice are prone to obesity because of reduced energy expenditure, whereas SRC2-/- mice are protected against obesity and display enhanced adaptive thermogenesis. Accordingly, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-l-leucine, a distinct PPARγ ligand, preferentially recruits SRC1 (but not SRC2) by inducing a particular allosteric configuration of the PPARγ coregulator binding interface (32Rocchi S. Picard F. Vamecq J. Gelman L. Potier N. Zeyer D. Dubuquoy L. Bac P. Champy M.F. Plunket K.D. Leesnitzer L.M. Blanchard S.G. Desreumaux P. Moras D. Renaud J.P. Auwerx J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 737-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). As a result, this unique ligand enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces glucose levels without promoting the weight gain normally associated with the thiazolidinedione class of PPARγ ligands. Thus, the selective modulation of PPARγ activity is highly dependent on its ability to recruit specific coactivators. Here we conducted detailed analysis of the interplay between rosiglitazone-regulated PPARγ and coactivators through a combination of mutagenesis, biochemical binding profiling, and structural analysis. Our quantitative competition experiments show that rosiglitazone-bound PPARγ has a marked binding preference for the PGC-1α ID1 motif (Figs. 1 and 2). Consistent with this result, the crystal structure of the PPARγ·PGC-1α complex reveals the docking mode of the PGC-1α ID1 helix (Fig. 4, A and B). Our mutagenesis studies further demonstrate the essential roles of the ID1 motif in the functional interaction between PGC-1α and PPARγ (Figs. 4D and 5). Interestingly, increased expression of PGC-1α has been shown in rosiglitazone treatment (18Wilson-Fritch L. Nicoloro S. Chouinard M. Lazar M.A. Chui P.C. Leszyk J. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Corvera S.

Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The coexpression of PGC-1α and PPARγ in rosiglitazone target tissues and the strong interaction between them suggest the importance of the interaction of PPARγ and PGC-1α in the pharmacological roles of rosiglitazone. The molecular basis for the selective binding of PPARγ with PGC-1α is provided by the structure of the bound pair. This structure reveals specific intermolecular and intramolecular interactions that define the preferential binding between rosiglitazone-bound PPARγ and PGC-1α (Fig. 6). Mutations designed to disrupt these interactions reduce the binding of PGC-1α to PPARγ in cell-based transcriptional assays (Fig. 5). In addition, we have demonstrated that different receptors can differ in their interaction with PGC-1α by using alternative interaction sites. Although ID2 is not required for PGC-1α interaction with PPARγ, this motif is shown to bind to the nuclear receptor ERRα (15Huss J.M. Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 19Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I. Schilb A. Riou V. Graham A. Strauss A. Geiser M. Fournier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49330-49337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ID2 contains an atypical LXXYL motif, which is an inverted LXXLL sequence. Instead of three hydrophobic leucine side chains, ID2 uses two leucine side chains to dock into the groove of the ERRα coactivator binding site. The interaction is further strengthened by the favorable van der Waals contacts between the tyrosine in the PGC-1α ID2 core and ERRα residues Leu333, Ile336, and Leu509 (19Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I. Schilb A. Riou V. Graham A. Strauss A. Geiser M. Fournier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49330-49337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, these ERRα residues are not conserved in PPARγ, and the coregulator binding interface of PPARγ shows binding properties distinct from those of ERRα. As such, only PGC-1α ID1 is capable of strong binding to PPARγ, whereas PGC-1α ID2 has a much lower affinity. Structural comparison between the PPARγ·PGC-1α ID1 and ERRα·PGC-1α ID2 complexes shows that these two nuclear receptors employ distinct structural mechanisms to achieve specific recognition of their coactivators. As PGC-1α also strongly interacts with PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and a large number of other nuclear receptors, the structure of the PPARγ·PGC-1α complex will have broad implications for understanding PGC-1α receptor interactions.

Both PAR1 and plasminogen, the precursor of plasmin, are expressed in the central nervous system. In this study we examined the effects of plasmin in astrocyte and neuronal cultures as well as in hippocampal slices. We find that plasmin evokes an increase in both phosphoinositide hydrolysis (EC50 64 nm) and Fura-2/AM fluorescence (195 ± 6.7% above base line, EC50 65 nm) in cortical cultured murine astrocytes. Plasmin also activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) within cultured astrocytes. The plasmin-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the increase in phospho-ERK1/2 levels were diminished in PAR1-/- astrocytes and were blocked by 1 μm BMS-200261, a selective PAR1 antagonist. However, plasmin had no detectable effect on ERK1/2 or [Ca2+]i signaling in primary cultured hippocampal neurons or in CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices. Plasmin (100-200 nm) application potentiated the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent component of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons but had no effect on α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate- or γ-aminobutyric acid receptor-mediated synaptic currents. Plasmin also increased NMDA-induced whole cell receptor currents recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells (2.5 ± 0.3-fold potentiation over control). This effect was blocked by BMS-200261 (1 μm; 1.02 ± 0.09-fold potentiation over control). These data suggest that plasmin may serve as an endogenous PAR1 activator that can increase [Ca2+]i in astrocytes and potentiate NMDA receptor synaptic currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons.

Plasmin is a serine protease generated through cleavage of the zymogen precursor plasminogen by plasminogen activator (tissue type (tPA) 2The abbreviations used are: tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; CNS, central nervous system; LTP, long-term potentiation; PAR, protease-activated receptor; TBS, tris-buffered saline; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IPSC, inhibitory postsynaptic current; EPSC, excitatory postsynaptic current; mEPSCs, miniature EPSC; IP3, inositol triphosphate; EC50, half-maximal activating concentration; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium concentration; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate; EPSP, excitatory postsynaptic potential. 2The abbreviations used are: tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; CNS, central nervous system; LTP, long-term potentiation; PAR, protease-activated receptor; TBS, tris-buffered saline; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IPSC, inhibitory postsynaptic current; EPSC, excitatory postsynaptic current; mEPSCs, miniature EPSC; IP3, inositol triphosphate; EC50, half-maximal activating concentration; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium concentration; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate; EPSP, excitatory postsynaptic potential. or urokinase type). The precursor, plasminogen, a 92-kDa protein, is primarily synthesized in the liver and circulates in the blood at 2-4 μm (1Zhang L. Seiffert T. Fowler B.J. Jenkins J.R. Thinnes T.C. Loskutoff D.J. Parmer R.J. Miles L.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Several studies have explored plasminogen expression in the central nervous system (CNS) (2Melchor J.P. Strickland S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 3Salles F.J. Strickland S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2125-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Basham M.E. Seeds N.V. J Neurochem. 2001; 77: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For example, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization studies have recently provided evidence for plasminogen mRNA in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of both neonatal and adult mice (4Basham M.E. Seeds N.V. J Neurochem. 2001; 77: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, tPA is known to be expressed in several brain regions, including the hippocampus, and is thought to be involved in learning as well as neuronal degeneration (2Melchor J.P. Strickland S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 93: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Once tPA cleaves plasminogen, plasmin has numerous targets, the best known being fibrinogen. The fibrinolytic actions of plasmin mediate clot dissolution and, thus, play a critical role in blood hemostasis. Plasmin has also been shown to have functional effects in the brain, including cleavage of pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (pro-BDNF) to BDNF, which may play a critical role in the generation of long term potentiation (LTP) (5Pang P.T. Teng H.K. Zaitsev E. Woo N.T. Sakata K. Zhen S. Teng K.K. Yung W.H. Hempstead B.L. Lu B. Science. 2004; 306: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). However, in addition to cleavage of fibrinogen and pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor, plasmin has also been reported to cleave a wide range of other substrates, including protease-activated receptors (PARs).PARs are a class of receptors activated by proteolytic cleavage of the N terminus by serine proteases. This cleavage reveals a new N terminus that acts as a tethered ligand to activate the receptor. For example, activation of PAR1 by thrombin cleavage can initiate signaling through Gαi/o, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13 pathways (6Junge C. Lee C.J. Hubbard K.B. Zhang Z. Olson J.J. Hepler J.R. Brat D.J.

Plasmin can cleave PAR1 at Arg-41 and PAR4 at Arg-47 to activate these receptors (10Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J. Helin J. Costello C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Additionally, plasmin cleaves downstream of these activating sites on PAR1 as well as PAR2, subsequently terminating signaling by removing the tethered ligand (10Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J. Helin J. Costello C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 11Loew D. Perrault C. Morales M. Moog S. Ravanat C. Schuhler S. Arcone P.

As a result of the multiple plasmin cleavage sites in PAR1, plasmin-triggered PAR1 activation may have a different temporal signaling profile than thrombin-triggered PAR1 activation. In the CNS of both humans and rodents, PAR1 is widely expressed in astrocytes, whereas its neuronal expression appears to be more localized (6Junge C. Lee C.J. Hubbard K.B. Zhang Z. Olson J.J.

In addition to plasmin, PAR1 can be activated by thrombin, Factor Xa, Factor VIIa, and small synthetic amino acid peptides that mimic the newly cleaved N terminus (e.g. TFLLR (14Hollenberg M.D. Saiffedine M. al-Ani B. Kawabata A. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1997; 75: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar)). Activation of PAR1 by different proteases in different cells has been suggested to serve different functions, complicating the understanding of the potential actions of PAR1 (9Traynelis S.F. Trejo J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2007; 14: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).The ability of plasmin to activate PAR1 suggests that brain-derived plasmin could influence normal CNS function. Therefore, it is important to more fully understand the role of PAR1 activation by plasmin in neuronal and glial physiology. Indeed, the tPA/plasminogen/plasmin system has previously been suggested to play important roles in normal brain function, including control of hippocampal neuronal plasticity, modification of the reward system, regulation of dopamine release from the nucleus accumbens, and regulation of function within the bed nucleus of stria terminalis as well as the CNS response to stress (5Pang P.T.

We have previously proposed that PAR1 activation triggers a complex cascade of events that culminates with potentiation of neuronal NMDA receptors (21Gingrich M.B. Junge C. Lyuboslavsky P. Traynelis S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4582-4595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lee J.C. Mannaioni G. Yuan H. Woo D.H. Gingrich M.B. Traynelis S.F. J. Physiol.

Behav. 2002; 71: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Because NMDA receptors are Ca2+-permeable and are well known to be involved in cellular processes underlying learning and memory (25Lisman J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 26Nicoll R.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that the ability of plasmin to activate PAR1 and regulate NMDA receptor function could be linked to changes in learning and memory. In this report we investigate the effects of plasmin on astrocytic and neuronal intracellular signaling as well as its effects on excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slice preparations. Our findings suggest that plasmin can control synaptic NMDA receptor function through activation of astrocytic PAR1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—PAR1-/- and wild-type mice were created by breeding PAR1+/- mice, a gift from Dr. Shaun Coughlin (University of California, San Francisco, CA (27Connolly A.J. Ishihara H. Kahn M.L. Farese Jr., R.V. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar)), with C57BL/6 wild-type mice from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Heterozygous littermates were bred to generate littermate homozygous null mutants and wild-type controls that were >99% C57BL/6, which were subsequently used to generate homozygous colonies. All procedures using animals were approved by the Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.Neuronal and Astrocytic Cultures—Cultured astrocytes were prepared from P0-P3 postnatal mouse cortex. Cells were dissociated into a single-cell suspension by trituration through a Pasteur pipette and plated onto either 12-mm glass coverslips or 6-well plates coated with 0.05 mg/ml poly-d-lysine and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin.Neuronal cultures were derived from E17 Sprague-Dawley rat pups. Briefly, cortical tissue was dissected, transferred into Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES, and incubated in trypsin containing 0.02% DNase at 37 °C for 15 min. Tissue was then triturated, and the supernatant was resuspended in B27-supplemented neurobasal medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated onto 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and after 3 days received serum-free media.All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere. As described previously, astrocyte cultures were ≥95% pure based on analysis of glial fibrillary acidic protein staining (Ref. 7Nicole O. Goldshmidt A. Hamill C.E. Sorensen S.D. Sastre A.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4319-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and data not shown).Measurement of Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis—Astrocyte cultures in 6-well plates were labeled overnight with 4 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.). Cells were then incubated for 20 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium buffered with 25 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) and 10 mm LiCl2. Accumulation of radioactive inositol phosphates was measured after 60 min of incubation with increasing concentrations of human plasmin (Hematologic Technologies). Unless specified otherwise, human plasmin was used in all subsequent experiments. After solubilization of cells with 20 mm formic acid and neutralization with 0.7 m NH4OH, [3H]inositol monophosphate fractions were separated by anion exchange chromatography (AG 1-X8 Dowex, Bio-Rad) using increasing amounts of ammonium formate. [3H]inositol monophosphate content was assessed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Measurements for each experiment were made in triplicate and averaged. The values reported were the mean of three separate experiments on cultures obtained from three different animals on three separate days.Phospho-ERK1/2 Immunolabeling—Cultured mouse astrocytes or neurons were treated with 100 nm plasmin for 15 min at 37 °C. Some cultures also received a 5-min preapplication of 1 μm BMS-200261 (Emory University Microchemical Facility) followed by co-application of 100 nm plasmin with 1 μm BMS-200261. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and washed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton-X, and 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Cultures were incubated overnight at 4 °C in monoclonal mouse antibody recognizing extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylated at both threonine 202 and tyrosine 204 (phospho-ERK, 1:200, Cell Signaling). After washing in TBS and incubating in rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to Texas Red (1:200, 4 h, Molecular Probes), cells were mounted with Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories) and viewed with an Olympus IX71 microscope and Orca-ER cooled digital camera (Hamamatsu).Western Blotting—Cultured wild-type or PAR1-/- astrocytes were treated with 100 nm plasmin, 30 μm TFLLR, or buffer for 15 min at 37 °C and lysed. Cell lysates were sonicated, boiled in sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE (13.5%), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% milk, 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.02% sodium azide for 1 h at room temperature and washed once in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween (TBS-T). Total ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein bands were detected by incubating membranes with total ERK1/2 antibody (1:300 in TBS-T) and phospho-ERK antibody (1:1,000 in TBS-T) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed with TBS-T and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:10,000 in TBS-T (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The membranes were again washed, and protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Densitometry to quantify protein expression levels was performed using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.) by measuring the integrated density of each protein band individually. Phospho-ERK1/2 levels were normalized to total-ERK1/2 levels for each treatment condition.Whole Cell Patch Clamp Recording—Transverse rat hippocampal slices (300 μm) were obtained from 10-17-day-old rats as previously described (28Mannaioni G. Marino M.J. Valenti O. Traynelis S.F. Conn P.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5925-5934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Slices were placed in a recording chamber and superfused at 1.5 ml/min with artificial cerebrospinal fluid composed 124 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, and 10 mm glucose saturated with 95:5% O2/CO2. All recordings were performed at 23 °C except recordings of EPSPs, which were performed at 34 °C.Spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells using visually guided whole cell patch recordings in voltage clamp configuration. Thin-walled glass micropipettes were filled with 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm Mg-ATP, 0.3 mm Na3-GTP, and 5 mm QX-314; the pH was adjusted to 7.24, and osmolality was adjusted to 310 mosm. The ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists d-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (d-APV, 50 μm) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (25 μm) were included in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Because of the high intracellular chloride concentration, IPSCs were inward currents at -60 mV. Both the frequency and peak amplitude of detected events were analyzed. The γ-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptor blocker bicuculline (10 μm) was added at the end of each experiment to verify that the spontaneous IPSCs were GABAA receptor-mediated. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked using a bipolar stimulator and a stimulus of 10-100 μA (50 μs). Miniature EPSCs were recorded in the presence of 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin (Calbiochem) and 10 μm bicuculline (Sigma). Spontaneous IPSCs and miniature EPSCs were detected from a holding potential of -60 mV by using the Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft). Evoked EPSPs were recorded under a current clamp from CA1 pyramidal cells in response to Schaffer collateral stimulation as described above. The area was determined for each EPSP, and then a running average of nine consecutive EPSPs was determined. Because the time at which plasmin reaches each cell will differ, the maximum potentiation by plasmin will occur at different times. We, therefore, analyzed the peak area for each cell from the running average, as described by Gingrich et al. (21Gingrich M.B. Junge C. Lyuboslavsky P. Traynelis S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4582-4595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peak area was normally distributed (Pearson test) and evaluated using a t test.Whole cell recordings of NMDA-evoked currents were obtained from CA1 pyramidal neurons in slices using 3-7-megaohm thin-walled glass pipettes filled with a solution containing 140 mm CsMeSO4, 5 mm HEPES, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 0.03 mm Na-GTP, 5 phosphocreatine; pH was adjusted to 7.24 and osmolality to 310 mosm. Whole cell NMDA receptor-mediated current responses in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells were evaluated in response to pulses of NMDA plus glycine (1 mm/30 μm), applied onto the dendrites using a pressurized micropipette. NMDA-evoked currents were measured every minute at a holding potential of -60 mV before and during the application of 100-200 nm plasmin (Hematologic Technologies) or 30 μm TFLLR-NH2 (hereafter, TFLLR; Emory University Microchemical Facility). Changes in series resistance were monitored from the instantaneous current response to the -5-mV step, and membrane resistance was estimated from the leak current. After five stable base-line measurements were taken, PAR1 agonist/antagonist or control solution was applied for 15-20 min.Whole cell patch clamp recordings (voltage clamp, holding at -60 mV) from 5-10-day cultured cortical neurons were made with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) at room temperature (23 °C). The recording chamber was continually perfused with recording solution composed of 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 by NaOH; osmolality was adjusted to 315-320 mosm with sucrose) with or without 1.5 mm Mg2+. Thin-wall glass pipettes were filled with 110 mm d-gluconate (50% w/w solution), 110 mm CsOH (50% w/w solution), 30 mm CsCl, 5 mm HEPES, 4 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm BAPTA, 2 mm NaATP, and 0.3 mm NaGTP (the pH was adjusted to 7.3 with CsOH, and osmolality was adjusted to 300-310 mosm with sucrose). Drugs were applied directly by gravity and controlled by solenoid valves (Lee, Westbrook, CT). The pipette was placed above the recorded cell. Drug application had a relatively fast onset and achieved complete local perfusion of the recorded cell (full solution exchange within 100 ms). The peak and steady-state amplitude of NMDA-evoked current was measured in control and plasmin-treated groups (300 nm plasmin, 10 min, at 37 °C). The Mg2+ sensitivity was evaluated by subtracting the responses to voltage ramps (-80 to +40 mV) before and during NMDA application in the presence of 1.5 mm Mg2+.Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Recordings from Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Stage V-VI oocytes from X. laevis were isolated and injected with cRNA, as previously described (29Dascal N. Cohen S. Pfluegers Arch. 1987; 409: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse PAR1 and PAR2 were synthesized in vitro from cDNA according to the manufacturer's specifications (Ambion, TX), and 2-10 ng of cRNA was injected. Mouse PAR1 and PAR2 cDNA were provided by Dr. Shaun Coughlin (University of California at San Francisco). Mouse PAR3 and PAR4 RIKEN Mouse FANTOM™ cDNA clones were obtained from the Genome Exploration Research Group, RIKEN GSC, and a replica was provided by K. K. DNAFORM, FANTOM Consortium, RIKEN Genome Exploration Research Group and Genome Science Group (Genome Network Project Core Group, PAR3/4). After 24-72 h after injection, oocytes were recorded using two-electrode voltage clamp (VHOLD-40 mV). The recording solution contained 60 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 1.8 vCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 6 mm HEPES. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Recording electrodes contained 0.3 m KCl.Activation of recombinant PAR in X. laevis oocytes is known to increase intracellular Ca2+, which opens a calcium-activated chloride channel endogenously expressed in oocytes to produce an inward current response under voltage clamp (29Dascal N. Cohen S. Pfluegers Arch. 1987; 409: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Oron Y. Dascal N. Nadler E. Lupu M. Nature. 1985; 313: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). At -40 mV, all agonists for PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4 evoked an inward current in oocytes expressing recombinant PARs that was characteristic of the Ca2+-activated Cl- current; this current was abolished in oocytes that were injected with 20 nl of 100 mm BAPTA to chelate intracellular calcium (n = 4-8 for each clone; data not shown). Oocytes that were not injected with any cRNA did not respond to TFLLR-NH2 (hereafter TFLLR), 2 furoyl-LIGRLO, AYPGKF-NH2 (hereafter AYPGKF), or thrombin (n = 6-20). Trypsin induced a small inward current responses in uninjected oocytes that was ⅕ that of the amplitude observed in oocytes injected with mouse PAR2 mRNA (21% + 11; unpaired t test; p < 0.01; n = 23). Mouse PAR3 did not produce detectable current responses to 10-50 nm thrombin.To quantify PAR activation, a 2-min base-line perfusion with wash buffer was followed by application of peptide agonist or protease activator for 2 min. We measured the area under the curve. To evaluate the selectivity of BMS-200261 (synthesized by Emory University Microchemical Facility) for PAR1 blockade, 1 μm BMS-200261 was pre-applied for 1 min followed by a 2-min co-application of 1 μm BMS-200261 with peptide or protease agonist. Responses with and without BMS-200261 were run on the same day. The concentrations of thrombin and trypsin that were tested matched reported EC50 values for mouse PAR1 and PAR2 (27Connolly A.J. Ishihara H. Kahn M.L. Farese Jr., R.V. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 31Mari B. Guerin S. Far D.F. Breitmayer J.P. Belhacene N. Peyron J.F. Rossi B. Auberger P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Applying thrombin at the reported EC50 concentration onto PAR4 (low nanomolar range) did not cause a current response in this system. We did see a reliable current response at 50 nm thrombin in oocytes injected with mouse PAR4 cRNA. We further evaluated the response to higher concentrations of thrombin to verify that 50 nm thrombin produced submaximal responses that were in the dynamic range of the concentration-effect curve. We similarly verified that concentrations of activators used for mouse PAR1 (1 nm thrombin) and mouse PAR2 (5 nm trypsin) were in the dynamic response range (n = 4-12 for PAR1, PAR2, PAR4).Ca2+ Imaging—Cultured astrocytes were incubated with 5 μm Fura-2/AM or Fluo-3/AM in 1 μm pluronic acid (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently transferred to a microscope stage for imaging. External solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose; the pH was adjusted to 7.4, and osmolality was adjusted to 325 mosm. After excitation at 340 and 380 nm, Fura-2 emission intensity at 510 nm was acquired as ratiometric images using an Olympus BX51WI microscope and a PTI IC200 intensified camera. Experiments with Fluo-3 used an excitation of 450-490 nm and band-passed emission (500-550 nm). Dose-response curves for plasmin were derived by using the FlexStation II plate reader (Molecular Devices) to measure changes in Fluo-4 fluorescence in wild-type mouse astrocytes plated onto 96-well plates. Fluo4/AM dye loading and agonist application were performed according to manufacturer instructions.Electrodes for simultaneous whole cell patch recording and Ca2+ imaging were filled with 140 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm HEPES, 7 mm NaCl, 4 mm Mg-ATP, 0.3 mm Na3-GTP, 0.1 mm Fluo-3 or Oregon Green; the pH was adjusted to 7.24, and osmolality was adjusted to 310 mosm. To eliminate synaptic activity, 1 μm tetrodotoxin was added to the oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Throughout the experiments -5 mV voltage steps of 15-ms duration were applied at 30-s intervals from a holding potential of -70 mV to continuously monitor the holding current, series resistance, and membrane input resistance. After entering whole cell mode, cells were maintained for ∼20 min to allow filling with Fluo-3 before image acquisition. After the base-line period, plasmin (200 nm) was applied, and images were acquired every 5-10 s with 25-50-ms exposure to 450-490-nm light. Fluorescence was recorded through a band-passed filter (500-550 nm) using a Princeton Micromax camera. Fluorescence intensity was measured in cell bodies using Imaging Workbench 2.2.1 (INDEC BioSystems, CA) and expressed as F/F0, where F0 is the fluorescence intensity before drug treatment. For all experiments increases in fluorescence greater then 1.2-fold were con"

We therefore investigated potential mechanisms in genetically modified mice. Transgenic (TG) mice were generated to overexpress Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase specifically in cardiomyocytes. Phosphorylation of sarcomeric cardiac RLC and cytoplasmic nonmuscle RLC increased markedly in hearts from TG mice compared with hearts from wild-type (WT) mice. Quantitative measures of RLC phosphorylation revealed no spatial gradients. No significant hypertrophy or structural abnormalities were observed up to 6 months of age in hearts of TG mice compared with WT animals. Hearts and cardiomyocytes from WT animals subjected to voluntary running exercise and isoproterenol treatment showed hypertrophic cardiac responses, but the responses for TG mice were attenuated. Additional biochemical measurements indicated that overexpression of the Ca2+/calmodulin-binding kinase did not perturb other Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent processes involving Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II or the protein phosphatase calcineurin. Thus, increased myosin RLC phosphorylation per se does not cause cardiac hypertrophy and probably inhibits physiological and pathophysiological hypertrophy by contributing to enhanced contractile performance and efficiency.

Myosin, the mechanochemical transducer of cardiomyocytes, is modulated by phosphorylation. Its motor domain contains an actin-binding surface and ATP catalytic pocket that tapers to an α-helical neck connected to the rod region responsible for self-assembly into thick filaments. Two small polypeptides, the essential light chain and the RLC, 2The abbreviations used are: RLC, regulatory light chain; WT, wild-type; TG, transgenic; cRLC, RLC of sarcomeric cardiac myosin II; nRLC, RLC of the nonmuscle, cytoplasmic myosin II; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; skMLCK, skeletal muscle MLCK; CaM kinase II, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; CMV, cytomegalovirus; MHC, myosin heavy chain. wrap around each α-helical neck region. Phosphorylation of RLC in striated muscles potentiates the force and speed of contractions that are dependent on Ca2+ binding to troponin on actin-containing thin filaments (1Sweeney H.L. Bowman B.F.

In heart muscle, a spatial gradient of cRLC phosphorylation across the ventricle with decreasing cRLC phosphorylation from apex to base may facilitate torsion during contraction (7Davis J.S.

Cardiomyocytes also contain a cytoplasmic, nonmuscle myosin IIB with its RLC (nRLC) where phosphorylation increases actin-activated ATPase activity. Myosin IIB is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm during development and then localizes to Z-lines and intercalated discs after birth (12Takeda K. Yu Z.-X. Qian S. Chin T.K. Adelstein R.S. Ferrans V.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Dudnakova T.V. Stepanova O.V. Dergilev K.V. Chadin A.V. Shekhonin B.V. Watterson D.M. Shirinsky V.P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2006; 63: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Ablation of cytoplasmic myosin IIB expression results in sarcomere disarray and aberrant development of the heart, leading to heart failure and death (14Tullio A.N. Accili D. Ferrans V.J. Yu Z.X.

RLCs are phosphorylated by dedicated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent MLCKs (15Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). skMLCK was reported to be in cardiac muscle where a mutation in the kinase from a young patient with hypertrophic myocardium was associated with an increased Vmax value. Thus, it was suggested that development of compensatory hypertrophy results from an increase in cRLC phosphorylation (7Davis J.S. Hassanzadeh S. Winitsky S. Lin H. Satorius C. Vemuri R. Aletras A.H.

Res. 2006; 98: 1110-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the current study, we tested this hypothesis by generating transgenic mice overexpressing skMLCK in cardiomyocytes. skMLCK is a dedicated protein kinase that phosphorylates RLCs from striated as well as smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells (15Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). We also examined adaptations to exercise conditioning and β-adrenergic stimulation in these transgenic animals, two stresses that induce cardiac hypertrophy. The availability of free Ca2+/calmodulin for activation of its cellular targets may be limiting in cells. Total calmodulin ranges from 5 to 40 μm in different kinds of cells where it affects protein structures and enzyme activities as well as gene expression (16Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The free Ca2+/calmodulin concentration is typically <1% of the total cellular calmodulin (16Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Stull J.T. Hsu L.C. Tansey M.G. Kamm K.E. J. Biol.

The free Ca2+/calmodulin in smooth, but not skeletal, muscle is limiting for full activation of a high affinity target such as MLCK (11Ryder J.W. Lau K.S. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20447-20454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 20Isotani E. Zhi G. Lau K.S. Huang J. Mizuno Y. Persechini A. Geguchadze R. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In cardiac muscle, free Ca2+/calmodulin also appears to be only 1% (50-75 nm) of the total calmodulin, suggesting intense competition among its targets (21Wu X. Bers D.M. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, by overexpressing Ca2+/calmodulin-binding MLCK in cardiomyocytes, we could determine whether Ca2+/calmodulin is functionally limiting for activation of target enzymes such as CaM kinase II and the protein phosphatase calcineurin. Production of Transgenic and Knock-out Mice—The coding region of rabbit skMLCK cDNA (1.8 kb) was subcloned into pCMV5 using the EcoRI restriction sites in pCMV5 to generate pCMV5 skMLCK. The enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-enhanced cyan fluorescent protein biosensor containing the Ca2+/calmodulin-binding sequence (16Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) was subcloned immediately downstream of the rabbit skMLCK cDNA using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites similar to the construction of the biosensor smooth muscle MLCK (20Isotani E.

The addition of the calmodulin sensor to skMLCK allows us to monitor expression as well as to study calmodulin activation properties in cardiomyocytes in the future. Expression and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity of skMLCK from pCMV-41M-skKCS was determined in transfected COS cell lysates (11Ryder J.W. Lau K.S. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol.

Mouse α-myosin heavy chain promoter in the Bluescript vector (pMHC/BS) was a generous gift from Dr. Robbins (22Buck S.H. Konyn P.J. Palermo J. Robbins J. Moss R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H1167-H1171PubMed Google Scholar). The skMLCK biosensor cDNA was isolated from CMV-41M-skKCS using EcoRI and SmaI restriction enzymes to produce a 3.6-kb fragment. The ends were filled using Klenow enzyme and ligated into pMHC/BS, which had been linearized immediately downstream of the MHC promoter using SalI and HindIII restriction enzymes and subsequently filled in with Klenow enzyme. The linearized MHC-41M-skKCS construct DNA was microinjected into fertilized oocytes (ICR strain) for production of transgenic mice by the Transgenic Mouse Facility at the University of Texas South-western Medical Center at Dallas. All protocols involving mice in this study were approved by the University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Five founder animals containing the MHC-41M-skKCS transgenes were identified by Southern analysis and used to establish homozygous transgenic mouse lines. Founder animals containing the MHC-41M-skKCS transgene were identified by Southern blot analysis of tail genomic DNA by using a 32P-labeled 750-bp cDNA encoding enhanced yellow fluorescent protein as a probe. Reverse transcription-PCR was also used to identify transgenic mice. A forward/sense primer (5′-ATCCATCCACGCCGAAGAAAG-3′) and a reverse/antisense primer (5′-CTCGGTCTTCCTTCGTCCTC-3′) were derived from rabbit skMLCK cDNA sequence. These produced a 492-base pair fragment in mice harboring the transgene. Another pair of forward/sense primer (5′-GGTGCCCTAGTCTCAATTTC-3′) and reverse/antisense primer (5′-GAAGAGACTGGAGCCAGGGA-3′) derived from mouse α-MHC promoter produced a 256-base pair fragment for control. Positive founders were used to establish transgenic mouse lines. Mice from two lines expressing different amounts of skMLCK with no obvious phenotype were characterized as described below. Samples of mouse ventricles were excised from transgenic mice and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were analyzed by Western blotting following SDS-PAGE to determine expression of skMLCK (2Zhi G. Ryder J.W. Huang J. Ding P. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, left ventricles quickly removed from anesthetized animals were sliced transversely into apex, middle, and base portions and frozen in liquid nitrogen within 2 min or less. In a different set of hearts, the left ventricular free-wall was sliced into epicardial and endocardial sections with a razor blade. Changes in cRLC phosphorylation occur on the order of 30-45 min in heart, so immediate fixation in situ is not essential to measure the extent of phosphorylation that reflects in vivo values (23Silver P.J.

Muscle samples were subjected to urea/glycerol-PAGE to separate phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated RLCs as described previously (20Isotani E. Zhi G. Lau K.S. Huang J. Mizuno Y. Persechini A. Geguchadze R. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because the urea/glycerol-PAGE system separates nonphosphorylated from monophosphorylated RLC, we have a direct quantitative measure of RLC phosphorylation in terms of percent or mol of phosphate/mol of RLC. Antibodies to cRLC (rabbit polyclonal) or smooth/nonmuscle muscle RLC (mouse monoclonal) were used for the appropriate analyses with Western blotting (20Isotani E. Zhi G. Lau K.S. Huang J. Mizuno Y. Persechini A. Geguchadze R. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and quantitative measurements were processed on a Storm PhosphorImager and analyzed by ImageQuant software. Additional Western blotting was performed on other proteins. Microsomes from heart were prepared with minor modifications (24Wehrens X.H.T. Lehnart S.E. Huang F. Vest J.A. Reiken S.R. Mohler P.J. Sun J. Guatimosim S. Song L.-S. Rosemblit N. D'Armiento J.M. Napolitano C. Memmi M. Priori S.G. Lederer W.J. Marks A.R. Cell. 2003; 113: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE and blotted with antibodies to phospholamban as described previously (25Wehrens X.H.T. Lehnart S.E. Reiken S.R. Marks A.R. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: e61-e70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The endogenous Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent calcineurin phosphatase activity was measured by assessing the expression of MCIP1.4 (modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein 1, exon 4 isoform), which is a direct target of the calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) pathway (26Ni Y.G. Berenji K. Wang N. Oh M. Sachan N. Dey A. Cheng J. Lu G. Morris D.J. Castrillon D.H. Gerard R.D. Rothermel B.A. Hill J.A. Circulation. 2006; 114: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Structural Analyses—Before histological evaluation, hearts were arrested in diastole by injection of 10% KCl into the jugular vein of anesthetized mice and then processed into paraffin according to routine procedures (27Sheehan D.C. Hrapchak B.B. Theory and Practice of Histotechnology. 2nd Ed. Batelle Press, Columbus, OH1980: 40-88Google Scholar, 28Woods A.E. Ellis R.C. Laboratory Histopathology, A Complete Reference. Churchill-Livingstone Press, London1994: 5.2-1-5.2-7Google Scholar). Four-chamber, longitudinal views were sectioned at the level of the aortic and pulmonary valves, and transverse views were sectioned at the level of the papillary muscles. Slides of four-chamber, longitudinal sections were randomized, and a blinded observer attempted to sort the slides into groups by distinctions in microscopic morphology. Cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas were measured using OpenLab software to calculate areas from outlined contours of cells in photomicrographs of transverse sections (29Nart P. Williams A. Thompson H. Innocent G.T. J. Comp. Pathol. 2004; 130: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells with a symmetry ratio of >0.6 (where 1 equals round) were used in the analysis to avoid measuring areas of cardiomyocytes sectioned tangentially. For transmission electron microscopy, dissected ventricles were rinsed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, cut into blocks of 3 × 1.5 × 0.5 mm, and immersion-fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer at 4 °C. Sections were cut by routine procedures, and images were made by AMT Advantage Software (version 4.1.0, for IC-PCI Frame Grabber with ORCA camera). Animal Protocols—Exercise conditioning by voluntary wheel running was used to promote myocardial hypertrophy as described previously (30Rothermel B.A. McKinsey T.A. Vega R.B. Nicol R.L. Mammen P. Yang J. Antos C.L. Shelton J.M. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3328-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Litter-matched male mice at 9-10 weeks of age were placed in individual cages where the number of revolutions/day was recorded; mice running 3 or more km/day were selected for analyses. Hearts were collected after 4 weeks of voluntary exercise. Other groups of matched mice were treated with isoproterenol for 7 days to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Isoproterenol at 40 mg/ml/g of mouse in saline or saline itself was injected into an Alzet® mini-osmotic pump (Model 2001, Durect Corp.), which releases at 1.0 μl/hr. Pumps were surgically implanted on the back during anesthesia. At the end of treatment protocols, mice were anesthetized (50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital) and weighed. Whole hearts were removed, dissected free of great vessels, lightly blotted to remove blood, and weighed. Tibial length was measured. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical evaluation was carried out by using an unpaired Student's t test for two comparisons or analysis of variance (plus the Newman-Keuls method) for multiple comparisons of data with variance homoscedasticity assessed by the Bartlett method. Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum and Nemenyi tests were used in multiple comparisons for data not meeting the homoscedastic variance test. Significance was accepted at a value of p < 0.05. Transgenic Mice Express skMLCK in Heart—We generated transgenic mice producing the skMLCK transgene (TG-skMLCK) specifically in cardiomyocytes with the full-length rabbit skMLCK cDNA coding region driven by the mouse α-MHC promoter. PCR analysis showed a 492-bp fragment from rabbit skMLCK, a 256-bp mouse α-MHC promoter fragment in transgenic skMLCK mice, and only the 256-bp fragment in WT mice (Fig. 1). Southern blots showed that DNA from transgenic mice has a primary BamHI fragment at 2.5 kb that is absent in DNA from WT mice. Five founder lines were established, two of which (the AM and AN lines) displayed significant skMLCK expression in the heart and were used for additional characterization. Transgenic mice express TG-skMLCK in heart tissue. Immunoblotting shows that TG-skMLCK migrated at the expected molecular mass of 145 kDa (Fig. 1) and was present in ventricles from AM and AN lines in amounts greater than skMLCK expressed in fast-twitch, extensor digitorum longus skeletal muscle and with expression in AM greater than in the AN line. There was no detectable skMLCK in heart tissue analyzed by immunoblotting, consistent with previous reports (2Zhi G. Ryder J.W. Huang J. Ding P. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17519-17524Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 31Herring B.P. Dixon S. Gallagher P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1656-C1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain a quantitative measure of the amount of skMLCK expressed in heart, we did Western blots with heart samples containing the transgene relative to the rabbit fast-twitch gracilis skeletal muscle. The cardiac tissue contained 6.3-fold and 0.63-fold amounts of kinase in the AM and AN lines, respectively (Fig. 1). Measurement of Sarcomeric and Cytoplasmic Myosin RLC Phosphorylation—The specificities of our antibodies to sarcomeric cRLC and to smooth and nonmuscle RLC were first determined in immunoblots. Immunoblotting showed that the polyclonal antibody against cardiac sarcomeric myosin RLC recognized only purified cRLC, but not the smooth muscle or cytoplasmic nonmuscle RLC (Fig. 2A). The monoclonal antibody raised against smooth RLC identified both purified smooth muscle RLC and nonmuscle RLC, but not sarcomeric cRLC. Additional characterizations were performed with urea/glycerol-PAGE that separates monophosphorylated from the nonphosphorylated RLC because of the two additional negative charges introduced by phosphate (32High C.W. Stull J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: H756-H764PubMed Google Scholar, 33Colburn J.C. Michnoff C.H. Hsu L.C. Slaughter C.A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19166-19173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody raised against smooth RLC identified nonphosphorylated and monophosphorylated forms of RLC in ventricular tissue samples (Fig. 2B) that contain a mixture of cytoplasmic and smooth muscle RLCs that comigrate in urea/glycerol-PAGE (data not shown). The cytoplasmic nRLC in the tissue samples is derived from nonmuscle cells as well as from cardiomyocytes (12Takeda K. Yu Z.-X. Qian S. Chin T.K. Adelstein R.S. Ferrans V.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Tullio A.N. Accili D. Ferrans V.J. Yu Z.X. Takeda K. Grinberg A. Westphal H. Preston Y.A. Adelstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12407-12412Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), but an increase in nRLC phosphorylation associated with cardiomyocyte-specific expression of skMLCK will result from phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes. The polyclonal antibody against the sarcomeric cRLC recognized nonphosphorylated and monophosphorylated cRLC (Fig. 2B). Thus, the two antibodies may be used for quantitative phosphorylation analyses of sarcomeric cRLC and cytoplasmic nRLC in heart. This phosphorylation analysis is sufficiently sensitive to measure cRLC phosphorylation quantitatively in different segments of mouse heart (Fig. 2C). skMLCK Expression in Cardiomyocytes Increases cRLC Phosphorylation—RLC phosphorylation was examined first in ventricular tissues from WT mice. The extent of cRLC phosphorylation in ventricles from 9-week-old WT animals decreased slightly from 0.46 ± 0.01 mol of phosphate/mol of cRLC at the apex to 0.36 ± 0.02 mol of phosphate/mol of cRLC at the base (Fig. 3A). The extent of cRLC phosphorylation was not statistically different in 6-month-old mice in comparing apex (0.50 ± 0.02 mol of phosphate/mol of cRLC) to base values (0.43 ± 0.03 mol of phosphate/mol of cRLC) (Fig. 4A). We also measured cRLC phosphorylation in ventricular free-wall sections from WT mice (n = 3). The extents of cRLC phosphorylation for left ventricular epicardium, endocardium, and septum were 0.35 ± 0.01, 0.40 ± 0.04, and 0.32 ± 0.03, respectively. These values were not significantly different. These quantitative measurements do not support the previous conclusion regarding a gradient of cRLC phosphorylation in ventricular heart muscle (7Davis J.S. Hassanzadeh S. Winitsky S. Lin H. Satorius C. Vemuri R. Aletras A.H. Wen H. Epstein N.D. Cell. 2001; 107: 631-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Phosphorylation of cRLC and nRLC in heart regions from 6-month-old mice and exercised mice. Transgenic skMLCK mice (AM) at 6 months of age display a significant increase in phosphorylation of cRLC (A) and nRLC (C) in apex, middle, and base portions of left ventricular muscle compared with age-matched WT mice. Hearts from exercised, 14-week-old, transgenic skMLCK mice (AM) show increased phosphorylation of cRLC (B) and nRLC (D) in the apex compared with age-matched, exercised WT mice. Values are means ± S.E. of 5-8 samples. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 versus WT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We analyzed changes in cRLC phosphorylation in hearts from transgenic animals overexpressing skMLCK. The extent of phosphorylation of cRLC in all regions of ventricular tissues from 9-week-old transgenic AM line mice was significantly greater than observed in WT mice (Fig. 3A). However, cRLC phosphorylation did not change in the transgenic AN line mice expressing lower amounts of the TG-skMLCK. These results for AM and AN mice are similar to results obtained in skeletal muscle with other transgenic mice (11Ryder J.W. Lau K.S. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20447-20454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Overexpressing skMLCK at low amounts did not enhance RLC phosphorylation. The skMLCK phosphorylates skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle RLCs with similar kinetic properties in contrast to the smooth muscle MLCK, which is more selective to the smooth and cytoplasmic nonmuscle RLCs (15Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Thus, we expected some overexpression of the kinase would lead to smaller but significant increases in RLC phosphorylation in heart and skeletal muscle. At 6 months of age, cRLC phosphorylation remained elevated in transgenic AM mice compared with WT animals in all three regions of the heart. No significant differences were found among the three heart regions within WT or transgenic animals (Fig. 4A). Thus, enhanced cRLC phosphorylation produced by TG-skMLCK was maintained. Moreover, exercise training that produces cardiac hypertrophy (see below) did not affect the extent of cRLC phosphorylation in TG or WT mice (Fig. 4B). skMLCK Expression in Cardiomyocytes Increases nRLC Phosphorylation—Similar to results obtained with sarcomeric cRLC, there was no consistent significant difference in the extent of nRLC phosphorylation in the apex compared with the base of ventricles from WT mice (Fig. 3B). Overexpression of TG-skMLCK in hearts of the AM, but not AN, mouse line resulted in an increase in nRLC phosphorylation in 9-week-old animals (Fig. 3B) that was still significantly increased at 6 months (Fig. 4C). skMLCK Expression Does Not Cause Cardiac Hypertrophy—Hearts from transgenic mice expressing TG-skMLCK showed no hypertrophy in 9-week-old and 6-month-old animals (Table 1). In 9-week-old transgenic mice, the heart weight to tibial length ratio was significantly less than the ratio for WT animals, but there were no differences at 6 months. Histological examinations of hearts from TG-skMLCK (AM) mice also showed no differences from WT at either age. Hearts had no cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, necrosis, or interstitial fibrosis (supplemental Fig. S"

Wild-type p53, a tumor suppressor protein, inhibits cellular growth and cell cycle progression at several checkpoints. Approximately 80% of tumor cells lack a p53 mutation but exhibit a 5–10-fold reduction of p53 protein levels compared with corresponding normal tissues (1Bensaad K. Vousden K.H. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1278-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). p53 is likewise present in non-malignant lung epithelial cells in which it contributes to the apoptotic response to injury.

In brief, cells stimulated with PBS or uPA for 6 h were then treated with 20 μg/ml of DRB (Calbiochem) to inhibit ongoing transcription, after which total RNA was isolated at specific time points. PAI-1 mRNA was measured by Northern blotting. Transfection of p53-deficient H1299 Cells with p53 cDNA—To confirm that p53 regulates PAI-1 expression, p53 cDNA was cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1.

Effect of Tobacco Smoke Extract (TSE) or Bleomycin on Beas2B Cell p53 and PAI-1 Expression—To determine the effects of TSE on Beas2B cells in vitro, we prepared extracts of tobacco smoke by passing smoke from a burning cigarette through sterile PBS. An absorbance of 1.00 at 260 nm was designated as 100%. The extract was sterile-filtered before use, and fresh extract was used each time. Alternatively, we treated Beas2B cells with bleomycin (40 μg/ml) for 24 h, and the CL and CM were analyzed for p53 and PAI-1 expression by Western blotting as described above. TUNEL Staining of Beas2B Cells—TSE- and bleomycin-induced Beas2B cell apoptosis was assessed by DNA staining to determine the extent of DNA damage using DeadEnd colorimetric TUNEL system kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, biotinylated nucleotide was incorporated at the 3′-OH DNA using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, recombinant enzyme. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin was then bound to these biotinylated nucleotides, which were detected using the peroxidase substrate, hydrogen peroxide, and the stable chromogen diaminobenzidine. The apoptotic nuclei are stained dark brown using this procedure. Alternatively, we analyzed Beas2B cells treated with TSE or bleomycin by flow cytometry following annexin-V/propidium iodide staining to quantitate the apoptotic cell population, as described earlier (8Shetty S. Gyetko M. Mazar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28133-28141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Molecular Cloning, Expression, and Purification of p53—The coding sequences of p53 or various deletion fragments were PCR-amplified using a previously cloned full-length cDNA packaged in pcDNA 3.1 vector, in conjunction with sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers, and the design was based on the 5′- and 3′-regions of the open reading frame. The 1,182-bp full-length or different deletion PCR products were subcloned and transformed into Escherichia coli. GST-p53 fusion proteins expressed by these cells were purified according to the method described previously (23Shetty S. Muniappa H.B. Halady P.K.S. Idell S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recombinant full-length p53 (rp53) proteins obtained by thrombin digestion or GST fusion proteins containing various p53 deletions were analyzed on a SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-p53 antibody to check the purity. p53-PAI-1 mRNA Binding Assays—Binding activities were tested by gel mobility shift assay using uniformly 32P-labeled transcripts corresponding to the PAI-1 coding (CDR) or 3′-un-translated (UTR) regions synthesized using T7 or SP6 polymerase (Ambion, TX) (21Shetty S. Kumar A. Idell S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 30 °C by incubating these transcripts (20,000 cpm) with either full-length or truncated rp53 protein as described earlier (21Shetty S. Kumar A. Idell S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Samples were then separated by electrophoresis on 5% native polyacrylamide gels with 0.25× TBE running buffer. The gels were dried and autoradiographed at -70 °C using Kodak x-ray film. In a separate experiment, following heparin digestion, the reaction mixtures were UV-irradiated on ice, and the immobilized RNA-protein complex was separated on SDS-PAGE, dried, and autoradiographed. Alternatively, full-length p53 or various deletion fragments were separated on a SDS-PAGE, electro-blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to Northwestern assay using 32P-labeled PAI-1 mRNA 3′-UTR transcript as described earlier (23Shetty S. Muniappa H.B. Halady P.K.S. Idell S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We also treated rp53 protein or preformed rp53·PAI-1 mRNA complex with varying amounts of monoclonal antibody against human p53 protein or nonspecific mouse IgG (mIgG) and subjected to gel mobility shift assay. Immunoprecipitation of RNA·Protein Complex—To confirm the direct interaction of p53 protein with PAI-1 mRNA in vivo, we cross-linked Beas2B cells treated with PBS and uPA (50 ng/ml or 1 μg/ml) with formalin as described before (24Niranjanakumari S. Lasda E. Brazas R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Methods (Duluth). 2002; 26: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The cytosolic extracts were immunoprecipitated using nonspecific mIgG followed by p53 monoclonal antibody in the presence of RNase inhibitor and ribosomal RNA for 1 h at room temperature. The immune complexes were later precipitated using protein A/G plus-agarose and the agarose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. Total RNA was isolated from the immune complexes using total RNA isolation reagent and associated PAI-1 mRNA was amplified by RT-PCR using specific primers in the presence of 32P-labeled dCTP. The corresponding nonradioactive PCR products were later identified by nucleotide sequencing (23Shetty S. Muniappa H.B. Halady P.K.S. Idell S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Competitive Inhibition by Sense and Antisense mRNA or Polyribonucleotides—rp53 protein was incubated with various amounts (0–100-fold excess) of unlabeled PAI-1 sense or antisense 3′-UTR mRNA or 500 m excess of ribonucleotide poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), or poly(U) (Sigma) for 30 min at 30 °C prior to the 32P-labeled PAI-1 mRNA and RNase T1 steps. In a separate experiment, rp53 was treated with SDS (0.1%) or proteinase K (2.5 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to addition of 32P-labeled PAI-1 mRNA. The reaction mixtures were later subjected to gel mobility shift assay. Similarly, 32P-labeled PAI-1 3′-UTR mRNA was pre-digested with RNase A and T1 (50 units) for 30 min at 37 °C before subjecting to gel mobility shift assay using rp53 protein. Determination of p53-binding Site on PAI-1 mRNA 3′-UTR—PAI-1 3′-UTR cDNA fragments of differing size were synthesized by PCR amplification of a full-length PAI-1 cDNA template using different sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers that were designed based on 5′ and 3′ regions of the open reading frame. These deletion fragments were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 and transcribed in vitro in the presence of [32P]UTP. 32P-Labeled deletion transcripts were subsequently used as probes for gel mobility shift or UV cross-linking studies to localize the rp53 protein-binding sequence on PAI-1 3′-UTR mRNA (21Shetty S. Kumar A. Idell S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Construction of β-Globin/PAI-1 Chimeric Message—The complete human β-globin cDNA in plasmid (pSP6βc) was excised and inserted into the HindIII-XbaI site of the plasmid pcDNA 3.1. Two 70-bp DNA fragments, one corresponding to the rp53-binding (C3) and the other corresponding to the control nonbinding sequence (C4), were prepared from PAI-1 cDNA. Each of these cDNA fragments was inserted into the 3′-UTR of β-globin cDNA. These chimeric cDNA constructs were then subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1. The orientations and sequences of β-globin/PAI-1 chimeric clones were verified by sequencing. Beas2B cells were transfected with the prepared chimeric plasmid constructs by lipofection. Total RNA was isolated at various time points after the inhibition of transcription by DRB. Chimeric β-globin/PAI-1 mRNA was then measured by Northern blotting using 32P-labeled cDNA (25Shetty S. Idell S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13771-13779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The half-life of the mRNA at each interval was determined by densitometry, normalized to the β-actin control mRNA of the samples, and subsequently compared with the densitometric values of samples determined at the 0-h base line of each experiment. Effect of p53 Binding PAI-1 mRNA 3′-UTR Sequence on PAI-1 Expression—Chimeric mRNAs were created using methods we reported previously (21Shetty S. Kumar A. Idell S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Shetty S. Idell S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24549-24556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). H1299 cells expressing vector cDNA or p53 cDNA were transfected with chimeric β-globin/PAI-1 cDNA containing the 70-nt p53 protein-binding sequence of the PAI-1 mRNA 3′-UTR or control non-p53 binding CDR sequences as described above for 48 h to competitively inhibit p53 binding to endogenous PAI-1 mRNA. The expression of chimeric β-globin/PAI-1 mRNA containing 70-nt p53-binding or nonbinding control sequences was confirmed by RT-PCR using β-globin and PAI-1-specific sense and antisense sequences or by Northern blotting as described above. PAI-1 expression was determined by Western blotting. Statistical Analysis—We tested the differences between Beas2B cells treated with p53 siRNA or PAI-1 siRNA and corresponding nonspecific control siRNA transfected cells exposed to TSE or bleomycin, respectively, by Student's t test. Expression of PAI-1 Protein and mRNA by p53-deficient Lung Carcinoma Cells and Non-malignant Lung Epithelial Cells—We recently reported that uPA induces PAI-1 expression through post-transcriptional stabilization of its mRNA (7Shetty S. Khalil B. Cines D.B. Idell S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18124-18131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in lung epithelial cells. uPA (200 ng/ml or 4 nm) likewise induced PAI-1 expression in rat smooth muscle cells (26Lau H.K.F. Ho J. Br. J. Haematol. 2002; 117: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). At similar uPA concentrations (25–250 ng/ml), p53 expression is induced in lung epithelial cells (8Shetty S. Gyetko M. Mazar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28133-28141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To determine whether p53 influences PAI-1 expression, we initially treated non-malignant Beas2B as well as malignant large cell lung carcinoma H1299 (p53-/-) cells with PBS or uPA (50 ng/ml) and assessed the induction of p53 expression by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, panel i, Beas2B cells express basal level of p53 and uPA-induced p53 protein, whereas H1299 cells neither express p53 nor respond to uPA stimulation. Northern blotting indicated that uPA failed to alter p53 mRNA in Beas2B cells, and p53 mRNA likewise was not detected in H1299 cells treated with or without uPA (Fig. 1A, panel ii). Therefore, the lysates of these two cell types were used for Western blotting to determine whether PAI-1 is differentially expressed because of the differences in their basal levels of p53. As shown in Fig. 1B, panel i, Beas2B cells express minimal PAI-1, and uPA (50 ng/ml) increased PAI-1 expression. This was consistent with a similar increase in expression of both 3.2- and 2.4-kb alternate spliced variants of PAI-1 mRNA in Beas2B cells stimulated with uPA (Fig. 1B, panel ii). Unlike Beas2B cells, p53-deficient cells expressed minimal amounts of PAI-1 protein as well mRNA and failed to respond to uPA treatment (Fig. 1B, panels i and ii). These observations led us to speculate that p53 is involved in uPA-mediated regulation of PAI-1 expression by lung epithelial and carcinoma cells. Effect of p53 on PAI-1 Protein and mRNA Expression—To confirm that p53 is involved in lung epithelial cell PAI-1 expression mediated by uPA, p53-deficient H1299 cells were transfected with either vector (pcDNA 3.1) cDNA alone or p53 cDNA cloned in pcDNA3.1. The cells were analyzed for p53 expression. H1299 cells transfected with p53 cDNA expressed p53 protein, whereas empty vector cDNA transfected cells failed to express p53 protein (Fig. 2A. panel i). Treatment of p53 cDNA overexpressing cells with 50 ng/ml of either full-length uPA (data not shown) or its amino-terminal uPAR-binding fragment failed to further increase p53 expression. These cells were also analyzed for PAI-1 expression by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, panel ii, pcDNA 3.1 cDNA-transfected H1299 cells expressed minimal amounts of PAI-1, and uPA stimulation failed to increase the expression of PAI-1 in these cells. However, transfection of p53 in H1299 cells induced relatively large amounts of basal PAI-1 expression. Inhibition of uPA gene transactivation by p53 probably caused less PAI-1 to remain at the cell surface uPA·uPAR complex which may thereby contribute to the differences in PAI-1 antigenic signals between CL and CM. We later analyzed the effects of p53 restoration at the PAI-1 mRNA level by Northern blotting and found that p53 expression similarly increased PAI-1 mRNA expression compared with vector cDNA-transfected cells. These cells further failed to respond to uPA stimulation (Fig. 2A, panel iii). These results confirm that p53 plays a major role in PAI-1 expression by H1299 cells. To extend these studies, we next inhibited p53 expression by RNA silencing in non-malignant Beas2B lung epithelial cells and analyzed p53 expression by Western blotting. We found that treatment of Beas2B cells with p53 siRNA inhibited both basal and uPA-mediated p53 expression by more than 95% compared with control nonspecific siRNA (Nsp siRNA)-treated cells (Fig. 2B, panel i). We next analyzed basal and uPA-mediated PAI-1 expression in siRNA-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, panel ii, Beas2B cells treated with nonspecific siRNA expressed minimal basal levels of PAI-1, and uPA stimulation enhanced PAI-1 in the CM and CL by severalfold. However, inhibition of p53 expression by p53 siRNA suppressed both basal and uPA-mediated PAI-1 expression in these cells compared with control siRNA-treated cells. We also confirmed that blocking the expression of p53 inhibited basal PAI-1 mRNA and that uPA failed to increase PAI-1 mRNA compared with control siRNA-treated Beas2B cells (Fig. 2B, panel iii). These results demonstrate that p53 regulates PAI-1 expression in Beas2B cells. Effect of p53 Expression on PAI-1 mRNA Synthesis and Degradation—p53 protein binds to the PAI-1 promoter sequence and induces PAI-1 mRNA transcription (27Kunz C. Pebler S. Otte J. Von Der Ahe D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3710-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Parra M. Jardi M. Koziczak M. Nagamine Y. Munoz-Canoves P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36303-36310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next tested the inference that p53 expression affects the rate of PAI-1 mRNA transcription in H1299 cells. Nuclear extracts from p53-deficient cells transfected with or without vector or p53 cDNA in pcDNA 3.1 were subjected to run-on transcription to determine the rate of PAI-1 mRNA synthesis. p53 expression failed to affect PAI-1 mRNA synthesis in H1299 cells (data not shown). Because uPA induces PAI-1 expression through post-transcriptional stabilization of PAI-1 mRNA (7Shetty S. Khalil B. Cines D.B. Idell S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18124-18131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we inferred that p53 might control PAI-1 expression at the level of PAI-1 mRNA degradation. We therefore treated naive H1299 or H1299 cells transfected with vector cDNA or p53 cDNA with DRB to inhibit ongoing transcription, and the decay of PAI-1 mRNA was analyzed at varying time periods by Northern blotting. H1299 cells expressing p53 produced stable PAI-1 mRNA (t½ > 12 h) when compared with untransfected (t½ < 3 h) or vector cDNA (t½ < 3 h) expressing p53-deficient cells (Fig. 3A). These results confirm that p53 regulates PAI-1 mRNA stability. To independently confirm that p53 down-regulates PAI-1 mRNA degradation at the post-transcriptional level in non-malignant lung epithelial cells, Beas2B cells were treated with control siRNA and p53 siRNA to suppress basal p53 expression. Because Beas2B cells express low levels of basal PAI-1 protein and respond to uPA stimulation (Fig. 1B, panel i), both control and p53 siRNA transfected cells were treated with PBS or uPA (50 ng/ml) for 6 h to induce maximum PAI-1 mRNA (7Shetty S. Khalil B. Cines D.B. Idell S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18124-18131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Ongoing transcription was inhibited, and the level of PAI-1 mRNA was determined by Northern blotting. Our results show that PAI-1 mRNA is relatively unstable (t½ < 3 h) in control siRNA treated Beas2B cells, and uPA treatment stabilized PAI-1 mRNA in these cells. However, uPA also failed to slow the decay of PAI-1 mRNA (t½ < 3 h) (Fig. 3B) in Beas2B cells in which p53 expression was inhibited by p53 siRNA. PAI-1 expression was relatively low but detectable in PBS-treated Beas2B cells, which were used to assess the effect of p53 inhibition on basal PAI-1 mRNA levels. However, the observed lack of PAI-1 mRNA stabilization in p53 siRNA-treated Beas2B cells following uPA treatment confirms that p53 contributes to the regulation of PAI-1 mRNA stability. We next tested if p53 likewise regulates PAI-1 translation by inhibiting protein degradation using MG-132 as described by Takagi et al. (29Takagi M. Absalon M.J. McLure K.G. Kastan M.B. Cell. 2005; 123: 49-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and found that p53 expression in H1299 cells failed to enhance the rate of PAI-1 protein translation (Fig. 3C).

https://openalex.org/W2003078536,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase JNK1 suppresses interleukin-3 withdrawal-induced cell death through phosphorylation of the BH3-only pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bad at Thr-201. It is unknown whether JNK1 regulates glycolysis, an important metabolic process that is involved in cell survival, and if so, whether the regulation depends on Thr-201 phosphorylation of Bad. Here we report that phosphorylation of Bad by JNK1 is required for glycolysis through activation of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), one of the key enzymes that catalyze glycolysis. Genetic disruption of Jnk1 alleles or silencing of Jnk1 by small interfering RNA abrogates glycolysis induced by growth/survival factors such as serum or interleukin-3. Proteomic analysis identifies PFK-1 as a novel Bad-associated protein. Although the interaction between PFK-1 and Bad is independent of JNK1, Thr-201 phosphorylation of Bad by JNK1 is required for PFK-1 activation. Thus, our results provide a novel molecular mechanism by which JNK1 promotes glycolysis for cell survival.

Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). Bad plays a critical role in the cross-talk between the growth/survival factor signaling pathway and the intrinsic death machinery (35Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic activity of Bad is regulated by extracellular stimuli via post-translational modifications including phosphorylation (35Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

In response to the stimulation of growth/survival factors such as interleukin-3 (IL-3) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), Bad is phosphorylated at the “regulatory serines” (Ser-112, Ser-136, and Ser-155) by a group of protein kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Akt, Rsk, and p70S6K (37Datta S.R.

Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The hyperphosphorylated form of Bad is inactive in terms of its pro-apoptotic function as it is sequestrated in the cytoplasm via its interaction with 14-3-3, a group of cytoplasmic anchorage proteins that interact with proteins through specific phospho-serine/threonine motifs (35Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). Withdrawal of growth/survival factors leads to dephosphorylation of Bad, which translocates to the mitochondria, where it binds prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl-XL and thereby allows the oligomerization of Bax and Bak (41Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). This results in increased mitochondria permeability, release of cytochrome c, caspase activation, and ultimately, apoptotic cell death. Recently, it has been shown that JNK suppresses IL-3 withdrawal-induced apoptosis in hematopoietic pro-B FL-5.12 cells via phosphorylation of Bad at Thr-201 (42Yu C. Minemoto Y. Zhang J. Liu J. Tang F. Bui T.N. Xiang J. Lin A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Bad by JNK at Thr-201 is also required for its interaction with 14-3-3 (42Yu C. Minemoto Y. Zhang J. Liu J. Tang F. Bui T.N. Xiang J. Lin A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition to regulation of apoptosis, Bad is involved in regulation of glycolysis, a metabolic process that is required for cell survival (43Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. Gygi S.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). It has been shown that inactivation of Bad by phosphorylation at the regulatory serines (Ser-112, Ser-136, and Ser-155) is required for the activity of mitochondrial glucokinase, one of the key enzymes that are responsible for glycolysis and ATP production (43Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. Gygi S.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Thus, inactivation of Bad may be critical for suppression of apoptosis and maintaining of glycolysis. Here we report that JNK1-mediated phosphorylation of Bad at Thr-201 is required for maintaining normal glycolysis for cell survival through activation of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), which is another key enzyme in glycolysis. Reagents—Antibodies against Bad (C-20), Bcl-XL (H5), PFK-1(K-15), and Xpress (M-21) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against JNK (antibody 333 for immunoprecipitation and 666 for immunoblotting) were from Pharmingen. Anti-M2 antibody (F1804), triose phosphate isomerase, aldolase, α-glycerophosphate, dehydrogenase, and fructose-6-phosphate were from Sigma. The specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 was synthesized and purified (29Tang F. Tang G. Xiang J. Dai Q. Rosner M.R. Lin A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP and [35S]methionine were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [5-3H]glucose was from GE Healthcare. Lipofectamine 2000 and the colloidal blue staining kit were from Invitrogen. Plasmids—pGEX-KG murine Bad was a gift from Dr. Stanley Korsmeyer. T201V mutation was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), pCDNA3.1-Hygro (+) vectors encoding wild-type (WT) M2-mBad, and M2-mBad(T201V) were generated by the addition of a N-terminal M2 tag to mBad and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Murine PFK-1 clone (clone number: MGC-6544) was from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and subcloned into pCDNA3.1-HisB vector. Cell Culture and Transfection—IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell line FL5.12, FL5.12/Bcl-XL, FL5.12 Bcl-XL/M2-Bad were generated and cultured as described previously (42Yu C. Minemoto Y. Zhang J. Liu J. Tang F. Bui T.N. Xiang J. Lin A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In IL-3 deprivation experiments, FL5.12 Bcl-XL/Bad cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and recultured in media lacking IL-3. Jnk1–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts(MEFs) were prepared from Jnk1 null mice, a gift from Dr. Michael Karin (44Sabapathy K. Jochum W. Hochedlinger K. Chang L. Karin M. Wagner E.F. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and immortalized as described (26Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Bad–/– fibroblasts (a gift from Dr. Stanley Korsmeyer) and COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. Transfection was performed using ExGene 500 (MBI Fermentas), according to the manufacturer's protocol, or by electroporation with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 960 microfarads/250 V. Mass Spectrometry—Bad-associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from 8 mg of cytosolic extracts of FL5.12/Bcl-XL cells or FL5.12 Bcl-XL/Bad stable cells. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue, and protein bands of interest were excised and in-gel digested. The resultant tryptic peptides were identified as described previously (45Zhao Y. Zhang W. Kho Y. Zhao Y. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Protein Kinase Assays and Immunoblotting—Immune complex kinase assays and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun pull down kinase assays were performed and quantitated as described previously (8Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Briefly, kinase assays were carried out for 60 min at 30 °C in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm nonradioactive ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. WT or mutant GST-Bad or GST-c-Jun (2–4 μg) was used as substrate. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Phosphorylated proteins were detected and quantitated by PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Active JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates prepared from cells stimulated by UV (60 J/m2, 2 min), using anti-JNK1 antibody (antibody 333). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (46Tang G. Yang J. Minemoto Y. Lin A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PFK-1 Assay—PFK-1 activity was measured as described previously (47Sapico V. Anderson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3252-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed by phosphate-buffered saline once and lysed with M2 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. 20 μg of supernatants were mixed with 1 ml of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm ATP, 0.15 mm NADH, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1 mm AMP, 1 mm NH4Cl, 5 units of triose phosphate isomerase/ml, 0.5 units of aldolase/ml, 0.5 units of α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase/ml, and 5 mm fructose-6-phosphate). Absorbance at 340 nm was read at room temperature every 2 min for a period of 10 min in an Ultrospec 1100 pro-spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare). Data are expressed as the change in absorbance at 340 nm/min/mg of protein × 103. Measurement of Glycolysis—Glycolysis was measured by monitoring the conversion of [5-3H]glucose to [3H]H2Oas described previously (48Liang Y. Buettger C. Berner D.K. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 1018-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline prior to resuspension in 1 ml of Krebs buffer followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 0.5 ml of Krebs buffer containing 10 mm glucose. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 mCi of [5-3H]glucose. After 1 h at 37 °C, triplicate 50-μl aliquots were transferred to uncapped PCR tubes containing 50 μl of 0.2 n HCl. Each tube was transferred to a scintillation vial containing 0.5 ml of H2O such that the water in the vial and the contents of the PCR tube were not mixed with each other. The vials were sealed, and diffusion was allowed to occur for 3 days. The amounts of diffused and undiffused 3H were determined by scintillation counting. Appropriate [3H]glucose-only and 3H2O-only controls were included for the calculation of 3H2O in each sample that reflects the rate of glycolysis. In Vitro Translation—The pCDNA3.1-based PFK-1 and Bcl-XL were translated in vitro using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate TnT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA Transfection and Retroviral Infection—siRNA specific for murine JNK1 or green fluorescent protein was designed by using the SiDESIGN center (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The target sequence for Jnk1 is 5′-TGATTCAGATGGAGTTAGA-3′, and for Gfp, the sequence is 5′-GAAGAAGATGGTGCGCTCC-3′. The siRNA was transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions. Retroviral particles were produced using the pSOS vector system, as described previously (49Luo Q. Kang Q. Song W.X. Luu H.H. Luo X. An N. Luo J. Deng Z.L. Jiang W. Yin H. Chen J. Sharff K.A. Tang N. Bennett E. Haydon R.C. He T.C. Gene (Amst.). 2007; 395: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The FL5.12 Bcl-XL/M2-Bad cells were infected with the retroviruses four consecutive times (with 6-h intervals). After 48 h, the infection procedure was repeated to enrich the frequency of infection. The bulk infected cells were collected for experiments 48–72 h after the second round of infection. Statistic Analysis—All statistic analyses were performed by using the Student's t test. A probability level of 0.05 or less was considered as significant. Data are presented as mean values ± standard error. JNK1 Is Essential for IL-3- or Serum-induced Glycolysis—Maintenance of normal glycolysis is important for cell survival (50Raff M.C.

The observations that phosphorylation of Bad at the regulatory serines (Ser-112, Ser-136, and Ser-155) is required for glycolysis (43Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S.

Xiang J. Lin A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) prompted us to test whether JNK1 regulates glycolysis, using hematopoietic pro-B FL5.12 cells stably expressing Bcl-XL and Bad (for simplicity, referred to as FL-5.12 cells hereinafter unless indicated otherwise) (36Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar, 42Yu C. Minemoto Y. Zhang J. Liu J. Tang F. Bui T.N. Xiang J. Lin A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Cells were subjected to IL-3 withdrawal for 2 h followed by the readdition of IL-3 for 15 min in the presence or absence of the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125. Under this condition, JNK1 activity was significantly reduced upon IL-3 withdrawal, stimulated by IL-3 readdition, and inhibited by SP600125 (Fig. 1A), consistent with the previous report (42Yu C. Minemoto Y. Zhang J. Liu J. Tang F. Bui T.N. Xiang J. Lin A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Metabolically labeling the cells with [5-3H]glucose revealed that the glycolytic rate was reduced following IL-3 withdrawal but became robust upon IL-3 readdition (Fig. 1A), consistent with the previous report that IL-3 up-regulates glycolysis in parental FL5.12 cells (53Bauer D.E. Harris M.H. Plas D.R. Lum J.J. Hammerman P.S. Rathmell J.C. Riley J.L. Thompson C.B. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1303-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly blocked IL-3 readdition-stimulated glycolysis (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with FL-5.12 cells expressing specific retroviral shRNA of JNK1 but not control shRNA (Fig. 1B). The stimulation of glycolysis by IL-3 readdition was modest (Fig. 1B). This is most likely due to the high basal level of glycolysis that may be independent on IL-3. This notion was further supported by the observation that in immortalized MEFs, silencing of JNK1 by siRNA or genetic disruption of Jnk1 alleles abolished fetal bovine serum (FBS)-induced glycolysis (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, JNK1 is required for growth factor-induced glycolysis. Given the fact that up-regulation of glycolysis is a direct effect of IL-3, rather than a compensatory result of growth factor stimulation of cell growth and proliferation (53Bauer D.E. Harris M.H. Plas D.R. Lum J.J. Hammerman P.S. Rathmell J.C. Riley J.L. Thompson C.B. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1303-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), IL-3-induced JNK1-dependent higher glycolytic rate may be beneficial to cell survival under stress conditions. JNK Regulates Activation of PFK-1—Hexokinase and PFK-1 are two rate-limiting enzymes in the glycolytic process (54Wilson J.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 126: 65-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Rempel A. Mathupala S.P. Griffin C.A. Hawkins A.L. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar, 56Layzer R.B. Rowland L.P. Bank W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3823-3831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of Bad at Ser-112, Ser-136, and Ser-155 by several protein kinases (cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Akt, and Rsk) is required for activation of glucokinase, which is one of the hexokinase isoforms (57Pelicano H. Martin D.S. Xu R.H. Huang P. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4633-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 58Cardenas M.L. Cornish-Bowden A. Ureta T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 242-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), thereby regulating the glycolytic process (43Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. Gygi S.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Since Bad is also phosphorylated at Thr-201 by JNK1, we were curious about whether JNK1 regulates glycolysis through modulation of the activity of PFK-1 and hexokinase. In IL-3-dependent FL-5.12 cells, PFK-1 had high basal activity, as measured by PFK-1 assay (Fig. 2A). The activity of PFK-1 was partially reduced by IL-3 withdrawal and further enhanced by IL-3 readdition (Fig. 2A). This suggests that PFK-1 activity is likely controlled by IL-3-dependent and -independent mechanisms. However, the augmented PFK-1 activity by IL-3 readdition was completely abrogated by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Fig. 2A) or retroviral shRNA of JNK1 (Fig. 2B). Thus, the stimulation of PFK-1 by IL-3 depends on JNK1 activity. Consistent with this conclusion, FBS induced significant increase of PFK-1 activity in MEFs but was unable to do so in MEFs expressing siRNA of JNK1 or in JNK1 null MEFs (Fig. 2, C and D). Similar results were obtained with hexokinase, although to a less extent (data not shown). Taken together, JNK1 may regulate IL-3- or FBS-stimulated glycolysis by, at least in part, modulating the activity of PFK-1. PFK-1 Is a Novel Bad-associated Protein—The observations that JNK1 inhibits IL-3 withdrawal-induced cell death through phosphorylation and inactivation of Bad (42Yu C. Minemoto Y. Zhang J. Liu J. Tang F. Bui T.N. Xiang J. Lin A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and that JNK1 regulates the rate of glycolysis and PFK-1 activity prompted us to examine the possible connection between PFK-1 and Bad. Using nano-HPLC electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry, we identified several proteins that were co-immunoprecipitated with Bad from FL-5.12 cells. One of Bad-associated proteins was PFK-1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Consistently, co-immunoprecipitation in combination of immunoblotting revealed that ectopically expressed Xpress-tagged PFK-1 or endogenous PFK-1 proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with M2-Bad proteins (Fig. 3, C and D). However, the interaction between Bad and PFK-1 was not affected by IL-3 (data not shown). To verify this observation, we employed an in vitro binding assay in which purified GST-Bad proteins were first phosphorylated by active JNK1 in the presence of either [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 3E, top panel, positive control) or nonradioactive ATP. GST-Bad proteins phosphorylated with nonradioactive ATP were isolated by GSH beads and mixed with COS-1 cell extracts containing Xpress-PFK-1. Immunoprecipitation using anti-Xpress antibody in combination with immunoblotting using anti-Bad antibody revealed that both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated GST-Bad proteins that were run at the position of 50 kDa in SDS-gel interacted with PFK-1 (Fig. 3E). In a parallel experiment, GST-Bad proteins phosphorylated with or without nonradioactive ATP were incubated with in vitro-translated 35S-labeled PFK-1 or the positive control [35S]-Bcl-XL. GST pull-down assays revealed that phosphorylation by active JNK1 significantly reduced the binding of GST-Bad to [35S]-Bcl-XL (Fig. 3F, low panel), consistent with the previous report (42Yu C. Minemoto Y. Zhang J. Liu J. Tang F. Bui T.N. Xiang J. Lin A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation by active JNK1 had no detectable effect on the binding of GST-Bad to 35S-labeled PFK-1 (Fig. 3F, top panel). Thus, Bad directly interacts with the second rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, PFK-1, and the interaction is independent of its phosphorylation by JNK1. This is in analogy to the previous report that the interaction between Bad and glucokinase is also independent of Bad phosphorylation at the regulatory serines (43Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. Gygi S.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Bad is involved in the assembly of the protein complex containing. The catalytic subunit of PP1 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, glucokinase, and WAVE-1 (43Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. Gygi S.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Future work is needed to determine whether PFK-1 is also a component of this complex. Phosphorylation of Bad at Thr-201 by JNK1 Is Required for PFK-1 Activation and Glycolysis—Although the interaction between Bad and PFK-1 is independent of Bad phosphorylation by JNK1, it is possible that the phosphorylation is required for Bad to regulate PFK-1 activity. To test this hypothesis, FL5.12/Bcl-XL cells were transiently transfected with WT M2-Bad or M2-Bad(T201V) in which threonine 201 has been replaced by valine. Although WT Bad was significantly phosphorylated by active JNK1, Bad(T201V) mutant was not, as measured by in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 4A). IL-3-withdrawal partially reduced PFK-1 activity, and its readdition significantly stimulated PFK-1 activity in cells expressing WT M2-Bad (Fig. 4B), consistent with the results obtained by using stable FL-5.12 cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, IL-3-withdrawal or readdition only slightly affected the activity of PFK-1 in cells expressing M2-Bad(T201V) mutant (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the effect of IL-3 on the rate of glycolysis was also greatly reduced in cells expressing M2-Bad(T201V) mutant when compared with that in cells expressing WT M2-Bad (Fig. 4C). The difference in IL-3-induced PFK-1 activity or glycolysis between FL5.12 Bcl-XL/Bad and FL5.12 Bcl-XL/Bad(T201V) cells was not the result of the difference in expression levels of M2-Bad and M2-Bad(T201V), as analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-M2 antibody (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that Thr-201 phosphorylation of Bad is required for the regulation of PFK-1 activity and glycolysis. This is in analogy to the previous report that the phosphorylation of Bad at the regulatory serines is required for activation of glucokinase (43Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. Gygi S.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Future work is needed to determine how phosphorylation of Bad at Thr-201 by JNK1 or the regulatory serines regulates the activity of PFK-1 or glucokinase, respectively. It is possible that JNK1 may regulate PFK-1 activity and glycolysis in Bad-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We reasoned that if JNK1 regulates PFK-1 activity and glycolysis only through phosphorylation of Bad at Thr-201, inactivation of JNK1 should not further affect PFK-1 activity and glycolysis in cells expressing M2-Bad(T201V) mutant. To test this hypothesis, Bad null MEFs were transiently transfected with WT M2-Bad, M2-Bad(T201V), or empty vector, with or without siRNA of JNK1 or control siRNA. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that expression of JNK1 was significantly silenced by its specific siRNA but not the control siRNA (Fig. 5A), whereas the expression of M2-Bad and M2-Bad(T201V) were at similar levels (Fig. 5A). PFK-1 assay showed that in Bad null cells expressing WT M2-Bad, FBS significantly stimulated the activity of PFK-1, and the stimulation was reduced by siRNA of JNK1 (Fig. 5B). However, in Bad null cells expressing M2-Bad(T201V) mutant, FBS only slightly stimulated PFK-1 activity, and more importantly, siRNA of JNK1 had no detectable effect on PFK-1 activity (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained when the glycolytic rate was analyzed (Fig. 5C). Thus, JNK1 regulates PFK-1 activation and glycolysis through phosphorylation of Bad at Thr-201 in response to IL-3 or FBS. In summary, our results suggest that nonphosphorylated Bad is ready to interact with PFK-1, but only JNK1-phosphorylated Bad is able to regulate PKF-1 activity. Thus, in addition to inhibition of the pro-apoptotic function of Bad, JNK1-mediated phosphorylation of Bad at Thr-201 is required for regulating the activity of PFK-1, which in turn promotes glycolysis for cell survival (Fig. 5D). We are grateful to Dr. Stanley Korsmeyer for reagents that make this work possible."
https://openalex.org/W2028417949,"Hypertension is a cardiovascular disease associated with increased plasma catecholamines, overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system, and increased vascular tone and total peripheral resistance. A key regulator of sympathetic nervous system function is the α1D-adrenergic receptor (AR), which belongs to the adrenergic family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Endogenous catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine activate α1D-ARs on vascular smooth muscle to stimulate vasoconstriction, which increases total peripheral resistance and mean arterial pressure. Indeed, α1D-AR KO mice display a hypotensive phenotype and are resistant to salt-induced hypertension. Unfortunately, little information exists about how this important GPCR functions because of an inability to obtain functional expression in vitro. Here, we identified the dystrophin proteins, syntrophin, dystrobrevin, and utrophin as essential GPCR-interacting proteins for α1D-ARs. We found that dystrophins complex with α1D-AR both in vitro and in vivo to ensure proper functional expression. More importantly, we demonstrate that knock-out of multiple syntrophin isoforms results in the complete loss of α1D-AR function in mouse aortic smooth muscle cells and abrogation of α1D-AR-mediated increases in blood pressure. Our findings demonstrate that syntrophin and utrophin associate with α1D-ARs to create a functional signalosome, which is essential for α1D-AR regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure.

Despite ubiquitous expression, α1-ARs are best characterized for their role in the cardiovascular system, where studies using α1-AR knock-out (KO) have revealed a critical role in the regulation of blood pressure and cardiac function (3Tanoue A.

The role of α1-ARs in the central nervous system is less clear, although expression in the brain has been implicated in regulating pyschostimulant effects of drugs of abuse, learning, and memory (2Piascik M.T.

Information on the α1D-AR subtype is scant because of difficulties in heterologous expression. α1D-AR cDNA expressed in vitro results in protein expression lacking α1D-AR-binding sites and signaling responses (10Minneman K.P.

It is increasingly recognized that most GPCRs are not functionally expressed in heterologous cell systems, suggesting that most GPCRs require other factors for functional expression in vitro. We propose that the difficulties in studyingα1D-AR in vitro stem from an absence of criticalα1D-AR-interacting proteins that are necessary for proper folding, expression, trafficking, localization, and signaling. It is now appreciated that most GPCRs exist as multi-protein complexes comprised of varying numbers of GPCR-interacting proteins (GIPs), capable of regulating GPCR signaling, ligand binding, trafficking, or scaffolding to effector molecules (12Hall R.A.

The five isoforms of syntrophins (α, β1, β2, γ1, and γ2) display conserved structural features, including two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a PSD-95/DlgA/Zo-1 (PDZ) domain, and a syntrophin unique (SU) domain (26Adams M.E.

Chem. 2006; 281: 12414-12420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that syntrophins may be the missing requirement for α1D-AR functional expression in vitro. In this study, we use biochemical, pharmacological, physiological, and molecular techniques to demonstrate that α-syntrophin is an essential GIP for α1D-AR-binding site formation and coupling to signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo. In addition, proteomic analysis reveals syntrophins scaffold α1D-ARs to the dystrophin-utrophin-cytoskeleton network, which allows for precise control over α1D-AR functional expression in vivo. Constructs—Mouse α-syntrophin in pBlu2SKP was kindly provided by Dr. Stan Froehner (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Human α1A- and α1B-AR in pREP4 were made as described (28Hague C. Lee S.E. Chen Z. Prinster S.C. Hall R.A. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Human α1D-AR was cloned into pcDNA3.1/H+ from pEGFP using KpnI/NheI, followed by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To generate α1D-6G and α1D-12G, FLAG-α1D-AR was amplified with PCR to add 5′ KpnI and 3′ EcoRI sites for subcloning into pcDNA3.1 and to remove the α1D-AR stop codon. 6G- or 12G-α-syntrophin was then amplified using PCR to add 5′ EcoRV and 3′ XbaI for subcloning into pcDNA3.1 containing α1D-AR. To generate the α1D-12G PDZ-binding motif mutant, QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis was used to mutate 568RETDI572 in α1D-AR to 568AAAAA572. α1D-6G truncations were generated by stop codons at amino acid positions 447 (SU N-stop), 403 (PH2 C-stop), and 286 (PH2 N-stop) using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis. pIRESpuro-GLUE was kindly provided by Dr. Randy Moon (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Human α1A-AR, α1D-AR, and α-syntrophin were amplified by PCR to add 5′ EcoRI and 3′ BglII for subcloning into pIRESpuro-GLUE. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The constructs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) when cells were ∼70% confluent. Polyclonal stable cell lines were generated with 400–800 mg/ml geneticin or 100–200 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). Stable cells were maintained with 100 μg/ml geneticin and/or 25 μg/ml hygromycin. Antibodies—Utrophin antibody 1862 and syntrophin antibodies 1351 (p-syn), syn17 (α), syn248 (β1), and syn28 (β2) have been previously described (29Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Anti-hemagglutinin (Cell Signaling Tech., Danvers, MA) and anti-β-actin (AbCam, Cambridge, MA) were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. Primary antibodies were detected with IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit or IRDye 680 goat anti-mouse (LiCor Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE) and imaged with an Odyssey Scanner (LiCor Biotechnology). Immunocytochemistry—The cells were co-transfected with α1D-AR-GFP and DsRed-tagged proteins specifically recognizing endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, or peroxisome (Invitrogen). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, mounted with Vectashield (containing 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole stain), and sealed with nail polish. The cells were imaged on a Zeiss 510 META confocal microscopy in the W. M. Keck Center (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). HEK293 cells were transfected with Myc-α1D-AR alone or with α-syntrophin-V5, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS, blocked/solubilized (TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2% bovine serum albumin, 5% horse serum), and incubated overnight with anti-Myc (1:50, mouse) (Santa Cruz, Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The cells were washed three times with TBS with 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with 488 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen), washed three times with TBS with 0.05% Tween 20, washed twice with TBS, and then mounted with Vectashield and sealed with nail polish. The cells were imaged on a Leica SL confocal microscopy in the W. M. Keck Center. Radioligand Binding—Radioligand binding was assayed as previously described (20Chen Z. Hague C. Hall R.A. Minneman K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12414-12420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Whole cell membranes were harvested, and total α1-AR-binding site density was measured with [3H]prazosin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm phentolamine. Protein was collected with a cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD), and samples were counted with a Packard Tri-Carb 2200 CA liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.

The cells were incubated with 1 μCi of [3H]myo-inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO) for 24–48 h, washed, and incubated with phenylephrine (PE) in KHB (129 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm glucose, 0.029 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm LiCl) for 1 h. Ion exchange columns were used to separate hydrolyzed [3H]phosphoinositides. The samples were normalized by counting incorporated [3H]myo-inositol. The samples were counted with a Packard Tri-Carb 2200 CA liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.

Kovar J. Sissons S. Cox K. Matter W. Chadwell F. Luan P. Vlahos C.J. Schutz-Geschwender A. Olive D.M. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 338: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cells were stimulated with epidermal growth factor (1 nm, 5 min) or PE (10 min), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with blocking buffer (TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2% bovine serum albumin, 5% horse serum) for 1.5 h, and incubated with anti-ERK and anti-pERK in TBS (w/2% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. The cells were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS and incubated with IRDye secondary antibodies. The cells were imaged with LiCor Odyssey system. TAP Purification—For TAP-α-syntrophin, TAP purification was conducted as previously described (31Angers S. Thorpe C.J. Biechele T.L. Goldenberg S.J. Zheng N. MacCoss M.J. Moon R.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed overnight and solubilized protein was incubated with streptavidin-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2 h, washed, and eluted with 50 mm d-biotin. Eluate was incubated for 1.5 h with calmodulin-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Bound Sepharose was washed, and final protein was eluted with 50 mm ammonium bicarb (pH 8.0) + 25 mm EGTA. For TAP-α1D-AR, TAP purification was conducted as previously described (32Daulat A.M. Maurice P. Froment C. Guillaume J.L. Broussard C. Monsarrat B. Delagrange P. Jockers R. Mol.

The cells were lysed overnight in buffer containing 1% digitonin, and solubilized protein was incubated with streptavidin-Sepharose, washed, and eluted with 50 mm d-biotin. Eluate was incubated with calmodulin-Sepharose, washed, and eluted with 50 mm ammonium bicarb (pH 8.0) + 25 mm EDTA. Final eluate was analyzed via mass spectrometry (linear ion trap Fourier transform or LTQ Orbitrap). Mouse α1D-AR Antibody Production—Glutathione S-transferase fusion peptides were constructed with either amino acids 1–23 or 35–59 of the N terminus of α1D-AR for injection into rabbits (R & R Rabbitry, Stanwood, WA). Sera was used at a concentration of 1:100 for Western blotting after confirming specificity. Protein Isolation—Harvested aortas or cells grown in culture were lysed with low salt lysis buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors and homogenized overnight at 4 °C. Insoluble protein was cleared by centrifugation, and syntrophin was immunoprecipitated from soluble extract with pan-syntrophin ab. Protein complexes were precipitated using protein G-Sepharose. Eluted samples were run on 10% bis-tris gels and probed as indicated. Blood Pressure—All of the animal studies conducted were approved by IACUC. For heart rate and blood pressure measurements, conscious mice were placed into a CODA 6+ system (Kent Scientific Co., Torrington, CT) with an attached tail cuff. For vasopressor challenge experiments, 12–16-week-old male mice (20–28 mg) were anesthetized with 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital intraperitoneally and placed into CODA 6+ system for continuous measurement of BP. The mice were then given either saline, 2.5 μg of prazosin, or 2.5 μg of BMY 7378 intraperitoneally (total volume of injections, 200 μl) followed by 3.12 μg of PE 10 min later. Base line was determined as the average blood pressure (BP) measurements prior to PE injection. The data were analyzed using Prism Software (GraphPad Software). Aortic Smooth Muscle Cell Isolation—mASMCs were isolated as described (33Faber J.E. Yang N. Xin X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 441-452PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dissected aortas were incubated in HBSS+ buffer (16.4 mm NaHCO3, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.73 units/ml elastase, 7000 units/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 265 units/ml collagenase in Hanks HBSS 1× without calcium/magnesium) for 10–15 min. Adventitial and medial layers were separated, and the medial layer was minced and digested in HBSS+ buffer for 60–70 min. The samples were then retriturated and centrifuged gently at 3000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were grown in M199 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Ca2+ Mobilization—mASMCs were washed with imaging buffer (75 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm KCl, 1.32 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.35) and then incubated with 5 μm Fluo-4 AM dye (Invitrogen) diluted in imaging buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were stimulated with either 100 μm PE or 100 μm UTP and imaged with an inverted Nikon in the W. M. Keck Imaging Center. The data were quantified using Metamorph (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and Prism (GraphPad Software). α-Syntrophin Increases α1D-AR Functional Expression—Although much information exists on the α1A- and α1B-AR subtypes, the α1D-AR has been poorly studied because of endoplasmic reticulum retention in heterologous expression systems (Fig. 1A). Recently, we identified α-syntrophin as a potential α1D-AR GIP through a yeast two-hybrid screen (20Chen Z. Hague C. Hall R.A. Minneman K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12414-12420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To address the potential importance of α-syntrophin as an α1D-AR GIP, we examined the effects of α-syntrophin overexpression on α1D-AR subcellular localization (Fig. 1B). As expected, Myc-α1D-AR expressed in HEK293 cells is retained intracellularly. However, co-expression of Myc-α1D-AR with α-syntrophin facilitates α1D-AR expression at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B). To determine how α-syntrophin effects α1D-AR function, we examined α1D-AR-binding site density and signaling in HEK293 cells. α1D-AR transfection into α-syntrophin cells resulted in a ∼10-fold increase in binding site density measured with the α1-AR-selective antagonist [3H]prazosin (Fig. 1C and Table 1). α-Syntrophin had no effect on α1A-AR (Fig. 1D and Table 1) or α1B-AR (data not shown) binding site density. Additionally, α-syntrophin overexpression specifically enhanced PE potencies (EC50) and maximal responses for stimulating PI production and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1, E–H, and Table 1). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that α-syntrophin is essential for α1D-AR functional expression in vitro.TABLE 1Syntrophins specifically increase α1D-AR functional expression in vitro α1A- and α1D-AR-binding site density, PI hydrolysis, and ERK1/2 activation were measured in WT and syntrophin-overexpressing HEK293 cells. Maximal responses for α1A-AR expressing cells are normalized to α1A-AR in WT HEK293 cells, and maximal responses for α1D-AR are normalized to α1D-AR in α-syntrophin-overexpressing HEK293 cells.

Interestingly, α-syntrophin contains a PDZ domain that is flanked by a split PH domain and contains a second PH2 domain and a SU domain important for protein scaffolding (21Adams M.E. Mueller H.A.

To examine the importance of each domain for α1D-AR signalosome function, α-syntrophin was tethered to the α1D-AR C terminus with a six- (6G) or twelve-glycine residue linker (12G) to permit flexibility (Fig. 2A). This method forces α-syntrophin to interact with α1D-AR, prevents other PDZ-containing proteins from interacting with the α1D-AR PDZ-binding motif, and ensures a 1:1 expression ratio between α1D-AR and α-syntrophin (35Mori M.X. Erickson M.G. Yue D.T. Science. 2004; 304: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Tethering syntrophin to α1D-AR with either a 6G (α1D-6G) or 12G (α1D-12G) linker caused a robust increase in α1D-AR-binding sites and functional responses (Fig. 2, B–D). Alanine mutagenesis of the PDZ-binding motif in α1D-AR (568RETDI572 → 568AAAAA572) eliminated α1D-12G stimulated [3H]PI hydrolysis (Fig. 3B), demonstrating the critical importance of this domain for forming the α1D-AR/α-syntrophin signalosome. Next, truncation mutants were used to assess the importance of the PH2 and SU domains of syntrophin for α1D-AR signalosome function (Fig. 3A). The absence of the SU domain markedly decreased α1D-6G functional expression, and additional truncations did not enhance this effect (Fig. 3B and Table 2), suggesting that the SU domain is of critical importance for α1D-AR signalosome assembly.FIGURE 3The SU domain of α-syntrophin is required for α1D-AR function.

To address the possibility that α-syntrophin scaffolds additional GIPs to the α1D-AR signalosome, we performed TAP/MS analysis using α-syntrophin as bait. TAP/MS of α-syntrophin identified proteins involved in signal transduction, endoplasmic reticulum quality control, protein degradation, and cytoskeletal organization (Table 3). As expected, multiple members of the dystrophin complex including utrophin, dystrobrevin, and dystrophin were identified as α-syntrophin interacting partners. Additionally, we identified proteins previously suggested to be important for α1D-AR function in vivo, including PLCβ3 and (Na+/PO4−) co-transporter (36Onwochei M.O. Ofori A.O. Agodoa I.L. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1998; 31: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We then performed the reverse experiment using the α1D-AR as bait. Multiple members of the dystrophin complex were identified as α1D-AR-interacting proteins including utrophin, dystrobrevin, and multiple syntrophin isoforms (Table 3). Interestingly, β1- and β2-syntrophin were identified, but not α-syntrophin, which can be explained by the endogenous expression of β1- and β2-syntrophin and not α-syntrophin in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A). Next, we tested the validity of our TAP/MS results by immunoprecipitating TAP-α1D-AR and probing for dystrophin complex members. TAP-α1D-AR interacted with utrophin and β1/β2-syntrophin (Fig. 4B), and immunoprecipitating TAP-α1D-AR from α-syntrophin-o"

https://openalex.org/W2062014994,"Cell-cycle transition from the G2 phase into mitosis is regulated by the cyclin-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDK1) in complex with cyclin B. CDK1 activity is controlled by both inhibitory phosphorylation, catalysed by the Myt1 and Wee1 kinases, and activating dephosphorylation, mediated by the CDC25 dual-specificity phosphatase family members. In somatic cells, Wee1 is downregulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation to ensure rapid activation of CDK1 at the beginning of M phase. Here, we show that downregulation of the regulatory β-subunit of protein kinase CK2 by RNA interference results in delayed cell-cycle progression at the onset of mitosis. Knockdown of CK2β causes stabilization of Wee1 and increased phosphorylation of CDK1 at the inhibitory Tyr15. PLK1–Wee1 association is an essential event in the degradation of Wee1 in unperturbed cell cycle. We have found that CK2β participates in PLK1–Wee1 complex formation whereas its cellular depletion leads to disruption of PLK1–Wee1 interaction and reduced Wee1 phosphorylation at Ser53 and 121. The data reported here reinforce the notion that CK2β has functions that are independent of its role as the CK2 regulatory subunit, identifying it as a new component of signaling pathways that regulate cell-cycle progression at the entry of mitosis."

BACE1 pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced through the use of alternative splice sites in exons 3 and 4, although the significance of these splicing events is unclear. Here, we quantitatively measured relative levels of BACE1 transcripts and identified a novel splice variant of BACE1. We found a subtle but significant difference in BACE1 splicing between brain and pancreas, indicating the cellular environment can affect BACE1 alternative splicing. Furthermore, we have shown that BACE1 proteins translated from alternatively spliced transcripts have dramatically reduced β-secretase activity and promotion of BACE1 alternative splicing reduces Aβ production. These findings illustrate the importance of BACE1 alternative splicing in affecting the level of Aβ produced in cells and suggest that targeting regulation of BACE1 alternative splicing is a potential therapeutic strategy for lowering β-secretase activity.

Commun. 2002; 293: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Normal splicing of BACE1 results in production of the full-length 501-amino acid active protein (BACE1 501). Alternative splicing of BACE1 occurs through the use of an alternative 5′-splice site within exon 3 and/or an alternative 3′-splice site within exon 4 (Fig. 1A). The use of the normal 5′-splice site in combination with the alternative 3′-splice site in exon 4 causes an in-frame deletion of 75 base pairs at the 5′-end of exon 4, resulting in production of a protein isoform 476 amino acids in length (BACE1 476). Similarly, the use of the alternative 5′-splice site in exon 3 in combination with the normal 3′-splice site causes an in-frame deletion of 132 base pairs at the 3′-end of exon 3. This deletion results in a protein isoform 457 amino acids in length (BACE1 457). Finally, the use of both alternative splice sites results in an in-frame deletion of 207 base pairs and production of a 432-amino acid protein isoform (BACE1 432).These alternative splicing events delete a portion of the protein between the two catalytic aspartates located in exon 2 and exon 6. The activities of BACE1 protein isoforms produced by alternative splicing are not well established. Past studies suggest that BACE1 476 and BACE1 457 have reduced activity or are completely inactive against APP, although the activities of BACE1 476, BACE1 457, and BACE1 432 have never been measured directly and the issue remains largely unresolved (25Bodendorf U.

In this study, we quantified the relative levels of BACE1 alternatively spliced transcripts using real-time PCR, and we identified a novel alternative splicing event. Furthermore, we characterized the activity of the resulting protein isoforms, and we showed that increasing BACE1 alternative splicing can reduce Aβ levels in cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—The cDNA encoding BACE1 501, 476, and 457 cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) were received as a gift from Dr. Patrick Keller.

Each sample was incubated with 200 nm OM99-2 BACE1 inhibitor (29Ghosh A.K. Shin D. Downs B. Koelsch G. Lin X. Ermolieff J. Tang J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3522-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) (EMD Biosciences) in DMSO (Sigma) or DMSO alone. Samples were assayed for β-secretase activity using the SensoLyte 520 β-secretase assay kit (AnaSpec) and measuring fluorescent signal at Ex/Em = 485/535 nm following a 30-min incubation at 37 °C.Treatment of Cells with Antisense RNA Oligos—HEKswe cells were plated in 6-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine hydrobromide (Sigma). Cells were then transfected with 25 nm 2′-O-methyl antisense RNA oligos with a phosphorothioate backbone (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Antisense RNA oligos contained either a randomized sequence, a sequence complementary to the normal splice site at the exon 3-intron 3 junction, or a sequence complementary to the normal splice site at the intron 3-exon 4 junction (supplemental Fig. S1). In cells treated with two antisense RNA oligos, each oligo was transfected at a final concentration of 25 nm. Twenty-four hours after transfection, medium on the transfected cells was changed and aliquots of the new medium were taken after 0, 4, and 8 h.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Aβ-40 levels were measured by colorimetric human β-amyloid 1–40 ELISA (Invitrogen). Medium collected from treated cells was centrifuged at 6800 × g for 3 min and diluted 1:16 for the assay.Reverse Transcription—Total RNAs from frontal lobe, cerebellum, hippocampus, and pancreas were purchased (Stratagene, Clontech, and Ambion), and samples were pooled by tissue type. Total RNA from HEK cells was isolated using RNAqueous (Ambion). For RT, concentrations of total RNAs were quantified, and RT was carried out on 1 μg of total RNA using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription (Qiagen). Following RT, sample volumes were doubled with H2O.Semi-quantitative PCR—To simultaneously amplify BACE1 501, 476, 457, and 432 from RT products, PCR was performed using 400 nm forward primer in exon 3 and 400 nm reverse primer in exon 4 (both contain restriction endonuclease site 5′-overhangs). For amplification of BACE1 455, the exon 3 forward primer and an isoform-specific reverse primer designed to anneal to the exon 3-exon 5 junction were used. For an endogenous control, a forward primer and reverse primer were designed and each used at a final concentration of 100 nm to amplify a region of ribosomal protein L39 (RPL39). All PCR primer sequences are listed in the primer sequences table (supplemental Fig. S1). All PCR was carried out using Advantage 2 Polymerase (Clontech) and the following PCR program: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 1 min; 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min; 1 final extension cycle of 68 °C for 1 min. Following PCR, Novex Hi-Density Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) sample buffer (Invitrogen) was added to each sample. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 20% TBE-acrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and visualized by post-staining with a 1:10,000 dilution of SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) in 1× TBE buffer (Invitrogen).Real-time PCR—Real-time PCR primers were designed to specifically amplify each BACE1 isoform individually. Primer sequences are listed in the primer sequences table (supplemental Fig. S1). For 501, the forward primer anneals to the 3′-end of exon 3, and the reverse primer anneals to the 5′-end of exon 4. For 476, the forward primer anneals to the 3′-end of exon 3, and the reverse primer anneals to the isoform-specific exon 3-alternative exon 4 site junction. For 457, the forward primer anneals to the isoform-specific alternative exon 3 site-exon 4 junction, and the reverse primer used was the same as for 501. For 432, the forward primer anneals to the 5′-end of exon 3 and the reverse primer anneals to the alternative exon 3 site-alternative exon 4 site junction. For 455, the same forward primer used for 476 and the 455 isoform-specific reverse primer described in the semi-quantitative PCR methods were used. The forward and reverse primers used to amplify total BACE1 annealed within exon 5. For an endogenous control, a forward primer and reverse primer were designed to amplify a region of RPL39. Standards for each isoform were made by amplifying the region between exon 3 and exon 6 of each BACE1 cDNA pcDNA4/myc-His expression vector, electrophoresing products on an agarose gel, and purifying the amplified bands by MiniElute gel purification (Qiagen). 10-fold serial dilutions of each standard were made and used to produce standard curves for each isoform. Primer pairs were used at a final concentration of 800 nm, except for the RPL39 primers that were used at 200 nm. Real-time PCR was performed with Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) using the ABI 7500 Fast System (Applied Biosystems). Amounts of each isoform in each sample were normalized to RPL39 and in most cases expressed as an amount relative to BACE1 501. All quantified data represent an average of at least two independent experiments. Error bars represent S.E. of the mean. Data comparing differences between two samples were statistically analyzed using the unpaired Student's t test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.RESULTSBACE1 Alternative Splicing Differs between Brain and Pancreas—BACE1 has been previously shown to be most highly expressed in the brain and pancreas in humans (5Vassar R.

A. 2000; 97: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). We wanted to confirm that alternatively spliced BACE1 mRNA exists in these tissues. The region of BACE1 between exon 3 and exon 4 was amplified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in samples of total RNA from human cerebellum, frontal lobe, hippocampus, and pancreas. Amplification of this region produces four products corresponding in size to the four previously reported splice variants of BACE1. Multiple RNA samples from three different sources were pooled according to tissue type for analysis. Our PCR data indicate that each of the four splice variants is present in brain and pancreas (Fig. 1B). Full-length BACE1 501 is the predominantly expressed transcript in all of the tissue types analyzed, whereas levels of the alternatively spliced transcripts are relatively low and decrease corresponding to size. However, we observed higher levels of BACE1 476 in pancreas compared with the regions of the brain tested. To quantify these results, a real-time PCR assay was developed to measure levels of each alternatively spliced transcript in relation to BACE1 501. Although there are no significant differences in splicing detected between cerebellum, frontal lobe, or hippocampus, the ratio of BACE1 476 to BACE1 501 is about two times greater in pancreas than in these brain regions (Fig. 1C). Real-time PCR also shows an increase in the ratio of BACE1 432 to BACE1 501 in pancreas that is statistically significant, but there is no significant difference in the ratio of BACE1 457 to BACE1 501. We saw similar results when total RNA samples from these tissues were analyzed individually, instead of being pooled (data not shown). These results suggest that cellular factors in pancreas weaken the usage of the normal 3′-splice site at the intron 3-exon 4 junction or enhance the recognition of the alternative 3′-splice site in exon 4.BACE1 pre-mRNA Undergoes Exon 4 Skipping—Because our findings support the possibility that usage of the normal 3′-splice site is not recognized by splicing machinery as robustly in pancreas as in brain, we reasoned that exon 4 skipping might also occur in pancreas (Fig. 2A). A reverse primer was designed to anneal to the exon 3-exon 5 junction to more simply detect only an exon 4-skipped transcript. Using the isoform-specific primer pair, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed on total RNA from human cerebellum, frontal lobe, hippocampus, and pancreas. Surprisingly, we found a low level of transcript lacking exon 4 in all tissues tested (Fig. 2B). An isoform-specific RT-PCR designed to identify an exon 3-skipped transcript did not yield any detectable products (data not shown). Because exon 4 skipping results in an in-frame deletion that would produce a protein 455 amino acids in length, the transcript completely lacking exon 4 will subsequently be referred to as BACE1 455 (Fig. 2A). This splice variant was not detected in our previous experiments because the reverse primer used for PCR amplification in those experiments was designed to anneal to exon 4. Furthermore, exclusion of exon 4 by alternative splicing produces a product with only six fewer base pairs than the BACE1 457 transcript, meaning it would be difficult to distinguish these two transcripts from each other based on RT-PCR product size. Real-time PCR shows BACE1 455 is expressed in tissues at low levels relative to BACE1 501 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the level of BACE1 455 mRNA is about three times greater in pancreas compared with regions of the brain tested (Fig. 2, B and C). This, along with the observation that BACE1 476 and BACE1 432 also exist at higher levels in pancreas, suggests that usage of the normal 3′-splice site at the intron 3-exon 4 junction is weaker in pancreas than in brain. Because we found that exon 4 skipping occurs, we reasoned that a transcript resulting from use of the alternative 5′-splice site in exon 3 and the 3′-splice site at the intron 4-exon 5 junction may exist. However, an RT-PCR designed to amplify such a transcript did not produce a detectable product from tissue RNA (data not shown).FIGURE 2BACE1 exon 4 skipping in brain and pancreas. A, weak usage of the normal 3′-splice site at the intron 3-exon 4 junction (NORM 3′SS) allows exon 4 skipping, resulting in a novel alternatively spliced BACE1 transcript (BACE1 455). B, total RNA samples were pooled by tissue type as in Fig. 1B and amplified. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR using an isoform-specific primer pair amplified a transcript lacking exon 4 (455) in cerebellum (C), frontal lobe (FL), hippocampus (H), and pancreas (P). C, real-time PCR showed a statistically significant increase in BACE1 455 relative to BACE1 501 in pancreas compared with regions of the brain tested (*, p < 0.05 compared with pancreas). Differences between brain regions were not statistically significant. Amplification of RPL39 was used as an endogenous control. For real-time PCR data analysis, quantities were normalized to RPL39 and then expressed as a proportion relative to BACE1 501. n = 2. Error bars represent S.E. of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)BACE1 Protein Isoforms Produced from Alternatively Spliced Transcripts Have Reduced Activity—After examining BACE1 splice variants in tissues, we sought to determine the effect of alternative splicing on BACE1 protease activity. The amino acids deleted by alternative splicing lie between the two active site aspartates in exons 2 and 6. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of full-length BACE1 501 was previously solved (30Hong L. Koelsch G. Lin X. Wu S. Terzyan S. Ghosh A.K. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Science. 2000; 290: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Analysis of the catalytic domain structure reveals that the alternatively spliced region has well defined structure and is in close proximity to the active site residues of the folded protein (Fig. 3A). It is reasonable to predict that the absence of this region would be detrimental to the structural integrity of the catalytic domain and, therefore, the activity of the enzyme.FIGURE 3Activity of BACE1 protein isoforms. A, the published structure of the catalytic domain of BACE1 (30Hong L. Koelsch G. Lin X. Wu S. Terzyan S. Ghosh A.K. Zhang X.C. Tang J.

B, a representative Western blot used to confirm that equal amounts of each purified isoform were used in the in vitro activity assay is shown. Proteins were detected with an anti-Myc horseradish peroxidase antibody. In addition to the splice isoforms, a catalytically inactive Myc-tagged BACE1 501 mutant (MUT) was also purified. MUT does not appear to undergo complete maturation, causing it to migrate faster than 501. All lanes shown are from the same gel and same exposure.

The γ subunit of AMPK binds AMP and ATP, and mutations that affect binding cause human disease. We have here addressed the role of the Snf4 (γ) subunit in regulating SNF1 protein kinase in response to glucose availability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous studies of mutant cells lacking Snf4 suggested that Snf4 counteracts autoinhibition by the C-terminal sequence of the Snf1 catalytic subunit but is dispensable for glucose regulation, and AMP does not activate SNF1 in vitro. We first introduced substitutions at sites that, in AMPK, contribute to nucleotide binding and regulation. Mutations at several sites relieved glucose inhibition of SNF1, as judged by catalytic activity, phosphorylation of the activation-loop Thr-210, and growth assays, although analogs of the severe human mutations R531G/Q had little effect. We further showed that alterations of Snf4 residues that interact with the glycogen-binding domain (GBD) of the β subunit strongly relieved glucose inhibition. Finally, substitutions in the GBD of the Gal83 β subunit that are predicted to disrupt interactions with Snf4 and also complete deletion of the GBD similarly relieved glucose inhibition of SNF1.

In mammals, AMPK regulates many metabolic processes, notably glucose and lipid metabolism, and controls transcription and protein synthesis to maintain energy balance. AMPK is activated by hormones and by stresses that deplete cellular ATP, thereby elevating the AMP:ATP ratio, and in humans, it is a target of drugs used in treatment of type 2 diabetes. AMPK is a heterotrimer comprising the catalytic α subunit and two regulatory subunits, β and γ, which exist as different isoforms (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2, and γ3). The kinase is activated by phosphorylation on Thr-172 in the activation loop of the α subunit by upstream kinases, including LKB1 (3Hong S.-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl.

This site corresponds to the site in the mammalian enzyme that contains nonexchangeable AMP and is not involved in AMP/ATP sensing (20Xiao B. Heath R. Saiu P. Leiper F.C. Leone P. Jing C. Walker P.A. Haire L. Eccleston J.F. Davis C.T. Martin S.R. Carling D. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 2007; 449: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Additional studies of the S. pombe partial heterotrimer revealed a binding site for ADP in the N-terminal Bateman domain (30Jin X. Townley R. Shapiro L. Structure. 2007; 15: 1285-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, S. pombe AMPK has not been well characterized genetically or biochemically, and it is not known whether it is regulated by nucleotides.In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SNF1 protein kinase is the ortholog of AMPK (for review, see Ref. 31Hedbacker K. Carlson M. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 2408-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). SNF1 is required for the adaptation of cells to metabolic stress, notably carbon stress (32Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), but also starvation for other nutrients (33Thompson-Jaeger S. Francois J. Gaughran J.P. Tatchell K.

Carbon metabolism is particularly important for yeast, and SNF1 is required for the adaptation of yeast cells to glucose limitation and for growth on carbon sources that are less preferred than glucose; the initial snf1 mutation was named for the sucrose-nonfermenting phenotype (41Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1981; 98: 25-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase is required to activate transcription of genes involved in the metabolism of sucrose and other carbon sources (42Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 43Young E.T. Dombek K.M. Tachibana C. Ideker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26146-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar); it is not required for growth on glucose, which inhibits its activity. In addition to regulating transcription, SNF1 controls the activity of metabolic enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism and carbohydrate storage (44Hardy T.A. Huang D. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27907-27913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Mitchelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Gao G. House C. Michell B. Katsis F. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19509-19516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Like other members of the AMPK family, SNF1 protein kinase is heterotrimeric, comprising the Snf1 catalytic (α) subunit, one of three β subunit isoforms (Gal83, Sip1, or Sip2), and the Snf4 (γ) subunit. Snf1 is phosphorylated on Thr-210 in the activation loop by the upstream kinases Sak1, Tos3, and Elm1 (3Hong S.-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), but the regulatory signal(s) is not known. Acute glucose limitation depletes ATP and elevates the AMP:ATP ratio (51Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), but AMP does not allosterically activate SNF1 in vitro (45Mitchelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Gao G. House C.

The possibility remains that AMP or ATP controls SNF1 activity in vivo.The β subunits control subcellular localization of SNF1 (53Vincent O. Townley R. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and interactions with substrates (54Vincent O. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6672-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Gal83 is the major isoform during growth on glucose (53Vincent O. Townley R. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and contributes the most to SNF1 activity in response to acute glucose limitation (55Hedbacker K. Hong S.P. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8255-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Gal83 and Sip2 contain a conserved glycogen-binding domain (GBD) and bind glycogen in vitro (56Wiatrowski H.A. van Denderen B.J.W. Berkey C.D. Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).The Snf4 subunit, like mammalian γ subunits, consists of four CBS repeats (Fig. 1). Snf4 interacts directly with Snf1 and the β subunits (52Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 57Jiang R. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 58Amodeo G.A. Rudolph M.J. Tong L. Nature. 2007; 449: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and is important for SNF1 function in vivo and in vitro; very little catalytic activity is detected in snf4 mutant cells, which exhibit a phenotype similar to that of snf1 cells (46Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19509-19516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 59Neigeborn L. Carlson M.

In contrast, Snf4 is not required for function of the truncated Snf1 catalytic domain (residues 1–309) (61Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5034-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) or of Snf1 lacking residues 381–488 (62Leech A. Nath N. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and Snf4 interacts directly with the C terminus of Snf1 (52Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 58Amodeo G.A. Rudolph M.J. Tong L. Nature. 2007; 449: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), suggesting that Snf4 counteracts autoinhibition by a C-terminal autoinhibitory sequence. However, several lines of evidence indicated that Snf4 is dispensable for glucose regulation. Various Snf4-independent mutant Snf1 proteins conferred glucose-regulated gene expression in the absence of Snf4 function (52Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 61Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5034-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 62Leech A. Nath N. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation of Thr-210 on full-length Snf1 remained glucose-regulated in snf4Δ mutants (50McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 63Elbing K. Rubenstein E.M. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26170-26180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These data indicate that at least one glucose regulatory mechanism operates independent of Snf4. The question remains: does Snf4 have any direct role in mediating regulatory signals?Structural analysis has not yet resolved the issue of whether Snf4 binds nucleotide. The crystal structure of the C-terminal Bateman (Bateman2) domain revealed a dimer with a pocket at its center, and residues corresponding to those altered by disease-causing mutations were located near this pocket (64Rudolph M.J. Amodeo G.A. Iram S.H. Hong S.P. Pirino G. Carlson M. Tong L. Structure. 2007; 15: 65-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The structure of a partial heterotrimer of SNF1, containing C-terminal fragments of Snf1 and Sip2 and full-length Snf4, was reported (58Amodeo G.A. Rudolph M.J. Tong L. Nature. 2007; 449: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This structure lacked bound nucleotide, although AMP was included in the crystallization solution, and comparison with the S. pombe structure revealed side chain differences in Snf4 that would interfere with AMP binding; however, another crystal appeared to have AMP bound to Snf4 at a similar position as in the S. pombe subunit (58Amodeo G.A. Rudolph M.J. Tong L. Nature. 2007; 449: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).In this study, we used genetic analysis to address the regulatory role of Snf4. We first introduced substitutions at sites that, in mammalian γ subunits, contribute to nucleotide binding, including alterations analogous to those causing human disease, and assayed the effects of each mutant Snf4 protein on regulation of Thr-210 phosphorylation and activity of SNF1 in yeast cells. Some of these mutations relieved glucose inhibition of phosphorylation and activity, providing evidence that Snf4 participates in a glucose regulatory mechanism, which may involve ligand binding. Additional substitutions that lack mammalian counterparts and alter residues that are distant from putative nucleotide-binding sites also relieved glucose inhibition of SNF1. Inspection of the crystal structure suggested that interactions of Snf4 with the GBD of the β subunit were perturbed. We further showed that substitutions in the GBD and deletion of the GBD similarly relieve glucose inhibition of SNF1. Finally, we showed that glucose inhibition of SNF1 is normal in cells lacking glycogen. These findings provide evidence for novel roles of Snf4 and the GBD in glucose regulation of SNF1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression of Mutant Snf4 Proteins—Centromeric plasmid pOV75 expresses Snf4 from the native promoter; this plasmid contains a NotI site at the C terminus of the open reading frame and differs from pOV76 (53Vincent O. Townley R. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) in lacking green fluorescent protein sequence. Mutations were introduced into pOV75 by using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Wild-type and mutant Snf4 proteins were expressed from pOV75 and its mutant derivatives in snf4Δ mutant cells of S. cerevisiae strain MCY2634 (MATa snf4Δ2 his3 leu2 ura3), which has the S288C genetic background. The elc1Δ::KanMX4 mutant strain was a derivative of BY4741 (MATa his3 leu2 met15 ura3; Research Genetics).Expression of Mutant Gal83 Proteins—Centromeric plasmid pRT12 expresses Gal83 fused to green fluorescent protein from the native promoter (53Vincent O. Townley R. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). pOV81 and pHW39 (56Wiatrowski H.A. van Denderen B.J.W. Berkey C.D. Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) are derivatives of pRT12 that express Gal83G235R and Gal83W184A,R214Q, respectively. The GBD (codons 153–243) was deleted from pRT12 by site-directed mutagenesis, yielding pMM66. Wild-type and mutant Gal83 proteins were expressed from these plasmids in S. cerevisiae strain MCY4099 (MATα gal83Δ::TRP1 sip1Δ::kanMX6 sip2Δ::kanMX4 ade2 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3) (56Wiatrowski H.A. van Denderen B.J.W. Berkey C.D. Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which has the W303 genetic background.Assay of SNF1 Catalytic Activity by Phosphorylation of SAMS Peptide—Cultures were grown to exponential phase (A600 of 0.7–1.0) in selective synthetic complete (SC) medium containing 2% glucose. Cells (100 ml) were collected by rapid filtration and were either scraped from the filter and frozen in liquid nitrogen or resuspended in 0.05% glucose for 10 min, collected, and frozen. For some experiments, after incubation in 0.05% glucose, an aliquot of cells was incubated in 2% glucose for 10 min, collected, and frozen. Cell extracts were prepared from two to three independent cultures as described (55Hedbacker K. Hong S.P. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8255-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). SNF1 was partially purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and assayed for phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide (HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR, called the SAMS peptide) (65Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) as described (46Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 24: 8255-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), using different protein concentrations to confirm linearity. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad assay. Kinase activity is expressed as nanomoles of phosphate incorporated into the peptide/min/mg of protein (65Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar).Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins (2–4 μg) from assayed fractions were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, except where noted otherwise, and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Thr(P)-172-AMPK (Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-polyhistidine (Sigma), anti-Snf1 (32Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), and anti-Snf4 (66Estruch F. Treitel M.A. Yang X. Carlson M. Genetics. 1992; 132: 639-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) antibodies. Before the membrane was reprobed, it was incubated in 0.2 m glycine, pH 2, for 10 min. ECL Plus or ECL Advance (Amersham Biosciences) was used for visualization.Growth Assay for 2-Deoxyglucose Resistance—Fresh overnight cultures were grown in selective SC plus 2% glucose and diluted to A600 of 2 in selective SC. The cells were spotted with 2-fold dilutions on selective SC medium containing 2% sucrose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (200 μg/ml), and antimycin A (1 μg/ml). The media contained the respiratory inhibitor antimycin A to increase the stringency of the assay. The control plates lacked 2-deoxyglucose. The plates were incubated at 30 °C and photographed.RESULTSStrategy to Assess Function of SNF1 Protein Kinase Containing a Mutant Snf4 Subunit—To determine whether alteration of Snf4 at sites that cause disease in humans would affect the regulation of SNF1, we introduced mutations into the SNF4 gene, under the control of its own promoter on a centromeric plasmid, and expressed the mutant proteins in snf4Δ yeast cells. The positions of the altered residues are shown in the Snf4 structure from the partial SNF1 heterotrimer, with AMP positioned as it is in the S. pombe γ subunit (58Amodeo G.A. Rudolph M.J. Tong L. Nature. 2007; 449: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). We used three assays to analyze the function of the mutant SNF1. First, we assessed the regulation of kinase activity in response to glucose availability. The cells were grown to mid-log phase in 2%"

Highly reduced viability, impairment of asexual spore germination, DNA condensation and fragmentation, and production of reactive oxygen species were observed in conidia treated with the drug, suggesting that PHS induces an apoptosis-like death in this fungus. Interestingly, we found that complex I mutants are more resistant to PHS treatment than the wild type strain. This effect appears to be specific because it was not observed in mutants defective in other components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, pointing to a particular involvement of complex I in cell death. The response of the mutant strains to PHS correlated with their response to hydrogen peroxide. The fact that complex I mutants generate fewer reactive oxygen species than the wild type strain when exposed to PHS likely explains the PHS-resistant phenotype. As compared with the wild type strain, we also found that a strain containing a deletion in the gene encoding an AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor)-like protein is more resistant to PHS and H2O2. In contrast, a strain containing a deletion in a gene encoding an AMID (AIF-homologous mitochondrion-associated inducer of death)-like polypeptide is more sensitive to both drugs. These results indicate that N. crassa has the potential to be a model organism to investigate the molecular basis of programmed cell death in eukaryotic species.

The term apoptosis (apo-from, ptosis-falling) means “dropping off” of petals or leaves from plants or trees and was described as a particular mode of cell death that is characterized by rounding up of the cell, reduction of cell volume, condensation of chromatin, fragmentation of the nucleus, and maintenance of the intact plasma membrane until the very late stage of the death process (1Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12776) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death (PCD) 2The abbreviations used are: PCD, programmed cell death; PHS, phytosphingosine; ROS, reactive oxygen species; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; AMID, AIF-homologous mitochondrion-associated inducer of death; GFS, glucose, fructose, sorbose; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling. 2The abbreviations used are: PCD, programmed cell death; PHS, phytosphingosine; ROS, reactive oxygen species; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; AMID, AIF-homologous mitochondrion-associated inducer of death; GFS, glucose, fructose, sorbose; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling. that plays a central role in tissue homeostasis and maintenance in multicellular organisms. Cytological phenotypes associated with apoptosis include chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, vacuolization, activation of caspases, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although the importance of apoptosis in stroke, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer is increasingly evident, many details of its regulation and production of apoptotic phenotypes are poorly understood (for recent reviews, see Refs. 2Skulachev V.P. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 473-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 3Madeo F. Herker E. Wissing S. Jungwirth H. Eisenberg T. Fröhlich K.-U. Curr. Opin.

In addition to the well established role of mitochondria in ATP production, regulation of cell death has emerged as a second major function of these organelles. This function appears to be related to the role of mitochondria as the major intracellular source of ROS, mainly generated at complexes I and III of the respiratory chain (5Andreyev A.Y. Kushnareva Y.E. Starkov A.A. Biochemistry (Mosc). 2005; 70: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Enhanced ROS production has been associated with mtDNA mutations, aging, and cell death (6Orrenius S. Drug Metab. Rev. 2007; 39: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and also with a wide variety of pathologies, including cancer, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases (7Dröge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7413) Google Scholar). ROS overproduction induces an osmotic imbalance across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This leads to the swelling of the mitochondrial matrix and, consequently, the disruption of the outer mitochondrial membrane and release of proteins from the intermembrane space into the cytosol (2Skulachev V.P. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 473-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Some of these released proteins, including cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), are proapoptotic regulators that subsequently activate cellular apoptotic programs (8Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2762) Google Scholar, 9Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway is a major apoptotic pathway, where the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrion and the production of ROS are the two main events proposed as integral control elements in the cell decision to die. In the second major pathway, the extrinsic pathway, caspases are activated directly (10Putcha G.V. Harris C.A. Moulder K.L. Easton R.M. Thompson C.B. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Programmed cell death and apoptotic mechanisms are ubiquitous in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species (11Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The complex regulatory network and the sometimes contradictory results obtained with human cell lines make it desirable to investigate cell death mechanisms in simpler model systems. For example, apoptotic-like programmed cell death has been observed in the unicellular yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Ludovico P. Madeo F. Silva M.

The fungal genomes contain a subset of metazoan apoptotic genes, although the genomes of filamentous fungi contain homologues of PCD genes of metazoans that are not present in S. cerevisiae (17Fedorova N.D.

BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), thus making them attractive models for dissecting mechanisms of programmed cell death. The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa is a morphologically complex multicellular organism with many differentiated cell types (18Davis R.H. Neurospora: Contributions of a Model Organism. University Press, Oxford2000Google Scholar). In addition, it is well studied, its genome was sequenced, and many molecular tools have been developed over the years to work with the organism (19Galagan J.E. Calvo S.E. Borkovich K.A. Selker E.U.

Genet. 2002; 3: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition to PCD induced by external factors, N. crassa and other filamentous fungi utilize a cell death pathway for non-self recognition that occurs when two genetically different colonies come in contact (22Dementhon K. Iyer G. Glass N.L. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 2161-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, it has the potential to be very useful for research on the mechanisms and evolution of programmed cell death in eukaryotic species. The fact that phytosphingosine (PHS) induces apoptosis in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans (23Cheng J. Park T.-S. Chio L.-C. Fischl A.S. Ye X.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) prompted us to initiate the characterization of the sphingolipid-induced PCD in wild type and respiratory mutants of N. crassa. In this work, we describe the programmed cell death phenotype of the fungal cells exposed to PHS and the finding that respiratory chain complex I is involved in the process. Strains and Growth Techniques—The N. crassa wild type strain 74-OR23-1A (74A) and mutants in the respiratory chain complex I genes nuo9.8, nuo14, nuo21, nuo21.3c, nuo30.4, nuo51, and nuo78 have been described previously (reviewed in Ref. 24Marques I.

Deficient mutants in the mitochondrial complexes III (fes-1; FGSC11184), IV (cyt-12; FGSC4506), and V (oli; FGSC8738) and in cytochrome c (cyc-1; FGSC3558), as well as the AIF (ΔNCU05850, here called aif-1; FGSC11900) and AIF-homologous mitochondrion-associated inducer of death (AMID) (ΔNCU06061; FGSC12090) deletion strains (20Colot H.V. Park G. Turner G.E. Ringelberg C. Crew C.M. Litvinkova L. Weiss R.L. Borkovich K.A. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 2003; 52: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). General procedures for growth and handling of the fungal strains have been published (26Davis R.H. de Serres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17A: 79-143Crossref Scopus (935) Google Scholar). When indicated, PHS from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) was added to the media from a stock solution of 4 mg/ml in ethanol. The viability of conidia was determined by plating the cells on GFS agar medium, which induces colonial growth, and counting colony-forming units after incubation at 26 °C. Conidial germination in Vogel's minimal medium (27Vogel H.J. Microb. Genet. Bull. 1956; 13: 42-46Google Scholar) at 26 °C was evaluated by observation under a Nikon optical microscope. These types of experiments, as well as the following methods, were repeated at least three times. TUNEL Assay—DNA strand breaks were analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) using the in situ cell death detection kit fluorescein (Roche Applied Science), as described previously (28Madeo F. Frolich E. Frolich K.-U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). N. crassa conidia were preincubated in minimal medium for 30 min, washed in water, and then treated with phytosphingosine for 60 min and washed again. Spheroplasts were prepared (29Duarte M. Sousa R. Videira A. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and fixation was performed 5.5 h after treatment with the drug. Images were collected in a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope using an Axiocam (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Flow cytometry analysis was performed in a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Twenty-thousand cells per sample were analyzed. Data were acquired and analyzed with CELLQuest PRO 3.3 (BD Biosciences). Spot Assays—Conidia from different strains were harvested with distilled water, and the cell suspensions were adjusted to a concentration of 6 × 107 cells/ml. Three-fold serial dilutions of each strain were spotted on plates containing GFS medium containing various concentrations of the appropriate drugs. Images were taken by scanning the plates after about 3 days incubation at 26 °C. ROS Detection—ROS production by mitochondria was monitored by using dihydrorhodamine 123 from Sigma. The reduced form of dihydrorhodamine 123 does not fluoresce until entering an actively respiring cell, where it is oxidized by ROS to a green fluorescent compound that is sequestered in the mitochondria (30Li W. Sun L. Liang Q. Wang J. Mo W. Zhou B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1802-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Conidial cells were harvested and suspended in minimal medium at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml. Then, 50 μg/ml dihydrorhodamine 123 was added, and the cell suspensions were incubated at 26 °C during 30 min and washed before the addition of PHS. ROS production was evaluated using a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed by CELLQuest version 3.3 (BD Biosciences) with excitation at 480 nm and emission at 530 nm. PHS Induces an Apoptosis-like Cell Death in N. crassa—The sphingolipid PHS has potent antifungal activity toward A. nidulans, inducing a caspase-independent apoptosis in this organism (23Cheng J. Park T.-S. Chio L.-C. Fischl A.S. Ye X.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In test effects in N. crassa, we evaluated the viability of asexual spores (conidia) upon exposure to PHS. Conidial cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μg/ml PHS, samples were withdrawn at different times and plated in GFS medium (which induces colonial growth of N. crassa), and the resulting colonies were counted. As shown in Fig. 1A, exposure of N. crassa wild type conidia to PHS resulted in cell death. The kinetics of cell viability, estimated by colony-forming unit counts, showed a dramatic decrease in the cell viability (around 60%) after a short period of incubation with the drug (5 min). Cell viability continued to decrease, reaching about 15% cell viability after a 120-min incubation with PHS. This effect was not seen in the control experiment where cell viability was nearly 100% and indicates that PHS possesses a potent activity against N. crassa. We also evaluated whether exposure to PHS impaired the germination of N. crassa conidia. Untreated wild type conidia progressively undergo germination when incubated in liquid medium; the majority of cells initiate germination within a couple of hours. In contrast, germination was inhibited in cells treated with PHS with less than 50% of the conidia initiating germination after a 4-h exposure (Fig. 1B). We observed that N. crassa conidia exposed to PHS underwent nuclear condensation (data not shown). Nuclear condensation is a hallmark of apoptosis, as is chromatin fragmentation. To determine whether chromatin fragmentation was also associated with cell death caused by PHS in N. crassa, we employed the TUNEL assay. TUNEL detects DNA fragmentation and has been used as a discriminating technique to detect programmed cell death at a single cell level (16Lu B.C.K. Kües U. Fischer R Growth, Differentiation and Sexuality. Springer, Berlin2006: 167-187Google Scholar). N. crassa wild type conidia were treated with PHS, and the TUNEL staining was subsequently performed. The results were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2A) and analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2B). Control conidial cells, either treated with PHS but unlabeled or labeled but untreated, were TUNEL-negative. TUNEL-positive cells, indicative of DNA fragmentation, were only found in the positive control and among cells treated with PHS (Fig. 2A). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was performed for the quantification of TUNEL-positive conidia from PHS-treated cells by comparing with the labeled but untreated negative control cells. Under the conditions tested, about 12% of the cells exposed to PHS revealed DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2B). Taken together, our results indicate that PHS induces an apoptosis-like cell death in N. crassa, similarly to what has been observed in A. nidulans. Complex I Mutants Are More Resistant to PHS than the Wild Type Strain—Mitochondria are an essential mediator of apoptosis. To evaluate whether mitochondria are also involved in PHS-induced death as suggested (23Cheng J. Park T.-S. Chio L.-C. Fischl A.S. Ye X.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we analyzed the behavior of mitochondrial mutants of N. crassa when exposed to the sphingolipid. We started with our collection of complex I mutants by testing the viability of conidial cells from nuo9.8, nuo14, nuo21, nuo21.3c, nuo30.4, nuo51, and nuo78 mutant strains following PHS treatment. Interestingly, we found that all complex I mutants are more resistant to PHS than the wild type strain. Fig. 3 shows the results obtained with the nuo51 and nuo21 mutant strains. It can be seen that the nuo51 mutant is clearly more resistant to PHS. Roughly, more than half of the nuo51 cells remain viable after a 90-min exposure to PHS, whereas the viability of wild type cells dropped below 20% under the same conditions. The nuo51 mutant (which lacks the 51-kDa subunit) is still capable of assembling complex I. However, this complex I is non-functional in electron transfer because the 51-kDa protein harbors the FMN prosthetic group, which is the entry point of electrons into the respiratory chain (31Fecke W. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The resistance of the nuo21 mutant toward PHS lies between that of the nuo51 mutant and a wild type strain. This observation is in agreement with the fact that strains lacking the 21-kDa subunit assemble a functional complex but show lower amounts of complex I enzyme than wild type (32Ferreirinha F. Duarte M. Melo A.M. Videira A. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 551-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complex I mutants were also more resistant than the wild type strain to inhibition of conidial germination by PHS (data not shown). To investigate whether the resistance to PHS is specific for complex I mutants, we tested the response to this sphingolipid in mutants that are defective in other components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In these experiments, we employed strain FGSC3558, which has a mutation in the cytochrome c structural gene, strain FGSC4506, which has a different mutation in cytochrome c but is also defective in complex IV, strain FGSC11184, which contains a deletion of the Rieske iron-sulfur subunit of complex III, strain FGSC8738, which contains a mutation in the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding subunit of complex V and is defective in energy transduction (33Perkins D.D. Radford A. Sachs M.S. The Neurospora Compendium. Academic Press, London2001Google Scholar), plus the previous series of complex I mutants. Serial dilutions of conidial suspensions from each of these strains were spotted on media containing PHS, incubated at 26 °C, and the growth of the strains was qualitatively analyzed. Typical results are shown in Fig. 4. All strains grew similarly under control conditions (minimal medium) with the exception of the complex III defective mutant FGSC11184, which displayed reduced growth under all conditions. When PHS was included in the medium, the complex I mutants were more resistant to the drug than the wild type strain, as expected. In contrast, all of the other respiratory complex mutants were more sensitive to PHS than the wild type strain. These results point to a specific involvement of complex I in PHS-induced cell death. In addition to PHS, a number of other environmental stimuli induce apoptotic-like death in both filamentous fungi and unicellular yeasts. In particular, exposure to hydrogen peroxide has been reported to induce apoptotic-like death in Aspergillus fumigatus, Colletotrichum trifolii, C. albicans, and S. cerevisiae (34Phillips A.J. Sudbery I. Ramsdale M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14327-14332Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 35Mousavi S.A.A. Robson G.D. Microbiology (Read.). 2004; 150: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36Chen C. Dickman M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3459-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated whether mutations in the different respiratory complexes affected sensitivity of these mutants to hydrogen peroxide. We observed that complex I mutants showed a similar resistance to H202 exposure as they showed upon exposure to PHS (Fig. 4, see also below). However, strains containing mutations in other respiratory complexes (FGSC3558, cytochrome c mutant; FGSC4506, defective in complex IV; FGSC11184, defective in complex III; FGSC8738, defective in complex V) showed a similar sensitivity to PHS and H202 (Fig. 4). These data suggest that the response of N. crassa to PHS and hydrogen peroxide likely share common mechanisms. AIF and AMID are flavoproteins/oxidoreductases (similar to complex I) that promote caspase-independent apoptosis (37Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar, 38Wu M. Xu L.-G. Li X. Zhai Z. Shu H.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25617-25623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, mutations in the AIF homologue (AIF1) rescue cells from ROS stress and delays age-induced apoptosis (39Wissing S. Ludovico P. Herker E. Buttner S. Engelhardt S.M. Decker T. Link A. Proksch A. Rodrigues F. Corte-Real M. Frohlich K.-U. Manns J. Cande C. Sigrist S.J. Kroemer G. Madeo F. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In N. crassa, there is one AIF-like homologue, NCU05850 (see supplemental Figs. S1 and S2), and two AMID-like predicted genes, NCU06016 and NCU11413, although NCU11413 is divergent. We therefore tested the sensitivity of deletion mutants in the AIF-like (FGSC11900) and an AMID-like (FGSC12090) predicted proteins of N. crassa toward both PHS and H2O2, using serial dilutions of conidia as outlined above. We observed that the N. crassa aif1 (FGSC11900) mutant was more resistant to exposure to both PHS and H202, whereas the mutant containing mutation in the predicted AMID homologue (FGSC12090) was more sensitive than the wild type strain to both drugs (Fig. 4). Complex I Mutants Generate Fewer ROS—As shown above, complex I mutants of N. crassa are more resistant to oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide than the wild type strain (Fig. 4). We hypothesized that this resistance (and resistance to PHS) is related to the production of reactive oxygen species. ROS are involved in programmed cell death in many species, including filamentous fungi (2Skulachev V.P. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 473-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 16Lu B.C.K. Kües U. Fischer R Growth, Differentiation and Sexuality. Springer, Berlin2006: 167-187Google Scholar). Exposure to hydrogen peroxide may elicit a “vicious cycle” of production of more ROS (40Zorov D.B. Filburn L.O. Klotz J.L. Zweier J.L. Slout S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1001-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 41Zorov D.B. Juhaszova M. Sollott S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Thus, complex I mutants could produce more ROS than the wild type strain, resulting in up-regulation of defense mechanisms for scavenging ROS from the cell. In this case, they should be more resistant to exogenously applied drugs that induce ROS, such as PHS and H2O2. Alternatively, complex I mutants could be more resistant to exogenously added ROS because they produce fewer endogenous ROS than wild type. To discriminate between these two hypotheses, we measured by flow cytometry the production of ROS upon PHS treatment of wild type N. crassa versus the complex I mutant nuo14, using dihydrorhodamine 123 as a marker. Conidia from wild type and the nuo14 mutant were exposed to PHS, and the production of ROS was determined at different times (50–200 min) after drug treatment. This time course study showed a dramatic increase in ROS production in wild type cells treated with PHS, with a maximum production of ROS around 80 min (Fig. 5). More than half of the cells (about 60%) exhibited detectable production of ROS at this time point. In sharp contrast, ROS production of the complex I mutant nuo14 exposed to PHS under the same conditions was almost negligible. Only about 15% of the nuo14 cells displayed detectable ROS levels. We performed similar kinetics of ROS production with other complex I mutants. Fig. 6 shows the results obtained with these strains after an 80-min exposure to PHS. The results show that complex I mutants produced between ¼ and ⅓ of the ROS produced by the wild type strain under identical conditions. Thus, the inability to generate high levels of ROS upon exposure to PHS likely accounts for the increased resistance of complex I mutants toward both PHS and hydrogen peroxide. In this study, we evaluated whether the filamentous fungus N. crassa is a suitable model organism to investigate molecular mechanisms associated with PCD. Our results indicate that phytosphingosine exhibits a potent antifungal activity against Neurospora, as deduced by the dramatic decrease in viability of fungal cells upon treatment with the sphingolipid. We further observed that PHS induced rapid nuclear condensation, as revealed by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrocloride staining of DNA. Conidia with condensed nuclei did not take up propidium iodide (data not shown). This mitosis-independent nuclear condensation and propidium iodide exclusion are characteristic features of apoptosis in other eukaryotic cells (42Span L.F. Pennings A.H. Vierwinden G. Boezeman J.B. Raymakers R.A. de Witte T. Cytometry. 2002; 47: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, DNA fragmentation and ROS production are also hallmarks of apoptotic cells (16Lu B.C.K. Kües U. Fischer R Growth, Differentiation and Sexuality. Springer, Berlin2006: 167-187Google Scholar). Based on the TUNEL assay, we detected DNA fragmentation exclusively in N. crassa conidia exposed to PHS. Furthermore, we found that the sphingolipid stimulates the production of ROS by these cells. Altogether, these results indicate that PHS induces an apoptosis-like cell death in N. crassa, as shown previously in A. nidulans (23Cheng J. Park T.-S. Chio L.-C. Fischl A.S. Ye X.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 163-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that respiratory chain complex I mutants are less prone to die upon exposure to PHS than the wild type strain, clearly implicating mitochondria in the death process. The complex I involvement appears to be specific since mutants defective in other components of the oxidative phosphorylation system, such as complex III, IV, and V mutants, do not show a similar resistance to PHS (or hydrogen peroxide) as the complex I mutants. Although ATP is required for apoptosis (2Skulachev V.P. Apoptosis. 2006; 11:"
https://openalex.org/W2040460895,"N-Glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum is an essential protein modification and highly conserved in evolution from yeast to humans. The key step of this pathway is the transfer of the lipid-linked core oligosaccharide to the nascent polypeptide chain, catalyzed by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex. Temperature-sensitive oligosaccharyltransferase mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at the restrictive temperature, such as wbp1-1, as well as wild-type cells in the presence of the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin display typical apoptotic phenotypes like nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine translocation, caspase-like activity, and reactive oxygen species accumulation. Since deletion of the yeast metacaspase YCA1 did not abrogate this death pathway, we postulated a different proteolytic process to be responsible. Here, we show that Kex1 protease is involved in the programmed cell death caused by defective N-glycosylation. Its disruption decreases caspase-like activity, production of reactive oxygen species, and fragmentation of mitochondria and, conversely, improves growth and survival of cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that Kex1 contributes also to the active cell death program induced by acetic acid stress or during chronological aging, suggesting that Kex1 plays a more general role in cellular suicide of yeast.

Similarly, regulated cell death has been shown to be essential during yeast development for the long term survival of the colony population in order to adapt to the environment, whereby ammonia acts as a signal for differentiation (36Vachova L.

N-Glycosylation is one of the most common types of eukaryotic protein modifications, and the pathway is highly conserved from yeast to humans (38Lehle L. Strahl S. Tanner W. Angew Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2006; 45: 6802-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In humans, defects in N-glycosylation are the cause of congenital disorders of glycosylation, a new family of genetic diseases with a severe, multisystemic clinical picture (39Jaeken J. Carchon H. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2004; 16: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that yeast mutants with a defect in subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), 2The abbreviations used are: OST, oligosaccharyltransferase; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; DHR, dihydrorhodamine; DHE, dihydroethidium; D2R, aspartate2 rhodamine 110; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; fmk, fluoro-methylketone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; H2DCFDA, 2′,7′dichloro dihydrofluorofluorescein diacetate; PI, propidium iodide; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TM, tunicamycin; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; mtGFP, mitochondrion-targeted green fluorescent protein construct. 2The abbreviations used are: OST, oligosaccharyltransferase; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; DHR, dihydrorhodamine; DHE, dihydroethidium; D2R, aspartate2 rhodamine 110; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; fmk, fluoro-methylketone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; H2DCFDA, 2′,7′dichloro dihydrofluorofluorescein diacetate; PI, propidium iodide; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TM, tunicamycin; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; mtGFP, mitochondrion-targeted green fluorescent protein construct. such as wbp1 and ost2, display morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis. OST2 from yeast is homologous to DAD1 (40Knauer R. Lehle L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), originally characterized in hamster cells as a “defender against apoptotic death” (41Nakashima T. Sekiguchi T. Kuraoka A.

Brewster J.L. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We observed nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, and externalization of phosphatidylserine. We also provided evidence for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a caspase-like activity, which could be diminished by heterologous expression of antiapoptotic human Bcl-2. Since deletion of the yeast metacaspase YCA1/MCA1 did not seem to abrogate this activity, we postulated a different proteolytic activity to be involved in cell death induced by a protein N-glycosylation defect (24Hauptmann P. Riel C. Kunz-Schughart L.A. Frohlich K.U. Madeo F. Lehle L. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Searching for a potential protease involved in this process, we came across Kex1. This protein has been characterized as a serine carboxypeptidase B-like protease, specific for basic amino acid residues, responsible for processing of prepro-α-factor (mating pheromone) as well as K1 and K2 killer toxin precursors (43Bussey H. Yeast. 1988; 4: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 44Fuller R.S. Sterne R.E. Thorner J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 345-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) while traversing the secretory pathway. Kex1 localizes to the Golgi apparatus and contains a membrane-spanning domain at the carboxyl-terminal side, whereas the large protease domain at the NH2 terminus is extended into the lumen of the secretory pathway (45Cooper A. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).In this study, we demonstrate that Kex1 protease is a new player in the yeast cell death cascade caused by defective N-glycosylation both in the glycosylation mutant wbp1-1 and in wild-type cells when exposed to the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. Disruption of KEX1 diminishes caspase-like activity and ROS accumulation, retards the fragmentation of mitochondria, and leads to a better growth and survival of cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence that KEX1 is also involved in cell death provoked by acetic acid stress and during chronological aging.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Media, and Genetic MethodsThe following strains were used: SS328 (MATα ade2-101 ura3-52 his3Δ200 lys2-801), SS328Δkex1 (MATα ade2-101 ura3-52 his3Δ200 lys2-801 Δkex1::kanMX), SS328Δyca1 (MATα ade2-101 ura3-52 his3Δ200 lys2-801 Δyca1:: kanMX), WCA (MATα his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3), WCAΔpep4 (MATα his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3 Δpep4::HIS3), WCAΔpep4Δkex1 (MATα his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3 Δpep4::HIS3 Δkex1::kanMX), MA7-B (MATa ade2-101 ura3-52 his3Δ200 lys2-801 wbp1-1), MA7-BΔkex1 (MATa ade2-101 ura3-52 his3Δ200 lys2-801 wbp1-1 Δkex1::kanMX), MA7-BΔyca1 (MATa ade2-101 ura3-52 his3Δ200 lys2-801 wbp1-1 Δyca1::kanMX), MA7-BΔaif1 (MATa ade2-101 ura3-52 his3Δ200 lys2-801 wbp1-1 Δaif1::kanMX), MA7-BΔnma111 (MATa ade2-101 ura3-52 his3Δ200 lys2-801 wbp1-1 Δnma111::kanMX). Strains were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose) or in selective YNB (yeast nitrogen base) medium supplemented with amino acids, nucleotide bases, as required, and 2% glucose at the temperatures indicated. For osmotic stabilization, 1 m sorbitol was added to rich medium.Disruption of KEX1, YCA1, AIF1, and NMA111 was carried out with a kanMX cassette amplified by PCR from the plasmid pUG6 (46Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar), using 5′-GCATACTTTGGTTAAAGAGTACCTTGGCTATAGAATACCGTAGAGATAAAGACCcagctgaagcttcgtacgc-3′ and 5′-GCCAAGTTAAAAATCAGTCATCTCAAAAGATTCATCGATTTCAGTGTTCGGAAGGCgcatagcccactagtggatct-3′ for disruption of KEX1 and using 5′-GCGTCCGGGTAATAACAACTATTGAAAAAGCATGGCTTCGCATTAATAGGAGCCcagctgaagcttcgtacgc-3′ and 5′-TACATAATAAATTGCAGATTTACGTCAATAGGGTGTGACGATGATAATTGTGGgcatagcccactagtggatct-3′ for disruption of YCA1. To delete AIF1 and NMA111, the kanMX cassettes were amplified by PCR using 5′fw primer 5′-GCAGTGATAAATCATTGATAGACACACATTTCCTCATCGTTGTTCTTCATTATTTACAGGAAAGAGCcagctgaagcttcgtacgc-3′ and 3′rev primer 5′-GCTGCAGTTCATATTTTAGTCTATTTTTTGAATAAAGGTTCCATTTTGTCGGAGAAAAGATTCTTCGgcatagcccactagtggatct for AIF1 and using 5′-GTAGAGTACAGTAAAGGTTTTTTAGATCTACTAATGACCATATCGTTGAGCcagctgaagcttcgtacgc-3′ and 5′-CTATTTTTCACTTTGGCTGTTGCCGGTAAATTCC TTTTCAATCCATTTGTGCGgcatagcccactagtggatct-3′ for NMA111. The cassettes were transformed into yeast strains SS328 (wild-type) and MA7-B (wbp1-1). Recombinants were selected for resistance to G418 sulfate, and positive clones were verified by PCR.To construct the expression plasmid pVT100-KEX1-ZZ, KEX1 was amplified by PCR with genomic DNA from wild-type strain SS328 as template using primer 5′-CCGAAGCTTATGTTTTACAATAGG-3′ with a HindIII site and primer 5′-TGCTCTAGAAAAATCAGTCATCTC-3′ with an XbaI site. The insert was ligated in HindIII/XbaI-cut yeast shuttle vector pVT100-ZZ. Correctness of the construct was verified by sequencing and analysis of the protein by Western blotting using the protein A epitopes (ZZ) fused in frame to the COOH terminus for detection.For tagging genomic KEX1 with two ZZ-epitopes, a cassette was amplified by PCR with 5′-GCCTTCCGAACACTGAAATCGATGAATCTTTTGAGATGACTGATTTGGAGCAGGGGCGGGTGC-3′ and 5′-CCCTTTAAAGAATTTATCTTTATGTCGCTGTTACTACGAAAAGCGTGTGCGAGGTCGACGGTATCG-3′ as primers and using plasmid pZZ-KAN as template. Transformants were selected on G418-sulfate medium, and the correct recombination at the chromosomal KEX1 locus was verified by PCR using the primers 5′-GTTACGCTGGCCAATACATACC-3′ and 5′-GAATTTTCGTTTTAAAACCTAAGAGTCAC-3′ and expression of the tagged protein by Western analysis. Mitochondria were visualized using a mitochondria-targeted green fluorescent protein in strains transformed with plasmid pVT100-mtGFP, as described previously (47Westermann B. Neupert W. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).Induction of Programmed Cell Death by Temperature Shift and Treatment with Acetic AcidFresh cultures were grown to a cell density of 2 × 106 ml-1 overnight at 25 °C and divided into two flasks. For initiation of the cell death program in wbp1-1, cultures were shifted to restrictive temperatures as indicated. For treatment with acetic acid, cells were harvested at a cell density of 2 × 106 ml-1 and suspended in YPD medium (pH 3.0; adjusted with HCl) containing appropriate concentrations of acetic acid at a cell density of 3 × 106 ml-1. Treatment with acetic acid was carried out for 200 min at 25 °C (16Ludovico P. Sousa M.J. Silva M.T. Leao C. Corte-Real M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar).Confocal Laser Microscopy and Flow CytometryFor detection of caspase-like activity, 5 × 106 cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of staining solution containing 10 μm FITC-VAD-fmk in phosphate-buffered saline (CaspACE FITC-VAD-fmk in situ marker; Promega) or in 0.25 ml of YPD containing 0.2 mm D2R (25 mm stock solution in ethanol/dimethyl sulfoxide 2:1; Thermo Scientific). After incubation for 20 min at room temperature (for FITC-VAD-fmk) or 30 min at 30 °C (for D2R) with low agitation in darkness, cells were centrifuged and washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Free intracellular radicals (ROS) were detected by dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123) and 2′,7′-dichlorodihydro-fluoresceindiacetate (H2DCFDA), which were added 1.5-2 h before harvesting the cells from a 2.5 mg ml-1 stock solution in ethanol to a final concentration of 5 μg ml-1. Staining with dihydroethidium (DHE) was performed as described in Ref. 32Buttner S. Eisenberg T. Carmona-Gutierrez D. Ruli D. Knauer H. Ruckenstuhl C. Sigrist C. Wissing S. Kollroser M. Frohlich K.U. Sigrist S. Madeo F. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar. For staining with propidium iodide (PI), cells were treated as described for caspase staining. PI was added from a 50 μg ml-1 stock solution in water to a final concentration of 50 ng ml-1.For confocal laser microscopy, cells were concentrated by a short centrifugation step and immobilized by covering with 1% agarose. Analysis was performed using an LSM 510-META confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For detection of FITC-VAD-fmk, D2R, DHR123, H2DCFDA, and GFP fluorescence signals, a 505-550-nm band pass emission filter was used with an excitation at 488 nm (argon laser). PI fluorescence (excitation 543 nm, HeNe laser) was ascertained using a 585-nm long pass emission filter. To avoid cross-talk between the fluorescence channels in the case of co-staining, probes were scanned sequentially.For flow cytometric analysis, cells were resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and 20,000 cells were probed. Analysis was achieved using the MoFlo (Cytomation) high speed sorter and Summit version 3.1 software. FITC-VAD-fmk, D2R, DHR123, and H2DCFDA fluorescence signals were determined using a 510-550-nm band pass filter; for PI and DHE, a 610-650-nm band pass filter was used (excitation 488 nm, argon laser).Test for Determination of Cell SurvivalTo determine the survival rate, cells were separated by the MoFlo cell sorter and spotted onto YPD plates. For each measuring point, 250 single cells were plated, and the number of colonies was determined after 3-4 days of incubation at the indicated temperature.Assay for KEX1 ActivityMembrane Preparation—Yeast cells were grown in minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% casamino acids, 20 mg ml-1 tryptophan, 20 mg ml-1 adenine, 30 mg ml-1 tyrosine, 2% glucose) overnight to a cell density of 2 × 107 ml-1. Approximately 3 × 1010 cells were harvested at 4,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and resuspended in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EtSH, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm MgCl2 and 5% glycerol; per gram, wet weight, 1 ml of buffer was added. Cells were broken with glass beads using a Merckenschlager bead beater (Braun, Melsungen, Germany), and the cell lysate was filtered to remove beads. After centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once and resuspended in buffer B containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 35% glycerol.Purification of KEX1-ZZ—For solubilization of KEX1-ZZ from the membrane fraction, 1.2 mg of protein in buffer B containing 0.5 m KCl and 1% octyl glucoside (added dropwise) were incubated in a final volume of 0.2 ml for 20 min on ice. The mixture was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 40 min at 2 °C, and 0.1 ml of the supernatant was added to 50 μl of IgG-Sepharose equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl. After incubation by rolling end over end for 30 min at 4 °C, the Sepharose beads were centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min at 4 °C and washed three times with 25 mm BisTris-HCl (pH 6.3).Enzyme Tests—To determine Kex1-ZZ activity, 0.5 mm furylacryloyl-Ala-Arg-OH in methanol and 930 μl of 25 mm Bis-Tris-HCl (pH 6.3) were added to 50 μl of IgG-Sepharose beads to which Kex1-ZZ was adsorbed as prepared above and incubated for the times indicated. Beads were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 s, and from the supernatant, the absorption at 340 nm was determined. To investigate a caspase-like activity, 40 μm Ac-VEID-AMC (2 mm stock solution in DMSO) was added to Kex1-ZZ-adsorbed IgG-Sepharose beads as described before. After incubation for 2 h by rolling end over end, emission of the supernatant was determined at a wavelength of 440 nm, applying an excitation of 370 nm. Measurements were accomplished in a Jobin Yvon-Spec Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorimeter with DataMax software.In Vivo Labeling with [35S]Methionine/CysteineYeast cells were grown in YPD to a cell density of 7 × 106 ml-1 overnight at 25 °C and then shifted to 37 °C for the times indicated. Prior to labeling, cells were transferred for 30 min to YNB glucose medium, and subsequently cells were labeled for 30 min at 37 °C and further processed for isolation and PAGE analysis of carboxypeptidase CPY as described in Ref. 48Knauer R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17249-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar.RESULTSDisruption of KEX1 Causes Better Growth and Survival of N-Glycosylation-defective Cells and Decreases Caspase-like Activity as Well as ROS Accumulation—Wbp1 is an essential subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, the key enzyme of protein N-glycosylation (49Knauer R. Lehle L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 50te Heesen S. Janetzky B. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2071-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). When the temperature-sensitive mutant wbp1-1 is shifted from the permissive temperature of 25 °C to a restrictive temperature, an underglycosylation of glycoproteins occurs, and cells start to die, thereby exhibiting typical markers of apoptosis (24Hauptmann P. Riel C. Kunz-Schughart L.A. Frohlich K.U. Madeo F. Lehle L. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, disruption of KEX1 restores the temperature growth defect of wbp1-1 at 31 °C. Similarly, a better survival of cells is observed. For this purpose, cells were shifted for different time periods to the restrictive temperature of 37 °C and subsequently separated with a cell sorter, and single cells were spotted on full medium plates. After 4 days at 25 °C, survival of cells was determined (Fig. 1B). The positive effect on survival by deletion of KEX1 can also be observed at restrictive temperatures lower than 37 °C (see supplemental Fig. 1). Deletion of KEX1 in wild-type cells has no effect on growth (Fig. 1A) or survival (data not shown), indicating that the N-glycosylation defect in wbp1 is the cause. A terminal, visible phenotype occurring in yeast programmed cell death is an alteration of the cell morphology, characterized by cell shrinkage. As shown in Fig. 1C, in wbp1-1Δkex1 cells lacking Kex1 protease, the amount of shrunken cells was strongly reduced from 20 to 5%, in comparison with wbp1-1 cells upon a shift to 37 °C for 4 h.We have recently demonstrated a caspase-like, proteolytic activity both by cell flow cytometry and cell-free extracts of N-glycosylation-stressed cells using typical metazoan caspase substrates (24Hauptmann P. Riel C. Kunz-Schughart L.A. Frohlich K.U. Madeo F. Lehle L. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity was reduced in the presence of specific as well as broad spectrum pancaspase inhibitors, such as Z-VAD-fmk, or by the addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine. So far the only caspase identified in yeast is Yca1p, belonging to the so-called metacaspase family (51Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A. Pisabarro M.T. Seshagiri S. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 961-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was shown to have a central role in yeast apoptosis. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence for other apoptotic pathways that are, in contrast to those previously mentioned, caspase-independent, both in vertebrates and yeast (26Fahrenkrog B.

Therefore, we asked whether Kex1 contributes to the proteolytic activity measured during cell death of wbp1-1 and how it compares with Yca1. As shown in Fig. 2A, deletion of Kex1 protease in wbp1-1 leads to a strong decrease of the amount of cells labeled with cell-permeable FITC-valyl-alanylaspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone (FITC-VAD-fmk), when analyzed by cell flow cytometry. Although 32 and 64%, respectively, of wbp1-1 cells showed positive staining after a temperature shift to 37 °C for 4 and 8 h, this amounted to only 10 and 25% in wbp1-1Δkex1 cells. In wild-type cells and wild-type Δkex1, no staining at 37 °C was detectable. The positive influence by KEX1 occurs already at lower restrictive temperatures than 37 °C (supplemental Fig. 1B). In contrast to KEX1, disruption of YCA1 in wbp1-1 had no effect on the caspase-like activity under the same conditions (Fig. 2A). In cells cultured at the permissive temperature of 25 °C, hardly any activity could be measured. Similarly, disruption of YCA1 affects neither growth (Fig. 1A), survival (Fig. 1B), nor cell shr"
https://openalex.org/W2069167544,"FE65, a neural adaptor protein, interacts with amyloid β-protein precursor (APP) and is known to regulate amyloid β generation from APP. FE65 also associates with nuclear proteins; however, its physiological function in the nucleus remains unclear. A fixed population of cytoplasmic FE65 is tethered to membranes by binding APP. This membrane-tethered FE65 is liberated from membranes by APP phosphorylation, which is facilitated by a stress-activated protein kinase in sorbitol-treated cells. Here we show that liberated FE65, which is distinct from “virgin” FE65 in the cytoplasm, translocates into the nucleus and accumulates in the nuclear matrix forming a patched structure. Targeting of FE65 into the nuclear matrix was suppressed by the APP intracellular domain fragment, which is generated by consecutive cleavages of APP. Thus, nuclear translocation of FE65 is under the regulation of APP. In the nucleus, FE65 induced γH2AX, which plays an important role in DNA repair as a cellular response by stress-damaged cells. These observations suggest that APP-regulated FE65 plays an important role in the early stress response of cells and that FE65 deregulated from APP induces apoptosis.

Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been hypothesized that FE65, along with APP, plays an important role in signal transduction during cellular stress responses. Here we investigated FE65 function in the cellular response of cells under hyperosmotic stress. FE65 translocation into the nuclear matrix of cells under osmotic stress was regulated by APP and its metabolic fragment, AICD. FE65 that was translocated into the nucleus under the regulation of APP induced γH2AX, which plays an important role in the DNA repair process. Therefore, APP-regulated FE65 contributes to the process of signal transduction in response to cellular stress. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (236-10501, Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen), anti-actin (C4, Chemicon/Millipore), anti-hemagglutinin (12CA5, Roche Applied Science), and anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) antibodies and rabbit polyclonal anti-APP carboxyl-terminal APP/C (Sigma), anti-phospho-Thr668-APP (Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Co. Ltd.), anti-histone H1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-EGFP (Clontech) antibodies were purchased from the indicated suppliers. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The rabbit polyclonal anti-FE65 UT122 antibody used was described previously (9Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Photobleaching Studies, Immunostaining of Cells, and Immunoblotting of Proteins—Fluorescence photobleaching was achieved under a Carl Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope with a photobleaching system (LSM510). Photobleaching procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fluorescence quantification was performed using the imaging software ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The procedure for immunostaining of cells was described previously (9Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In brief, mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (N2a) cells cultured on an 8-well chamber slide glass (Nalge Nunc International) were transfected with the indicated plasmids in Lipofectamine 2000 for 24 h, and the cells were fixed with 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (rt), permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with PBS containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 546 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR). After incubation with secondary antibody, cells were treated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min followed by washing three times with PBS and observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss). Immunoblotting of proteins has been described previously (9Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by ECL (GE Healthcare) and quantified with the VersaDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). Culture, Gene Transfection, and Sorbitol Treatment of Cells—N2a cells were cultured and transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids in Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (9Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To establish stable cell lines in which APP or FE65 expression was knocked down, N2a cells were transfected with pSUPERmAPP, pSUPERmFE65, or pSUPERcontrol vectors in Lipofectamine 2000 and screened by immunoblotting to examine endogenous expression of APP or FE65. Sorbitol treatment of cells was initiated by replacing the culture medium with medium containing 0.5 m sorbitol for the indicated times and completed by replacing the medium with medium lacking sorbitol. Plasmid Construction—To prepare pEGFP-FE65, a cDNA encoding full-length human FE65 was amplified from pcDNA3.1NFLAG-FE65 (9Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using the following primers: forward (f), 5′-ggcggcggtaccgccaccatgtctgttcca-3′; reverse (r), 5′-ggcggcggatcctggggtatgggcccccag-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with KpnI/BamHI and was cloned into the same cleavage sites of the pEGFP-N3 vector. pEGFP-AICDwt was generated by amplifying cDNA encoding AICD (from amino acids 653-695 of APP695) from pcDNA3APP695 (9Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) by PCR with the 5′-ggcggcaagcttgccaccatgcagtacaca-3′ (f) and 5′-ggcgatggatccgttctgcatctgc-3′ (r) primers, digesting with HindIII/BamHI, and cloning into the pEGFP-N3 vector. Ala substitutions for Tyr682 and Tyr687 of AICD were introduced by PCR of pcDNA3APP695 with four primers: 5′-gaacttggcggttggattttcggcgccgtt-3′ (first), 5′-ctgctcaaagaacttggcggt-3′ (second), and the primers used for pEGFP-AICDwt described above. The obtained fragment was used to generate pEGFP-AICDmt. Other constructs with a FLAG sequence at the amino terminus were created by the PCR of cDNAs derived from N2a or SH-SY5Y cells or cloned cDNA with gene-specific f and r primer sets. The products were digested with the indicated restriction enzymes and cloned into the pcDNA3.1NFLAG vector (9Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). pcDNA3.1NFLAG-cp2 was generated by the PCR of cDNA using the 5′-gggcccaagcttatggcctgggctctgaagct-3′ (f) and 5′-gggccctctagactacttgagaatgacatgata-3′ (r) primers and digested with HindIII/XbaI. pcDNA3.1NFLAG-hnRNP L was generated by the PCR of cDNA with 5′-gggcccaagcttatggtgaagatggcggct-3′ (f) and 5′-gggccctctagattaggaggcgtgctgtgc-3′ (r) primers and digested with HindIII/XbaI. To generate pmRFP-Golgi, the mRFP sequence was prepared from pRSETb-mRFP by the PCR using the 5′-ggcggcggatccatggcctcctccgaggac-3′ (f) and 5′-ggcggctgcggccgcttaggcgccggtggagtggcg-3′ (r) primers and digested with BamHI/NotI. The resulting fragment encoding mRFP was ligated into pECFP-Golgi (Clontech) in place of cDNA encoding enhanced cyan fluorescent protein using BamHI/NotI restriction sites. Then mRFP-Golgi was recloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector to obtain pcDNA3.1mRFP-Golgi. To prepare pSUPERmFE65 or pSUPERmAPP, two oligonucleotides (5′-gatccccggctttgaggaaggagagtttcaagagaactgtccttcctcaaagccttttta-3′ (f) and 5′-agcttaaaaaggctttgaggaaggagagttctcttgaaactctccttcctcaaagccggg-3′ (r) for mouse FE65 and 5′-gatccccgaaggccgttatccagcatttcaagagaatgctggataacggccttcttttta-3′ (f) and 5′-agcttaaaaagaaggccgttatccagcattctcttgaaatgctggataacggccttcggg-3′ (r) for mouse APP) were synthesized, annealed, and inserted into the pSUPERvector (OligoEngine) at the BglII/HindIII sites. pSUPER-control was prepared using the synthesized oligonucleotides 5′-gatccccggctttgaggatggagaatttcaagagaattctccatcctcaaagccttttta-3′ (f) and 5′-agcttaaaaaggctttgaggatggagaattctcttgaaattctccatcctcaaagccggg-3′ (r) for FE65 or 5′-gatccccgaaggcagttatccagcatttcaagagaatgctggataactgccttcttttta-3′ (f) and 5′-agcttaaaaagaaggcagttatccagcattctcttgaaatgctggataactgccttcggg-3′ (r) for APP as described above. pEGFP-APP, pcDNA3NFLAG-APP, pcDNA3.1NFLAG-FE65 and pcDNA3.1NHA-FE65 were described in previous reports (5Ando K.

Subcellular and Subnuclear Fractionation of Cultured Cells and Protein Analysis—Subcellular fractionation was carried out as described previously (9Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Subnuclear fractionation was also carried out as described previously (15Fey E.G. Krochmalnic G. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly cells were collected by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and suspended in CSK buffer (10 mm Pipes-NaOH (pH 6.8), 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 100 mm NaCl and incubated for 3 min on ice. A 10% volume aliquot was lysed by sonication to prepare the crude cell lysate (CL). The CSK buffer suspension was centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as the membrane/cytosol (MC) fraction. The pellet was resuspended in CSK buffer containing 250 mm ammonium sulfate and incubated on ice for 5 min. The suspension was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was used as the nucleoplasm (NP) fraction. The pellet was washed with PBS, resuspended in CSK buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and DNase I (100 μg/ml), and incubated at rt for 20 min. After incubation, a 10% volume of 2.5 m ammonium sulfate was added, the solution was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected as the DNA-binding protein fraction. The pellet was washed with PBS and then resuspended in CSK buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and RNase A (25 μg/ml). After incubation for 10 min at rt, the sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected as the RNA-binding protein fraction. The washed pellet was resuspended in Tris/SDS solution (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% (w/v) SDS, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and sonicated for 10 s to prepare the nuclear matrix (NM) fraction. Equal volumes of each fraction were used for immunoblot analysis, and the recovery of proteins in the respective fractions was estimated and indicated as yield (in percent) relative to CL (100%). Damaged DNA Electrophoresis—Damaged DNA analyses were carried out as described previously (16Kitagawa D. Tanemura S. Ohata S. Shimizu N. Seo J. Nishitai G. Watanabe T. Nakagawa K. Kishimoto H.

Briefly cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm EDTA, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100), and the DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and then dissolved in double distilled water containing RNase A (20 μg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at rt. DNA was then subjected to agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis and stained with EtBr. Comet Assay—Cells were suspended in 1% (w/v) low melting agarose (Sigma A6560) in PBS and dropped onto a glass plate coated with 1% (w/v) agarose HS (Nippon gene). The plate was covered with a coverslip for 5 min at rt. The coverslip was removed, and the glass plate was soaked in a lysis buffer (2.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% DMSO, and 1% Triton X-100) for 1.5 h at 4 °C, washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and left in neutral electrophoresis buffer (300 mm NaOAc, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), and 1% DMSO) for 45 min at 4 °C. The samples were then subjected to electrophoresis for 40 min at 25 V at 4 °C and washed three times with 0.4 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The glass plate was then soaked in 70% ethanol for a few minutes to dehydrate, completely dried, and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Samples were covered with a coverslip and observed with a confocal microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss). Flow Cytometry—Cells were treated with 70% ethanol and stored at -20 °C until analysis. The stored cells were precipitated by centrifugation and washed with PBS twice, incubated with stain solution (PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 100 μg/ml boiled RNase A, and 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min at rt, and analyzed with FACSort (BD Biosciences). Nuclear Accumulation of FE65 in Cells Treated with Sorbitol—A previous report indicates that membrane-tethered FE65 is released into an FE65-rich cytoplasm (9Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To assess the fate of FE65 released from APP into the cytoplasm of cells under osmotic stress, we examined subcellular fractions and identified cellular localization of FE65. In N2a cells, FE65 largely localized in the cytoplasm as expected, whereas a fixed amount of FE65 was recovered from the membrane fraction, and small amounts of FE65 were detected in the nucleus (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 7, and 13). When N2a cells were treated with sorbitol, the level of APP phosphorylation at Thr668 increased, the amount of membrane-tethered FE65 decreased, and the level of FE65 in the nucleus increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-4 and 13-16). Sorbitol removal induced dephosphorylation of APP, disappearance of nuclear FE65, and restoration of membrane-tethered FE65 (Fig. 1A, lanes 5, 6, 17, and 18). Nuclear FE65 may be exported from or degraded in the nucleus when hyperosmotic conditions are abolished. This enhanced nuclear localization of FE65 in response to sorbitol was also observed in COS7, SH-SY5Y, HEK293, and mouse central nervous system catecholaminergic CAD cells as well as in response to other osmolytes such as mannitol or NaCl and genotoxic stresses such as H2O2 (data not shown). To determine which nuclear region showed FE65 accumulation after sorbitol treatment (Fig. 1B), N2a cells treated with (+) or without (-) sorbitol were lysed, and the CLs were fractionated into MC and nuclear fractions. The nuclear fraction was further subfractionated into NP, DNA-binding protein (DNA-bp), RNA-binding protein (RNA-bp), and NM fractions. Intranuclear FE65 distribution in cells treated with (+) or without (-) sorbitol was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B, upper panels), and quantitative recovery was determined as the percent yield (Fig. 1B, lower graph). Regardless of sorbitol treatment, FE65 was largely recovered in the MC fraction with a modest NP fraction also recovered. Approximately 20% of FE65 was recovered in the NM fraction in sorbitol-treated cells. Negligible FE65 was detected in the DNA-bp and RNA-bp fractions. In contrast, the transcriptional regulator CP2/LSF/LBP1 (designed cp2) was detected in the DNA-bp fraction, and ∼50% of the pre-mRNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (designed hnRNP L) was recovered in the RNA-bp fraction (Fig. 1B, upper panels). These observations, together with previous reports (9Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggest that some of the FE65 population, perhaps those that are membrane-tethered, translocated into the nucleus, particularly into the nuclear matrix, in response to sorbitol exposure. Cellular Localization of FE65 in Living Cells with or without Sorbitol Treatment—Although we hypothesize that membrane-tethered FE65 translocated into the nuclei (Fig. 1A), it was difficult to distinguish membrane-released from cytoplasm-derived FE65. Therefore, we observed real time movement of EGFP-FE65 in living cells with or without sorbitol treatment. EGFP-FE65 was located diffusely throughout the cell, although a slight accumulation was observed at the perinuclear membrane region that largely co-localized with Golgi (Fig. 2A). When EGFP-FE65 was co-expressed with APP695, EGFP-FE65 was significantly localized around the perinuclear region with a few diffuse distributions in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2B). The majority of APP695 localized to the perinuclear region primarily at the Golgi (Fig. 2C), suggesting that EGFP-FE65 could be tethered at the membrane via binding to APP. Co-localization of APP and FE65 at the perinuclear region was confirmed by immunostaining of fixed cells (data not shown). To examine FE65 translocation in living cells, we performed fluorescence photobleaching. When the perinuclear region was subjected one time to photobleaching (the bleached region is indicated within a red circle in Fig. 2D), the majority of EGFP-FE65 at the perinuclear region was bleached out and then reappeared after bleaching (Fig. 2D). However, continuous bleaching to EGFP-FE65 at the perinuclear region abolished fluorescence of EGFP-FE65 throughout the cell (Fig. 2E). This is due to a continuous photobleaching at the perinuclear region rather than the photobleaching throughout the cell (data not shown). When cells expressing EGFP-FE65 with APP695 were treated with 0.5 m sorbitol, EGFP-FE65 localized as “patches” in the nuclei (Fig. 3B). Herein the patches are assigned to the shape of the region where EGFP-FE65 accumulated in nuclei and do not indicate a specific subnuclear structure. These patches were not observed in nuclei prior to sorbitol treatment (Fig. 3A). The fluorescence of EGFP-FE65 in the nuclei became stronger with increasing time of sorbitol treatment (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that FE65 enters the nuclei and forms patched structures in cells following sorbitol treatment. To confirm the translocation of FE65 into the nucleus from the perinuclear membrane region, we photobleached the sorbitol-treated cells. When EGFP-FE65 patches in the nucleus were bleached one time following 20 min of sorbitol treatment, the fluorescence disappeared and then reappeared in a time-dependent manner, although the level was not restored completely (Fig. 4, A and D). When EGFP-FE65 at the perinuclear region was bleached one time following 20 min of sorbitol treatment, the fluorescence disappeared and then reappeared at the bleached region (Fig. 4, B and E). The nuclear patches of EGFP-FE65 were largely unaffected by bleaching at the perinuclear region. In contrast, when cells were subjected to continuous bleaching at the perinuclear region after 20 min of sorbitol treatment, the fluorescence of EGFP-FE65 in both the cytoplasm and nuclear patches disappeared (Fig. 4, C and F). These results suggest that in cells under osmotic stress APP-tethered FE65 in the perinuclear region translocated into the nucleus, and a fixed ratio of FE65 in the cytoplasmic pool became newly tethered at the perinuclear membrane region. This result is consistent with our previous observations that APP-tethered FE65 is released from membranes by APP phosphorylation (9Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We also observed nuclear patch formation by EGFP-FE65 in cells without APP overexpression (Fig. 5A, top panels). Photobleaching experiments of EGFP-FE65 in such cells gave results similar to those in cells with APP overexpression (supplemental Fig. S1; compare with Fig. 4). The reason for this was thought to arise because of the presence of a moderate level of endogenous APP. To confirm the role of APP in this process, we used small interfering RNA to generate the APP knockdown cell line C5, which has APP levels that are ∼20% of those in parental N2a and control A3 cell lines (supplemental Fig. S2). When A3 or N2a cells expressing EGFP-FE65 were treated with sorbitol, EGFP-FE65 formed nuclear patches in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5A, top and bottom panels). In contrast, almost no nuclear patch formation of EGFP-FE65 was observed in sorbitol-treated C5 cells expressing EGFP-FE65 (Fig. 5A, middle panels). In A3 cells, ∼20% of the total amount of endogenous FE65 accumulated in the nuclear matrix fraction after sorbitol treatment, whereas in C5 cells a reduced level of endogenous FE65 accumulated in the nuclear matrix fraction after sorbitol treatment (Fig. 5B). In C5 cells, overexpressed EGFP-FE65 did not form nuclear patches (Fig. 5A), although a moderate amount of endogenous FE65 was detected in the nuclear matrix even when endogenous levels of FE65 were very low (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that a fixed ratio of APP to FE65 may be needed for sorbitol-induced nuclear matrix targeting of FE65. Therefore, we next examined the efficiency of FE65 targeting into the nuclear matrix of cells differentially expressing APP. Cells expressing a fixed amount of NHA-FE65 (FE65 with an amino-terminal hemagglutinin tag) were transfected with various amounts of pcDNA3NFLAG-APP and treated with or without sorbitol, and NHA-FE65 that had translocated into the nuclear matrix fraction was recovered (Fig. 5C). NHA-FE65 recovery in the nuclear matrix fraction was maximal in cells expressing a moderate level of APP (50 ng of pcDNA3NFLAG-APP to 400 ng of pcDNA3NHA-FE65), indicating that the efficiency of nuclear matrix targeting of FE65 is dependent on the amount of APP expressed by the cell. AICD Suppresses FE65 Localization to the Patched Nuclear Matrix—FE65 interacts not only with APP but also with AICD, which is believed to function in nuclei (6Cao X. Sudhof T.C.

EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Indeed AICD was detected in the nuclear fraction in vivo (9Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These observations led us to hypothesize that nuclear FE65 associates with AICD to enable some functions in which case the proteins may co-localize in the nuclei. Therefore, we examined localization of AICD and FE65 in sorbitol-treated cells. We used EGFP fusions with AICD wild type (AICDwt) or with an AICD mutant (AICDmt) in which Tyr682 and Tyr687 of APP695 were substituted with Ala rendering the mutant unable to interact with FE65 (19Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Furthermore AICD-EGFP is metabolically more stable than AICD in the cell (data not shown). N2a cells co-expressing NFLAG-FE65 with AICDwt-EGFP or AICDmt-EGFP were treated with (+sorbitol) or without (control) sorbitol, and the nuclear localization of FE65 was examined (Fig. 6A). NFLAG-FE65 in the presence of AICDwt-EGFP showed a pan-cellular localization in control cells (Fig. 6A, panels a-d) similar to the localization in cells expressing EGFP-FE65 alone (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly in sorbitol-treated cells, the majority of NFLAG-FE65 in the presence of AICDwt-EGFP was detected throughout the cell with a few NFLAG-FE65 proteins demonstrating a weak, patched co-localization with AICDwt-EGFP in the nucleus (Fig. 6A, panels e-h). This result was quite different from the results from cells with EGFP-FE65 alone. In contrast, NFLAG-FE65 in the presence of AICDmt-EGFP showed a pan-cellular localization in control cells (Fig. 6A, panels i-l) and a patched nuclear localization in sorbitol-treated cells (Fig. 6A, panels m-p) similar to the results with EGFP-FE65 alone (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S1). These microscopic observations were confirmed by nuclear fractionation (Fig. 6B, upper panel). The yield of NFLAG-FE65 in the nuclear matrix fraction was extremely low in the presence of AICDwt-EGFP in sorbitol-treated cells (Fig. 6B, lane 11) compared with cells co-expressing EGFP (Fig. 6B, lane 10) or AICDmt-EGFP (Fig. 6B, lane 12).

Two subfamilies are distinguished depending on the presence or absence of a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain, denoted “Cys-box.” The N-terminal domain (NtD) contains the catalytic residues for transglycosidase activity and is separated from the Cys-box by a linker region. To obtain a better understanding of the structure and function of the Cys-box-containing subfamily, we identified the disulfide bonds in Gas2p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by an improved mass spectrometric methodology. We mapped two separate intra-domain clusters of three and four disulfide bridges. One of the bonds in the first cluster connects a central Cys residue of the NtD with a single conserved Cys residue in the linker. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Cys residue in the linker resulted in an endoplasmic reticulum precursor that was not matured and underwent a gradual degradation. The relevant disulfide bond has a crucial role in folding as it may stabilize the NtD and facilitate its interaction with the C-terminal portion of a Gas protein. The four disulfide bonds in the Cys-box are arranged in a manner consistent with a partial structural resemblance with the plant X8 domain, an independent carbohydrate-binding module that possesses only three disulfide bonds. Deletion of the Cys-box in Gas2 or Gas1 proteins led to the formation of an NtD devoid of any enzymatic activity. The results suggest that the Cys-box is required for proper folding of the NtD and/or substrate binding.

In yeast and fungal cells, the cell wall determines cell shape, protects cells from lysis, and constitutes a permeability barrier to the uptake of exogenous substances. In fungal pathogens, the cell wall is also the interface for interactions with the host and is required for cell adhesion and virulence. In yeast, the extracellular matrix is formed and strengthened by the correct cross-linking of several polymers, mannoproteins, glucans, and chitin (1Lesage G. Bussey H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 2Klis F.M. Boorsma A. De Groot P.W. Yeast. 2006; 23: 185-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) where β(1,3)-glucan is the most abundant polymer forming a helical, branched structure that is probably responsible for the elastic properties of the cell wall (3Rees D.A. Scott W.E. J. Chem. Soc. (Lond.) (B). 1971; 1971: 469-479Google Scholar, 4Rees D.A. Morris E.R. Thom D. Madden J.K. Aspinall G.O.E. The Polysaccharides. I. Academic Press, New York1982: 196-290Google Scholar). A plasma membrane β(1,3)-glucan synthase complex extrudes the polymer outside the cell, and other families of enzymes are responsible for its incorporation into the cell wall and for the anchoring of the other components in a way that is still poorly understood (1Lesage G. Bussey H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The Gel/Gas/Phr family of proteins plays an essential role in cell wall biogenesis acting as β(1,3)-glucan processing enzymes (5Hartland R.P. Fontaine T. Debeaupuis J.P. Simenel C. Delepierre M.

J. 2000; 347: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In vitro these proteins catalyze a β(1,3)-glucanosyltransferase reaction that consists of the cleavage of an internal glycosidic linkage of a β(1,3)-glucan chain, the release of the reducing portion, and the transfer of the new reducing end to the nonreducing end of another acceptor β(1,3)-glucan (5Hartland R.P.

Thus β(1,3)-glucanosyltransferases act similarly to glycoside hydrolases, but a carbohydrate functions as the acceptor rather than a water molecule (5Hartland R.P. Fontaine T. Debeaupuis J.P.

This preference for transglycosylation rather than hydrolysis presumably reflects structural differences between β(1,3)-glucanosyltransferases and β(1,3)-glucanases. Proteins related to the Gel/Gas/Phr family are present in many yeast and fungal species and form family GH72 of glycoside hydrolases. GH72 enzymes are crucial for proper morphogenesis. Mutants deleted for the GAS1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae display morphological defects and reduced growth (7Popolo L. Vai M. Gatti E. Porello S. Bonfante P. Balestrini R. Alberghina L. J.

Because of the importance of this class of proteins in cell wall construction and virulence, they are promising molecular targets for new antifungal drugs. Sequence analysis showed that members of GH72 family share a putative catalytic domain and a linker segment in the N-terminal region but differ significantly in the C-terminal portion where a cysteine-enriched module (Cys-box) and a polyserine region of variable length (Ser-box) may be present in different arrangements (17Ragni E. Fontaine T. Gissi C. Latge J.P. Popolo L. Yeast. 2007; 24: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In a previous work (17Ragni E. Fontaine T. Gissi C. Latge J.P. Popolo L. Yeast. 2007; 24: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we described the identification of two distinct GH72 subfamilies based on the presence (GH72+) or absence of the Cys-box (GH72–). In addition all GH72 proteins share a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 3The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; AGE, affinity gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CDAP, 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER-associated protein degradation; HPAEC, high performance anion-exchange chromatography; LC, liquid chromatography; ESI, electrospray ionization; FTICR, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; PNGaseF, peptide N-glycosidase F; QTOF, quadrupole time-of-flight; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; NtD, N-terminal domain. attachment signal at the C-terminal end. The GPI anchor tethers these proteins to the plasma membrane, but at least some members, e.g. Gas1p, Gas3p, and Gas5p of S. cerevisiae, are further processed and become covalently cross-linked to the cell wall via a glycosidic bond between a GPI remnant and β(1,3)-glucan-linked β(1,6)-glucans (18Yin Q.Y. de Groot P.W. de Jong L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 20894-20901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The organization of domains of GH72+ proteins resembles that of many polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes such as mannanases, chitinases, cellulases, and glucanases that are composed of the following distinct domains: a putative catalytic module and a noncatalytic module connected by a flexible region (20Sunna A. Gibbs M.D. Bergquist P.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). The noncatalytic module is often an independent appendix required for tight polysaccharide binding, and it is necessary for targeting secreted enzymes to the sites where hydrolysis takes place and for increasing the local concentration of the enzyme or in some cases for disrupting the fibrillar structure of the substrate (as for example in cellulose binding domains (20Sunna A. Gibbs M.D. Bergquist P.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). In this work we have analyzed the disulfide bond structure and domain organization of Gas1p and Gas2p, two GH72+ enzymes of S. cerevisiae. We have mapped seven disulfide bonds in Gas2p by a recently developed computer-assisted mass spectrometric approach (22de Koning L.J. Kasper P.T. Back J.W. Nessen M.A. Vanrobaeys F. Van Beeumen J. Gherardi E. de Koster C.G. de Jong L. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Results suggest that the Cys-box tightly interacts with the NtD. Truncation analyses reveal a unique domain organization of Gas1 and Gas2 proteins as well as a role for the Linker region and a crucial Cys residue in the attainment of the properly folded and active conformation of the enzyme. General Strategy Used to Identify Disulfide-linked Peptides—Our analytical strategy of the protein under study consists of cleavage between adjacent Cys residues and mass spectrometric analysis of the peptide mixture (see supplemental Fig. S1 for a flow chart). Free –SH groups were first alkylated under conditions preventing disulfide exchange reactions. Cleavage was accomplished by partial hydrolysis at low pH at Asp residues, combined with digestion by endoproteinase Glu-C. Peptides were separated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) directly coupled to electrospray ionization and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry to provide the high mass accuracy required for unambiguous nomination of candidate disulfide-linked peptides (given the large number of theoretical disulfide-linked combinations that exists with the chosen cleavage steps from a protein as complicated as Gas2p (22de Koning L.J. Kasper P.T. Back J.W. Nessen M.A. Vanrobaeys F. Van Beeumen J. Gherardi E. de Koster C.G. de Jong L. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). To identify linear peptides for internal calibration of the FTICR mass spectrometer, the peptide sample is first subjected to LC and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The MS/MS data are also used to validate the structures of candidate disulfide-linked peptides as revealed by accurate mass measurement. Disulfide linkages in peptides with two disulfide bonds are identified by mass spectrometry after partial reduction of disulfide bonds, cyanylation of Cys residues, and peptide bond cleavage at cyanylated residues. Alkylation and Digestion—One part of a solution containing 1.2 m iodoacetamide, 6 m guanidinium HCl, and 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, was added to 4 parts of a solution containing 0.75 mg/ml sGas2p, 6 m guanidinium chloride, and 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0. The pH was raised to 8 by addition of a solution of 1.2 m ammonium bicarbonate in 6 m guanidinium HCl to obtain a final concentration of 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the reaction mixture was dialyzed against water in six washes at 6 °C using an Ultrafree-0.5 centrifugal filter-type device Biomax-10 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The protein (2 mg/ml) was cleaved at the Asp residues by incubation in 15 mm HCl for 2 h at 108 °C (23Inglis A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). For subsequent enzymatic digestion, the peptide mixture was brought to pH 7 with a sodium phosphate buffer (final concentration 25 mm) and digested overnight with sequencing grade endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Applied Science) at a protease:substrate ratio of 1:30 (w/w). For reduction and alkylation, the peptides were treated with 5 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8, for 1 h at 56 °C followed by addition of 20 mm iodoacetamide (final concentration) and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. Peptide samples were either diluted to an equivalent of 0.2–2 pmol of protein/μl in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid prior to LC/MS or LC/MS/MS or directly subjected to reversed-phase HPLC on aC12 column. sGas1-ΔSer was cleaved at Asp in the same way as sGas2p. After cleavage the pH was raised to 6.5 with 50 mm PIPES buffer, and free cysteines were modified with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Gas1p peptides were collected on Zip-Tips μC18 pipette tips (Millipore, Billerica, MA), washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with a solution containing 50% v/v acetonitrile and 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid. Reversed-phase HPLC—A Jupiter Proteo C12 column (inner diameter 2 mm, length 150 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) was operated on a SMART system with a fraction collector (Amersham Biosciences). A constant flow rate of 50 μl/min was maintained. After injection of the sample, the column was rinsed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) for 9 min. Peptides were eluted by applying a linear gradient to 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B) over 75 min. Absorbance of the effluent was continuously recorded at 214, 254, and 280 nm. Fractions of 50 μl were collected, beginning 24 min after the start of the gradient. Partial Reduction, Cyanylation, and Cleavage—Peptides in HPLC fractions were partially reduced in a medium containing 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (BioVectra, Oxford, CT) and 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 3, for 15 min at room temperature (24Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Nakagawa S. Tamakashi Y. Hamana T. Kawase M. Taketomi S. Ishibashi Y. Nishimura O. Fukada T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 5513-5514Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Then 10 mm 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP) (Sigma) in 0.1 m acetic acid was added to cyanylate cysteine residues. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Addition of CDAP also instantaneously inactivates TCEP under these conditions (26Wu J. Watson J.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 194: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of cyanylated peptides was accomplished by adding 1 m ammonia and incubation at room temperature for 1 h (24Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Reaction was stopped by the addition of 4.5 parts of 2.4% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid before analysis by LC/MS on a QTOF mass spectrometer. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra were analyzed with Virtualmslab to identify candidate disulfide-linked and linear peptides from sGas1-ΔSer and sGas2p. virtualmslab can perform multistage virtual experiments, in any user-defined order, with mass spectrometric analyses. The virtual experimental results are used to generate MS reference data bases that can be matched with the real MS data obtained from the equivalent real experiment (22de Koning L.J. Kasper P.T. Back J.W. Nessen M.A. Vanrobaeys F. Van Beeumen J. Gherardi E. de Koster C.G. de Jong L. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The settings for a quest for disulfide-linked peptides containing one disulfide bond or for linear peptides in sGas2p were as follows: cleavage at N-terminal and C-terminal peptide bonds at Asp with up to four missed cleavages allowed, cleavage at the C-terminal peptide bond at Glu, except at Glu-Pro, with up to one missed cleavage allowed; free cysteines modified by iodoacetamide. For sGas1-ΔSer the settings were as follows: cleavage at Asp, optional conversion of Asn to Asp (as a result of deglycosylation by PNGaseF), and cleavage at newly formed Asp, up to four missed cleavages at Asp allowed; free cysteines modified by N-ethylmaleimide. Peptides were separated on a reversed-phase C18 PepMap analytical column (inner diameter 75 μm, length 150 mm) operated on an Ultimate nano-LC system (LC Packings Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min using a gradient of 1–50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. The eluate was directly electrosprayed in a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters) operating in MS-alone mode or in data-dependent MS/MS mode. Fragmentation was conducted with argon as collision gas at a pressure of 4 × 10–5 bars. Tandem mass spectrometric spectra were processed with the MaxEnt3 algorithm embedded in Masslynx Proteinlynx (Waters) software to generate peak lists used to search the S. cerevisiae mass spectrometry protein sequence data base (MSDB, Imperial College, London, UK) using the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK). Peptide mass tolerance and fragment mass tolerance were set at 0.2 Da, and cleavage at each peptide bond was allowed. Gas2p peptides cleaved at Asp or Glu thus identified were used as internal calibrants for mass spectra acquired with FTICR mass spectrometry (see below). Analysis of MS/MS spectra of candidate disulfide-linked precursor ions was supported by the Biolynx tool of the Masslynx software by editing one cysteine-containing candidate peptide as a modification on the cysteine residue of the other candidate and vice versa. Theoretical possible fragments were predicted and compared with the raw data. LC/electrospray ionization/FTICR-MS data were acquired with an ApexQ Fourier transforms ion cyclotron mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a 7T magnet and a CombiSource™. The mass spectrometer was coupled to a 200-μm inner diameter, 750-mm long monolithic reverse phase column (GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan) operated on an Ultimate 2000 HPLC system at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. Following injection of the sample (1 μl), a linear solvent gradient was applied in 30 min from 100% H2O, 0.1% formic acid to 50% H2O, 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, during which about 600 high resolution mass spectra were recorded. Mass calibration was accomplished using LC-QTOF-MS/MS validated peptides as internal calibrants, resulting in a mass accuracy of better then 2 ppm over the complete MS data set. Mass spectra were charge-deconvoluted, and the resulting data set composed of 308 peptide ion chromatograms with corresponding masses and retention times was imported in the virtualmslab program. Tandem mass spectrometry data on the FTICR mass spectrometer were acquired with off-line nano-electrospray using a 2-μl sample in a nano-electrospray needle with a 2-μm (inner diameter) tip (New Objectives, Woburn, MA). Multiple charged peptides were mass selected in the quadrupole sector and then accelerated with 12 V into the hexapole collision cell for collisional dissociation at an argon pressure of about 5 × 10–6 mbars (pressure gauge reading). The resulting fragment ions were accumulated for 2 s and then extracted from the collision cell and injected into the ICR cell for mass analysis. Matrix-assisted laser ionization/desorption-FTICR mass analysis was performed as described previously (22de Koning L.J. Kasper P.T. Back J.W. Nessen M.A. Vanrobaeys F. Van Beeumen J.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant Gas Proteins—pHIL-S1-derived plasmids, linearized with BglII, were transformed into Pichia pastoris strain GS115 (his4), and the selection of His+Muts mutants and protein induction were performed as described previously (27Carotti C.

Large scale purification of His6-tagged Gas1 proteins by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography was performed under native conditions. About 400 ml of the culture supernatant was concentrated to 1/10th of the original volume by ultrafiltration through a Millipore regenerated cellulose membrane (cutoff 30,000). The concentrated fraction was dialyzed against Lysis Buffer (LB) (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl) at 4 °C overnight. Two ml of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (1 ml of resin (Qiagen) plus 1 ml of LB) was added to the dialyzed fraction and left at 4 °C for 1 h (27Carotti C. Ragni E. Palomares O. Fontaine T. Tedeschi G. Rodriguez R. Latge J.P. Vai M. Popolo L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3635-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) under gentle agitation. A mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) was added at each step. Then the mixture was loaded onto a column (1 × 10 cm, Econo Bio-Rad column) and washed twice with 16 ml of Wash Buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 3–5 mm imidazole). To elute the protein, the column was washed four times with 1 ml of Elution Buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole). The column flow-through, wash, and elution fractions were collected, and protein content was determined by the dye reagent protein assay (Bio-Rad). Deletion Analysis—Recombinant plasmids for integrative recombination in P. pastoris were generated by cloning BamHI/XhoI-digested PCR fragments into the corresponding sites of the expression vector, pHIL-S1, to obtain in-frame fusion with the secretion signal of the P. pastoris PHO1 gene. The plasmid pXH, carrying the full coding sequence of the GAS1 gene, was used as template for PCR amplifications (28Vai M. Gatti E. Lacana E. Popolo L. Alberghina L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12242-12248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The His6-tagged soluble forms, Gas1-Δ8Cys and Gas1-ΔL, were obtained using the forward primer XHup (5′-GCATATTCGACTGACTCGAGAACGATGTTCCAGCGATTGAA-3′) and the reverse primers Δ8Cys-rev (5′-ATCGTCCTCAGGATCCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGCCTCCGTTTGGAGT-3′) or ΔL-rev (5′-ATCGTCCTCAGGATCCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTGTGTTGGCGGAAGTTGG-3′), respectively. XHup is complementary to nucleotides +68 to +87 of the coding region of GAS1 and has an XhoI site incorporated (underlined). Δ8Cys-rev and ΔL-rev are complementary to nucleotides +1090 to +1104 and to nucleotides +990 to + 1008, respectively. These primers have an in-frame His6 coding sequence (shown in italics), a TAA stop codon (shown in boldface), and a BamHI site (underlined). The plasmid G2, carrying the full coding sequence of the GAS2 (17Ragni E. Fontaine T. Gissi C. Latge J.P. Popolo L. Yeast. 2007; 24: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was used as template for PCR amplifications. The His6-tagged soluble form, Gas2-Δ8Cys, was obtained using the forward primer Gas2-XhoI (5′-AGCATATTCGACTGACTCGAGGTGTCAGCTTTGAAAAAACC-3′) and the reverse primer Gas2-ΔCys-rev (5′-ATCGTCCTCGGATCCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGCTTCTATCAGGTGTTT-3′). Primer Gas2-XhoI is complementary to nucleotides +78 to +99 of the coding region of GAS2 and has an XhoI site incorporated (underlined). Gas2-Δ8Cys-rev is complementary to nucleotides +1148 to +1164 and has an in-frame His6 coding sequence (shown in italics), a TAA stop codon (shown in boldface), and a BamHI site (underlined). Different recombinant plasmids for the expression and secretion of His6-tagged forms of the 8Cys-box of Gas1p in P. pastoris were derived from the pHILS-1 or PICZαA vectors (Invitrogen). Three constructs were obtained as follows: (i) from Asn366 to Gly486; (ii) from Ala357 to Gly486; and (iii) from Ala350 to Asp482. Oligonucleotide sequences used for PCR amplifications are available upon request. Plasmid DNA was purified using commercial purification kits (Qiagen). DNA sequencing was used to confirm the correct fusions and the absence of undesired mutations throughout the coding sequence (BMR Genomics, Università di Padova, Padova, Italy). Standard procedures using lithium acetate were used for yeast transformation. Mutagenesis of Cys348—The mutant GPI-anchored form Gas1-C348S was constructed by a PCR-based cassette mutagenesis. A fragment of GAS1 gene was amplified using the primer pair Gas1Prom (5′-TCGAGCTCGAAGGAATCTTCCAACCT-3′), complementary to nucleotides –597 to –580 from the start codon, and C348SG1R (5′-TACTTACCAGTAGCTGGACTAGCAACATCACTTGTTGTT-3′), complementary to nucleotides +1041 to +1003. Gas1Prom has a SacI site (underlined), whereas C348SG1R has a Van91I site (underlined) and a serine codon (in boldface) instead of the Cys348 codon (TGT). Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) was used for the amplification from yeast genomic DNA. The mutant fragment of the GAS1 gene was cloned into the PCRII-TOPO-GAS1 plasmid harboring the wild-type GAS1 (–597/+2024) and previously digested with SacI/Van91I to remove the 5′ part of the GAS1 gene. The resulting plasmid (PCRII-TOPO-GAS1C348S) was SacI/BamHI-digested to excise the GAS1-C348S mutant gene and clone it into the SacI/BamHI-digested YCplac33 yeast single copy vector. The plasmid was used to transform the WB2d (gas1::LEU2) strain of S. cerevisiae. As a control, the same strain was transformed with the wild-type GAS1 gene cloned in the same vector (–597/+2024 fragment). Enzyme Assays—β(1,3)-Endoglucanase activity was measured by the reducing sugar assay using the p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide reagent with borohydride-reduced laminarin (5Hartland R.P. Fontaine T. Debeaupuis J.P. Simenel C. Delepierre M. Latge J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26843-26849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The purified protein fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, at 4 °C, and 10 μg of purified protein was incubated with 40 μl of reduced laminarin (10 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, in a final volume of 0.5 ml. At different times, 50 μl of the reaction mixtures were withdrawn and kept at 4 °C. Then 950 μl of p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide solution was added to the samples and to the glucose standards. After 10 min of boiling the absorbance at 405 nm was measured. To test for β(1,3)-glucanosyltransferase activity, 1–1.5 μg of the purified protein were incubated with 3 mm reduced laminarioligosaccharide containing 13 glucose residues (rG13), and the assay was performe"

https://openalex.org/W2034672660,"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare, recessively inherited genetic disease characterized by skin cancer proneness and premature aging in photoexposed area. The disease results from defective nucleotide excision repair of ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA lesions. Reconstruction of group C (XP-C) skin in vitro previously suggested that patients' dermal fibroblasts might be involved in promoting skin cancer development, as they elicited microinvasions of both control and XP-C keratinocytes within dermal equivalents. Here we show that in the absence of UV exposure XP-C fibroblasts exhibit aged-like features such as an elongated and dendritic shape. We analysed the repertoire of expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) involved in skin aging and cancer. All XP-C fibroblasts tested in this study overexpressed specifically and significantly MMP1. MMP1 expression was also found increased in the dermis of XP-C skin sections suggesting the active contribution of XP-C mesenchymal cells to skin aging and exacerbated carcinogenesis. Increased MMP1 expression in cultured XP-C fibroblasts resulted from MMP1 mRNA accumulation and enhanced transcriptional activity of the MMP1 gene promoter. Deletion analysis revealed the essential role of AP-1 activation in constitutive MMP1 overexpression in XP-C primary fibroblasts. In parallel, levels of reactive oxygen species and FOSB DNA-binding activity were found increased in XP-C fibroblasts. Altogether, these observations suggest that beyond its role in nucleotide excision repair the XPC protein may be important in cell metabolism and fate in the absence of UV."

https://openalex.org/W2012195094,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-encoded viral FLICE inhibitory protein K13 interacts with a cytosolic IκB kinase (IKK) complex to activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). We recently reported that K13 antagonizes KSHV lytic regulator RTA (replication and transcription activator) and blocks lytic replication, but spares RTA-induced viral interleukin-6 (vIL6). Here we report that K13 is also present in the nuclear compartment, a property not shared by its structural homologs. K13 interacts with and activates the nuclear IKK complex, and binds to the IκBα promoter. K13 mutants that are retained in the cytosol lack NF-κB activity. However, neither the IKKs nor NF-κB activation is required for nuclear localization of K13. Instead, this ability is dependent on a nuclear localization signal located in its N-terminal 40 amino acids. Finally, K13, along with p65/RelA, binds to the promoters of a number of KSHV lytic genes, including RTA, ORF57 and vGPCR, but not to the promoter of the vIL6 gene. Thus, K13 has an unexpected nuclear role in viral and cellular gene regulation and its differential binding to the promoters of lytic genes may not only contribute to the inhibition of KSHV lytic replication, but may also account for the escape of vIL6 from K13-induced transcriptional suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2028958945,"t(8;21)(q22;q22) results in the AML1-ETO (A1E) fusion gene and is a common cytogenetic abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although insertions at the breakpoint region of the A1E fusion transcripts have been reported, additional structural alterations are largely uncharacterized. By RT–PCR amplifications and DNA sequencing, numerous in-frame and out-of-frame AML1b-ETO and AML1c-ETO transcripts were identified in 13 pediatric t(8;21) AMLs, likely resulting from alternate splicing, internal deletions and/or breakpoint region insertions involving both the AML1 (RUNX1) and ETO regions. The in-frame A1E fusion transcript forms represented minor forms. These structure alterations were found in AML1c-ETO but not AML1b-ETO transcripts in two adult t(8;21) AMLs. Although no analogous alterations were detected in native AML1b transcripts, identical alterations in native ETO transcripts were identified. When transfected into HeLa cells, only AML1b, and not the in-frame A1E forms, transactivated the GM-CSF promoter. In co-transfection experiments, the effects of A1E proteins on GM-CSF transactivation by AML1b ranged from repressive to activating. Our results demonstrate a remarkable and unprecedented heterogeneity in A1E fusion transcripts in t(8;21) myeloblasts and suggest that synthesis of alternate A1E transcript and protein forms can significantly impact the regulation of AML1 responsive genes."
https://openalex.org/W2075983323,"Nearly all members of a widespread family of bacterial transposable elements related to insertion sequence 3 (IS3), therefore called the IS3 family, very likely use programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting to produce their transposase, a protein required for mobility. Comparative analysis of the potential frameshift signals in this family suggested that most of the insertion sequences from the IS51 group contain in their mRNA an elaborate pseudoknot that could act as a recoding stimulator. It results from a specific intramolecular interaction between an apical loop and an internal loop from two stem-loop structures. Directed mutagenesis, chemical probing, and gel mobility assays of the frameshift region of one element from the IS51 group, IS3411, provided clear evidences of the existence of the predicted structure. Modeling was used to generate a three-dimensional molecular representation of the apical loop-internal loop complex. We could demonstrate that mutations affecting the stability of the structure reduce both frameshifting and transposition, thus establishing the biological importance of this new type of RNA structure for the control of transposition level."
