https://openalex.org/W3165260738,"The magnitude and nature of the COVID-19 pandemic prevents public health policies from relying on coercive enforcement. Practicing social distancing, wearing masks and staying at home becomes voluntary and conditional on the behavior of others. We present the results of a large-scale survey experiment in nine countries with representative samples of the population. We find that both empirical expectations (what others do) and normative expectations (what others approve of) play a significant role in compliance, beyond the effect of any other individual or group characteristic. In our vignette experiment, respondents evaluate the likelihood of compliance with social distancing and staying at home of someone similar to them in a hypothetical scenario. When empirical and normative expectations of individuals are high, respondents’ evaluation of the vignette’s character’s compliance likelihood goes up by 55% (relative to the low expectations condition). Similar results are obtained when looking at self-reported compliance among those with high expectations. Our results are moderated by individuals’ trust in government and trust in science. Holding expectations high, the effect of trusting science is substantial and significant in our vignette experiment (22% increase in compliance likelihood), and even larger in self-reported compliance (76% and 127% increase before and after the lockdown). By contrast, trusting the government only generates modest effects. At the aggregate level, the country-level trust in science, and not in government, becomes a strong predictor of compliance."
https://openalex.org/W3164304829,"Introduction Misinformation surrounding COVID-19 poses a global public health problem that adversely affects governments’ abilities to mitigate the disease and causes accidental deaths and self-harm due to false beliefs about the virus, prevention measures, vaccines and cures. We aim to examine the relationship between exposure to and trust in COVID-19 news (from Television, social media, interpersonal communication) and information sources (healthcare experts, government, clerics) and belief in COVID-19 myths and false information, as well as critical verification practices before posting on social media. Methods We use a cross-sectional researcher-administered phone survey of adults living in Lebanon between March 27 and April 23, 2020. Results The sample included 56.1% men and 43.9% women, 37.9% with a university degree, 63.0% older than 30, and 7% with media literacy training. Those who trust COVID-19 news from social media [95%CI:(1.05–1.52)] and interpersonal communication [95%CI:(1.25–1.82)], and those who trust information from clerics [95%CI:(1.25–1.82)] were more likely to believe in COVID-19 myths and false information. University graduates [95%CI:(0.25–0.51)] and those who trust information from government [95%CI:(0.65–0.89] were less likely to believe in myths and false information. Those who believe in COVID-19 myths and false information [95%CI:(0.25–0.70)] were less likely to engage in critical social media posting practices. Only those who underwent media literacy training [95%CI:(1.24–6.55)] were more likely to engage in critical social media posting practices. Conclusion Higher education and trust in information from government contributed to decreasing belief in COVID-19 myths and false information. Trust in news from social media, interpersonal communication and clerics contributed to increasing belief in COVID-19 myths and false information, which in turn contributed to less critical social media posting practices, thereby exacerbated the infodemic. Media literacy training contributed to increasing critical social media posting practices, thereby played a role in mitigating the infodemic."
https://openalex.org/W3164587385,"The spread of antibiotic resistance is closely related with selective pressure in the environment. Wastewater from industrialized regions is characterized by higher concentrations of these pollutants than sewage from less industrialized areas. The aim of this study was to compare the concentrations of contaminants such as antibiotics and heavy metals (HMs), and to evaluate their impact on the spread of genes encoding resistance to antimicrobial drugs in samples of wastewater, sewage sludge and river water in two regions with different levels of industrialization. The factors exerting selective pressure, which significantly contributed to the occurrence of the examined antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), were identified. The concentrations of selected gene copy numbers conferring resistance to four groups of antibiotics as well as class 1 and 2 integron-integrase genes were determined in the analyzed samples. The concentrations of six HMs and antibiotics corresponding to genes mediated resistance from 3 classes were determined. Based on network analysis, only some of the analyzed antibiotics correlated with ARGs, while HM levels were correlated with ARG concentrations, which can confirm the important role of HMs in promoting drug resistance. The samples from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located an industrialized region were characterized by higher HM contamination and a higher number of significant correlations between the analyzed variables than the samples collected from a WWTP located in a less industrialized region. These results indicated that treated wastewater released into the natural environment can pose a continuous threat to human health by transferring ARGs, antibiotics and HMs to the environment. These findings shed light on the impact of industrialization on antibiotic resistance dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W3164613822,"Regional analgesia is worth performing in the multimodal postoperative management of hip fracture (HF) because it reduces hospital morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and side effects of the recently described ""Pericapsular Nerve Group (PENG) Block"" with those of the femoral block, which is considered the standard of care for postoperative pain control after femoral neck fracture.We conducted a comparative observational study at a university hospital (Saint Antoine Hospital, Sorbonne University, Paris, France), where the PENG block was introduced in August 2019. We include all patients from June to October 2019, who were coming for femoral neck fractures and who had an analgesic femoral block or PENG block before their surgery. The primary outcome was the comparison of cumulative postoperative morphine consumption 48 hours after surgery.Demographics, medical charts, and perioperative data of 42 patients were reviewed: 21 patients before (Femoral group) and 21 patients after the introduction of PENG block (PENG group) in clinical practice. Thirteen total hip arthroplasties (THA) and eight hemi arthroplasties (HA) were included in each group. Demographics were also comparable. The median, postoperative, morphine equivalent consumption at 48 hours was 10 [0-20] mg and 20 [0-50] mg in Femoral and PENG groups respectively (p = 0.458). No statistically significant differences were found in postoperative pain intensity, time to ambulation, incidence of morphine-related side effects, or length of hospital stay. The postoperative muscle strength of the quadriceps was greater in the PENG group than in the Femoral group (5/5 vs. 2/5, p = 0.001).In the management of hip fractures, PENG block is not associated in our study with a significant change in postoperative morphine consumption, compared to femoral block. However, it does significantly improve the immediate mobility of the operated limb, making it appropriate for inclusion in enhanced recovery programs after surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3164026940,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous organic compounds associated with chronic disease in epidemiologic studies, though the contribution of PAH exposure on fatal outcomes in the U.S. is largely unknown.We investigated urinary hydroxylated PAH metabolites (OH-PAHs) with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a representative sample of the U.S. population.Study participants were ≥20 years old from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2014. Concentrations (nmol/L) of eight OH-PAHs from four parent PAHs (naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, pyrene) were measured in spot urine samples at examination. We identified all-cause, cancer-specific, and cardiovascular-specific deaths through 2015 using the National Death Index. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between ΣOH-PAHs and mortality endpoints. We assessed potential heterogeneity by age, gender, smoking status, poverty, and race/ethnicity. Additionally, we examined the overall mixture effect using quantile g-computation.In 9,739 eligible participants, there were 934 all-cause deaths, 159 cancer-specific deaths, and 108 cardiovascular-specific deaths (median 6.75 years follow-up). A log10 increase in ΣOH-PAHs was associated with higher all-cause mortality (HRadj = 1.39 [95%CI: 1.21, 1.61]), and possibly cancer-specific mortality (HRadj = 1.15 [95%CI: 0.79, 1.69]), and cardiovascular-specific mortality (HRadj = 1.49 [95%CI: 0.94, 2.33]). We observed substantial effect modification by age, smoking status, gender, and race/ethnicity across mortality endpoints. Risk of cardiovascular mortality was higher for non-Hispanic blacks and those in poverty, indicating potential disparities. Quantile g-computation joint associations for a simultaneous quartile increase in OH-PAHs were HRadj = 1.15 [95%CI: 1.02, 1.31], HRadj = 1.41 [95%CI: 1.05, 1.90], and HRadj = 0.98 [95%CI: 0.66, 1.47] for all-cause, cancer-specific, and cardiovascular-specific mortalities, respectively.Our results support a role for total PAH exposure in all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the U.S. population."
https://openalex.org/W3164139333,"Agri-food systems are besieged by malnutrition, yield gaps, and climate vulnerability, but integrated, research-based responses in public policy, agricultural, value chains, and finance are constrained by short-termism and zero sum thinking. As they respond to current and emerging agri-food system challenges, decision makers need new tools that steer toward multi-sector, evidence-based collaboration. To support national agri-food system policy processes, the Integrated Agri-food System Initiative (IASI) methodology was developed and validated through case studies in Mexico and Colombia. This holistic, multi-sector methodology builds on diverse existing data resources and leverages situation analysis, modeled predictions, and scenarios to synchronize public and private action at the national level toward sustainable, equitable, and inclusive agri-food systems. Culminating in collectively agreed strategies and multi-partner tactical plans, the IASI methodology enabled a multi-level systems approach by mobilizing design thinking to foster mindset shifts and stakeholder consensus on sustainable and scalable innovations that respond to real-time dynamics in complex agri-food systems. To build capacity for these types of integrated, context-specific approaches, greater investment is needed in supportive international institutions that function as trusted in-region 'innovation brokers.' This paper calls for a structured global network to advance adaptation and evolution of essential tools like the IASI methodology in support of the One CGIAR mandate and in service of positive agri-food systems transformation."
https://openalex.org/W3164305957,"The 2016 WHO Standards for improving quality of maternal and newborn care in health facilities established patient experience of care as a core indicator of quality. Global health experts have described loss of autonomy and disrespect as mistreatment. Risk of disrespect and abuse is higher when patient and care provider opinions differ, but little is known about service users experiences when declining aspects of their maternity care.To address this gap, we present a qualitative content analysis of 1540 written accounts from 892 service users declining or refusing care options throughout childbearing with a large, geographically representative sample (2900) of childbearing women in British Columbia who participated in an online survey with open-ended questions eliciting care experiences.Four themes are presented: 1) Contentious interactions: ""I fought my entire way"", describing interactions as fraught with tension and recounting stories of ""fighting"" for the right to refuse a procedure/intervention; 2) Knowledge as control or as power: ""like I was a dim girl"", both for providers as keepers of medical knowledge and for clients when they felt knowledgeable about procedures/interventions; 3) Morbid threats: ""do you want your baby to die?"", coercion or extreme pressure from providers when clients declined interventions; 4) Compliance as valued: ""to be a 'good client'"", recounting compliance or obedience to medical staff recommendations as valuable social capital but suppressing desire to ask questions or decline care.We conclude that in situations where a pregnant person declines recommended treatment, or requests treatment that a care provider does not support, tension and strife may ensue. These situations deprioritize and decenter a woman's autonomy and preferences, leading care providers and the culture of care away from the principles of respect and person-centred care."
https://openalex.org/W3165260306,"Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) with reported incidence rates up to 45% contributes substantially to overall morbidity. In this study, we conducted a retrospective evaluation of POPF along with its potential perioperative clinical risk factors and its effect on tumor recurrence.Clinical data on patients who had received pancreatoduodenectomy (PD), distal pancreatectomy (DP), or duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (DPPHR) were prospectively collected between 2007 and 2016. A Picrosirius red staining score was developed to enable morphological classification of the resection margin of the pancreatic stump. The primary end point was the development of major complications. The secondary end points were overall and recurrence-free survival.340 patients underwent pancreatic resection including 222 (65.3%) PD, 87 (25.6%) DP, and 31 (9.1%) DPPHR. Postoperative major complications were observed in 74 patients (21.8%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, POPF correlated with body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.025), prolonged stay in hospital (p<0.001), high Picrosirius red staining score (p = 0.049), and elevated postoperative levels of amylase or lipase in drain fluid (p≤0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified UICC stage (p<0.001), tumor differentiation (p<0.001), depth of invasion (p = 0.001), nodal invasion (p = 0.001), and the incidence of POPF grades B and C (p = 0.006) as independent prognostic markers of recurrence-free survival.Besides the known clinicopathological risk factors BMI and amylase in the drain fluid, the incidence of POPF correlates with high Picrosirius red staining score in the resection margins of the pancreatic stumps of curatively resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Furthermore, clinically relevant POPF seems to be a prognostic factor for tumor recurrence in PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W3164734043,"Chronic inflammation is a primary risk factor for chronic metabolic disease and may be triggered by a ""leaky gut."" Several biomarkers have been recognized to indicate intestinal permeability (i.e., leaky gut) and bacterial translocation. Nonetheless, which of these biomarkers exhibit the highest correlation with metabolic health parameters remains unclear. Hence, this study aimed to explore the correlation between leaky gut-related markers and metabolic health.Based on waist circumference, plasma fasting glucose, plasma gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and plasma LDL cholesterol, two groups of 40 subjects with the most extreme metabolic health profiles were selected from the NQplus cohort study (n = 2048), which was previously conducted by the Wageningen University's Division of Human Nutrition. Eight potential leaky gut-related markers were selected from the literature and measured in serum or EDTA plasma samples of these selected individuals. These samples were also obtained from the NQplus cohort study.From the leaky gut markers, levels of zonulin, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, soluble CD14, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, and peptidoglycan were significantly higher in individuals with unhealthy metabolic profiles (p<0.05). No differences in EndoCAb IgM, EndoCAb IgA, and EndoCAb IgG were observed between healthy and unhealthy individuals. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that zonulin was substantially associated with metabolic health parameters such as BMI, blood glucose, triglyceride, GGT, and C-reactive protein levels. C-reactive protein, an inflammation marker, showed the most pronounced association with zonulin.Biomarkers that link a leaky gut and subsequent bacterial translocation to metabolic health were identified in this study. Especially zonulin may aid in monitoring a leaky gut and detecting individuals at risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3165165079,"Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are associated to social attention (SA) impairments. A gaze bias to non-social objects over faces has been proposed as an early marker of ASD. This bias may be related to the concomitant circumscribed interests (CI), which question the role of competing objects in this atypical visual behavior. The aim of this study was to compare visual attention patterns to social and non-social images in young children with ASD and matched typical controls (N = 36; age range 41-73 months) assessing the role of emotion in facial stimuli and the type of competing object. A paired preference task was designed pairing happy, angry, and neutral faces with two types of objects (related or not related to autism CI). Eye tracking data were collected, and three indexes were considered as dependent variables: prioritization (attentional orientation), preference, and duration (sustained attention). Results showed that both groups had similar visual pattern to faces (prioritization, more attention and longer visits to faces paired with objects non-related to their CI); however, the ASD group attended to faces significantly less than controls. Children with ASD showed an emotional bias (late orientation to angry faces and typical preference for happy faces). Finally, objects related to their CI captured attention in both groups, significantly reducing SA in children with ASD. Atypical SA is present in young children with ASD regardless the competing non-social object. Identifying strengths and difficulties in SA in this population may have substantial repercussion for early diagnosis, intervention, and ultimately prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3165717023,"The purpose of this work is to propose a workflow that couples experimental and computational activities aimed at developing a credible digital twin of a commercial coronary bioresorbable vascular scaffold when direct access to data about material mechanical properties is not possible. Such a situation is be faced when the manufacturer is not involved in the study, thus directly investigating the actual device is the only source of information available. The object of the work is the Fantom® Encore polymeric stent (REVA Medical) made of Tyrocore™. Four devices were purchased and used in mechanical tests that are easily reproducible in any mechanical laboratory, i.e. free expansion and uniaxial tension testing, the latter performed with protocols that emphasized the rate-dependent properties of the polymer. Given the complexity of the mechanical behaviour observed experimentally, it was chosen to use the Parallel Rehological Framework material model, already used in the literature to describe the behaviour of other polymers, such as PLLA. Calibration of the material model was based on simulations that replicate the tensile test performed on the device. Given the high number of material parameters, a plan of simulations was done to find the most suitable set, varying each parameter value in a feasible range and considering a single repetitive unit of the stent, neglecting residual stresses generated by crimping and expansion. This strategy resulted in a significant reduction of computational cost. The performance of the set of parameters thus identified was finally evaluated considering the whole delivery system, by comparing the experimental results with the data collected simulating free expansion and uniaxial tension testing. Moreover, radial force testing was numerically performed and compared with literature data. The obtained results demonstrated the effectiveness of the digital twin development pipeline, a path applicable to any commercial device whose geometric structure is based on repetitive units."
https://openalex.org/W3164394158,"Brassica rapa is an important leafy vegetable that can potentially accumulate high concentrations of cadmium (Cd), posing a risk to human health. The aim of the present study was to identify cadmium detoxifying molecular mechanisms in B. rapa using a functional cloning strategy. A cDNA library constructed from roots of B. rapa plants treated with Cd was transformed into the Cd sensitive yeast mutant strain DTY167 that lacks the yeast cadmium factor (YCF1), and resistant yeast clones were selected on Cd containing media. Two hundred genes potentially conferring cadmium resistance were rescued from the surviving yeast clones and sequenced. Sequencing analysis revealed that genes encoding for metallothionein (MT)1, MT2a, MT2b and MT3, and phytochelatin synthase (PCS)1 and PCS2 accounted for 35.5%, 28.5%, 4%, 11.3%, 18.7% and 2%, respectively of the genes identified. MTs and PCSs expressing DTY167 cells showed resistance to Cd as well as to Zn. PCS1 expressing yeast cells were also more resistant to Pb compared to those expressing MTs or PCS2. RT-PCR results showed that Cd treatment strongly induced the expression levels of MTs in the root and shoot. Furthermore, the different MTs and PCSs exhibited tissue specific expression. The results indicate that MTs and PCS genes potentially play a central role in detoxifying Cd and other toxic metals in B. rapa."
https://openalex.org/W3164085767,"Indonesia faces a growing informal sector in the wake of implementing a national social health insurance system—Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN)—that supersedes the vertical programmes historically tied to informal employment. Sustainably financing coverage for informal workers requires incentivising enrolment for those never insured and recovering enrolment among those who once paid but no longer do so. This study aims to assess the ability- and willingness-to-pay of informal sector workers who have stopped paying the JKN premium for at least six months, across districts of different fiscal capacity, and explore which factors shaped their willingness and ability to pay using qualitative interviews. Surveys were conducted for 1,709 respondents in 2016, and found that informal workers’ average ability and willingness to pay fell below the national health insurance scheme’s premium amount, even as many currently spend more than this on healthcare costs. There were large groups for whom the costs of the premium were prohibitive (38%) or, alternatively, they were both technically willing and able to pay (25%). As all individuals in the sample had once paid for insurance, their main reasons for lapsing were based on the uncertain income of informal workers and their changing needs. The study recommends a combination of strategies of targeting of subsidies, progressive premium setting, facilitating payment collection, incentivising insurance package upgrades and socialising the benefits of health insurance in informal worker communities."
https://openalex.org/W3165292831,"A dysphagia diet is important for patients with stroke to help manage their nutritional state and prevent aspiration pneumonia. Tongue pressure measurement is a simple, non-invasive, and objective method for diagnosing dysphagia. We hypothesized that tongue pressure may be useful in making a choice of diet for patients with acute stroke. Using balloon-type equipment, tongue pressure was measured in 80 patients with acute stroke. On admission, a multidisciplinary swallowing team including doctors, nurses, speech therapists, and management dietitians evaluated and decided on the possibility of oral intake and diet form; the tongue pressure was unknown to the team. Diet form was defined and classified as dysphagia diet Codes 0 to 4 and normal form (Code 5 in this study) according to the 2013 Japanese Dysphagia Diet Criteria. In multivariate analysis, only tongue pressure was significantly associated with the dysphagia diet form (p<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that the optimal cutoff tongue pressure for predicting diet Codes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 was 3.6 (p<0.001, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.997), 9.6 (p<0.001, AUC = 0.973), 12.8 (p<0.001, AUC = 0.963), 16.5 (p<0.001, AUC = 0.979), and 17.3 kPa (p<0.001, AUC = 0.982), respectively. Tongue pressure is one of the sensitive indicators for choosing dysphagia diet forms in patients with acute stroke. A combination of simple modalities will increase the accuracy of the swallowing assessment and choice of the diet form."
https://openalex.org/W3165304814,"Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) is a rare but potentially life-threatening event due to massive hemorrhage. Placenta previa and previous cesarean section are major risk factors for PAS. Italy holds one of the highest rates of primary and repeated cesarean section in Europe; nonetheless, there is a paucity of high-quality Italian data on PAS. The aim of this paper was to estimate the prevalence of PAS in Italy and to evaluate its associated factors, ante- and intra-partum management, and perinatal outcomes. Also, since severe morbidity and mortality in Italy show a North-South gradient, we assessed and compared perinatal outcomes of women with PAS according to the geographical area of delivery.This was a prospective population-based study using the Italian Obstetric Surveillance System (ItOSS) and including all women aged 15-50 years with a diagnosis of PAS between September 2014 and August 2016. Six Italian regions were involved in the study project, covering 49% of the national births. Cases were prospectively reported by a trained clinician for each participating maternity unit by electronic data collection forms. The background population comprised all women who delivered in the participating regions during the study period.A cohort of 384 women with PAS was identified from a source population of 458 995 maternities for a prevalence of 0.84/1000 (95% CI, 0.75-0.92). Antenatal suspicion was present in 50% of patients, who showed reduced rates of blood transfusion compared to unsuspected patients (65.6% versus 79.7%, P = 0.003). Analyses by geographical area showed higher rates of both concomitant placenta previa and prior CS (62.1% vs 28.7%, P<0.0001) and antenatal suspicion (61.7% vs 28.7%, P<0.0001) in women in Southern compared to Northern Italy. Also, these women had lower rates of hemorrhage ≥2000 mL (29.6% vs 51.2%, P<0.0001), blood transfusion (64.5% vs 87.5%, P = 0.001), and severe maternal morbidity (5.0% vs 11.1%, P = 0.036). Delivery in a referral center for PAS occurred in 71.9% of these patients.Antenatal suspicion of PAS is associated with improved maternal outcomes, also among high-risk women with both placenta previa and prior CS, likely because of their referral to specialized centers for PAS management."
https://openalex.org/W3165647374,"Overweight and obesity has reach pandemic levels, with two-thirds (67%) of adult Australians classified as overweight or obese. As two of the most significant behavioral risk factors for obesity are modifiable (diet and exercise), there exists an opportunity for treatment through workplace health promotion initiatives. As one of Australia's largest industries with its own unique workplace factors, the mining industry has previously reported higher than population levels of overweight and obesity. This represented an opportune setting to test the RESHAPE workplace wellness program. RESHAPE is an eight-step framework (based on the WHO 'Health Workplace Framework and Model') which aims to provide a sustained approach to wellness in the workplace. This paper presents baseline findings from a pilot study that aimed to implement RESHAPE at three mine sites in NSW, Australia, and investigates the issue of overweight and obesity in the coal mining industry. Across three mine sites, 949 coal miners were examined cross-sectionally on a range of workplace, wellness, health, diet, and exercise factors using a paper-based survey. This was a predominantly male sample (90.4%) with the majority (59.2%) of participants aged 25-44 years. Self-reported height and weight measures indicated that less than 20 percent (18.9%) of participants were in a healthy BMI range, while there were effectively equal numbers of overweight (40.9%) and obese (39.1%) participants. Only 3.5% of participants met the daily recommendation for vegetables (5 serves) and shift-workers had greater association with elevated BMI compared to non-shift workers (B = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.23, 2.20, p = 0.016). Poor nutrition is likely to be a key component in elevated levels of overweight and obesity within this industry, with workplace factors compounding challenges workers face in implementing health behavior change. Future studies would benefit from assessing diet and physical activity knowledge in relation to recommendations and serving sizes."
https://openalex.org/W3164545141,"Consent policies for post-mortem organ procurement (OP) vary throughout Europe, and yet no studies have empirically evaluated the ethical implications of contrasting consent models. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel indicator of governance quality based on the ideal of informed support, and examine national differences on this measure through a quantitative survey of OP policy informedness and preferences in seven European countries.Between 2017-2019, we conducted a convenience sample survey of students (n = 2006) in Austria (AT), Belgium (BE), Denmark (DK), Germany (DE), Greece (GR), Slovenia (SI) and Spain (ES), asking participants about their donation preferences, as well as their beliefs and views about the policy in place. From these measures, we computed indices of informedness, policy support, and fulfilment of unexpressed preferences, which we compared across countries and consent systems.Our study introduces a tool for analyzing policy governance in the context of OP. Wide variation in policy awareness was observed: Most respondents in DK, DE, AT and BE correctly identified the policy in place, while those in SI, GR and ES did not. Respondents in opt-out countries (AT, BE, ES and GR) tended to support the policy in place (with one exception, i.e., SI), whereas those in opt-in countries (DE and DK) overwhelmingly opposed it. These results reveal stark differences in governance quality across countries and consent policies: We found a preponderance of informed opposition in opt-in countries and a general tendency towards support-either informed or uninformed-in opt-out countries. We also found informed divergence in opt-in countries and a tendency for convergence-either informed or uninformed-among opt-out countries.Our study offers a novel tool for analyzing governance quality and illustrates, in the context of OP, how the strengths and weaknesses of different policy implementations can be estimated and compared using quantitative survey data."
https://openalex.org/W3165475256,"Introduction Employment is particularly beneficial for persons living with HIV (PLWH). However, PLWH experiencing internalized stigma or anticipating that they may experience stigma may be less likely to seek employment due to additional barriers associated with HIV. The purpose of this study was to understand the associations between internalized and anticipated stigma and employment barriers for PLWH. Methods Participants (N = 712) from 12 sites across the United States were recruited and interviewed about barriers to employment, HIV stigma, and several other factors related to health. A series of unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models were conducted using cross-sectional data. Results Adjusted models suggest that greater anticipated stigma was related to increased employment barriers (β = 0.12, p = 0.04). Mental and physical health functioning also positively predicted employment barriers (β = -0.18, p &lt;0.001; β = -0.40, p &lt;0.001, respectively). Discussion Employment among PLWH has beneficial impacts on HIV-related health outcomes. This study suggests that anticipated stigma may limit and individual’s willingness to seek out employment, or may cause them to leave employment. Internalized stigma may not play as large of a role in employment as anticipated stigma for PLWH. HIV-related stigma reduction interventions focused on community-level and employers are essential to improve employment opportunities for PLWH."
https://openalex.org/W3165541830,"Recent studies have suggested that people's intent and ability to act also can influence their perception of their bodies' peripersonal space. Vice versa one could assume that the inability to reach toward and grasp an object might have an impact on the subject's perception of reaching distance. Here we tested this prediction by investigating body size and action capability perception of neurological patients suffering from arm paresis after stroke, comparing 32 right-brain-damaged patients (13 with left-sided arm paresis without additional spatial neglect, 10 with left-sided arm paresis and additional spatial neglect, 9 patients had neither arm paresis nor neglect) and 27 healthy controls. Nineteen of the group of right hemisphere stroke patients could be re-examined about five months after initial injury. Arm length was estimated in three different methodological approaches: explicit visual, explicit tactile/proprioceptive, and implicit reaching. Results fulfilled the working hypothesis. Patients with an arm paresis indeed perceived their bodies differently. We found a transient overestimation of the length of the contralesional, paretic arm after stroke. Body size and action capability perception for the extremities thus indeed seem to be tightly linked in humans."

This study sought to estimate the prevalence of vaping during pregnancy and to explore the factors and outcomes associated with vaping in pregnancy.England.Women who gave birth between 15th and 28th October 2017.A cross-sectional population-based postal survey of maternal and infant health, the National Maternity Survey (NMS) 2018. The prevalence of vaping and patterns of cigarette smoking were estimated, and regression analysis was used to explore associations between maternal characteristics and vaping, and between vaping and birth outcomes.Unweighted and weighted prevalence of vaping with 95% confidence intervals, and unadjusted and adjusted relative risks or difference in means for the association of participant characteristics and secondary outcomes with vaping. Secondary outcome measures were: preterm birth, gestational age at birth, birthweight, and initiation and duration of breastfeeding.A total of 4,509 women responded to the survey. The prevalence of vaping in pregnancy was 2.8% (95%CI 2.4% to 3.4%). This varied according to the pattern of cigarette smoking in pregnancy: 0.3% in never-smokers; 3.3% in ex-smokers; 7.7% in pregnancy-inspired quitters; 9.5% in temporary quitters; and 17.7% in persistent smokers. Younger women, unmarried women, women with fewer years of formal education, women living with a smoker, and persistent smokers were more likely to vape, although after adjusting for pattern of cigarette smoking and maternal characteristics, persistent smoking was the only risk factor. We did not find any association between vaping and preterm birth, birthweight, or breastfeeding.The prevalence of vaping during pregnancy in the NMS 2018 was low overall but much higher in smokers. Smoking was the factor most strongly associated with vaping. Co-occurrence of vaping with persistent smoking has the potential to increase the harms of tobacco exposure in pregnant women and their infants."

The aim of this study was to investigate long-term cardiac outcomes in patients with heart failure having various combinations of CI and RAP.A total of 787 heart failure patients who underwent right-heart catheterization were retrospectively categorized into the following four groups: Preserved CI (≥2.5 L/min/m2) and Low RAP (<8 mmHg) (PRE-CI/L-RAP; n = 285); Preserved CI (≥2.5 L/min/m2) and High RAP (≥8 mmHg) (PRE-CI/H-RAP; n = 242); Reduced CI (<2.5 L/min/m2) and Low RAP (<8 mmHg) (RED-CI/L-RAP; n = 123); and Reduced CI (<2.5 L/min/m2) and High RAP (≥8 mmHg) (RED-CI/H-RAP; n = 137). Survival analysis was applied to investigate which groups were associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).The RED-CI/L-RAP and RED-CI/H-RAP groups were significantly associated with MACE as compared with the PRE-CI/L-RAP and PRE-CI/H-RAP groups after adjustment for confounding factors (RED-CI/L-RAP vs. PRE-CI/L-RAP: HR 2.11 [95% CI 1.33-3.37], p = 0.002; RED-CI/H-RAP vs. PRE-CI/L-RAP: HR 2.18 [95% CI 1.37-3.49], p = 0.001; RED-CI/L-RAP vs. PRE-CI/H-RAP: HR 1.86 [95% CI 1.16-3.00], p = 0.01; RED-CI/H-RAP vs. PRE-CI/H-RAP: HR 1.92 [95% CI 1.26-2.92], p = 0.002), whereas the difference between the RED-CI/H-RAP and RED-CI/L-RAP groups was not significant (HR 1.03 [95% CI 0.64-1.66], p = 0.89).The hemodynamic severity categorized by CI and RAP levels provided clear risk stratification in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Low CI was an independent predictor of long-term cardiac outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3164909448,"Despite huge changes in demographic behaviors, the family continues to be the major source of psychosocial support for older adults in India. The loss of household headship can be a cause of disregard for the aged and is associated in a very fundamental way with other status losses. Our study used the two rounds of the India Human Development Survey to understand the association of family structure on the gain or loss status of household headship among 10,527 older adults.Bivariate analysis was done using the chi-square test for association. Equivalently, the multivariate analysis involved estimating multivariable logistic regression models. Multicollinearity did not affect the estimates from the regression models. For examining headship transition, we performed two complete sets of analysis, by taking gain in headship and loss in headship as the outcome variable respectively.Across two rounds, a major shift in family structure was noticed as 6.8% of households moved from extended to a single generation. Results indicate that family structure was significantly associated with gaining and losing headship among older adults. Headship loss was more common among nuclear [OR: 2.16; CI: 1.28, 3.65] and extended [OR: 2.76; CI: 1.64, 4.66] family structures. Moreover, gaining headship was found to be significantly associated with married, educated, and working older adults.Since living in single generation household may preferably be encouraged among older adults than their living in a complex household without headship and value they deserve, the public intervention may support the independent living within the older population through housing policies that create additional choices presented to older adults making residential decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3164969811,"Self-administration of patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) by patients with low literacy is a methodologic and implementation challenge. There is an increasing emphasis on patient-centered care and wider adoption of PROMs to understand outcomes and measure healthcare quality. However, there is a risk that the use of PROMs could perpetuate health disparities unless they are implemented in an inclusive fashion. We present a protocol to adapt validated, text-based PROMs to a multimedia format (mPROMs) to optimize self-administration in populations with limited literacy. We describe the processes used to develop the protocol and the planned protocol implementation.Our study protocol development was guided by the International Quality of Life Assessment (IQOLA) protocol for translating and culturally adapting PROMs to different languages. We used the main components of IQOLA's protocol to generate a conceptual framework to guide development of a Multimedia Adaptation Protocol (MAP). The MAP, which incorporates human-centered design (HCD) and takes a community-engaged research approach, includes four stages: forward adaptation, backward adaptation, qualitative evaluation, and validation. The MAP employs qualitative and quantitative methods including observation, cognitive and discovery interviews, ideation workshops, prototyping, user testing, co-creation interviews, and psychometric testing. An iterative design is central to the MAP and consistent with both the IQOLA protocol and HCD processes. We will pilot test and execute the MAP to adapt the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity Short Form for use in a mixed literacy hand and upper extremity patient population in Baltimore, Maryland.The MAP provides an approach for adapting PROMs to a multimedia format. We encourage others to evaluate and test this approach with other questionnaires and patient populations. The development and use of mPROMs has the potential to expand our ability to accurately capture PROs in limited literacy populations and promote equity in PRO measurement."
https://openalex.org/W3165183354,"Primary healthcare systems worldwide suffer from major gaps in infrastructure and human resources. One key infrastructure gap is access to reliable electricity, absence of which can significantly affect the quantity and quality of healthcare services being delivered at rural primary health facilities. However, absence of granular empirical evidence is a barrier for quantitatively understanding the significance of electricity access as one of the determinants of access to reliable primary healthcare. Using data from India's District Level Household and Facility Survey, we develop zero-inflated negative binomial models with co-variates and state-level fixed effects to estimate the relationship between levels of electricity access and the quantity of basic health services delivered at Primary Health Centers (PHCs). We find that lack of electricity access is associated with a significant and large decrease in the number of deliveries (64 percent), number of in-patients (39 percent), and number of out-patients (38 percent). We further find that lower level of electricity access at primary health centers is disproportionately associated with adverse effects on women's access to safe and quality healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W3165235152,"The catastrophic environmental, life and monetary losses concomitant to the hazardous cargo accidents have remained a matter of critical concern for the maritime transportation officials. The factors that instigate these accidents while dealing with hazardous cargo in a port environment requires rigorous analysis and evaluation, which still remains in its infancy. In accord to these prevailing issues, this study focusses on the assessment of multifactor risks associated with the dealing of hazardous cargos inside a port. The methodology adopted is the amalgamation of expert judgment and literature review for the identification of factors and developing their causal relationship, while Bayesian Network (BN) for the inference, which was based on 348 past accident reports from the year 1990 to 2018. The results indicate that under normal circumstances, the probability of an accident with considerable consequences is 59.8, where human and management were found to be the highest contributing factors. Setting evidence at the environment and pollution accident to occur, the incidence probability of the ""management"" is raised by 7.06%. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the most critical factors for the hazardous cargo accident. This study reveals that in order to evade the hazardous cargo accidents and curtail severity of the consequences, the port authorities, concerned government departments and other related institutions should pay specific attention to the qualification, training and attitude of the involved workforce. Moreover, the development and implementation of stringent safety protocols was also revealed to have critical prominence. This study holds practical vitality for enhancing safety and mitigating risks associated to hazardous cargo dealing in a port."
https://openalex.org/W3164550472,"Through improvements in trauma care there has been a decline in injury mortality, as more people survive severe trauma. Patients who survive severe trauma are at risk of long-term disabilities which may place a high economic burden on society. The purpose of this study was to estimate the health care and productivity costs of severe trauma patients up to 24 months after sustaining the injury. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of injury severity level on health care utilization and costs and determined predictors for health care and productivity costs.This prospective cohort study included adult trauma patients with severe injury (ISS≥16). Data on in-hospital health care use, 24-month post-hospital health care use and productivity loss were obtained from hospital registry data and collected with the iMTA Medical Consumption and Productivity Cost Questionnaire. The questionnaires were completed 1 week and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after injury. Log-linked gamma generalized linear models were used to investigate the drivers of health care and productivity costs.In total, 174 severe injury patients were included in this study. The median age of participants was 55 years and the majority were male (66.1%). The mean hospital stay was 14.2 (SD = 13.5) days. Patients with paid employment returned to work 21 weeks after injury. In total, the mean costs per patient were €24,760 with in-hospital costs of €11,930, post-hospital costs of €7,770 and productivity costs of €8,800. Having an ISS ≥25 and lower health status were predictors of high health care costs and male sex was associated with higher productivity costs.Both health care and productivity costs increased with injury severity, although large differences were observed between patients. It is important for decision-makers to consider not only in-hospital health care utilization but also the long-term consequences and associated costs related to rehabilitation and productivity loss."

https://openalex.org/W3164199341,"Out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for healthcare severely affect the current consumption, future health and earnings capacity of poor/underprivileged households and hence it is crucial for priority setting. This study assesses the variation in overall as well as disease-specific impoverishment impact of OOP payments between the regions experiencing different climate change risks, defined as high disaster-prone (HDP) areas and low-disaster-prone (LDP) areas, in Bangladesh.This paper estimated three poverty measures, such as poverty headcount, poverty intensity and normalized poverty gap for all ailments, catastrophic events, diseases types (communicable, non-communicable (NCDs), and accident and injury), illness conditions (acute and chronic) and hospitalization using 3,791 randomly selected rural households (1,203 from HDP and 2,588 from LDP areas) across the regions. Cost of basic need approach was used for estimating poverty line expenditure.About 13 percent households annually fall into poverty due to OOP outlays for healthcare. Despite having significantly (p-value≤0.01) less OOP payments (HDP areas: BDT 5,117; LDP areas: BDT5,811) the impoverishment impact of OOP payments for healthcare in HDP areas (16.5%) has substantially higher than LDP areas (11.3%). Population in HDP areas, especially char (river island; 19.55 percent) and haor (water submerged; 16.80 percent) are more susceptible to any level of OOP payments due to low level of earnings. Catastrophic healthcare expenditure (61.79%) and NCDs (14.29 percent) are exacerbating the poverty level in Bangladesh. Both absolute and relative average poverty gap are more widen in HDP than LDP areas due to catastrophic OOP outlays for healthcare.The impoverishment effect due to OOP payments for healthcare in both HDP and LDP areas are high, especially for NCDs and catastrophic healthcare expenditure. However, the situation is bit worse in HDP areas. Preventing the escalation of NCDs as well as catastrophic expenditure and hence reducing the level of impoverishment thereof call for restricting tobacco use, increasing physical activity, encouraging to intake healthy diets, ensuring food safety, controlling air pollution, and improving mental health. Moreover, government should give more emphasis, especially in the HDP areas, on making community clinics more functional through providing screening equipment and training to the Community Health Care Providers for early detection of NCDs, and ensuring availability of medicine all the time. Note that other than community clinics, there is little option for providing healthcare in HDP areas due to poor functionality of public facilities as well as lack of private facilities in HDP areas."
https://openalex.org/W3164601973,"Stable personality dispositions, like motives, are often assumed to exert a direct, stable impact on behavior. This also applies to the explicit achievement motive, which is supposed to influence the behavior that individuals select and how strongly they engage in it. Drawing on motivational intensity theory, we demonstrated in two studies that explicit achievement motive strength only predicted exerted force in a hand grip task if task difficulty was unclear. If task difficulty was clear, explicit achievement motive strength did not influence exerted force. Our findings suggest that the availability of information about the difficulty of motive satisfaction moderates the impact of the explicit achievement motive on behavior."

UN agencies estimates 571,464 migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in Libya in 2021; among these, 3,934 people are held in detention. We aimed to describe morbidities and water, hygiene, and sanitation (WHS) conditions in detention in Tripoli, Libya. We conducted a retrospective analysis of data collected between July 2018 and December 2019, as part of routine monitoring within an Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) project providing healthcare and WHS support for migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in some of the official detention centres (DC) in Tripoli. MSF had access to 1,630 detainees in eight different DCs on average per month. Only one DC was accessible to MSF every single month. The size of wall openings permitting cell ventilation failed to meet minimum standards in all DCs. Minimum standards for floor space, availability of water, toilets and showers were frequently not met. The most frequent diseases were acute respiratory tract infections (26.9%; 6,775/25,135), musculoskeletal diseases (24.1%; 6,058/25,135), skin diseases (14.1%; 3,538/25,135) and heartburn and reflux (10.0%; 2,502/25,135). Additionally, MSF recorded 190 cases of violence-induced wounds and 55 cases of sexual and gender-based violence. During an exhaustive nutrition screening in one DC, linear regression showed a reduction in mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of 2.5mm per month in detention (95%-CI 1.3–3.7, p&lt;0.001). Detention of men, women and children continues to take place in Tripoli. Living conditions failed to meet minimum requirements. Health problems diagnosed at MSF consultations reflect the living conditions and consist largely of diseases related to overcrowding, lack of water and ventilation, and poor diet. Furthermore, every month that people stay in detention increases their risk of malnutrition. The documented living conditions and health problems call for an end of detention and better protection of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in Libya."
https://openalex.org/W3164918604,"A longitudinal study was carried out to investigate species composition, seasonal abundance, parity and transmission potential of Simulium damnosum complex in Alabameta community in Osun State, Southwestern, Nigeria. Adult Simulium damnosum complex were collected along Owena River, Alabameta, by two dark complexioned vector collectors from 07:00hr to 18:00hr weekly using collecting tubes from November 2014 to April 2015. The flies were morphologically identified and dissected for the purpose of detecting Onchocerca parasite using dissecting microscope. The Monthly Biting Rate (MBR) of flies was determined using World Health Organization standard formula. A total of four hundred and forty flies were collected during the study period with all of them identified as forest species of Simulium damnosum complex. There was significant variation in monthly collection of the flies with the month of November having the highest number of flies (194) (44%) while the month of April recorded the lowest number of flies (31) (7%) (p<0.05). The morning biting peak (09hr - 11hr) (137) was higher than the evening biting peak (15hr -17hr) (64) (p<0.05) while nulliparous flies (294) (67%) were more abundant than the parous flies (146) (33%) (p<0.05). There was absence of infection (zero infectivity) of the flies (p<0.05). The zero infectivity in the flies may plausibly indicate the possibility of zero transmission of Onchocerca parasite in the community which if sustained over a period of time may signify the possibility of onchocerciasis elimination. Also, the presence of forest species of the flies reduces the risk of resident's intense exposure to blinding savannah strain of onchocerciasis."

Thus, this study aimed to obtain baseline data regarding KMC knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among nursing staff caring for mothers and newborns in a hospital in Indonesia.This cross-sectional study included 65 participants from three hospital wards at Koja District Hospital, North Jakarta. Participants included 29 perinatal ward nurses, 21 postnatal ward nurses and midwives, and 15 labor ward midwives. Data on KAP of KMC were collected using a self-administered questionnaire with closed-ended questions. Each questionnaire can be completed in approximately 1 hour.Among the included nursing staff, 12.3% (8/65) were determined to have received specific training on KMC, whereas 21.5% (14/65) had received more general training that included KMC content. About 46.2% of the nursing staff had good knowledge concerning KMC, 98.5% had good knowledge of KMC benefits, and 100% had a positive attitude toward KMC. All perinatal ward nurses had some experience assisting and implementing KMC. Some KAP that were observed among the nursing staff included lack of knowledge about the eligible infant weight for KMC and weight gain of infants receiving KMC, lack of education/training about KMC, and concerns regarding necessary equipment in KMC wards.This study identified several issues that need to be addressed, including knowledge of feeding and weight gain, workload, incubator use, and the need for well-equipped KMC wards. We recommend that hospitals improve their nursing staff's knowledge of KMC and establish well-equipped KMC wards."
https://openalex.org/W3165181402,"Shield tunneling in karst areas poses significant challenges, as vibration caused by the shield machine can disturb the stability of the karst caves, ultimately resulting in the collapse of a tunnel. In the present study, a numerical model involving an iteration process was developed based on the Mindlin solution scheme to identify the optimal shield tunneling speed for minimizing the disturbance to karst cave stability. The developed model was then implemented to investigate an underground tunnel constructed in a karst region with different shield tunneling strategies. By using the variation in the energy density of a karst cave as a performance index, the model predicts that when approaching the affected zone of a karst carve (e.g., approximately 5 m from the carve), the shield tunneling machine should be controlled within a certain speed (i.e., < 30 mm/min). Once the shield tunneling machine moves into the affected zone of the cave, the speed of the machine needs to be decelerated to 11 mm/min, and the speed of 30 mm/min can be restored when the shield machine moves out of the affected zone. This finding demonstrates that the developed model could potentially be used to identify the optimal shield tunneling speed to minimize the disturbance to karst cave stability and ensure the safety of tunnel construction in karst regions."

The study population was divided into low and normal fibrinogen groups. A 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching analysis was used to evaluate the association between a low fibrinogen level (< 160 mg/dL) and postoperative development of AKI.In total, 142 patients (23.1%) developed AKI after LDLT. The PS matching analysis showed that the probability of AKI was two-fold higher in the low fibrinogen group than in the normal fibrinogen group. In addition, patients with AKI had poorer postoperative outcomes such as longer hospitalization, longer ICU stay, and higher mortality than patients without AKI.The preoperative fibrinogen level may be useful for risk stratification of patients undergoing LDLT in terms postoperative development of AKI."

In this study, we compared the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by a one-step real-time RT-PCR method using a heat-resistant reverse transcriptase variant MM4 from Moloney murine leukemia virus, two thermostable DNA polymerase variants with reverse transcriptase activity from Thermotoga petrophila K4 and Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1, or a wild-type DNA polymerase from Thermus thermophilus M1. The highest performance was achieved by combining MM4 with the thermostable DNA polymerase from T . thermophilus M1. These enzymes efficiently amplified specific RNA using uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) to remove contamination and human RNase P RNA amplification as an internal control. The standard curve was obtained from 5 to 10 5 copies of synthetic RNA. The one-step real-time RT-PCR method’s sensitivity and specificity were 99.44% and 100%, respectively (n = 213), compared to those of a commercially available diagnostic kit.

https://openalex.org/W3164193420,"The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of repeated cocaine administration on the whole body of rats. Rats (male, 6 weeks old, Sprague Dawley) were injected intraperitoneally with cocaine (50 mg/kg) once a day for 1, 3 or 7 days, and major organs (heart, liver, lung, brain, kidney, spleen) were excised from the sacrificed animals. During autopsy, we found a reduction in spleen size, but not other organs, in cocaine-administered rats as compared to control rats. This reduction became to be noticed at 3 day and easily perceived at 7 day. No marked changes were observed in other organs examined. H&E and EMG staining showed a tendency for a decrease in the number of red blood cells (RBCs) as well as an increase in collagen fibers in the spleens of rats treated repeatedly with cocaine. Transcriptome analysis indicated that repeated cocaine administration depletes RBCs from the spleen. Immunoblot analysis showed that cocaine increases the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MYL) as well as the levels of transgelin, both of which are involved in the contraction of myofibrils. Collectively, these results show that repeated cocaine administration results in sustained contraction of the spleen, which leads to the release of RBCs from the spleen into circulation."

Characteristic is vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, which is often overlooked. Early diagnosis and start of therapy improve quality of life. This study aimed to characterize oculomotor dysfunction of NPC patients, and to provide ophthalmologic data including retinal imaging.Eighteen patients with biochemically or genetically diagnosed NPC completed oculomotor and ophthalmologic examination. Ten of them performed saccadometry by infrared based video-oculography. Saccadic parameters were compared to 100 healthy controls, and were correlated with clinical variables. Another subgroup of eight patients received optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the optic disc and the macula, of which the segmented layers were analysed using a crude linear mixed model, and one adjusted for age, sex, and spherical equivalent.Saccadometry revealed slowed peak velocity compared to controls most evident vertically. Peak velocity correlated negatively with SARA-Score, but correlation with clinical assessment of saccades was not significant. Clinical features in the assessment of vertical saccades were intensive blinking and head movements to initiate gaze changes, and lateral trajectory of the eyes. Macular OCT revealed significant total retinal thinning in the fovea, specifically of the outer nuclear layer and outer retinal layer. Para- and perifoveal retinal thicknesses, as well as peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer were normal.Foveal thinning was revealed in NPC. It remains to be shown, whether OCT will prove to be useful to monitor progression. Saccadic impairment reflects CNS involvement and therefore is a parameter to demonstrate the progression of NPC, and potentially also the efficacy of new therapies. Saccadometry, in contrast to clinical investigation, allows the precise evaluation of saccades."

The stem-galling fly, Cecidochares connexa (Macquart) (Diptera: Tephritidae), has spread widely across West Africa since its release in only Côte d'Ivoire, occurring in six countries. This study aimed to investigate whether the gall fly had spread further across West Africa and into Central Africa. Here, we surveyed C. odorata for C. connexa galls in Cameroon between October 2018 and October 2020, along roadsides, on farms, residential areas, and abandoned plots, encompassing various vegetation types. Additional surveys were conducted across four countries (Ghana, Togo, Benin Republic and Nigeria) in West Africa that we considered the probable pathway for the spread of the gall fly into Central Africa. Cecidochares connexa was present at five of the six locations surveyed in Cameroon, albeit in varying abundance. In Africa, these findings represent the first-ever report of C. connexa outside of West Africa. In West Africa, we recorded significant expansion in the geographic range of C. connexa, as reflected in the absent-present record of C. connexa in two locations in Nigeria and one in Ghana, as well as its occurrence in all locations surveyed in Benin Republic and Togo. Clearly, Ghana, Togo, Benin Republic and Nigeria served as the dispersal pathway of C. connexa from the release sites in Côte d'Ivoire into Cameroon, covering over 2,300 km. Following the spread and establishment of C. connexa into Cameroon, we anticipate that it will continue to spread further into other parts of Central Africa which are climatically suitable. Cecidochares connexa is currently the only biological control agent for C. odorata in Central Africa. Given that it has significantly reduced populations of C. odorata in other countries where it has established, it is expected to have a similar impact in Central Africa."

Ramucirumab+chemotherapy (CT) (HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.35-0.77) and use of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, including camrelizumab (HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.57-0.88), sintilimab (HR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50-0.98), nivolumab (HR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.62-0.94), and pembrolizumab (HR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.72-0.98), conferred better OS than CT; however, this OS benefit was not observed for PD-L1 inhibitor (avelumab) and other target agents (trastuzumab, everolimus, gefitinib, and anlotinib). In subgroup analysis, ramucirumab+CT and pembrolizumab showed significant improvement in OS, when compared to CT, in esophageal/EGJ adenocarcinoma (AC) cases; moreover, all PD-1 inhibitors had significant OS advantage over CT in treating esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Based on treatment ranking in terms of OS, ramucirumab+CT and camrelizumab were ranked the best treatments for patients with AC and SCC, respectively.Ramucirumab+CT and PD-1 inhibitors were superior to CT for previously treated cases of advanced esophageal/EGJ cancer. Ramucirumab+CT seemed to be the most effective treatment in patients with esophageal/EGJ AC, while use of PD-1 inhibitors, especially camrelizumab, was likely to be the optimal treatment in patients with esophageal SCC."
https://openalex.org/W3165195841,"Three scarce terpenes, psiadin, plectranthone and saudinolide, were obtained after chromatographic isolation and purification from the aerial parts of the respective plants. Their identities were established based on their spectral data. Their anticancer effects against two human colorectal carcinoma cell lines, CCL233 and CCL235, along with the potential molecular mechanisms of action, were explored. Psiadin and plectranthone exhibited marked growth inhibition on both cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner with minimal cytotoxicity against normal breast cells (HB2). The terpenes even showed superior activities to the tested standards. Flow cytometry showed apoptosis induction and alteration in the cell cycle in colorectal cancer cells treated with both compounds. Nevertheless, it was also found that both compounds inhibited NF-κB transcriptional activity, induced mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization and increased the percentage of reactive oxygen species in the treated cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner as well. Since the anticancer effect of psiadin on cancer cells was higher than that produced by plectranthone, only psiadin was tested to determine its possible targets. The results suggested a high degree of specificity of action affecting particular cellular processes in both cancer cells. In conclusion, both terpenes, in particular psiadin, showed significant discriminative therapeutic potential between cancer and normal cells, a value that is missing in current chemotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W3164526588,"Minipigs have remarkably similar physiology to humans, therefore, they it can be a good animal model for inflammation study. Thus, the conventional (serum chemistry, histopathology) and novel analytic tools [immune cell identification in tissue, cytokine level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum, NF-kB target gene analysis in tissue] were applied to determine inflammation in Chicago Miniature Swine (CMS) minipig. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute systemic inflammation caused liver and kidney damage in serum chemistry and histopathology. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) also showed an increase of immune cell distribution in spleen and lung during inflammation. Moreover, NF-kB-target gene expression was upregulated in lung and kidney in acute inflammation and in heart, liver, and intestine in chronic inflammation. Cytokine mRNA was elevated in PBMC under acute inflammation along with elevated absolute cytokine levels in serum. Overall, LPS-mediated systemic inflammation affects the various organs, and can be detected by IHC of immune cells, gene analysis in PBMC, and measuring the absolute cytokine in serum along with conventional inflammation analytic tools."
https://openalex.org/W3164596882,"Since most sporting injuries occur at the lower extremity (50% to 66%) and many of those injuries occur at the knee (30% to 45%), it is important to have robust metrics to measure risk of knee injury. Dynamic measures of knee stability are not commonly used in existing metrics but could provide important context to knee health and improve injury screening effectiveness. This study used the Local Dynamic Stability (LDS) of knee kinematics during a repetitive vertical jump to perform a post-hoc previous injury classification of participants. This study analyzed the kinematics from twenty-seven female collegiate division 1 (D1) soccer, D1 basketball, and club soccer athletes from Auburn University (height = 171 ± 8.9cm, weight = 66.3 ± 8.6kg, age = 19.8 ± 1.9yr), with 7 subjects having sustained previous knee injury requiring surgery and 20 subjects with no history of injury. This study showed that LDS correctly identified 84% of previously injured and uninjured subjects using a multivariate logistic regression during a fatigue jump task. Findings showed no statistical difference in kinematic position at maximum knee flexion during all jumps between previously injured and uninjured subjects. Additionally, kinematic positioning at maximum knee flexion was not indicative of LDS values, which would indicate that future studies should look specifically at LDS with respect to injury prevention as it cannot be effectively inferred from kinematics. These points suggest that the LDS preserves information about subtle changes in movement patterns that traditional screening methods do not, and this information could allow for more effective injury screening tests in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3164654612,"Biodegradable plastics must be sufficiently stable to maintain functionality during use but need to be able to degrade rapidly after use. We previously reported that treatment with an enzyme named PaE, secreted by the basidiomycete yeast Pseudozyma antarctica can speed up this degradation. To facilitate the production of large quantities of PaE, here, we aimed to elucidate the optimal conditions of ethanol treatment for sterilization of the culture supernatant and for concentration and stabilization of PaE. The results showed that Pseudozyma antarctica completely lost its proliferating ability when incubated in ≥20% (v/v) ethanol. When the ethanol concentration was raised to 90% (v/v), PaE formed a precipitate; however, its activity was restored completely when the precipitate was dissolved in water. To reduce ethanol use, PaE was successfully concentrated and recovered by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation and ethanol precipitation steps. Over 90% of the activity in the original culture supernatant was recovered and the specific activity was increased 3.4-fold. By preparing the enzyme solution at a final concentration of 20% (v/v) ethanol, about 60% of the initial activity was maintained at ambient temperature for over 6 months without growth of microbes. We conclude that ethanol treatment is effective for sterilization, concentration, and stabilization of PaE, and that concentrating PaE by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation and ethanol precipitation substantially increases the PaE purity and decreases ethanol use."
https://openalex.org/W3164664259,"Older adults in Japan are tackling health-related challenges brought by comprehensive geriatric symptoms, such as physical and cognitive problems and social-psychological issues. In this nationwide study, we mainly focused on the Kihon checklist (KCL) as certificated necessity of long-term care for Japanese older adults and investigated whether the KCL score was associated with geriatric depression. In addition, we aimed to identify critical factors that influence the relationship between the KCL score and geriatric depression.This survey was a cross-sectional observational study design, performed from 2013 to 2019. A total of 8,760 participants aged 65 years and over were recruited from five cohorts in Japan, consisting of 6,755 persons in Chubu, 1,328 in Kanto, 481 in Kyushu, 49 in Shikoku and 147 in Tohoku. After obtaining informed consent from each participant, assessments were conducted, and outcomes were evaluated according to the ORANGE protocol. We collected data on demographics, KCL, physical, cognitive and mental evaluations. To clarify the relationship between the KCL and geriatric depression or critical factors, a random intercept model of multi-level models was estimated using individual and provincial variables depending on five cohorts.The KCL score was correlated with depression status. Moreover, the results of a random intercept model showed that the KCL score and geriatric depression were associated, and its association was affected by provincial factors of slow walking speed, polypharmacy and sex difference.These results suggest that provincial factors of low walking performance, polypharmacy and sex difference (female) might be clinically targeted to improve the KCL score in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3165020100,"Introduction The impact of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) on arterial intima-media thickness (IMT), a surrogate measure for cardiovascular disease, remains uncertain, in part because of the potential for non-SDB vascular risk factor interactions. In the present study, we determined predictors for common carotid (CCA) and femoral (CFA) artery IMT in an adult, sleep clinic cohort where non-SDB vascular risk factors (particularly diabetes) were eliminated or controlled. Methods We recruited 296 participants for polysomnography (standard SDB severity metrics) and CCA/CFA ultrasound examinations, followed by a 12 month vascular risk factor minimisation (RFM) and continuous positive pressure (CPAP) intervention for participants with a range of SDB severity (RFM Sub-Group, n = 157; apnea hyponea index [AHI]: 14.7 (7.2–33.2), median [IQR]). Univariable and multivariable linear regression models determined independent predictors for IMT. Linear mixed effects modelling determined independent predictors for IMT change across the intervention study. P&lt;0.05 was considered significant. Results Age, systolic blood pressure and waist:hip ratio were identified as non-SDB predictive factors for CCA IMT and age, weight and total cholesterol:HDL ratio for CFA IMT. No SDB severity metric emerged as an independent predictor for either CCA or CFA IMT, except in the RFM Sub-Group, where a 2-fold increase in AHI predicted a 2.4% increase in CFA IMT. Across the intervention study, CCA IMT decreased in those who lost weight, but there was no CPAP use interaction. CFA IMT, however, decreased by 12.9% (95%CI 6.8, 18.7%, p = 0.001) in those participants who both lost weight and used CPAP &gt; = 4hours/night. Conclusion We conclude that SDB severity has little impact on CCA IMT values when non-SDB vascular risk factors are minimised or not present. This is the first study, however, to suggest a potential linkage between SDB severity and CFA IMT values.

https://openalex.org/W3165238362,"Introduction Poor sleep is a risk factor for adverse health events. For health prevention, it may be helpful to know whether poor sleep or sleep disorders in individuals are associated with sleep problems in their partners or children. Methods In the MultiGeneration Study (MGS, conducted from 2013 to 2016), 1237 partners (aged 27 to 90 years) and 1660 adult children (aged 18 to 66 years) of index persons were recruited. Index persons are participants of the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study, a population-based cohort study in the Ruhr area (study start 1999–2001, 4841 participants aged 45–75 years). We used two analysis populations: one with 1181 index persons whose partners were in MGS, and one with 1083 index persons with at least one adult child in MGS. Sleep characteristics were assessed using questionnaires (including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). The exposure was the presence of a sleep characteristic of the index subject. Results Children showed the investigated sleep characteristics more often if these were also present in their parent (e.g., RR (relative risk) = 1.28 (95% CI: 1.06–1.55) for poor sleep quality). In partners, strong associations were observed for rising times and napping, but only weak associations for snoring, poor sleep quality and sleep disorders. Snoring of the bed partner is a risk factor for poor sleep (e.g., RR = 1.67 (0.91–3.07) for difficulties falling asleep). Conclusion Aggregation is observed for many sleep characteristics in people living in partnerships as well as in parents and their adult children."
https://openalex.org/W3164829835,"Intraoperative frozen section (FS) consultation is an important tool in surgical oncology that suffers from sampling error because the pathologist does not always know where to perform a biopsy of the surgical specimen. Intraoperative molecular imaging is a technology used in the OR to visualize lesions during surgery. We hypothesized that molecular imaging can address this pathology challenge in FS by visualizing the cancer cells in the specimen in the pathology suite. Here, we report the development and validation of a molecular-imaging capable cryostat called Smart-Cut.A molecular imaging capable cryostat prototype was developed and tested using a murine model. Tumors grown in mice were targeted with a NIR contrast agent, indocyanine green (ICG), via tail vein injection. Tumors and adjacent normal tissue samples were frozen sectioned with Smart-Cut. Fluorescent sections and non-fluorescent sections were prepared for H&E and fluorescent microscopy. Fluorescent signal was quantified by tumor-to-background ratio (TBR). NIR fluorescence was tested in one patient enrolled in a clinical trial.The Smart-Cut prototype has a small footprint and fits well in the pathology suite. Fluorescence imaging with Smart-Cut identified cancerous tissue in the specimen in all 12 mice. No false positives or false negatives were seen, as confirmed by H&E. The mean TBR in Smart-Cut positive tissue sections was 6.8 (SD±3.8). In a clinical application in the pathology suite, NIR imaging identified two lesions in a pulmonary resection specimen, where traditional grossing only identified one.Molecular imaging can be integrated into the pathology suite via the Smart-Cut device, and can detect cancer in frozen tissue sections using molecular imaging in a murine model."
https://openalex.org/W3165663204,"A multi-link network covert channel (MLCC) such as Cloak exhibits a high capacity and robustness and can achieve lossless modulation of the protocol data units. However, the mechanism of Cloak involving an arrangement of packets over the links (APL) is limited by its passive synchronization schemes, which results in intermittent obstructions in transmitting APL packets and anomalous link switching patterns. In this work, we propose a novel ordinal synchronization mark sequence (OSMS) for a Cloak framework based MLCC to ensure that the marked APL packets are orderly distinguishable. Specifically, a unidirectional function is used to generate the OSMS randomly before realizing covert modulation. Subsequently, we formulate the generation relation of the marks according to their order and embed each mark into the APL packets by using a one-way hash function such that the mark cannot be cracked during the transmission of the APL packet. Finally, we set up a retrieval function of the finite set at the covert receiver to extract the marks and determine their orders, and the APL packets are reorganized to realize covert demodulation. The results of experiments performed on real traffic indicated that the MLCC embedded with OSMS could avoid the passive synchronization schemes and exhibited superior performance in terms of reliability, throughput, and undetectability compared with the renowned Cloak method, especially under a malicious network interference scenario. Furthermore, our approach could effectively resist the inter-link correlation test, which are highly effective in testing the Cloak framework."
