https://openalex.org/W2902547680,"Outer membrane vesicles produced by Gram-negative bacteria have been studied for half a century but the possibility that Gram-positive bacteria secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) was not pursued until recently due to the assumption that the thick peptidoglycan cell wall would prevent their release to the environment. However, following their discovery in fungi, which also have cell walls, EVs have now been described for a variety of Gram-positive bacteria. EVs purified from Gram-positive bacteria are implicated in virulence, toxin release, and transference to host cells, eliciting immune responses, and spread of antibiotic resistance. Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes listeriosis. Here we report that L. monocytogenes produces EVs with diameters ranging from 20 to 200 nm, containing the pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Cell-free EV preparations were toxic to mammalian cells, the murine macrophage cell line J774.16, in a LLO-dependent manner, evidencing EV biological activity. The deletion of plcA increased EV toxicity, suggesting PI-PLC reduced LLO activity. Using simultaneous metabolite, protein, and lipid extraction (MPLEx) multiomics we characterized protein, lipid, and metabolite composition of bacterial cells and secreted EVs and found that EVs carry the majority of listerial virulence proteins. Using immunogold EM we detected LLO at several organelles within infected human epithelial cells and with high-resolution fluorescence imaging we show that dynamic lipid structures are released from L. monocytogenes during infection. Our findings demonstrate that L. monocytogenes uses EVs for toxin release and implicate these structures in mammalian cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2902424700,"It is well known that an increase in mechanical loading can induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and a long standing model in the field indicates that mechanical loads induce hypertrophy via a mechanism that requires signaling through the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Specifically, it has been widely proposed that mechanical loads activate signaling through mTORC1 and that this, in turn, promotes an increase in the rate of protein synthesis and the subsequent hypertrophic response. However, this model is based on a number of important assumptions that have not been rigorously tested. In this study, we created skeletal muscle specific and inducible raptor knockout mice to eliminate signaling by mTORC1, and with these mice we were able to directly demonstrate that mechanical stimuli can activate signaling by mTORC1, and that mTORC1 is necessary for mechanical load-induced hypertrophy. Surprisingly, however, we also obtained multiple lines of evidence that indicate that mTORC1 is not required for a mechanical load-induced increase in the rate of protein synthesis. This observation highlights an important shortcoming in our understanding of how mechanical loads induce hypertrophy and illustrates that additional mTORC1-independent mechanisms play a critical role in this process.-You, J.-S., McNally, R.

https://openalex.org/W2903192705,"γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) administration has been shown to increase β-cell mass, leading to a reversal of type 1 diabetes in mice. Whether GABA has any effect on β cells of healthy and prediabetic/glucose-intolerant obese mice remains unknown. In the present study, we show that oral GABA administration ( ad libitum) to mice indeed increased pancreatic β-cell mass, which led to a modest enhancement in insulin secretion and glucose tolerance. However, GABA treatment did not further increase insulin-positive islet area in high fat diet-fed mice and was unable to prevent or reverse glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, whether in vivo or in vitro, GABA treatment increased β-cell proliferation. In vitro, the effect was shown to be mediated via the GABAA receptor. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that GABA preferentially up-regulated pathways linked to β-cell proliferation and simultaneously down-regulated those networks required for other processes, including insulin biosynthesis and metabolism. Interestingly, single-cell differential expression analysis revealed GABA treatment gave rise to a distinct subpopulation of β cells with a unique transcriptional signature, including urocortin 3 ( ucn3), wnt4, and hepacam2. Taken together, this study provides new mechanistic insight into the proliferative nature of GABA but suggests that β-cell compensation associated with prediabetes overlaps with, and negates, its proliferative effects.-Untereiner, A., Abdo, S., Bhattacharjee, A., Gohil, H., Pourasgari, F., Ibeh, N., Lai, M., Batchuluun, B., Wong, A., Khuu, N., Liu, Y., Al Rijjal, D., Winegarden, N., Virtanen, C., Orser, B.

https://openalex.org/W2903170960,"The 42-amino-acid β-amyloid (Aβ42) is a critical causative agent in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The hereditary Arctic mutation of Aβ42 (E22G) leads to increased intracellular accumulation of β-amyloid in early-onset Alzheimer's disease. However, it remains largely unknown how the Arctic mutant variant leads to aggressive protein aggregation and increased intracellular toxicity. Here, we constructed stable cell lines expressing fluorescent-tagged wildtype (WT) and E22G Aβ42 to study the aggregation kinetics of the Arctic Aβ42 mutant peptide and its heterogeneous structural forms. Arctic-mutant peptides assemble and form fibrils at a much faster rate than WT peptides. We identified five categories of intracellular aggregate-oligomers, single fibrils, fibril bundles, clusters, and aggresomes-that underline the heterogeneity of these Aβ42 aggregates and represent the progression of Aβ42 aggregation within the cell. Fluorescence-lifetime imaging (FLIM) and 3D structural illumination microscopy (SIM) showed that all aggregate species displayed highly compact structures with strong affinity between individual fibrils. We also found that aggregates formed by Arctic mutant Aβ42 were more resistant to intracellular degradation than their WT counterparts. Our findings uncover the structural basis of the progression of Arctic mutant Aβ42 aggregation in the cell."

Despite the fact that wheat provides 20% of the world's caloric and protein diet, its metabolic responses to aphid attack, in general, and specifically its production of benzoxazinoid defense compounds are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to compare the metabolic diversity of durum wheat seedlings (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) under attack by three different cereal aphids: i) the English grain aphid (Sitobion avenae Fabricius), ii) the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.), and iii) the greenbug aphid (Schizaphis graminum Rondani), which are some of the most destructive aphid species to wheat. Insect progeny bioassays and metabolic analyses using chromatography/Q-Exactive/mass spectrometry non-targeted metabolomics and a targeted benzoxazinoid profile were performed on infested leaves. The insect bioassays revealed that the plants were susceptible to S. graminum, resistant to S. avenae, and mildly resistant to R. padi. The metabolic analyses of benzoxazinoids suggested that the predominant metabolites DIMBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin- 3-one) and its glycosylated form DIMBOA-glucoside (Glc) were significantly induced upon both S. avenae, and R. padi aphid feeding. However, the levels of the benzoxazinoid metabolite HDMBOA-Glc (2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucoside) were enhanced due to the feeding of S. avenae and S. graminum aphids, to which Svevo was the most resistant and the most susceptible, respectively. The results showed a partial correlation between the induction of benzoxazinoids and aphid reproduction. Overall, our observations revealed diverse metabolic responses of wheat seedlings to cereal aphid feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2902067706,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with the health status of older Chinese people living in the community, in order to inform strategies to expand access to healthcare.Two-phase stratified cluster sampling was applied; 2000 older people participated in this study. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in Shanghai between June and August, 2011. Descriptive analysis was used to examine the respondents' characteristics. Based on Andersen's healthcare utilization model, a chi-squared test and multiple logistic regression were performed to examine the influences of predisposing, enabling, need, and contextual factors on healthcare utilization.We found that 44.5% of the older people in the sample had good self-reported health status, while 12.8% were poor, 14.5% had visited hospitals or clinics as outpatients in the previous two weeks, and 16.5% had been hospitalized in the previous year. Logistic regression analysis revealed that outpatient health services were more likely to be used by women and those whose income was from friends or social relief, who had poor to good self-reported health status, who were experiencing declining health, who engaged in volunteer activities, and who had chronic diseases. Meanwhile, hospitalization was more likely among those in the older age groups, those with pension income, living in outer suburbs, with poor self-reported health status, experiencing difficulty with activities of daily living and outdoor activities, or having a chronic disease.The results showed the impact of economic status, health status, demographic and social characteristics, and other factors on the health service utilization of elderly people living in the community in Shanghai. Need variables were the strongest predictors of health service use, although contextual factors also contributed."
https://openalex.org/W2903081742,"Critical functions of immune cells require them to rapidly change their shape and generate forces in response to cues from their surrounding environment. However, little is known about how soluble factors that may be present in the microenvironment modulate key aspects of cellular mechanobiology-such as immune cell deformability and force generation-to impact functions such as phagocytosis and migration. Here we show that signaling by soluble stress hormones through β-adrenoceptors (β-AR) reduces the deformability of macrophages; this is dependent on changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and is associated with functional changes in phagocytosis and migration. Pharmacologic interventions reveal that the impact of β-AR signaling on macrophage deformability is dependent on actin-related proteins 2/3, indicating that stress hormone signaling through β-AR shifts actin organization to favor branched structures rather than linear unbranched actin filaments. These findings show that through remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, β-AR-mediated stress hormone signaling modulates macrophage mechanotype to impact functions that play a critical role in immune response.-Kim, T.-H., Ly, C., Christodoulides, A., Nowell, C.

https://openalex.org/W2902074340,"Chronic blood transfusions are responsible to cause iron overload, which leads to several complications to end organs and osteoporosis. Iron chelation is needed to remove iron excess and to contain bone-mass loss. Deferasirox is the most recent oral iron chelator that prevents transfusion related iron overload complications. Recently Eltrombopag (ELT) iron chelating properties are emerging. ELT is an agonist at Thrombopoietin receptor, used in treatment of thrombocytopenia. We tested ELT and Deferasirox in iron overloaded osteoclasts from thalassemic patients and donors measuring intracellular iron, TRAP expression and osteoclast activity. We confirmed ELT iron chelation capacity also in bone tissue and a synergic effect when used with Deferasirox. Moreover, having demonstrated its effects on osteoclast activity, we suggest for the first time that ELT could ameliorate bone tissue’s health reducing bone mass loss."
https://openalex.org/W2902140738,"Attitudes and beliefs about menstruation can place restrictions on menstruating women and girls, limiting their ability to fully participate in community life, education and employment. This paper presents evidence on menstruation-related beliefs contributing to restrictive practices in Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands (SI) and Fiji. Focus group discussions and interviews were undertaken with 307 adolescent girls, women and men in a rural and urban site in each country. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Participants described a range of attitudes and beliefs that restrict the behaviour of menstruating women and girls. Themes include the belief that menstrual blood is ‘dirty’; that when menstruating, girls and women can bring ‘bad luck’ to men; secrecy and shame associated with menstruation; and beliefs about the impact of certain behaviours on menstruation and health. Restrictive practices were more frequently reported in PNG and SI than Fiji, and more common in rural compared with urban sites. Some restrictions, such as avoidance of household chores, were perceived as desirable or driven by women themselves. However participants identified other restrictions, such as not being able to attend church or hygienically wash menstrual hygiene materials, as unwanted, in some cases impacting on participation in school, work and community life. Education initiatives guided by women and girls, implemented by local stakeholders and grounded in a sound understanding of specific contexts are needed to address discriminatory attitudes and beliefs that contribute to unwanted restrictions, and to support enabling attitudes and beliefs regarding menstruation."
https://openalex.org/W2902759596,"Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1 (SND1) has been reported as an oncoprotein in a variety of cancers involving multiple processes, including proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying metastasis remain largely unknown. Herein, by using the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3, which has high metastasis ability, we showed that loss-of-function of SND1 dramatically suppressed the invasion and migration of SKOV3 cells. We then performed gene expression profiles and further verified (by use of quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis) that loss-of-function of SND1 resulted in up-regulation of epithelial markers, such as epithelial cadherin and claudin 1, and down-regulation of mesenchymal markers, including neural cadherin and vimentin. Moreover, we illustrated that SLUG, a key transcription factor implicated in epithelial–mesenchymal transition and metastasis, acts as an essential effector of the SND1-promoted epithelial–mesenchymal transition process via regulating N-CAD and VIM expression (or E-CAD and CLDN1). The underlying molecular mechanisms illustrated that SND1 regulates the gene transcriptional activation of SLUG by increasing chromatin accessibility through the recruitment of the acetyltransferases GCN5 and CBP/p300 to the SLUG promoter proximal region. Overall, SND1 was identified as a novel upstream regulator of SLUG, which plays important roles in regulating the E-CAD/N-CAD expression switch.—Xin, L., Zhao, R., Lei, J., Song, J., Yu, L., Gao, R., Ha, C., Ren, Y., Liu, X., Liu, Y., Yao, Z., Yang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2902320787,"The human macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL) is a C-type lectin characterized by a unique specificity for terminal GalNAc residues present in the tumor-associated Tn antigen (αGalNAc-Ser/Thr) and its sialylated form, the sialyl-Tn antigen. However, human MGL has multiple splice variants, and whether these variants have distinct ligand-binding properties is unknown. Here, using glycan microarrays, we compared the binding properties of the short MGL 6C (MGLshort) and the long MGL 6B (MGLlong) splice variants, as well as of a histidine-to-threonine mutant (MGLshort H259T). Although the MGLshort and MGLlong variants displayed similar binding properties on the glycan array, the MGLshort H259T mutant failed to interact with the sialyl-Tn epitope. As the MGLshort H259T variant could still bind a single GalNAc monosaccharide on this array, we next investigated its binding characteristics to Tn-containing glycopeptides derived from the MGL ligands mucin 1 (MUC1), MUC2, and CD45. Strikingly, in the glycopeptide microarray, the MGLshort H259T variant lost high-affinity binding toward Tn-containing glycopeptides, especially at low probing concentrations. Moreover, MGLshort H259T was unable to recognize cancer-associated Tn epitopes on tumor cell lines. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that in WT MGLshort, His259 mediates H bonds directly or engages the Tn-glycopeptide backbone through water molecules. These bonds were lost in MGLshort H259T, thus explaining its lower binding affinity. Together, our results suggest that MGL not only connects to the Tn carbohydrate epitope, but also engages the underlying peptide via a secondary binding pocket within the MGL carbohydrate recognition domain containing the His259 residue.

Carbohydrate binding mechanism of the macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin 1 revealed by saturation transfer experiments.J. Biol.

These amino acids are replaced by arginine and serine in MGL2, respectively. Although no crystal structure of human MGL is available, glycan accommodation by MGLlong has been studied by saturation transfer-difference NMR measurements and molecular modeling, revealing fine-structural insights into the interaction of Gal/GalNAc and MUC1-Tn-glycopeptides with MGL (17Marcelo F.

These NMR binding studies have verified that galactose is a much weaker ligand than GalNAc. The NHAc group of GalNAc participates in additional H-bond and CH-π interactions, which are absent in the case of galactose. Moreover, an increased number of H bonds were formed when MGL engaged a Tn-glycopeptide; however, this was not reflected by an improved affinity, probably due to the subtle enthalpy–entropy equilibrium of any ligand–protein recognition event. Our knowledge on MGL has substantially increased over the last decade; nevertheless, the carbohydrate fine specificities and ligand-binding properties of the different human MGL splice variants have never been directly compared and have been assumed to be identical. Here, we aimed to elucidate the molecular recognition features of human MGLshort and MGLlong isoforms by evaluating their carbohydrate specificities using glycan and Tn-peptide microarrays. In addition, we mutated the His259 in the CRD of human MGL, equivalent to Thr111 in MGL1, to Thr in the MGLshort variant (H259T) to elucidate whether this amino acid is also crucial for the exclusive GalNAc-binding properties of human MGL. The MGL 6B (MGLlong) and 6C (MGLshort) splice variants vary in a region of 27 amino acids present in the terminal stalk domain of MGLlong only (Fig. 1A). We constructed recombinant MGL-Fc proteins, consisting of the extracellular domains of MGLlong and MGLshort fused to the human IgG1-Fc domain for detection. Previously, Ala89 and Thr111 (Ala256 and Thr278 in the full-length MGL1) were shown to be crucial for the Lewis X preference of murine MGL1 (16Sakakura M. Oo-Puthinan S. Moriyama C. Kimura T.

Based on these findings and our previous work using the MGLshort splice variant (8van Vliet S.J. van Liempt E. Saeland E. Aarnoudse C.A. Appelmelk B. Irimura T. Geijtenbeek T.B. Blixt O.

In our initial screens, the MGLshort K237A/H259T double mutant showed identical binding characteristics as the MGLshort single H259T mutant (data not shown); therefore, we omitted the K237A/H259T mutant from further analyses. All MGL-Fc proteins displayed equal binding to three independent anti-MGL antibodies (Fig. S1B), confirming the correct folding and indicating that the H259T mutation did not induce significant structural changes. We next screened the glycan array developed by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (http://www.functionalglycomics.org), 7Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. containing 610 glycans of natural and synthetic origin. As reported previously (8van Vliet S.J. van Liempt E. Saeland E. Aarnoudse C.A. Appelmelk B. Irimura T. Geijtenbeek T.B. Blixt O. Alvarez R. van Die I. van Kooyk Y.

Immunol. 2005; 17 (15802303): 661-66910.1093/intimm/dxh246Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), MGLshort recognized the O-glycans αGalNAc, sialyl-Tn, and core 6 (GlcNAcβ1–6GalNAcα); the helminth glycans LDN and its fucosylated derivate (LDNF; GalNAcβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc); and the glycosphingolipid structures GM2 (GalNAcβ1–4(Neu5Acα2–3)Galβ1–4Glc) and GD2 (GalNAcβ1–4(Neu5Acα2–8Neu5Acα2–3)Galβ1–4Glc) (Fig. 1B; full results in Table S1). Although differences were subtle, MGLlong displayed significantly higher binding to core 6, LDN, and LDNF than MGLshort and significantly lower binding to GM2 and GD2, as deduced by glycan microarrays. In contrast, the MGLshort H259T failed to interact with sialyl-Tn, LDNF, GM2, or GD2 on the array, whereas αGalNAc, the core 6 structure, and LDN were still bound (Fig. 1B). None of the MGL variants interacted with the core 1/T antigen, LacNAc, Lewis X, lactosylceramide, or GM3 structures on this array. Next, we performed ELISA-based binding assays using polyacrylamide (PAA)-coupled glycoconjugates. All MGL variants, including the mutant, strongly bound the PAA-coupled GalNAc (Fig. 1C). Recognition of PAA-coupled sialyl-Tn and LDN by MGLshort and MGLlong was comparable, whereas MGLshort H259T showed diminished binding to both. Again, no binding could be detected to galactose, core 1/T antigen, or Lewis X. In contrast to the glycan microarray, no differential binding between MGLshort and MGLlong to the LDN moiety could be observed. The discrepancy with glycan microarrays might be explained by the multivalent nature of the PAA-glycoconjugate (20–25 glycans/molecule) versus the monovalent presentation on the array. Overall, the carbohydrate recognition profiles of MGLshort and MGLlong appeared to be quite similar; therefore, we focused our further investigations on the differential recognition of MGLshort and the MGLshort H259T mutant. Although the Thr111 amino acid (corresponding to His259 in human MGL) has been implicated in the exclusive Lewis X specificity of mouse MGL1 (16Sakakura M. Oo-Puthinan S. Moriyama C. Kimura T. Moriya J. Irimura T. Shimada I. Carbohydrate binding mechanism of the macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin 1 revealed by saturation transfer experiments.J. Biol.

Nevertheless, the His259 seems essential for binding extended GalNAc structures, such as the sialyl-Tn and glycosphingolipids, and might therefore be a critical component of a secondary binding site in the MGL CRD. To further extract carbohydrate determinants associated with MGL binding, we analyzed our array results using the publicly available Glycopattern web-based resource (https://glycopattern.emory.edu)7 (18Agravat S.B. Saltz J.H. Cummings R.D. Smith D.F.

We first employed the GlycanMotifMiner to discover glycan binding motifs for MGLshort and MGLshort H259T. A binding motif was defined as a structural glycan element that contained the motif and was classified as an MGL-binding glycan. For both MGL variants, we identified the extended core 6 O-glycan Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–6GalNAc as the main glycan-binding motif (Table 1). In addition, MGLshort recognized the LDN motif and the globoside glycolipid GalNAcβ1–3Gal (Gb4Cer). The MGLshort H259T only seemed to favor core 6–derived structures (Table 1). Although not identified as a glycan-binding motif, some additional glycans emerged as high-affinity ligands for MGL on the glycan microarray. These included the single α- and β-GalNAc and 6-sulfated LDN (Table 2).Table 1Glycan binding motifs of MGLshort and MGLshort H259T Open table in a new tab Table 2High-affinity ligands for MGLshort and MGLshort H259T Open table in a new tab To evaluate the differential glycan binding of MGLshort and MGLshort H259T, we used the side-by-side comparison tool in the Glycopattern software. Here, we identified 10 glycan structures that displayed high binding to MGLshort, but failed to interact with the MGLshort H259T (Table 3). Five of these contain the GalNAcα1–3(Fucα1–2)Galβ blood group A antigen. Furthermore, we observed diminished binding to the synthetic GalNAcβ1–3GalNAcα epitope, the ganglioside GM2, sialylated LDN, a synthetic ganglioside containing polysialic acid, and the Forssman antigen (GalNAcα1–3GalNAcβ) (Table 3).Table 3Differential glycan binding of MGLshort H259T Open table in a new tab The lectin and antibody-mediated recognition of GalNAc moieties in Tn-containing mucin structures seems to be fine-tuned by the peptide backbone (19Borgert A.

After proliferation, the IEE cells differentiate into enamel-secreting ameloblasts. Proliferative IEE cells persist near the apical tip of the root, and these cells continue to invaginate to form roots. After postnatal day 7 (P7), these cells form the Hertwig's epithelial root sheath with outer enamel epithelium. Adjacent mesenchymal cells then receive signals from the IEE cells and differentiate into odontoblasts (4Li J. Parada C. Chai Y.

Later, its expression is restricted to the ameloblast lineage (including IEE cells) and secretory and mature ameloblasts with increasing levels of its expression. Epfn is also expressed in mature odontoblasts. Epfn-deficient mice show severe enamel hypoplasia due to inhibition of IEE cell proliferation and ameloblast differentiation, but they also form supernumerary teeth due to random dental epithelial cell invagination (9Nakamura T. Fukumoto S. Yamada Y. Diverse function of epiprofin in tooth development.J. Oral Biosci. 2011; 53: 22-3010.1016/S1349-0079(11)80032-0Crossref Google Scholar). A more recent study demonstrated that Epfn regulates the balance between cell proliferation and cytodifferentiation in dental epithelial and mesenchymal cells during tooth development and morphogenesis (8Nakamura T.

Recently, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify a novel bHLH transcription factor from a tooth germ cDNA library, and we isolated a homologous sequence to Ascl5 (17He B. Chiba Y. de Vega S. Tanaka K. Yoshizaki K. Ishijima M. Yuasa K. Ishikawa M. Rhodes C. Sakai K. Zhang P. Fukumoto S. Zhou X. Yamada Y. Identification of the novel tooth-specific transcription factor AmeloD.J. Dent. Res. 2018; (in press) (30426815)10.1177/0022034518808254Google Scholar). Ascl5 was previously predicted from a database to be a pseudogene, and we modified it as a protein-coding gene. Therefore, we speculated that Ascl5 was a novel gene in tooth development, and we named it AmeloD. The AmeloD sequence has been registered in GenBank™ under accession number MG575629. AmeloD forms a heterodimer with the protein E12 and binds to E-box cis-elements on the E-cadherin promoter to suppress its transcriptional activity (17He B. Chiba Y. de Vega S. Tanaka K. Yoshizaki K. Ishijima M. Yuasa K. Ishikawa M. Rhodes C. Sakai K. Zhang P. Fukumoto S. Zhou X. Yamada Y. Identification of the novel tooth-specific transcription factor AmeloD.J. Dent. Res. 2018; (in press) (30426815)10.1177/0022034518808254Google Scholar). AmeloD is expressed in developing teeth and specifically in the IEE (17He B. Chiba Y. de Vega S. Tanaka K. Yoshizaki K. Ishijima M. Yuasa K. Ishikawa M. Rhodes C. Sakai K. Zhang P. Fukumoto S. Zhou X. Yamada Y. Identification of the novel tooth-specific transcription factor AmeloD.J. Dent. Res. 2018; (in press) (30426815)10.1177/0022034518808254Google Scholar); however, its function in tooth development is unknown. In the present study, we sought to identify the role of AmeloD in tooth development by creating AmeloD-KO mice. These KO mice showed enamel hypoplasia and a reduction in dental epithelial cell invagination, and the resulting molars had smaller crowns and shorter roots when compared with control wildtype (WT) molars. We found that AmeloD promotes proper tooth germ growth by the suppression of E-cadherin. We further analyzed the relationship between cell migration and tooth morphogenesis in AmeloD and Epfn double-knockout (AmeloD; Epfn-KO) mice. We found that AmeloD contributed to the multiple tooth formation observed in Epfn-KO mice by promoting the invagination of dental epithelial cells. Our results revealed that AmeloD acts as a suppressor of E-cadherin likely to promote dental epithelial cell migration and that it regulates the interactions between dental epithelial and mesenchymal cells to form proper tooth sizes. We first analyzed AmeloD expression during tooth development. We performed immunostaining of AmeloD in molars at E12, E14, and E17 and at P10 (Fig. 1). AmeloD was expressed in the thickening dental epithelium in E12 molars and in the invaginating epithelium in E14 molars. In P10 molars, AmeloD was not expressed in the differentiated ameloblasts, but it was expressed in the IEE cells in the apical root tip. These results indicate that AmeloD was expressed in the early stage of IEE. However, although AmeloD was strongly expressed in proliferating IEE cells, it was no longer expressed once the IEE cells differentiated into ameloblasts, in agreement with a previous observation by He et al. (17He B. Chiba Y. de Vega S. Tanaka K. Yoshizaki K. Ishijima M. Yuasa K. Ishikawa M. Rhodes C. Sakai K. Zhang P. Fukumoto S. Zhou X. Yamada Y. Identification of the novel tooth-specific transcription factor AmeloD.J. Dent. Res. 2018; (in press) (30426815)10.1177/0022034518808254Google Scholar). We also sought to identify the in vivo function of AmeloD by using zinc-finger nuclease technology to create AmeloD-KO mice (Fig. 2A). We analyzed the genotype of these mice by DNA sequencing (Fig. 2B) and obtained two mouse lines that had an identical deletion of 1 bp in the cut site; this deletion caused a frameshift and induced an early termination codon. In WT mice, the AmeloD protein consists of 188 amino acids (aa) and contains a bHLH domain. By contrast, the AmeloD-KO mice expressed a premature AmeloD protein consisting of only 19 aa (Fig. 2C). Consequently, Western blotting of protein extracts (Fig. 2D) and immunostaining using the anti-AmeloD antibody (Fig. 2E) did not detect the truncated AmeloD in P1 AmeloD-KO molars. The two AmeloD-KO mouse lines showed the same phenotype. The AmeloD-KO mice were fertile. However, the incisors of 6-week-old mice were chalky white in color, indicating enamel hypoplasia (Fig. 2F, a and b). Radiographic analysis of the heads of the 6-week-old AmeloD-KO mice revealed a length of the incisors similar to that determined in WT mice (Fig. 2F, c and d). Conversely, the roots were shorter in the AmeloD-KO molars than in the WT molars (Fig. 2F, e and f). We extracted WT and AmeloD-KO molars from 6-week-old mice; at this age, root formation was completed (Fig. 2F). Measurements of tooth crown height and root length revealed that AmeloD-KO teeth had smaller crowns and roots when compared with WT teeth (Fig. 2G). We also used micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to analyze the phenotypes of the lower molars of 6-week-old WT and AmeloD-KO mice (Fig. 3A). The WT and AmeloD-KO teeth differed in size as the AmeloD-KO molars developed smaller cusps (Fig. 3A). The total enamel volume and dentin volume were also about 20% smaller in the AmeloD-KO molars than in the WT molars (Fig. 3B). Six-week-old WT and AmeloD-KO mice had similar incisor volumes. We examined the effects of deletion of AmeloD on incisor size by micro-CT analysis of the P11 mandible; at this age, the incisor had not yet erupted (Fig. 3C). This micro-CT analysis revealed that the size of the incisors and molars at the age of P11 and the total and combined volumes of enamel and dentin in the incisors and molars were smaller in AmeloD-KO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 3D). We also analyzed the developing molars to determine the histological details of the tooth abnormalities (Fig. 3E). We used hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining to analyze the histological differences between WT and AmeloD-KO molars. The bud stage (E13) molars showed no obvious histological differences. After the crown formation (P14), the enamel thickness and dentin thickness were thinner in AmeloD-KO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 3F), and this resulted in a smaller crown size in the AmeloD-KO mice. At this P14 stage, the developing root width was also smaller in the AmeloD-KO molars. These results indicate that deletion of AmeloD inhibited tooth germ growth. The AmeloD-KO mice had small teeth and enamel hypoplasia. Tooth size is related to dental epithelial proliferation and expansion of the tooth germ. We used immunofluorescence staining of Ki67, a proliferation marker, to determine the effect of AmeloD on the proliferation of the IEE cells in P1 WT and AmeloD-KO incisors (Fig. 4A). Ki67 was strongly expressed at an early stage in IEE cells in WT incisors (Fig. 4A). The Ki67-positive area was expanded in AmeloD-KO mice, indicating that deletion of AmeloD may affect the proliferation activity of the IEE cells or expansion of the area of Ki67-positive cells caused by the inhibition of IEE cell differentiation. We used an EdU labeling assay and the molar tooth germ to examine whether the deletion of AmeloD influences the proliferation of IEE cells (Fig. 4B). We found that the numbers of EdU-positive cells did not differ between WT and AmeloD-KO mice (Fig. 4C). We also examined the effect of AmeloD on dental epithelial proliferation in vitro. Overexpression of the AmeloD gene in the cervical loop–derived dental epithelial (CLDE) cell line resulted in high expression of AmeloD (Fig. 4D) without affecting the proliferation of these cells (Fig. 4E). Similar results were observed in EdU incorporation assays (Fig. 4F). These results suggested that IEE cell proliferation may not be affected by AmeloD expression. Tooth germ growth is regulated by the migration and proliferation of IEE cells, and E-cadherin negatively regulates cell migration in these cells (3Li C.Y. Cha W. Luder H.U. Charles R.P. McMahon M. Mitsiadis T.A. Klein O.D. E-cadherin regulates the behavior and fate of epithelial stem cells and their progeny in the mouse incisor.Dev.

We used immunofluorescence staining for E-cadherin to identify the mechanism of tooth growth inhibition in P1 WT and AmeloD-KO incisors (Fig. 5A). The early stage of IEE cells of WT incisors did not express E-cadherin. However, differentiation of the IEE cells into ameloblasts resulted in strong expression of E-cadherin by the ameloblasts to retain their polarity. By contrast, the IEE cells of the AmeloD-KO incisors expressed E-cadherin (Fig. 5A). We used fluorescence line intensity scans (30 pixels wide) across cell–cell junctions to quantify the expression levels of E-cadherin in the IEE cells (Fig. 5B). The IEE cells of the WT incisors showed no E-cadherin expression, whereas the IEE cells of the AmeloD-KO incisors showed significant E-cadherin expression. The SI cells of the WT and AmeloD-KO incisors showed no differences in E-cadherin expression levels. E-cadherin continued to be expressed in the proliferative IEE cells of the AmeloD-KO mice, suggesting an inhibition of migration activity of the IEE cells. We found that AmeloD suppressed the transcription of E-cadherin by binding to its promoter region (17He B. Chiba Y. de Vega S. Tanaka K. Yoshizaki K. Ishijima M. Yuasa K. Ishikawa M. Rhodes C. Sakai K. Zhang P. Fukumoto S. Zhou X. Yamada Y. Identification of the novel tooth-specific transcription factor AmeloD.J. Dent. Res. 2018; (in press) (30426815)10.1177/0022034518808254Google Scholar), suggesting that AmeloD is required for E-cadherin modulation in the IEE cells. We used adeno-GFP-AmeloD–infected CLDE cells in wound healing assays to determine the activity of AmeloD during dental epithelial cell migration (Fig. 5C). Cell migration was significantly greater in CLDE cells overexpressing AmeloD than in control CLDE cells infected with adeno-GFP. Addition of the anti-E-cadherin antibody to CLDE cells without infection promoted cell migration, suggesting that the suppression of E-cadherin induces cell migration (Fig. 5D). We then used a hanging drop culture to compare spheroid formation by the adeno-GFP-AmeloD–infected CLDE cells and the control adeno-GFP–infected cells (Fig. 5E). The control CLDE cells formed spheroids in 6 h, whereas the AmeloD-overexpressing CLDE cells and CLDE cells treated with anti-E-cadherin antibody failed to form spheroids. We quantified single cell numbers in the drops by counting cell numbers after passage through a cell strainer (Fig. 5F). We found significantly higher numbers of single cells in the drops containing AmeloD-overexpressing CLDE cells or the cells treated with anti-E-cadherin antibody than in the control infected with adeno-GFP cells (Fig. 5F). These results indicated that AmeloD expression inhibited spheroid formation through suppression of E-cadherin. The in vitro analysis revealed that AmeloD promoted migration of dental epithelial cells by inhibition of E-cadherin. During ectodermal organ development, the motility of epithelial cells affects organ morphogenesis (19Daley W.P. Matsumoto K. Doyle A.D. Wang S. DuChez B.J. Holmbeck K. Yamada K.M. Btbd7 is essential for region-specific epithelial cell dynamics and branching morphogenesis in vivo.Development. 2017; 144 (28506999): 2200-221110.1242/dev.146894Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that deletion of AmeloD in vivo inhibits tooth growth by the suppression of IEE cell motility. We examined whether the deletion of AmeloD affected incisor growth speed by performing incisor cutting and recovery assays in 6-week-old WT and AmeloD-KO mice (Fig. 6). At this age, the sizes of the incisors are similar in WT and AmeloD-KO mice as shown in Fig. 2F; this is because the continuous growth of the incisors might overcome the potential growth rate differences in the AmeloD-KO incisors. The lower left incisor was clipped to one-half its length on day 0, and we observed the rate of incisor growth by measuring incisor length at day 3 postcutting (Fig. 6A). At day 3, the WT incisors had recovered to almost the length of the uncut right lower incisor (Fig. 6A, middle panel). By contrast, the AmeloD-KO incisors did not recover their length. We quantified the growth speed of the recovered incisors by measuring their total length 3 days after cutting (Fig. 6B). The relatively slow recovery of the AmeloD-KO incisors suggests that a reduction in IEE cell motility had affected tooth growth speed; i.e. the deletion of AmeloD inhibits incisor growth, likely due to the inhibition of IEE cell motility. Our data suggested an important role for AmeloD in IEE cell migration and invagination; therefore, we hypothesized that AmeloD could be involved in the random dental epithelium invasions into the mesenchyme region observed in Epfn-KO teeth. Epiprofin, an Sp zinc-finger family transcription factor, is essential for ameloblast development. Epfn is expressed in the IEE, ameloblasts, and odontoblasts (7Nakamura T. de Vega S. Fukumoto S.

However, it is unknown whether HOXC6 regulates cervical cancer progression. In this study, we used quantitative PCR and Western blots to demonstrate that HOXC6 overexpression is associated with cervical cancer progression. These results are also supported by the public RNA-seq data showing that HOXC6 overexpression is correlated with poor patient survival. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that enhanced HOXC6 expression results in cervical cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, anchorage colony formation, and xenograft tumor growth. Mechanistically, we show that HOXC6 up-regulates BCL2 expression through transcription regulation. Together, these results led us to conclude that overexpression of HOXC6 expression can enhance BCL2-mediated antiapoptotic effects to promote cervical cancer cell cycle progression and proliferation.-Wang, Y., Wang, C., Liu, N., Hou, J., Xiao, W., Wang, H.

Biomarkers of type I (C1M), III (C3A, C3M), IV (C4M), V (C5M) and VI (C6M) collagen degradation and type I (PRO-C1), II (PRO-C2), III (PRO-C3), IV (PRO-C4), V (PRO-C5) and VI (PRO-C6) collagen formation were measured in serum. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to test for differences in biomarker levels and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to investigate the ability of the biomarkers to separate groups. Results In early diffuse SSc, formation biomarkers of type III, IV, V and VI collagen were significantly increased compared to asymptomatic controls (p<0.0001). Moreover, in early diffuse SSc formation biomarkers of type III, V and VI collagen were significantly increased compared to late diffuse SSc (p = 0.0006, 0.003 and 0.004, respectively). Type I (p<0.0001), III (C3M: p = 0.001, and C3A: p = 0.02), IV (p<0.0001) and VI (p<0.0001) collagen degradation biomarkers significantly increased in early diffuse SSc compared to controls. C4M, C6M, PRO-C4, PRO-C5 and PRO-C6 had an AUC of >0.85 when assessing asymptomatic controls vs. diffuse SSc. Biomarkers of type VI collagen (PRO-C6 and C6M) turnover had the best separation with an AUC’s of >0.90. Conclusion Formation biomarkers of ECM turnover were shown to be significantly different between asymptomatic controls and diffuse SSc. This pilot study suggest that serological biomarkers of the ECM turnover is potentially applicable in SSc."
https://openalex.org/W2902575894,"This study reports the construction of high density linkage maps of Japanese plum (Prunus salicina Lindl.) using single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs), obtained with a GBS strategy. The mapping population (An x Au) was obtained by crossing cv. “Angeleno” (An) as maternal line and cv. “Aurora” (Au) as the pollen donor. A total of 49,826 SNPs were identified using the peach genome V2.1 as a reference. Then a stringent filtering was carried out, which revealed 1,441 high quality SNPs in 137 An x Au offspring, which were mapped in eight linkage groups. Finally, the consensus map was built using 732 SNPs which spanned 617 cM with an average of 0.96 cM between adjacent markers. The majority of the SNPs were distributed in the intragenic region in all the linkage groups. Considering all linkage groups together, 85.6% of the SNPs were located in intragenic regions and only 14.4% were located in intergenic regions. The genetic linkage analysis was able to co-localize two to three SNPs over 37 putative orthologous genes in eight linkage groups in the Japanese plum map. These results indicate a high level of synteny and collinearity between Japanese plum and peach genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2903117958,"Wheat aphids damage wheat plants directly by feeding on them and indirectly by transmitting plant pathogenic viruses, both of which result in low yield and plant death. Due to their high root absorption and systemic characteristics, neonicotinoid insecticidal seed treatments are increasingly applied to control wheat aphids throughout the growing season in China. Ecological concerns are raised in some research, because neonicotinoids can persist and accumulate in soils. They are prone to leach into waterways, and are found in crop nectars and pollens, where they may be harmful to pollinators. Less information is available about the effect of neonicotinoid seed treatments on soil microorganisms. Here, we posed the hypothesis that neonicotinoids are not harmful to soil microbial communities. We tested our hypothesis by evaluating the effects of two neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and clothianidin, on soil microbiomes using high-throughput sequencing during three points in the wheat growth season. Except for the imidacloprid-treated soil in the seedling stage, the community richness and diversity were not affected according to Chao1, ACE and the Shannon indices, and species distribution histogram at the phylum level. However, Beta diversity indices showed that the species richness of the bacterial and fungal community was suppressed by neonicotinoids in seedling stage (high neonicotinoids concentrations), whereas by the reviving period, the changes reverted into stimulation of the soil microorganisms (low neonicotinoids concentrations). Overall, the general microbiome recovered at the end of the wheat planting season. Generally, wheat seed dressing with neonicotinoid insecticides control aphids during the entire growth period, and have no lasting adverse effects on the soil microbiome. This study provides an understanding of the influence of neonicotinoids on crop land ecology at the level of soil microbe communities."
https://openalex.org/W2903493845,"Freshwater fish populations are rapidly declining globally due to the impacts of rapid climate change and existing non-climatic anthropogenic stressors. In response to these drivers, freshwater fishes are responding by shifting their distribution range, altering the timing of migration and spawning and through demographic processes. By 2050, the mean daily air temperature is predicted to increase by 2 to 3 degrees C in insular Newfoundland and by 3 to 4 degrees C in Labrador. Mean daily precipitation is also projected to increase in all locations, with increased intensity projected for several regions. To mitigate negative consequences of these changes, managers require analytical approaches that describe the vulnerability of fish to climate change. To address this need, the current study adopts the National Marine Fisheries Service vulnerability assessment framework to characterize the vulnerability of freshwater fishes in Newfoundland and Labrador. Twelve vulnerability indicators were developed from an extensive literature review and applied to the assessment. Experts were solicited using an online questionnaire survey and scores for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity were collated and analyzed to derive a final vulnerability score and rank for each species. The analysis showed one species to be of high—very high vulnerability, two species were highly vulnerable while four species were moderately vulnerable to climate change. The result provides insight into the factors that drive vulnerability of freshwater fishes in the region, this information is significant to decision-makers and other stakeholders engaged in managing freshwater fish resources in Newfoundland and Labrador."

The mechanisms that contribute to rapid cell lysis are largely unexplored. Here, we show that cell lysis may be enabled by a process of toxins targeting receptor clusters and present indirect evidence for receptor “recycling” that allows multiple toxin pores to be formed close together. With the use of live cell single-molecule super-resolution imaging, Förster resonance energy transfer and nanoscale total internal reflection fluorescence colocalization microscopy, we visualized toxin pore formation in the presence of its natural docking ligand. We demonstrate disassociation of hC5aR from toxin complexes and simultaneous binding of new ligands.

https://openalex.org/W2902265131,"Background and aim The majority of seasonal influenza vaccines are trivalent, containing two A virus strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and one B virus strain. The co-circulation of two distinct lineages of B viruses can lead to mismatch between the influenza B virus strain recommended for the trivalent seasonal vaccine and the circulating B virus. This has led some manufacturers to produce quadrivalent influenza vaccines containing one strain from each B lineage in addition to H1N1 and H3N2 strains. However, it is also important to know whether vaccines containing a single influenza B strain can provide cross-protectivity against viruses of the antigenically distinct lineage. The aim of this study was to assess in naïve ferrets the potential cross-protective activity of trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (T-LAIV) against challenge with a heterologous wild-type influenza B virus belonging to the genetically different lineage and to compare this activity with effectiveness of quadrivalent LAIV (Q-LAIV) in the ferret model. Methods and results Ferrets were vaccinated with either one dose of trivalent LAIV containing B/Victoria or B/Yamagata lineage virus, or quadrivalent LAIV (containing both B lineages), or placebo. They were then challenged with B/Victoria or B/Yamagata lineage wild-type virus 28 days after vaccination. The ferrets were monitored for clinical signs and morbidity. Nasal swabs and lung tissue samples were analyzed for the presence of challenge virus. Antibody response to vaccination was assessed by routine hemagglutination inhibition assay. All LAIVs tested were found to be safe and effective against wild-type influenza B viruses based on clinical signs, and virological and histological data. The absence of interference between vaccine strains in trivalent and quadrivalent vaccine formulations was confirmed. Trivalent LAIVs were shown to have the potential to be cross-protective against infection with genetically different influenza B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages. Conclusions In this ferret model, quadrivalent vaccine provided higher protection to challenge against both B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineage viruses. However, T-LAIV provided some cross-protection in the case of a mismatch between circulating and vaccine type B strains. Notably, B/Victoria-based T-LAIV was more protective compared to B/Yamagata-based T-LAIV."

To this purpose, three within-subjects experiments were run, which differed among them in terms of stimuli (audiovisual congruent vs audiovisual incongruent; audio only vs video only) and/or in terms of number of possible answers. In particular, expert volleyball players were asked to predict the length of temporally occluded overhand serves, choosing among either two or three possible landing sectors. Response accuracy and response times were measured. For the incongruent stimuli, the results revealed that the percentage of predictions in line with early auditory information was significantly higher than the respective percentage of predictions in line with early visual information. For unimodal stimuli, prediction accuracy was significantly higher on the basis of auditory information than on the basis of visual information, without any difference on response times. Taken together, the results highlighted the relevance of early auditory information for the prediction of volleyball serves' length."

https://openalex.org/W2902374497,"Development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is regulated by interactive effects of genetic and environmental risk factors. The most significant genetic risk factor for AD is the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E ( APOE4), which has been shown to exert greater AD risk in women. An important modifiable AD risk factor is obesity and its associated metabolic dysfunctions. Whether APOE genotype might interact with obesity in females to regulate AD pathogenesis is unclear. To investigate this issue, we studied the effects of Western diet (WD) on female EFAD mice, a transgenic mouse model of AD that includes human APOE alleles ε3 (E3FAD) and ε4 (E4FAD). EFAD mice were fed either control (10% fat, 7% sugar) or WD (45% fat, 17% sugar), and both metabolic and neuropathologic outcomes were determined. Although E4FAD mice generally exhibited poorer metabolic status at baseline, E3FAD mice showed greater diet-induced metabolic impairments. Similarly, E4FAD mice exhibited higher levels of AD-related pathology overall, but only E3FAD showed significant increases on select measures of β-amyloid pathology after exposure to WD. These data demonstrate a gene-environment interaction between APOE and obesogenic diets in females. Understanding how AD-promoting effects of obesity are modulated by genetic factors will foster the identification of at-risk populations and development of preventive interventions.-Christensen, A., Pike, C.

This research aims to evaluate the psychometric and diagnostic properties of the Taiwan version of Qmci (Qmci-TW) screen and to explore the discriminating ability of the Qmci-TW in differentiating among normal controls (NCs), MCI and dementia. Thirty-one participants with dementia and 36 with MCI and 35 NCs were recruited from a neurology department of regional hospital in Taiwan. Their results on the Qmci-TW, Taiwanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Traditional Chinese version of the Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) were compared. For analysis, we used Cronbach’s α, intraclass correlation coefficient, Spearman’s ρ, Kruskal–Wallis test, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and multivariate analysis, as appropriate. The Qmci-TW exhibited satisfactory test–retest reliability, internal consistency, and interrater reliability as well as a strong positive correlation with results from the MoCA and MMSE. The optimal cut-off score on the Qmci-TW for differentiating MCI from NC was ≤ 51.5/100 and dementia from MCI was ≤ 31/100. The MoCA exhibited the highest accuracy in differentiating MCI from NC, followed by the Qmci-TW and then MMSE; whereas, the Qmci-TW and MMSE exhibited the same accuracy in differentiating dementia from MCI, followed by the MoCA. The Qmci-TW may be a useful clinical screening tool for a spectrum of cognitive impairments."
https://openalex.org/W2952804599,"To date the LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation remains the most common genetic cause of Parkinson disease (PD) worldwide. It accounts for up to 6% of familial and approximately 1.5% of sporadic cases. LRRK2 has a kinase enzymatic domain which provides an attractive potential target for drug therapies and LRRK2 kinase inhibitors are in development. Prevalence of the p.G2019S has a variable ethnic and geographic distribution, the highest reported among Ashkenazi Jews (30% in patients with familial PD, 14% in sporadic PD, 2.0% in controls) and North African Berbers (37% in patients with familial PD, 41% in sporadic PD, and 1% in controls). Little is known about the frequency of the LRRK2 p.G2019S among populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Our group and others previously reported that the p.G2019S is absent in a small cohort of Nigerian PD patients and controls. Here we used Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assay to screen for the p.G2019S in a larger cohort of Black African PD patients (n = 126) and healthy controls (n = 54) from Nigeria. Our analysis confirmed that all patients and controls are negative for the p.G2019S mutation. This report provides further evidence that the LRRK2 p.G2019S is not implicated in PD in black populations from Nigeria and support the notion that p.G2019S mutation originated after the early human dispersal from sub-Saharan Africa. Further studies using larger cohorts and advance sequencing technology are required to underpin the genetic causes of PD in this region."

Here we investigate the ability of a non-nucleoside DNA methylation inhibitor, RG108 to induce epigenetic changes at both global and gene-specific levels in order to enhance mesenchymal cell markers, in hBMSCs. hBMSCs were treated with complete culture medium, 50 μM RG108 and DMSO for three days and subjected to viability and apoptosis assays, global and gene-specific methylation/hydroxymethylation, transcript levels’ analysis of epigenetic machinery enzymes and multipotency markers, protein activities of DNMTs and TETs, immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis for NANOG and OCT4 and flow cytometry for CD105. The RG108, when used at 50 μM, did not affect the viability, apoptosis and proliferation rates of hBMSCs or hydroxymethylation global levels while leading to 75% decrease in DNMTs activity and 42% loss of global DNA methylation levels. In addition, DNMT1 was significantly downregulated while TET1 was upregulated, potentially contributing to the substantial loss of methylation observed. Most importantly, the mesenchymal cell markers CD105, NANOG and OCT4 were upregulated being NANOG and OCT4 epigenetically modulated by RG108, at their gene promoters. We propose that RG108 could be used for epigenetic modulation, promoting epigenetic activation of NANOG and OCT4, without affecting the viability of hBMSCs. DMSO can be considered a modulator of epigenetic machinery enzymes, although with milder effect compared to RG108."

We evaluated the prospective associations between service attendance and marital stability in mid and late life considering either 1) divorce or separation; or 2) remarriage, as separate outcomes. Data were drawn from the Nurses' Health Study, a large prospective cohort study that consisted of US female nurses in their 50s at study enrollment, with repeated measures of service attendance and marital status over 14 years of follow-up from 1996-2010. During follow up, among 66,444 initially married nurses who were mainly Christians, frequent service attendance was associated with 50% lower risk of divorce (95% CI: 32%, 63%), and 52% lower risk of either divorce or separation (95%CI: 37%, 63%). Among initially divorced or separated women, frequent service attendance was not associated with subsequent likelihood of remarriage; however, among widowed women, women who attended services frequently had 49% increased likelihood of remarriage (95% CI: 13%, 97%) compared to those women who did not. The study provides evidence that in this cohort of US nurses, frequent service attendance is associated with lower risk of becoming divorced in mid- and late- life, and increased likelihood of remarriage among widowed nurses, but not among divorced or separated nurses."

The expression of specific microRNAs has demonstrated to be essential for pluripotent maintenance and cell differentiation, but not much information is available in domestic species. We aim to generate horse iPSCs, characterize them and evaluate the expression of different microRNAs (miR-302a,b,c,d, miR-205, miR-145, miR-9, miR-96, miR-125b and miR-296). Two equine iPSC lines (L2 and L3) were characterized after the reprogramming of equine fibroblasts with the four human Yamanaka‘s factors (OCT-4/SOX-2/c-MYC/KLF4). The pluripotency of both lines was assessed by phosphatase alkaline activity, expression of OCT-4, NANOG and REX1 by RT-PCR, and by immunofluorescence of OCT-4, SOX-2 and c-MYC. In vitro differentiation to embryo bodies (EBs) showed the capacity of the iPSCs to differentiate into ectodermal, endodermal and mesodermal phenotypes. MicroRNA analyses resulted in higher expression of the miR-302 family, miR-9 and miR-96 in L2 and L3 vs. fibroblasts (p<0.05), as previously shown in human pluripotent cells. Moreover, downregulation of miR-145 and miR-205 was observed. After differentiation to EBs, higher expression of miR-96 was observed in the EBs respect to the iPSCs, and also the expression of miR-205 was induced but only in the EB-L2. In addition, in silico alignments of the equine microRNAs with mRNA targets suggested the ability of miR-302 family to regulate cell cycle and epithelial mesenchymal transition genes, miR-9 and miR-96 to regulate neural determinant genes and miR-145 to regulate pluripotent genes, similarly as in humans. In conclusion, we could obtain equine iPSCs, characterize them and determine for the first time the expression level of microRNAs in equine pluripotent cells."
https://openalex.org/W2902795167,"Endogenous wound electric fields (EFs), an important and fundamental occurrence of wound healing, profoundly influence the directed migration of keratinocytes. Although numerous studies have unveiled the signals responsible for EF-biased direction, the mechanisms by which EFs promote keratinocyte motility remains to be elucidated. In our study, EFs enhanced the directed migratory speed of keratinocytes by inducing autophagic activity, thereby facilitating skin barrier restoration. Initially, we found that electrical signals directed keratinocytes to the cathode with enhanced motility parameters [ i.e., trajectory distance, trajectory speed, displacement distance, and displacement speed ( Td/ t)] and more efficient migration (directionality and Td/ t along the x axis, among others). Meanwhile, EFs induced a time-dependent increase in autophagic activity in keratinocytes, with constant autophagic flux, accompanied by increased transcription of numerous autophagy-related genes. Deficiency in Atg5, a key protein necessary for autophagosome formation, led to significant reduction of autophagy, which was accompanied by a substantial reduction in EF-stimulated directed motility. These results demonstrated a causal relationship between autophagy and EF-directed migratory speed. In addition, both cell migration under normal conditions and EF-biased directionality were autophagy independent. Thus, our findings define autophagy as an important functional regulator of electrically enhanced directed motility, adding to a growing understanding of EFs.-Yan, T., Jiang, X., Lin, G., Tang, D., Zhang, J., Guo, X., Zhang, D., Zhang, Q., Jia, J., Huang, Y.

Previous efforts to operationalize and measure post-national citizenship identities leave it open how people's stances on different issues are related and suffer from a variety of theoretical and methodological shortcomings regarding the nature of political attitudes and ideologies. A recently proposed approach conceptualizes ideologies as networks of causally connected evaluative reactions to individual issues. Individual evaluative reactions form the nodes in a network model, and these nodes can influence each other via linked edges, thereby giving rise to a dynamic thoughts system of networked political and identity-related views. To examine this system at large, we apply network analysis to data from the European Values Study. Specifically, we investigate 33 evaluative reactions regarding national and supra-national identity, diversity, global empathy, global environmentalism, immigration, and supra-national politics. The results reveal a strongly connected network of citizenship identity-related attitudes. A community analysis reveals larger clusters of strongly related evaluative reactions, which are connected via bridges and hub nodes. Centrality analysis identifies evaluative reactions that are strategically positioned in the network, and network simulations indicate that persuasion attempts targeted at such nodes have greater potential to influence the larger citizenship identity than changes of more peripheral attitude nodes. We lastly show that socio-demographic characteristics are not only associated with the overall level of post-national citizenship, but also with the network structure, suggesting that these structural differences can affect the network function as people develop national or post-national citizenship identities, or respond to external events. These results provide new insights into the structure of post-national identities and the mechanism how post-national identities might evolve. We end with a discussion of future opportunities to study networked attitudes in the context of civic and citizenship education."
https://openalex.org/W2903233429,"Dermal fibroblast cells can adopt different cell states such as proliferation, quiescence, apoptosis or senescence, in order to ensure tissue homeostasis. Proliferating (dividing) cells pass through the phases of the cell cycle, while quiescent and senescent cells exist in a non-proliferating cell cycle-arrested state. However, the reversible quiescence state is in contrast to the irreversible senescence state. Long-term quiescent cells transit into senescence indicating that cells age also when not passing through the cell cycle. Here, by label-free in vitro vibrational spectroscopy, we studied the biomolecular composition of quiescent dermal fibroblast cells and compared them with those of proliferating and senescent cells. Spectra were examined by multivariate statistical analysis using a PLS-LDA classification model, revealing differences in the biomolecular composition between the cell states mainly associated with protein alterations (variations in the side chain residues of amino acids and protein secondary structure), but also within nucleic acids and lipids. We observed spectral changes in quiescent compared to proliferating cells, which increased with quiescence cultivation time. Raman and infrared spectroscopy, which yield complementary biochemical information, clearly distinguished contact-inhibited from serum-starved quiescent cells. Furthermore, the spectra displayed spectral differences between quiescent cells and proliferating cells, which had recovered from quiescence. This became more distinct with increasing quiescence cultivation time. When comparing proliferating, (in particular long-term) quiescent and senescent cells, we found that Raman as well as infrared spectroscopy can separate these three cellular states from each other due to differences in their biomolecular composition. Our spectroscopic analysis shows that proliferating and quiescent fibroblast cells age by similar but biochemically not identical processes. Despite their aging induced changes, over long time periods quiescent cells can return into the cell cycle. Finally however, the cell cycle arrest becomes irreversible indicating senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2903435953,"Background Virtual reality (VR) has shown to be an effective distraction method in health care. However, questions remain regarding individual and VR-related factors that may modulate the effect of VR. Purpose To explore the effect of VR distraction on tactile perception thresholds in healthy volunteers, in relation to personal characteristics and interactivity of VR applications. Methods A randomized three way cross-over study was conducted to investigate the effects of active and passive VR applications in 50 healthy participants. Main outcome measures were monofilament detection thresholds (MDT) and electrical detection thresholds (EDT). Personal characteristics (e.g. age, gender, susceptibility for immersion) and immersion in the VR conditions were analyzed for their effect on VR induced threshold differences. Results The use of VR caused a significant increase in both MDT and EDT compared to the control condition (MDT: F (2, 76) = 20.174, p < 0.001; EDT F (2, 76) = 6.907, p = 0.002). Furthermore, a significant difference in favour of active VR compared to passive VR was found in MDT (p = 0.012), but not in EDT. No significant gender effect was found. There was a significant positive correlation between age and active VR distraction (r = 0.333, p = 0.018). Immersion in the VR world was positively correlated with the effect of VR, whereas visualization and daydreaming were negatively correlated with VR effects. Conclusion VR increased tactile perception thresholds, with active VR having the largest effect. Results indicate that the efficacy of VR may increase with increasing age. Gender did not affect VR susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2903491994,"The BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 is effective in treating BRAF-mutated melanoma; however, because drug resistance develops in most cases, it is critical to develop a new strategy for inhibiting drug-resistant melanoma growth. The melanoma-associated membrane glycoprotein CD63 is involved in cell proliferation and metastasis. Here, we found that cell surface CD63 suppresses the proliferation of human melanoma cells and PLX4032-resistant cells. Endogenous CD63 protein levels were negatively correlated with PLX4032 resistance of human melanoma cell lines. CD63 overexpression in these cells, in which endogenous CD63 levels are low, suppressed cell proliferation under PLX4032 treatment. The cell surface levels and average molecular mass of CD63 were increased with PLX4032 treatment because of the up-regulated polylactosamine modification caused by induced β1,3- N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 expression, which is involved in polylactosamine synthesis. Forced cell surface localization of CD63 led to reduced melanoma cell proliferation without PLX4032 treatment. CD63 overexpression in PLX4032-resistant cells, in which CD63 levels were lower and cell surface polylactosamine levels were higher than those in parental cells, effectively suppressed proliferation. Our study shows the potential of CD63 to sensitize melanoma cells to PLX4032 and to reduce the proliferation of PLX4032-resistant cells.-Kudo, K., Yoneda, A., Sakiyama, D., Kojima, K., Miyaji, T., Yamazaki, M., Yaita, S., Hyodo, T., Satow, R., Fukami, K.

Many rG4 structures located in the 5’UTRs of mRNAs act as translation repressors due to their high stability which is thought to impede ribosomal scanning. That said, it is not known if these are mRNA-specific examples, or if they are indicative of a global expression regulation mechanism of the mRNAs involved in a common pathway based on structure folding recognition. Gene-ontology analysis of mRNAs bearing a predicted rG4 motif in their 5’UTRs revealed an enrichment for mRNAs associated with the colorectal cancer pathway. Bioinformatic tools for rG4 prediction, and experimental in vitro validations were used to confirm and compare the folding of the predicted rG4s of the mRNAs associated with dysregulated pathways in colorectal cancer. The rG4 folding was confirmed for the first time for 9 mRNAs. A repressive effect of 3 rG4 candidates on the expression of a reporter gene was also measured in colorectal cancer cell lines. This work highlights the fact that rG4 prediction is not yet accurate, and that experimental characterization is still essential in order to identify the precise rG4 folding sequences and the possible common features shared between the rG4 overrepresented in important biological pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2903424668,"MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA that regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. MicroRNAs have been identified in various body fluids under normal conditions and their stability as well as their dysregulation in disease has led to ongoing interest in their diagnostic and prognostic potential. Circulating microRNAs may be valuable predictors of early-life complications such as birth asphyxia or neonatal seizures but there are relatively few data on microRNA content in plasma from healthy babies. Here we performed small RNA-sequencing analysis of plasma processed from umbilical cord blood in a set of healthy newborns. MicroRNA levels in umbilical cord plasma of four male and four female healthy babies, from two different centres were profiled. A total of 1,004 individual microRNAs were identified, which ranged from 426 to 659 per sample, of which 269 microRNAs were common to all eight samples. Many of these microRNAs are highly expressed and consistent with previous studies using other high throughput platforms. While overall microRNA expression did not differ between male and female cord blood plasma, we did detect differentially edited microRNAs in female plasma compared to male. Of note, and consistent with other studies of this type, adenylation and uridylation were the two most prominent forms of editing. Six microRNAs, miR-128-3p, miR-29a-3p, miR-9-5p, miR-218-5p, 204-5p and miR-132-3p were consistently both uridylated and adenylated in female cord blood plasma. These results provide a benchmark for microRNA profiling and biomarker discovery using umbilical cord plasma and can be used as comparative data for future biomarker profiles from complicated births or those with early-life developmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2902219194,"Atta bisphaerica (Forel) is a leaf-cutting ant that specializes on grass and causes productivity losses in sugar cane fields and pastures. Three phorid species, Apocephalus attophilus (Borgmeier), Myrmosicarius grandicornis (Borgmeier) and Eibesfeldtphora bragancai (Brown), have been found parasitizing A. bisphaerica workers. These parasitoids can reduce plant material transported into the nests and ant traffic on the trails. Therefore, phorid flies have been considered potential biological control agents for leaf-cutting ants. Here, we evaluated which parasitoid species attack the leaf-cutting ant A. bisphaerica in pasture areas of a Brazilian Savannah-Atlantic Forest ecotone, parasitism rate, effect of host size, sexual dimorphism and sex ratio of the emerged parasitoids. Four nests of A. bisphaerica were selected in pasture areas from August 2016 to August 2017, with 400 workers collected from each colony monthly. A total of 23,714 A. bisphaerica workers were collected during the study, of which 236 (0.99%) were parasitized by phorid parasitoids. Apocephalus attophilus, E. bragancai and M. grandicornis parasitized 217, 17 and 2 ants, respectively. The higher parasitism rate was found in the hottest/rainy season of the year. Non-parasitized ants survived longer than those parasitized by A. attophilus. The larval and pupal periods of this parasitoid were 2.2 ± 0.8 and 16 ± 1.4 days, respectively, and the number of pupae per parasitized ant ranged from 1 to 7. The number of A. attophilus pupae per host increased with the host head size. Likewise, the size of the adult parasitoids also increased according to the host ant. Apocephalus attophilus females were larger than males and the sex ratio (male: female) did not differ from 1: 1. Our results showed that A. attophilus would be a potential biocontrol agent of leaf-cutting ants because it produces multiple larvae per host, allowing a great production of parasitoids with short developmental time and kills the host ant faster than other phorids."
https://openalex.org/W2903559820,"According to early models of GPCR signaling, G proteins only interact with activated receptors. However, some GPCRs were shown to assemble with G proteins before receptor activation, in accordance with more recent models. Previously, we found that the 5-HT7 receptor, as opposed to the 5-HT4 receptor, was preassociated with Gs, but the molecular determinants for this interaction are still elusive. In a series of chimeric 5-HT7 receptors with intracellular segments from 5-HT4, we determined the receptor-G protein interaction by performing antibody-immobilized fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. We identified the intracellular loop 3 and C-tail of the 5-HT7 receptor to be responsible for the preassociation with Gs, and we further delineated the TM5 extension in the intracellular loop 3 and helix 8 in the C-tail as the molecular determinants. These chimeric exchanges converted the 5-HT7 receptor into a collision-coupled receptor that recruited G proteins only upon agonist activation, whereas reciprocal exchanges converted 5-HT4 to a preassociated receptor. The 5-HT7 receptor displayed 2-component agonist-induced Gs signaling with high and low potency. In addition, the same segments were involved in low-potency signaling and preassociation. The correspondence between Gs preassociation and low-potency Gs signaling is a novel aspect of GPCR pharmacology.-Ulsund, A. H., Dahl, M., Frimurer, T. M., Manfra, O., Schwartz, T. W., Levy, F.

https://openalex.org/W2903196728,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) implicated in numerous pathological processes, including coronary heart disease, arterial and venous thrombosis, and chronic fibrotic diseases. These associations have made PAI-1 an attractive pharmaceutical target. However, the complexity of the serpin inhibitory mechanism, the inherent metastability of serpins, and the high-affinity association of PAI-1 with vitronectin in vivo have made it difficult to identify pharmacologically effective small-molecule inhibitors. Moreover, the majority of current small-molecule PAI-1 inhibitors are poor pharmaceutical candidates. To this end and to find leads that can be efficiently applied to in vivo settings, we developed a dual-reporter high-throughput screen (HTS) that reduced the rate of nonspecific and promiscuous hits and identified leads that inhibit human PAI-1 in the high-protein environments present in vivo. Using this system, we screened >152,000 pure compounds and 27,000 natural product extracts (NPEs), reducing the apparent hit rate by almost 10-fold compared with previous screening approaches. Furthermore, screening in a high-protein environment permitted the identification of compounds that retained activity in both ex vivo plasma and in vivo. Following lead identification, subsequent medicinal chemistry and structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies identified a lead clinical candidate, MDI-2268, having excellent pharmacokinetics, potent activity against vitronectin-bound PAI-1 in vivo, and efficacy in a murine model of venous thrombosis. This rigorous HTS approach eliminates promiscuous candidate leads, significantly accelerates the process of identifying PAI-1 inhibitors that can be rapidly deployed in vivo, and has enabled identification of a potent lead compound."
https://openalex.org/W2902621149,"ATP synthase uses a rotary mechanism to couple transmembrane proton translocation to ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, which occur at the catalytic sites in the β subunits. In the presence of Mg2+, the three catalytic sites of ATP synthase have vastly different affinities for nucleotides, and the position of the central γ subunit determines which site has high, medium, or low affinity. Affinity differences and their changes as rotation progresses underpin the ATP synthase catalytic mechanism. Here, we used a series of variants with up to 45- and 60-residue-long truncations of the N- and C-terminal helices of the γ subunit, respectively, to identify the segment(s) responsible for the affinity differences of the catalytic sites. We found that each helix carries an affinity-determining segment of ∼10 residues. Our findings suggest that the affinity regulation by these segments is transmitted to the catalytic sites by the DELSEED loop in the C-terminal domain of the β subunits. For the N-terminal truncation variants, presence of the affinity-determining segment and therefore emergence of a high-affinity binding site resulted in WT-like catalytic activity. At the C terminus, additional residues outside of the affinity-determining segment were required for optimal enzymatic activity. Alanine substitutions revealed that the affinity changes of the catalytic sites required no specific interactions between amino acid side chains in the γ and α3β3 subunits but were caused by the presence of the helices themselves. Our findings help unravel the molecular basis for the affinity changes of the catalytic sites during ATP synthase rotation."
https://openalex.org/W2902943372,"We previously reported in a cross-sectional analysis an adverse relationship between weight cycling and HDL-cholesterol but not angiographic obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) among women undergoing coronary angiography for suspected ischemia in the NHLBI-sponsored Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE). We now examine the relationship between weight cycling and prospective adverse cardiovascular outcome in this group.795 women enrolled between 1996-2001 in the WISE undergoing coronary angiography for evaluation of suspected ischemia and followed for a median of 6.0 years (interquartile range = 3.4 years). Adverse outcome was defined as a composite of all-cause death, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. Weight cycling was defined as the intentional loss of at least 10 lbs. (4.5 kgs.) at least three times during the women's lifetime.Women (n = 224) who reported a history of weight cycling were younger; more often white and better educated compared those without this history. At baseline, women with a weight cycling history had lower HDL-C values, higher body mass index, larger waist circumferences and higher values for fasting blood sugar, but no difference in obstructive CAD prevalence or severity. There was an inverse relationship between weight cycling and adverse composite cardiovascular outcome, whereby fewer of women with a history of weight cycling experienced an adverse outcome as compared to non-cyclers (21% vs 29%, respectively, p = 0.03).Despite an adverse association with HDL-cholesterol in women undergoing coronary angiography for suspected ischemia, weight cycling was associated with a lower adverse outcome rate in women with suspected ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2903256502,"By the virtue of burgeoning terrorism, the exponential growth of advanced weaponry, and allied aids for explosions, it is quite evident that infrastructural facilities in the world have increasingly become more susceptible to sabotaging activities. The ever enhancing employment of reinforced concrete (RC) in the construction industry around the globe, the progressive collapse mechanisms, and respective mitigation strategies in the context of terrorism have garnered quite an attraction by the structural engineering community. The proficiency to envisage the complete collapse under the chain reaction of structural failures, partial collapse of key structural members, or the strength degradation of fundamental structural elements under the blast or impact loading can deliver significant information to cope with partial or complete structural failure. It is quite convenient to say that during the service life, a structure may experience extreme loading conditions. The current study has proposed a new methodology to cover the effect of uncertainty involved in loading on key structural elements of new and complex structures by emphasizing a very realistic structural capacity loss mechanism that allows the incremental reduction in the structural capacities of pivotal structural elements against any sort of impact loading instead of their complete annihilation. To demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology, a 13-story complex structure was selected that was comprised of a diverse structural configuration. The outcomes and results ensured the structural integrity against the applied loadings, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed methodology."
https://openalex.org/W2902692016,"An important aim of teaching philosophy in Dutch secondary schools is to learn about philosophy (that is, the great philosophers) by doing philosophy. In an earlier study published in PLoS ONE, we focused on the relationship between student learning activities and teacher behavior by analyzing eight lessons. Correspondence analysis revealed that doing philosophy was more effective in some lessons than in others. We replicated this finding in the current study, using 10 new lessons, and elaborated on the relationship between the likely causes for doing philosophy effectively. The data suggest that conducting a dialogue in the form of a philosophical discussion is sufficient for achieving an effective lesson, whereas the teachers’ guidance being shared with the students is a necessary but not sufficient condition for achieving an effective lesson."
https://openalex.org/W2903348670,"Malignant glioma (MG) is the most lethal primary brain tumor. In addition to having inherent resistance to radiation treatment and chemotherapy, MG cells are highly infiltrative, rendering focal therapies ineffective. Genes involved in MG cell migration and glial cell differentiation are up-regulated by hypophosphorylated nuclear factor I (NFI), which is dephosphorylated by the phosphatase calcineurin in MG cells. Calcineurin is cleaved and thereby activated by calpain proteases, which are, in turn, inhibited by calpastatin (CAST). Here, we show that the CAST gene is a target of NFI and has NFI-binding sites in its intron 3 region. We also found that NFI-mediated regulation of CAST depends on NFI's phosphorylation state. We noted that occupation of CAST intron 3 by hypophosphorylated NFI results in increased activation of an alternative promoter. This activation resulted in higher levels of CAST transcript variants, leading to increased levels of CAST protein that lacks the N-terminal XL domain. CAST was primarily present in the cytoplasm of NFI-hypophosphorylated MG cells, with a predominantly perinuclear immunostaining pattern. NFI knockdown in NFI-hypophosphorylated MG cells increased CAST levels at the plasma membrane. These results suggest that NFI plays an integral role in the regulation of CAST variants and CAST subcellular distribution. Along with the previous findings indicating that NFI activity is regulated by calcineurin, these results provide a foundation for further investigations into the possibility of regulatory cross-talk between NFI and the CAST/calpain/calcineurin signaling pathway in MG cells.

https://openalex.org/W2902051370,"Background Each child in Germany undergoes a preschool health examination including vision screening and recommendations for further ophthalmic care. This study investigated the frequency of and adherence to these recommendations. Methods A population-based prospective cohort study was performed in the area of Mainz-Bingen (Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany). All preschoolers were examined at the statutory preschool health examination, which includes vision testing (Rodenstock vision screener) with available correction in the last preschool year. Based on the results, recommendations for further ophthalmic care were given to the parents. Six weeks prior to school entry, parents were surveyed concerning ophthalmic health care visits, diagnoses, and treatments. Ophthalmic care recommendation frequency and its adherence were investigated using logistic regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders. Results 1226 children were included in this study, and 109 children received a recommendation for ophthalmic care based on the preschool health examination. At the follow-up, 84% of children who had received a recommendation had visited an ophthalmologist within the preceding year compared to 47% of children who had not received a recommendation. The recommendation for ophthalmic care was clearly associated with a higher number of ophthalmological visits (odds ratio = 7.63; 95% confidence interval: 3.96–14.7). In a subgroup analysis, adherence to a recommendation was lower in children with migrant background (OR = 2.26; 95%-CI: 0.64–7.90, compared to: OR = 11.6; 95%-CI: 4.95–27.4) and in those with low socio-economic status. Conclusions Adherence to preschool recommendations for ophthalmic care is high in German preschoolers. However, a migrant background and low socio-economic status may reduce this adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2902393543,"Interval mapping approaches have been playing significant role for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to discover genetic architecture of diseases or traits with molecular markers. Composite interval mapping (CIM) is one of the superior approaches of the interval mapping for discovering both linked and unlinked putative QTL positions. However, estimators of this approach are not robust against phenotypic outliers. As a result, it fails to detect true QTL positions in presence of outliers. In this study, we investigated the performance of β-Composite Interval Mapping (BetaCIM) for detecting both linked and unlinked important QTLs positions from the robustness points of views. Performance of this approach depends on the value of tuning parameter β. It reduces to the classical CIM approach for β →0. We described and formulated the cross-validation procedure for selecting trait specific optimum value of β. It was observed that the optimum value of β depends on both amount of contaminated observations and their scatteredness. BetaCIM approach discover similar QTL positions as classical IM/CIM in absence of phenotypic outliers, but gives better results in presence of phenotypic outliers in terms of detecting true QTLs and effects estimation. We formulated the generalized forms of robust QTL analysis and developed an R-package named ""BetaCIM"" by implementing this robust approach. Left and right kidney weight data sets of mouse intercross population (129 S1/SvlmJ × A/J) were analyzed by using BetaCIM, CIM, and IM approaches. For right kidney weight (RKW) CIM and BetaCIM provided similar LOD score profile, and both approaches identified 3 QTL positions. IM approach also identified 3 QTL positions. For left kidney weight (LKW), there was evidence of one outlying observation; and in this case the BetaCIM approach identified 2 QTL positions. However, none of the QTLs were significant by CIM and IM approaches at 5% level of significance. Gene expression ontology (GEO) search showed that the candidate genes (Otof and A330033J07Rik) of the identified QTLs for LKW were expressed in kidney. Both simulation and real data analysis results showed that BetaCIM approach improves the performance over the existing methods in presence of phenotypic outliers. Otherwise, it keeps almost equal performance."
https://openalex.org/W2902593437,"Serum interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) is elevated in cholestatic liver diseases and predicts response to antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPPIV) cleaves active IP-10 into an inactive form, which inhibits recruitment of CXCR3+ T cells to the liver. In this study the link between IP-10 levels, DPPIV activity in serum and CXCR3+ T cells is analysed in cholestatic and non-cholestatic liver patients.In serum DPPIV activity (by enzymatic assay), IP-10 (by ELISA) and bile acids (BA) (by enzymatic assay) were analysed in 229 naive HCV genotype (GT) 1 patients and in 16 patients with cholestatic liver disease. In a prospective follow-up (FU) cohort of 27 HCV GT 1 patients peripheral CD3+CXCR3+, CD4+CXCR3+ and CD8+CXCR3+ cells were measured by FACS.In 229 HCV patients serum IP-10 levels correlated positively to DPPIV serum activity. Higher IP-10 levels and DPPIV activity were detected in cholestatic and in cirrhotic HCV patients. Increased IP-10 serum levels were associated with therapeutic non-response to antiviral treatment with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin. In the HCV FU cohort elevated IP-10 serum levels and increased BA were associated with higher frequencies of peripheral CD3+CXCR3+, CD4+CXCR3+ and CD8+CXCR3+ T cells. Positive correlation between serum IP-10 levels and DPPIV activity was likewise validated in patients with cholestatic liver diseases.A strong correlation between elevated serum levels of IP-10 and DPPIV activity was seen in different cholestatic patient groups. Furthermore, in cholestatic HCV patients a functional link to increased numbers of peripheral CXCR3+ immune cells could be observed. The source of DPPIV release in cholestatic patients remains open."
https://openalex.org/W2902822576,"Audio description (AD) is one of the main methods that people who are blind or low vision (B/LV) use to access film, television, and theatre content. AD is a second audio track inserted into the space(s) where speech is absent, which tends to be only a few seconds. Contained in that second track is an audio description of the important visual information contained within a specific scene. However, as there is insufficient time to describe all visual information, decisions about what is important to describe and how to present that information (style) to optimize a B/LV viewer’s entertainment experience are required. Most research to date has considered only short-term, single-episode experiences to gauge viewers’ reactions to the AD content. In addition, this research typically has used a monotone, single style of audio description, which is defined as “the conventional style” in this paper. We use an integrative style instead, that is defined as ‘AD designed to fit a specific show”, and differed between shows. We carried out a within-subjects longitudinal study with eight episodes of a dark comedy, using different description styles and describers in order to assess viewer engagement and preferences for AD describer style, language use, timing, and fit to the show. Twenty-four blind participants viewed and rated all eight episodes. Major findings included that most participants found the integrative style entertaining, a fit with the specific episodes, and enjoyable. Some participants, however, preferred the conventional style and struggled with the language and topic of a dark comedy and its associated descriptions."
