IntroductionHuman immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; 1,25D3, 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol; 25D3, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol; LC3B, light chain 3B; WST-1, 4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; TCID50, 50% tissue culture infective dose; EdU, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine; hCAP18, human cationic antimicrobial protein 18. is a global health problem that at current estimates has infected 60 million people and caused 25 million deaths worldwide. Currently, there are an estimated 33 million people living with HIV-1, 2 million of whom are children (1Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic 2008, Executive Summary. Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, Geneva, Switzerland2008Google Scholar). Despite the immune defense mechanisms that the host deploys against HIV-1 and improved antiretroviral therapies, the virus persists in long-lived cells including macrophages and dendritic cells.One-third of HIV-1-infected individuals are co-infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a leading cause of death among people living with HIV-1. Studies have suggested that 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25D3), the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, exerts anti-mycobacterial effects in human macrophages in vitro (2Martineau A.R. Honecker F.U. Wilkinson R.J. Griffiths C.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 103: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (3Sly L.M.

Few publications have examined the relationship between vitamin D3 and HIV-1 disease progression and survival. However, the few studies published have shown that HIV-1-infected individuals have lower 1,25D3 levels than uninfected individuals (5Haug C. Müller F. Aukrust P. Frøland S.S. J. Infect.

Dang T. Magenta L. Calmy A. Vergopoulos A. Bischoff-Ferrari H.A. AIDS. 2010; 24: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, depressed levels of 1,25D3 are correlated with significantly lower CD4+ T cell counts and higher tumor necrosis factor levels (6Haug C.J. Aukrust P. Haug E. Mørkrid L. Müller F. Frøland S.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 3832-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Interestingly, consumption of foods rich in 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25D3), the inactive precursor for 1,25D3, correlates with an increase in CD4+ T cell counts in HIV-1-infected individuals (10de Luis D.A. Bachiller P. Aller R. de Luis J. Izaola O. Terroba M.C. Cuellar L. González Sagrado M. Nutr. Hosp. 2002; 17: 285-289PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, women with low levels of 25D3 have an increased risk of HIV-1 disease progression (11Mehta S. Giovannucci E. Mugusi F.M. Spiegelman D. Aboud S. Hertzmark E. Msamanga G.I. Hunter D. Fawzi W.W. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), with infants born to HIV-1-infected mothers with low 25D3 levels having an increased risk of acquiring HIV-1 in utero, intrapartum, and through breastfeeding while also having a higher mortality rate (12Mehta S. Hunter D.J. Mugusi F.M. Spiegelman D. Manji K.P. Giovannucci E.L. Hertzmark E. Msamanga G.I. Fawzi W.W. J. Infect. Dis. 2009; 200: 1022-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy) is a trafficking pathway whereby cytoplasmic constituents such as subcellular organelles and microbial pathogens are engulfed by autophagosomes, which fuse with lysosomes, forming autolysosomes, degrading the engulfed component. As an obligatory intracellular parasite, HIV-1 survival is dependent upon its ability to exploit host cell machinery for replication and dissemination and to circumvent cellular processes that prevent its growth. During infection, HIV-1 down-regulates Beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B-II (LC3B-II), reducing both basal autophagy and the numbers of autophagosomes per cell (13Espert L. Varbanov M. Robert-Hebmann V. Sagnier S. Robbins I. Sanchez F. Lafont V. Biard-Piechaczyk M. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Blanchet F.P. Moris A. Nikolic D.S.

However, silencing of autophagy proteins inhibits HIV-1 infection of HeLa cells (16Brass A.L. Dykxhoorn D.M. Benita Y. Yan N. Engelman A. Xavier R.J. Lieberman J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2008; 319: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein expressed on the surface of infected cells induces cell death with autophagy in uninfected bystander CD4+ T cells (17Denizot M. Varbanov M. Espert L. Robert-Hebmann V. Sagnier S. Garcia E. Curriu M. Mamoun R. Blanco J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Espert L. Denizot M. Grimaldi M.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of 1,25D3-mediated autophagy on productive HIV-1 infection of macrophages. We demonstrate that 1,25D3 induces autophagy in macrophages that inhibits HIV-1 replication.DISCUSSIONOur results demonstrate that physiological concentrations of 1,25D3 induce autophagy in human macrophages and that autophagy is required for the 1,25D3-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 replication. To our knowledge these results are the first to link the induction of autophagy with the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in macrophages.Studies of 1,25D3 as an autophagy inducer have focused on immortalized cell lines (32Høyer-Hansen M.

Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2786-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and its potential role as an anti-oncogenic drug as it induces cell death via a caspase-independent mechanism (33Wang J. Lian H. Zhao Y. Kauss M.A. Spindel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25596-25605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) at supraphysiological concentrations (32Høyer-Hansen M.

Blood. 2003; 101: 2454-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These concentrations are associated in patients with hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria that result from the increased intestinal absorption of calcium combined with the calcium-immobilizing effects of vitamin D3. Therefore, 1,25D3 or vitamin D3 analogs are being pursued as anti-cancer therapies only in combination with glucocorticoids or anti-mitotic agents (46Trump D.L. Potter D.M. Muindi J. Brufsky A. Johnson C.S. Cancer. 2006; 106: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Importantly, we observed no decrease in cell viability or increase in apoptotic cells resulting from physiologically relevant concentrations of 1,25D3 that significantly inhibited HIV-1 through autophagy.The envelope glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, activate protein kinase C and Akt, upstream effectors of the mTORC1, that trigger autophagy in uninfected cells (17Denizot M. Varbanov M. Espert L. Robert-Hebmann V. Sagnier S. Garcia E. Curriu M. Mamoun R. Blanco J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Espert L.

Oblet C. Religa A. Riquet N. Mathieu D. Yssel H. Veas F. AIDS. 2005; 19: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, the G-U-rich long terminal repeat region of the HIV-1 genome is a ligand for Toll-like receptor 8 found in monocytes (48Heil F. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Kirschning C. Akira S. Lipford G. Wagner H. Bauer S. Science. 2004; 303: 1526-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (2993) Google Scholar) that triggers downstream signaling via Toll-interleukin-1 receptor-domains activating the interferon regulatory factor, nuclear factor κ-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways leading to the induction of autophagy (49Delgado M.A. Elmaoued R.A. Davis A.S. Kyei G. Deretic V. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1110-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). As an obligatory intracellular parasite, HIV-1 survival is dependent upon its ability to exploit the host cell machinery for replication and dissemination and to circumvent cellular processes that prevent its growth. One such mechanism is that, upon infection, HIV-1 down-regulates IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4, which is essential for virtually all Toll-like receptor signaling (50Pathak S. De Souza G.A. Salte T. Wiker H.G. Asjö B. Scand. J. Immunol. 2009; 70: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that HIV-1 down-regulates autophagy in productively infected CD4+ T cells, U937 cells (15Zhou D. Spector S.A. AIDS. 2008; 22: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and myeloid dendritic cells through an Env-dependent manner (14Blanchet F.P. Moris A. Nikolic D.S. Lehmann M. Cardinaud S. Stalder R. Garcia E. Dinkins C. Leuba F. Wu L. Schwartz O. Deretic V. Piguet V. Immunity. 2010; 32: 654-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and that HIV-1 is undetectable in highly autophagic macrophages (13Espert L. Varbanov M. Robert-Hebmann V. Sagnier S. Robbins I. Sanchez F. Lafont V. Biard-Piechaczyk M. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Moreover, in myeloid cells, HIV-1 Gag co-localizes with LC3B puncta (Fig. 6) and CD9 (51Kyei G.B. Dinkins C. Davis A.S. Roberts E. Singh S.B. Dong C. Wu L. Kominami E. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Federico M. Panganiban A. Vergne I. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). These data combined with our observations that pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy and RNA interference of autophagy proteins inhibits HIV-1 replication in macrophages are consistent with the hypothesis that HIV-1 is assembled on endocytic membranes that intersect with the autophagy pathway (42Pelchen-Matthews A. Kramer B. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 52Deneka M. Pelchen-Matthews A. Byland R. Ruiz-Mateos E. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, our data obtained using wortmannin appears to be in conflict with a previous study that showed that PI3K inhibition blocked HIV infection of macrophages within 24 h (53François F. Klotman M.E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2539-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). That study used LY 294002, which has recently been shown to inhibit a large number of other kinases as well as ATP-binding proteins (34Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Klevernic I. Arthur J.S. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). Therefore, the rapidity of HIV-1 inhibition observed in that study may be due to the nonspecific inhibition of other kinases involved during HIV-1 replication. By triggering autophagy, physiologically relevant concentrations of 1,25D3 overcomes the HIV-1-mediated down-regulation of autophagy and inhibits viral replication through an autophagy-dependent mechanism without inducing apoptosis or necrosis even though the autophagic response is similar to that observed in cancer cells (33Wang J. Lian H. Zhao Y. Kauss M.A. Spindel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25596-25605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We also show that blocking 1,25D3-triggered autophagy with pharmacological inhibitors or RNA interference decreases the inhibition of HIV-1 replication. Therefore, this study demonstrates, to our knowledge for the first time, that 1,25D3 inhibits HIV-1 replication through the induction of autophagy.In this study we also show that blocking rapamycin-triggered autophagy with pharmacological inhibitors or RNA interference also decreases the inhibition of HIV-1 replication. Therefore, although it is known that rapamycin inhibits HIV-1 replication through the down-regulation of CCR5 and the inhibition of HIV-1 mRNA synthesis (54Roy J. Paquette J.S. Fortin J.F. Tremblay M.J. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 2002; 46: 3447-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 55Heredia A. Amoroso A. Davis C. Le N. Reardon E. Dominique J.K. Klingebiel E. Gallo R.C. Redfield R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10411-10416Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we demonstrate the novel finding that rapamycin also inhibits HIV-1 replication at least in part through the induction of autophagy. A recent publication observed that 50 μg/ml (54.7 μm) rapamycin treatment of HIV-1-infected cells induced higher yields of p24 antigen into the supernatant than from rapamycin-untreated cells and attributed this to the induction of autophagy (51Kyei G.B. Dinkins C. Davis A.S. Roberts E. Singh S.B. Dong C. Wu L. Kominami E. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Federico M. Panganiban A. Vergne I. Deretic V. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, rapamycin is cytotoxic at concentrations above 2 μm and induces apoptosis (56Harris J. Hanrahan O. De Haro S.A. Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2009; (Chapter 14, Unit 14, 14)PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), which may lead to the secretion of HIV-1 p24 antigen even in the absence of lactate dehydrogenase release, a marker for secondary necrosis. Moreover, in vivo concentrations of therapeutically administered rapamycin are 500–5000-fold lower, at which concentrations we and others observed the inhibition of HIV-1 replication (Fig. 3) and the induction of autophagy (15Zhou D. Spector S.A. AIDS. 2008; 22: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 57Mercalli A. Sordi V. Ponzoni M. Maffi P. De Taddeo F. Gatti G. Servida P. Bernardi M. Bellio L. Bertuzzi F. Secchi A. Bonifacio E. Piemonti L. Am. J. Transplant. 2006; 6: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, rapamycin is now being used in HIV-1-infected transplantation recipients for its potential antiretroviral activity as well as for its immunosuppressive effects (58Di Benedetto F. Di Sandro S. De Ruvo N. Montalti R. Ballarin R. Guerrini G.P. Spaggiari M. Guaraldi G. Gerunda G. Transplantation. 2010; 89: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).We also investigated the effect of extracellular LL-37 on HIV-1 replication. We observed that although HIV-1 is inhibited at LL-37 concentrations found in the plasma of healthy individuals, at the concentrations found to be elicited by macrophages in response to physiological concentrations of 1,25D3 in vitro and in the absence of 1,25D3, LL-37 is unable to induce autophagy and actually enhances HIV-1 replication. Interestingly, similar concentrations of LL-37 are found in cervicovaginal secretions where higher base-line genital levels are associated with increased acquisition of HIV-1, independent of the behavioral and immune correlates of HIV-1 acquisition (59Levinson P. Kaul R. Kimani J. Ngugi E. Moses S. MacDonald K.S. Broliden K. Hirbod T. AIDS. 2009; 23: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is possible that endogenous hCAP18 may be more relevant than the secreted LL-37, as Yuk et al. (4Yuk J.M. Shin D.M. Lee H.M. Yang C.S. Jin H.S. Kim K.K. Lee Z.W. Lee S.H. Kim J.M. Jo E.K. Cell Host. Microbe. 2009; 6: 231-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) clearly showed that hCAP18 is upstream of Beclin-1 and ATG5 induction post-supraphysiological levels of 1,25D3 treatment (20 nm). However, we observed no role for exogenous LL-37 in 1,25D3-mediated autophagy at physiological concentrations (12.5–100 pm).Vitamin D3 deficiency is conservatively defined as <50 nm 25D3, which is the estimated mean concentration of 25D3 present in people worldwide (60Hagenau T. Vest R. Gissel T.N. Poulsen C.S. Erlandsen M. Mosekilde L. Vestergaard P. Osteoporos. Int. 2009; 20: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). A number of studies have found that the concentrations of vitamin D3 metabolites in HIV-1-infected persons are lower than that of uninfected controls (5Haug C. Müller F. Aukrust P. Frøland S.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 169: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Haug C.J. Aukrust P. Haug E. Mørkrid L. Müller F. Frøland S.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Giovannucci E. Mugusi F.M. Spiegelman D. Aboud S. Hertzmark E. Msamanga G.I. Hunter D. Fawzi W.W. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, a history of AIDS-defining events is associated with lower 1,25D3 concentrations (7Mueller N.J. Fux C.A. Ledergerber B. Elzi L. Schmid P. Dang T. Magenta L. Calmy A. Vergopoulos A. Bischoff-Ferrari H.A. AIDS. 2010; 24: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The major source of vitamin D3 is through the endogenous photochemical conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to previtamin D3 by ultraviolet B light exposure, which then undergoes a 1,7-sigmatropic hydrogen transfer forming cholecalciferol. This is then transferred from the skin by the vitamin D-binding protein and is subsequently hydroxylated by 25-hydroxylase CYP2R1 in hepatocytes to form 25D3 in a poorly regulated manner. Lesser amounts of vitamin D3 metabolites are also consumed through fortified dairy products and oily fish. Vitamin D3 status, therefore, is largely dependent upon the availability of cholecalciferol. Why HIV-1-infected individuals tend to have lower levels of 1,25D3 and/or 25D3 is largely unknown but is thought to be related to inadequate renal 1α-hydroxylation mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or antiretroviral drugs (6Haug C.J.

Four genes contribute to the variability of serum 25D3 concentrations: 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (involved in cholesterol synthesis and the availability of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin), 25-hydroxylase CYP2R1 and CYP24A1 (degrades and recycles vitamin D3), and GC, which encodes for the vitamin d-binding protein. Genetic variations at these loci were recently identified in individuals who have a substantially increased risk of vitamin D insufficiency (62Wang T.J. Zhang F. Richards J.B.

Studies to assess the genetic variations at these loci and their impact on HIV-1 progression and disease status are now under way.In summary, this study demonstrates a role for autophagy during the early phases of HIV-1 infection and a potential link between vitamin D3 and rapamycin-induced autophagy and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in macrophages. Whether vitamin D3 supplementation will be a useful adjunct to antiretroviral treatment of HIV-1-infected persons is unknown but is testable through clinical trials. Dissecting the molecular mechanisms by which HIV-1 utilizes autophagic machinery will greatly enhance our understanding of this critical nexus in the host-virus relationship that in turn may lead to the development of novel strategies to prevent and treat HIV-1 infection and related opportunistic infections.

Currently, there are an estimated 33 million people living with HIV-1, 2 million of whom are children (1Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic 2008, Executive Summary. Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, Geneva, Switzerland2008Google Scholar). Despite the immune defense mechanisms that the host deploys against HIV-1 and improved antiretroviral therapies, the virus persists in long-lived cells including macrophages and dendritic cells.One-third of HIV-1-infected individuals are co-infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a leading cause of death among people living with HIV-1. Studies have suggested that 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25D3), the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, exerts anti-mycobacterial effects in human macrophages in vitro (2Martineau A.R.

To identify the genes and encoded enzymes responsible for santalene biosynthesis, we cloned and characterized three orthologous terpene synthase (TPS) genes SaSSy, SauSSy, and SspiSSy from three divergent sandalwood species; Santalum album, S. austrocaledonicum, and S. spicatum, respectively. The encoded enzymes catalyze the formation of α-, β-, epi-β-santalene, and α-exo-bergamotene from (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate (E,E-FPP). Recombinant SaSSy was additionally tested with (Z,Z)-farnesyl diphosphate (Z,Z-FPP) and remarkably, found to produce a mixture of α-endo-bergamotene, α-santalene, (Z)-β-farnesene, epi-β-santalene, and β-santalene. Additional cDNAs that encode bisabolene/bisabolol synthases were also cloned and functionally characterized from these three species. Both the santalene synthases and the bisabolene/bisabolol synthases reside in the TPS-b phylogenetic clade, which is more commonly associated with angiosperm monoterpene synthases. An orthologous set of TPS-a synthases responsible for formation of macrocyclic and bicyclic sesquiterpenes were characterized. Strict functionality and limited sequence divergence in the santalene and bisabolene synthases are in contrast to the TPS-a synthases, suggesting these compounds have played a significant role in the evolution of the Santalum genus.

Sandalwood fragrance biosynthesis involves sesquiterpene synthases of both the terpene synthase (TPS)-a and TPS-b subfamilies, including santalene synthases.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 287Issue 45PreviewVOLUME 286 (2011) PAGES 17445–17454 Full-Text PDF Open Access Santalum album L. is a slow-growing hemi-parasitic tree, which has long been exploited for its fragrant heartwood. Other species such as S. spicatum, native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia (WA) and S. austrocaledonicum from Vanuatu and New Caledonia, have also contributed substantially to the fragrance market (1Jones C.G. Plummer J.A. Barbour E.L. Byrne M. Silvae Genet. 2009; 58: 279-286Crossref Google Scholar). Unsustainable demand for sandalwood has led to the establishment of plantations to add supply. Knowledge of the molecular and physiological underpinnings of sandalwood oil biosynthesis will advance plantation development through improved management and selection. Sandalwood heartwood contains a complex mixture of sesquiterpene olefins and alcohols (Fig. 1) with (+)-α-santalene, (−)-β-santalene, (−)-α-exo-bergamotene, (+)-epi-β-santalene, and β-bisabolene frequently representing about 1–2% by weight of oil (2Jones C.G.

The more odor intensive compounds, α- and β-santalol, α-exo-bergamotol, and epi-β-santalol, as well as (Z)-lanceol and α-bisabolol make up the bulk of S. album oil, but are often lower and more variable in S. austrocaledonicum (4Page T.

J. 1997; 12: 43-46Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The compounds found in sandalwood oil may play an important role in warding off pathogens, as sesquiterpenoids have been implicated in plant pathogen defense strategies (6Gershenzon J. Dudareva N. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Santalol biosynthesis is proposed to proceed by multiple Wagner-Meerwein rearrangements of transoid farnesyl diphosphate, (E,E)-FPP, 3The abbreviations used are: FPPfarnesyl diphosphateTPSterpene synthase. followed by oxidation at C12, probably via a cytochrome P450 (Fig. 1). Co-occurrence patterns of the santalenes and bergamotene, as well as other olefins and bisabolol, indicated that multi-product TPS enzymes may be responsible for the production of several sandalwood oil components (2Jones C.G. Ghisalberti E.L. Plummer J.A. Barbour E.L. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Multiple product formation from terpene synthase (TPS) enzymes in S. album was recently confirmed by characterization of two TPSs, however these were not responsible for santalene biosynthesis (7Jones C.G. Keeling C.I. Ghisalberti E.L. Barbour E.L. Plummer J.A. Bohlmann J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 477: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The commercially exploited sandalwoods possess unique chemical phenotypes (3Howes M.J. Simmonds M.S. Kite G.C. J. Chromatogr. A. 2004; 1028: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas others such as S. accuminatum and S. murrayanum, endemic to southwestern WA, produce little or no oil (8.Applegate, G. B., Chamberlain, J., Daruhi, G., Feigelson, J. L., Hamilton, L., McKinnell, F. H., Neil, P. E., Rai, S. N., Rodehn, P., Statham, P., Stemmermann, L., (1990) in Proceedings of the Symposium on Sandalwood in the Pacific April 9–11, (Hamilton, L., Conrad, C. E., eds), pp 1–11, US Forest Service, Honolulu, Hawaii.Google Scholar). Despite this variation, the santalenes and their hydroxylated equivalents remain key components. To better understand essential oil biosynthesis as well as the molecular origins of chemical diversity in the Santalum genus, we cloned and functionally characterized several TPS cDNAs from three divergent oil-producing Santalum species, S. album, S. austrocaledonicum, and S. spicatum. We also compared genomic TPS sequences of the three commercial Santalum species to those of S. murranyanum to test if the absence of, or open reading frame mutations in the genes accounted for the oil-deficient phenotype of this species. farnesyl diphosphate terpene synthase. All reagents, solvents, antibiotics, cloning kits, modifying enzymes, and precursor chemicals were purchased from commercial sources. (E,E)-FPP and geranyl diphosphate (GPP) were from Sigma. (Z,Z)-FPP was synthesized using standard methods (9Xie H. Shao Y. Becker J.M. Naider F. Gibbs R.A. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 65: 8552-8563Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Shao Y. Eummer J.T. Gibbs R.A. Org. Lett. 1999; 1: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and products verified by GC-MS, NMR, and IR spectroscopy. Monoterpene standards were from an in-house collection of commercially available standards. An olefin fraction of sandalwood oil yielded a santalene standard (see below under GC-MS analysis and product identification). Several 25 mm holes were drilled into the lower stems of mature S. album, S. austrocaledonicum, S. spicatum, and S. murrayanum trees growing on land managed by the Forest Products Commission of Western Australia. Wood shavings from the heartwood-sapwood transition zone were collected and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. The samples were transported to the lab where RNA was extracted from 10 g of tissue using an established protocol (11Kolosova N. Miller B. Ralph S. Ellis B.E. Douglas C. Ritland K. Bohlmann J. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 821-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After precipitation by LiCl, RNA was stored at −80 °C until needed for reverse transcription and RACE. S. album RNA was transported to UBC Vancouver, Canada for cDNA library construction. Xylem total RNA from S. album (1.4 μg) was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a cDNA library was constructed using the SMART-Creator kit with the pDNR-LIB vector (Clontech). The ligation mixture was transformed by electroporation into 25 μl of phage resistant electrocompetent Escherichia coli cells and Sangar-sequenced at the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, Vancouver, Canada. Reads were assembled using the CAP3 program with default settings. The sequences (∼6000 unique reads) were compared with the GenBankTM database for key specialized metabolism genes, particularly prenyltransferases and TPS genes. The following sequences have been deposited into the GenBankTM database: SaSSy (HQ343276); SauSSy (HQ343277); SspiSSy (HQ343278); SauBS (HQ343279); SspiBS (HQ343280); SauSesquiTPS (HQ343281); SspiSesquiTPS (HQ343282), SaSTPS gDNA (JF746807); SauSTPS gDNA (JF746808); SspiSTPS gDNA (JF746809); SmSTPS gDNA (JF746810); SmSSy (JF746811); SaSSy (JF746812); SauBS gDNA (JF746813); SmBS (JF746814); SaMonoTPS1 gDNA (JF746815). cDNA was generated for S. austrocaledonicum, S. spicatum, and S. murrayanum in the same manner as before, except the cDNA was used directly as template for PCR. Primers based on the open reading frame (ORF) of previously identified S. album TPS genes were used for amplification (7Jones C.G. Keeling C.I. Ghisalberti E.L. Barbour E.L. Plummer J.A. Bohlmann J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 477: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). Where products could not be amplified, 5′- and 3′-RACE using the Clontech SMARTerTM kit was used to obtain the respective untranslated regions for more specific primer design. SaSesquiTPS1 gene orthologs were amplified in two rounds using a nested primer approach. All products were first cloned into a high-copy storage vector (TOPO Zero Blunt, Invitrogen, or pJET1.2, Fermentas) for sequencing before being subcloned into pET28b(+). Several individuals of S. album and S. spicatum were studied to examine if polymorphisms were present in the ORFs across populations of these two species. No TPS genes could be amplified from S. murrayanum cDNA, although this could be due to exceedingly low transcript abundance. Genomic DNA sequences for all three TPS genes were also cloned and sequenced for all three Santalum species. The same ORF primers used for successful cDNA amplifications were used on genomic DNA extracted from the same individuals from which RNA extractions were performed. These larger gDNA fragments (3–4 kb) were cloned into pJET1.2 vectors and sent for sequencing (Macrogen, Korea). Genomic DNA sequences of TPS genes from the three oil-bearing species were spliced in-silico with introns following the usual 3′ n/GT and 5′ AG/n pattern (12Trapp S.C. Croteau R.B. Genetics. 2001; 158: 811-832PubMed Google Scholar). Santalum murrayanum intron-exon patterns were determined by comparing the gDNA sequences to cDNAs of S. spicatum. Sequences were aligned using ClustalX 2.1.0, trees were constructed using Phylip (13Felsenstien J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) and visualized with the Phylodraw 0.8 program. Sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis are listed in full under supplemental Fig. S2. Genomic DNA sequences of TPS genes from the three oil-bearing species were spliced in-silico with introns following the usual 3′ n/GT and 5′ AG/n pattern (12Trapp S.C. Croteau R.B. Genetics. 2001; 158: 811-832PubMed Google Scholar). S. murrayanum intron-exon patterns were determined by comparing the gDNA sequences to cDNA sequences of S. spicatum. TPS genes were cloned into the pET28b(+) expression vector (Novagen, San Diego CA) with a polyhistidine tag in-frame. Depending on the restriction sites available, the His6 tag was either N-terminal or C-terminal. Primers with appropriate restriction sites (supplemental Fig. S1) were used to amplify each gene and cloned into the pET28b(+) vector. Vectors containing the TPS genes were transformed into chemically competent C41 E. coli cells (Avidis, Saint-Beauzire, France) containing the pRARE 2 plasmid isolated from Rosetta 2 competent cells (Novagen). Colonies were grown on LB plates containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol (50 μg ml−1). Three independent colonies were picked and grown in a shaker overnight at 37 °C in 5 ml of LB with the same antibiotics and this culture was used to inoculate 400 ml of Terrific Broth. Cell suspensions were grown at 37 °C with shaking until the A600 = 0.8 and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and shaken overnight at 16 °C. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 4 °C and pellets (∼1 g) were frozen at −80 °C for future use. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 mg ml−1 lysozyme, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.01 mg ml−1 DNAse1, and RNAse1, 100 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and made in His-trap binding buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, pH 7.4)., Cells were stirred thoroughly on ice with a glass rod for 30 min followed by homogenized using a high pressure cell cruncher. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 1.25 h before being decanted. Cleared lysate (∼12 ml) was purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography spin-columns (GE Healthcare) and eluted in 600 μl of elution buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4 pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). The eluted protein was desalted on a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) using 25 mm 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH 7.4, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 100 mm KCl. Approximately 1-ml fractions from a 3.5 ml elution were collected. Protein concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer with extinction coefficients calculated by amino acid composition (14Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. D A.R. A B. Walker J.M. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005: 571-607Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining visualized the purified recombinant proteins (supplemental Fig. S3). Enzyme assays for all recombinant proteins were done in triplicate using the GC vial method described by O'Maille et al. (15O'Maille P.E. Chappell J. Noel J.P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 335: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For enzyme assays where only product identification was assessed, 10 μg of protein was used in a final volume of 500 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm DTT, and 10 mm of either Mg2+ or Mn2+. Substrates (FPP and GPP) were added to a final reaction concentration of 100 μm. Vials were overlaid with 500 μl of hexane to trap volatile products and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Mixtures were vortexed for 1 min to extract all volatiles and the vials were centrifuged to separate the organic layer. For determination of steady-state enzyme kinetic constants, conditions were as described previously except the enzyme concentration was kept at 10 nm. Substrate concentrations ranged from 1 μm to 100 μm, and reactions were incubated at 30 °C for exactly 5 min. Critically, reactions were quenched at 5 min by the addition of 500 μl 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0 and vortexed, then stored at −80 °C immediately. An approach similar to the previously published method for diterpene production (16Cyr A. Wilderman P.R. Determan M. Peters R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 6684-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was used for in vivo production of santalenes. The SaFPPS gene was identified in the xylem EST library (GenBankTM accession no. HQ343283) and was amplified from cDNA using primers with Nco1 and Not1 ends amenable to pCDFDuet-1 vector multiple cloning site 1. Likewise, SaSSy was amplified with Nde1 and Kpn1 sites adapted for use with the In-Fusion cloning system (Clontech) and cloned into the second multiple cloning site (supplemental Fig. S1). The dual expression vector construct, pCDFDuet-1:SaFPPS:SaSSy, as well as an empty pCDFDuet-1 vector control were transformed into chemically competent C41(DE3) cells and grown on 50 μg of ml−1 streptomycin selective media. Individual colonies were grown in 5 ml overnight cultures, and these were used to inoculate 200 ml shaking cultures of Terrific Broth. As cells were approaching the log-phase of growth (A600 = 0.6) at 37 °C the incubator was cooled to 20 °C for 1 h before inducing with IPTG at a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cultures were shaken for a further 16 h before being centrifuged to pellet the cells. Cell pellets were lysed with 0.2 m NaOH and neutralized with acetic acid before being extracted twice with hexanes and reduced by evaporation. Media was extracted twice with 100 ml of hexane and these fractions were reduced by rotary evaporation to yield a thin oily residue. The residues were resuspended in 2 ml of hexane and analyzed by GC-MS using conditions described below. Product mixtures were analyzed by GC-MS in scan mode for product identification. A standard containing the three santalenes and α-exo-bergamotene was prepared by flash chromatography of 2 ml of neat S. album oil over silica and eluted in hexane. A final yield of 25 mg was resuspended in EtOH, and purity was confirmed by GC. Monoterpene identification was aided through an in-house standard collection. All mass spectra were compared with the NIST 2005 library and the literature (17Paolini J. Muselli A. Bernardini A.-F. Bighelli A. Casanova J. Costa J. Flavour. Fragr.

The Kovat retention indices (KIs) were determined for all compounds (supplemental Figs. S4, S7, S10) using an n-alkane standard and compared with the literature wherever DB-WAX or similar phase column data were available (17Paolini J. Muselli A. Bernardini A.-F. Bighelli A. Casanova J.

Where reliable retention data and pure standards were not available, a combination of mass spectral and retention properties was used to infer the candidate compound. GC-MS was performed on a Shimadzu GC2010 with a DB-WAX column and He as carrier gas. Conditions were as follows: Injector 200 °C, MS interface 240 °C, ion source 200 °C, Oven program: 40 °C for 3 min, then 8 °C min−1 to 180 °C, held 5 min, then 10 °C min−1 to 220 °C, held 10 min. Solvent cut time was set to 5 min. For product identification, total ion monitoring was used, scanning from m/z 41 to m/z 250. Incubations with (Z,Z)-FPP were analyzed on a HP5890 with a DB-WAX column and an initial oven temperature of 40 °C then ramped at 10 °C min−1 to 230 °C and held for 20 min. For kinetic assays, single ion monitoring (SIM) of the sesquiterpene base ions m/z 91, 93, and 94 were used. Likewise monoterpene base ions (m/z 69, 71, and 93) were monitored for GPP assays. An internal standard (isobutyl benzene, 30 μm) was added to the hexane used to overlay each reaction. Detector response factors were calculated based on the santalene standard which was prepared earlier. Product losses due to extraction inefficiency was accounted for by first adding the standard to assay buffer as an EtOH stock and extracting into the hexane layer as per sample assays.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4126-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) was identified in the S. album xylem EST library and cloned. It encoded a 569 amino acid protein with 56% identity to SamonoTPS1 (7Jones C.G. Keeling C.I. Ghisalberti E.L. Barbour E.L. Plummer J.A. Bohlmann J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 477: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and appeared to lack an N-terminal transit peptide. Upon heterologous expression in E. coli, the affinity-purified recombinant His6-tagged protein had a molecular mass of ∼66 kDa, similar to that of most monomeric TPS enzymes (supplemental Fig. S3). When incubated in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+ the enzyme converted (E,E)-FPP into α-, β-, and epi-β-santalene, α-exo-bergamotene, as well as traces of α- and β-farnesene (Fig. 2). Orthologous TPSs identified in two other oil-bearing species (SspiSSy from S. spicatum and SauSSy from S. austrocaledonicum) were also found to convert (E,E)-FPP into the santalenes in very similar proportions as SaSSy (Fig. 2). In all three orthologs, incubations with Mn2+ yielded mainly α-exo-bergamotene (supplemental S4). The larger metal ion likely distorts the active site, causing premature quenching of the bergamotyl carbocation intermediate. Each santalene synthase had an apparent Km of 1.4 (± 0.3) μm, indicating a biologically relevant, high affinity for (E,E)-FPP. Catalytic turnover rates were similar for all three enzymes, with a kcat for SaSSy of 0.34 s−1, 0.91 s−1 for SauSSy, and 2.6 s−1 for SpiSSy. All three santalene synthases produced linalool, geraniol, and terpineol along with traces of α-pinene and camphene when incubated with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) (supplemental Fig. S4). Although conversion of GPP did occur, a linear relationship existed between substrate concentration and V0, even at high (>100 μm) concentrations, rather than an asymptotic curve indicative of active site saturation. Monoterpenes have only been reported in sandalwood oil at very low concentrations (23Valder C. Neugebauer M. J. Essent. Oil. Res. 2003; 15: 178-186Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Braun N.A. Meier M. Hammerschmidt F.-J. J. Essent. Oil. Res. 2005; 17: 477-480Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Incubations of SaSSy with (Z,Z)-FPP indicated the enzyme was also catalytically active on this isomer. In the presence of 10 mm Mg2+ (Z,Z)-FPP was converted into α-endo-bergamotene, α-santalene, (Z)-β-farnesene, epi-β-santalene, and β-santalene (Fig. 3A). The product profile resulting from incubations of SaSSy with (E,E)-FPP (Fig. 3B) resemble the authentic essential oil of S. album (Fig. 3C) more closely than that of the (Z,Z)-FPP incubations. Continuity of santalene biosynthesis from FPP produced by a S. album FPP synthase (SaFPPS) was confirmed using an in vivo E. coli expression system. SaFPPS and SaSSy were cloned into the dual expression vector pCDFDuet-1 (Novagen) and transformed into C41 chemically competent cells. No detectable levels of the santalenes or bergamotene were found in the cell pellet extraction, or in the empty vector control extracts, but all four compounds were detected in hexane extracts of media from overnight cultures (Fig. 4). These results validated the in vivo activity of SaSSy and demonstrate the feasibility of metabolically engineering a santalene synthase into an appropriate host microorganism for in vivo production of santalenes using established methods (16Cyr A. Wilderman P.R. Determan M. Peters R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 6684-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Huang Q. Roessner C.A. Croteau R. Scott A.I. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001; 9: 2237-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To further explore the origins of chemical diversity in the genus Santalum, the orthologous TPS gene pair SauBS (S. austrocaledonicum β-bisabolene synthase) and SspiBS (S. spicatum α-bisabolol synthase) were cloned and characterized using cDNA as PCR template with primers originally developed from S. album (7Jones C.G. Keeling C.I. Ghisalberti E.L. Barbour E.L. Plummer J.A. Bohlmann J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 477: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recombinant SauBS produced almost exclusively β-bisabolene and only traces of α-bisabolol with (E,E)-FPP, while only limonene and terpineol were produced when incubated with GPP (supplemental Figs. S5 and S6). SspiBS produced a mixture of β-bisabolene and α-bisabolol, along with traces of α-bisabolene and farnesene isomers. The functions of these two enzymes were very similar to the previously identified SaMonoTPS1 from S. album which produced mostly β-bisabolene and traces of α-bisabolol from (E,E)-FPP, but could also convert GPP into monoterpenes analogous in structure to the bisabolenes (7Jones C.G. Keeling C.I. Ghisalberti E.L. Barbour E.L. Plummer J.A. Bohlmann J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 477: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Extending our investigation of Santalum sesquiterpene synthases into the TPS-a subfamily, two orthologous cDNAs; SspiSesquiTPS and SauSesquiTPS, from S. spicatum and S. austrocaledonicum, respectively, were cloned and characterized. The translated amino acid sequences of these genes were similar to the previously characterized SaSesquiTPS1 from S. album (7Jones C.G. Keeling C.I. Ghisalberti E.L. Barbour E.L. Plummer J.A. Bohlmann J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 477: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) but the recombinant TPSs of these species yielded markedly different sesquiterpene profiles. SauSesquiTPS produced α-humulene and δ-cadinene, along with β-elemene, which is the thermal rearrangement product of germacrene A (28de Kraker J.W. Franssen M.C. de Groot A. Konig W.A. Bouwmeester H.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1381-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and several other bicyclic sesquiterpenes when incubated with (E,E)-FPP (supplemental Fig. S7). The cadinenes may also be the result of heat-induced dehydration rearrangements (7Jones C.G. Keeling C.I. Ghisalberti E.L. Barbour E.L. Plummer J.A. Bohlmann J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 477: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, SspiSesquiTPS produced only three main compounds; β-elemol (the thermal rearrangement product of hedycaryol (29Southwell I.A. Phytochemistry. 1970; 9: 2243-2245Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar)), guaiol and bulnesol (supplemental Fig. S8). Both enzymes produced only traces of linalool with GPP (supplemental Fig. S9). Each set of orthologous TPS across the Santalum genus showed sequence homology to previously reported TPS with key domains being well conserved (supplemental Fig. S10). As with all angiosperm TPSs, the R(R/P)X8W motif implicated in prenyl diphosphate ionization (30Williams D.C. McGarvey D.J. Katahira E.J. Croteau R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12213-12220Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and the aspartate-rich divalent metal ion binding domain (31Lesburg C.A. Zhai G. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Science. 1997; 277: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) (DDXXD) are present. Residues likely to be responsible for product specificity and substrate preference were identified in the α14 helix, and the α18-α19 helix turn respectively, based on those identified by Kamparinas et al. (32Kampranis S.C. Ioannidis D. Purvis A. Mahrez W. Ninga E. Katerelos N.A. Anssour S. Dunwell J.M. Degenhardt J. Makris A.M. Goodenough P.W. Johnson C.B. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1994-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Genomic sequences of a set of Santalum TPS genes were compared with determine whether differences at the genomic level might be related to the chemotypic differences observed among oil producing (S. album, S. spicatum, S. austrocaledonicum) and oil-deficient (S. murrayanum) species. All four species have genomic copies of the target TPS genes (supplemental Fig. S11) although cDNAs could not be amplified from a xylem-derived RNA pool of S. murrayanum. The deduced amino acid sequences of the santalene synthase, bisabolene/bisabolol synthase, and TPS-a sesquiterpene synthase gDNAs in S. murrayanum are highly homologous to those of the functionally characterized TPS cDNAs of the other species (Fig. 7) and possibly encode functional TPS enzymes. Intron-exon structure of sandalwood TPS genes were typical of angiosperm TPS-a and TPS-b genes; each bearing 6 introns and 7 exons (12Trapp S.C. Croteau R.B. Genetics. 2001; 158: 811-832PubMed Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S11). Intron boundaries observed a 3′ ∼N▾GT, 5′ AG▾N∼ pattern. An ortholog of SauBS in S. murrayanum, labeled SmBS, showed a mutation encoding a stop codon in exon 3. We also cloned a variant SaSSy gDNA sequence from S. album with a 10-nucleotide deletion in exon 3, producing a frameshift and subsequent stop codon. No frame shifts or premature stop codons were present in the other TPS gDNAs sequenced. The genes and encoded enzymes for santalene biosynthesis have been isolated from three divergent sandalwood species. SaSSy, SauSSy, and SpiSSy are bona fide sesquiterpene synthases for santalene formation, despite being phylogenetically aligned with the TPS-b subfamily, which comprises mainly of angiosperm monoterpene synthases. Low Km values for each santalene synthase indicated a high affinity for (E,E)-FPP, while no active site saturation was apparent with GPP, indicating they are genuine sesquiterpene synthases. Vestigial activity with GPP suggests that these santalene synthases may have evolved from a monoterpene synthase ancestor through loss of the plastid target peptide and subsequent specialization of the active site for (E,E)-FPP. The putative ancestral enzyme which gave rise to SaSSy, SauSSy, and SspiSSy likely had latent plasticity in the active site, enabling it to accommodate both GPP and FPP. Similarly, it has been shown in the case of fruit flavor biosynthesis in wild and cultivated strawberry (33Aharoni A. Giri A.P. Verstappen F.W. Bertea C.M. Sevenier R. Sun Z. Jongsma M.A. Schwab W. Bouwmeester H.J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3110-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) that molecular evolution of the corresponding TPSs involved plasticity of the active site to accommodate alternative substrates when sub-cellular localization of the enzymes is changed through loss of a plastid target peptide. Most intriguing, SaSSy was able to convert (Z,Z)-FPP into α-, β-, and epi-β-santalenes and α- endo-bergamotene (Fig. 3). Sallaud et al. (34Sallaud C. Rontein D. Onillon S. Jabes F. Duffe' P. Giacalone C. Thoraval S. Escoffier C. Herbette G. Leonhardt N. Causse M. Tissiera A. Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) discovered a santalene/bergamotene synthase in wild tomato, which was able to accommodate (Z,Z)-FPP but was unreactive toward (E,E)-FPP (Fig. 5). SaSSy is uniquely able to accommodate both transoid and cisoid isomers of FPP and surprisingly, produce a similar suite of compounds. These rearrangements are likely to proceed via the initial ionization of (Z,Z)-FPP into either (3S) or (3R)-nerolidyl diphosphate (Fig. 6). Cyclization may occur through an endo- conformation, resulting in α-endo-bergamotene and (−)-epi-β-santalene, while the exo-cyclization would lead to α- and β-santalene. Sandalwood oil contains traces of α-endo-bergamotene (26Braun N.A. Meier M. Hammerschmidt F.-J. J. Essent. Oil. Res. 2005; 17: 477-480Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) thus it is plausible that the native enzyme is able to access both isomers of FPP in the cell. To our knowledge this level of plasticity in the active site of a TPS is unprecedented.FIGURE 6Detailed mechanism explaining the formation of products resulting from incubations of SaSSy with (Z,Z)-farnesyl diphosphate in the presence of Mg2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to characterizing the santalene synthases, continuity of the biosynthetic pathway from FPP to the santalenes (Fig. 4) was demonstrated using an in vivo production system, highlighting the potential for metabolic engineering of microorganisms to produce precursors of valuable fragrance compounds of limited availability from plants. This system will also serve as a useful platform for exploring further downstream metabolic processes such as hydroxylation to the santalols. Like the santalene synthases, the active sites of the bisabolene/bisabolol synthases are sufficiently plastic to accommodate the same series of carbocation rearrangements for both C10 and C15 substrates, as has been found with a cineole synthase mutant from Salvia fruticosa (32Kampranis S.C. Ioannidis D. Purvis A. Mahrez W. Ninga E. Katerelos N.A. Anssour S. Dunwell J.M. Degenhardt J. Makris A.M. Goodenough P.W. Johnson C.B. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1994-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Santalum spicatum oil contains variable amounts of α-bisabolol relative to other sesquiterpenoids (5Piggot M.J. Ghisalberti E.L. Trengove R.D. Flavour. Fragr. J. 1997; 12: 43-46Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and allelic variation (35Köllner T.G. Schnee C. Gershenzon J. Degenhardt J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1115-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) in the ORF of SspiBS, particularly in the α14 helix may be partly responsible for the diversity of phenotypes observed across the distribution of S. spicatum. Within-species variation in the santalene synthase ORFs were not evident for the species studied here. Phylogenetically, SauBS and SspiBS also cluster with the santalene synthases in the TPS-b group (Fig. 7). Thus, TPSs of two phylogenetic clades, TPS-a and TPS-b, contribute to the sesquiterpene profiles of sandalwood oils. The TPS-a sesquiterpene synthases from the three oil-bearing Santalum species all produced markedly different combinations of sesquiterpenes (supplemental Figs. S7–S9). This was true to a lesser extent for the bisabolene/bisabolol synthases (supplemental Figs. S5 and S6) yet in both cases the diversity of function is in contrast to the highly conserved product profiles of the three orthologous santalene synthases (Fig. 2). Genomic sequences revealed that all four species of Santalum studied here had copies of TPS genes, and that no frame shifts or mutations in the open reading frames were apparent (supplemental Fig. S11). Even the genome of S. murrayanum contains a complete ORF of the santalene synthase, despite possessing an oil-deficient phenotype. This suggests factors controlling the spatial or temporal patterns of TPS expression, rather than the absence of, or mutations in the ORFs of the genes themselves, are likely to be responsible for the low- or no-oil phenotype. All oil producing species of Santalum, and even ancestral genera within the Santalaceae family (36Krieipl A.T. König W.A. Phytochemistry. 2004; 65: 2045-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), contain detectable levels of the santalenes, α-bergamotene, bisabolene, and bisabolol, and all species studied here contain complete genomic copies of the santalene synthase ORF. The uniformity of santalene product profiles of SaSSy, SauSSy, and SspiSSy is in contrast to the variety of compounds produced by the bisabolene/bisabolol synthases, and more so by the TPS-a group sesquiterpene synthases in the Santalum genus. The higher amino acid sequence identity of the santalene synthase orthologs (94–98%) compared with the TPS-a genes (89–93%) further support a genetic basis of functional conservation of santalene biosynthesis (supplemental Fig. S10). Function of SauBS and SaMonoTPS (7Jones C.G. Keeling C.I. Ghisalberti E.L. Barbour E.L. Plummer J.A. Bohlmann J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 477: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) is also well conserved between S. album and S. austrocaledonicum (99% identity) however SspiBS differs in both sequence identity (92%) and catalytic function (supplemental Fig. S2). These findings may suggest positive selection for santalene and to a lesser extent bisabolene biosynthesis in the Santalum genus, and possibly in the Santalaceae family more generally. As sesquiterpenes have been implicated in defense against pathogens (6Gershenzon J. Dudareva N. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar) it is possible that selection pressure in the form of disease has allowed for the survival of populations with the santalene and bisabolene phenotype. In conclusion, we have identified several terpene synthases responsible for the production of key fragrant compounds in three commercially exploited species of sandalwood. These findings are of great significance for the flavor and fragrance industry, as well as the growing plantation sandalwood industry.

https://openalex.org/W2012169430,"A number of human malignancies exhibit sustained stimulation, mutation, or gene amplification of the receptor tyrosine kinase human mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met). ARQ 197 is a clinically advanced, selective, orally bioavailable, and well tolerated c-Met inhibitor, currently in Phase 3 clinical testing in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Herein, we describe the molecular and structural basis by which ARQ 197 selectively targets c-Met. Through our analysis we reveal a previously undisclosed, novel inhibitory mechanism that utilizes distinct regulatory elements of the c-Met kinase. The structure of ARQ 197 in complex with the c-Met kinase domain shows that the inhibitor binds a conformation that is distinct from published kinase structures. ARQ 197 inhibits c-Met autophosphorylation and is highly selective for the inactive or unphosphorylated form of c-Met. Through our analysis of the interplay between the regulatory and catalytic residues of c-Met, and by comparison between the autoinhibited canonical conformation of c-Met bound by ARQ 197 to previously described kinase domains of type III receptor tyrosine kinases, we believe this to be the basis of a powerful new in silico approach for the design of similar inhibitors for other protein kinases of therapeutic interest."

Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a cytochrome P450 gene in a new subfamily of CYP71, CYP71BJ1, involved in alkaloid biosynthesis. Co-expression analysis of putative cytochrome P450 genes in the Catharanthus roseus transcriptome identified candidate genes with expression profiles similar to known terpene indole alkaloid biosynthetic genes.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) 5The abbreviations used are: P450, cytochrome P450; contig, group of overlapping clones; 16OMT, 16-hydroxytabersonine 16-O-methyltransferase; T16H, tabersonine 16-hydroxylase; ABT, aminobenzotriazole. play a key role in the development and survival of plants (1Nielsen K.A. Moller B.L. de Montellano P.R. 3rd Ed. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2005: 553-583Google Scholar). P450s participate in the biosynthesis of a wide variety of compounds throughout primary and specialized metabolism, including fatty acids, terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, cyanogenic glucosides, glucosinolates, and alkaloids. Notably, plants have an unusually large number of P450 genes compared with prokaryotes and other eukaryotic organisms. Furthermore, plant P450s are typically stringently substrate-specific enzymes that catalyze highly regio- and stereoselective transformations (2Jensen K. Møller B.L. Phytochemistry. 2010; 71: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 3Nelson D.R. Schuler M.A. Paquette S.M. Werck-Reichhart D. Bak S. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 756-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The catalytic functions of most plant P450s are unknown. Identifying a P450 that catalyzes a specific biosynthetic transformation poses a challenge due to the homology shared by P450 genes and the typical lack of correlation between primary structure and catalytic function (4Mizutani M. Ohta D. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61: 291-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus is currently the sole source of two anticancer agents subject to widespread clinical use, the bisindole alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine (5O'Connor S.E. Maresh J.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2006; 23: 532-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). In C. roseus, the alkaloid tabersonine can be transformed into the bisindole precursor vindoline, in aerial organs, or 19-O-acetylhörhammericine in roots (see Fig. 1) (5O'Connor S.E. Maresh J.J. Nat.

Although hydroxylation at the 16-position of tabersonine ultimately leads to vindoline, tabersonine can be converted by a P450-dependent 6,7-epoxidase to form lochnericine (7Furuya T. Sakamoto K.

Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both lochnericine and 19-hydroxytabersonine are proposed intermediates in 19-O-acetylhörhammericine biosynthesis (Fig. 1), and minovincinine 19-hydroxy-O-acetyltransferase is the only gene in this pathway for which a cognate cDNA has been isolated and characterized (6Laflamme P. St-Pierre B. De Luca V. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although alkaloid biosynthesis in C. roseus involves several biotransformations known or predicted to be P450-dependent (11Facchini P.J. De Luca V. Plant J. 2008; 54: 763-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), only five C. roseus P450s have been functionally characterized, namely flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase (CYP75A8), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (CYP73A4), geraniol 10-hydroxylase (CYP76B6), secologanin synthase (CYP72A1), and tabersonine 16-hydroxylase (T16H; CYP71D12). Only the latter three participate in alkaloid biosynthesis (12Kaltenbach M. Schröder G. Schmelzer E. Lutz V. Schröder J.

These C. roseus P450 genes were characterized functionally using various techniques, including in vitro substrate specificity assays and cDNA library screening. Although such traditional approaches have proven effective for the functional elucidation of many P450 genes, no versatile approach exists to identify diverse P450s, particularly those carrying out more specialized functions (4Mizutani M. Ohta D. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61: 291-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Recently, co-expression analysis has been used effectively to guide the functional characterization of P450 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana (17Ehlting J. Sauveplane V. Olry A. Ginglinger J.F.

Here, we describe the use of a C. roseus expressed sequence tag collection generated by transcriptome sequencing and a corresponding expression profile data set to facilitate the identification and characterization of a unique P450. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression data identified P450 candidates that are co-expressed with genes known to be involved in alkaloid biosynthesis. We developed a whole cell assay to demonstrate that yeast cell cultures expressing one of these P450 gene candidates produce a hydroxylated product in the culture medium when supplemented with tabersonine. This enzyme, CYP71BJ1, is the first member of a new plant P450 subfamily and appears to be a tabersonine/lochnericine 19-hydroxylase. Tabersonine was a generous gift from Viresh Rawal (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). Unless otherwise noted, all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The C. roseus transcriptome and expression mapping data were generated by the Medicinal Plant Genomics Consortium at Michigan State University. Separate cDNA libraries were constructed from mRNA from three C. roseus tissues (seedlings, seedlings treated with methyl jasmonate, and suspension culture cells treated with yeast extract) using the Illumina mRNA-seq kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and sequenced (single end, 36 bp) on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform at the Michigan State University Research Technology Support Facility. A custom Perl script was used to remove reads with low complexity and low quality regions. Reads with a base with a quality score <20 or with >2 N bases were considered low quality and removed. The low complexity threshold was defined as a read composed of >85% of a single nucleotide. Transcript assemblies were constructed using the Velvet (version 0.7.61)/Oases (version 0.1.17) de novo transcriptome assembler (19Zerbino D.R. Birney E. Genome Res. 2008; 18: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (7374) Google Scholar). The hash length for the initial Velvet assembly was 27, and the minimum transcript length cut-off used for Oases was 200 bp. The final assembly contained 33,992 transcripts with an N50 of 780 bp. The longest transcript from each contig was selected as the representative transcript, and reads from the individual libraries were mapped (up to two mismatches permitted) to the assembled transcriptome using Bowtie (20Langmead B. Trapnell C. Pop M. Salzberg S.L. Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14993) Google Scholar). Expression values (reads per kb transcript per million mapped reads) were calculated with a custom Perl script. Expression levels of P450 candidates (as designated by pfam analysis), and known alkaloid biosynthetic genes, in control and elicited seedlings, and cell suspension cultures were subjected to hierarchical clustering analysis using CLUSTER (version 3.0) for Mac. The resulting dendrogram was viewed with Treeview (21Saldanha A.J. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 3246-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2334) Google Scholar). The expression mapping data and complete Treeview cluster are reported in the supplemental data. All P450 sequences used in this analysis have been deposited to GenbankTM. C. roseus hairy root cultures were grown according to Morgan et al. (10Morgan J.A. Shanks J.V. Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and C. roseus seedlings were grown and elicited with methyl jasmonate as reported previously (11Facchini P.J. De Luca V. Plant J. 2008; 54: 763-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A T16H gene, codon-optimized for expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) with BamHI and XhoI restriction sites for directional cloning into pYeDP60. The CYP71BJ1 ORF was amplified from elicited seedling cDNA (6 days after elicitation) using a sense primer (5′-AAA AAA GGA TCC ATG TTG TCT TCA TTG AAA GAT-3′) containing an engineered BamHI restriction site (underlined) and an antisense primer (5′-AAA AAA GAA TTC TTA AAA AAT GGT AAC CGG AGT TG-3′) containing an EcoRI restriction site. The apparent full-length ORF for candidate “Locus_41747” was amplified using a sense primer (5′-AAA AAA GGA TCC ATG AAC TTC TCT CTC ACC TCT CCC ATT TTC C-3′) containing an engineered BamHI restriction site (underlined) and start codon (boldface) and an antisense primer (5′-AAA AAA GAA TTC TTA GTT TCC TTC AAC TAC AGT TGA GAT GCT AGG-3′) containing an EcoRI restriction site. The full-length ORF for CYP81Z1 was amplified using a sense primer (5′-AAA AAA GGA TCC ATG GAG GTT TCC TTT TTC TAC ACC TC-3′) containing an engineered BamHI restriction site (underlined) and an antisense primer (5′- AAA AAA CCC GGG TTA TGG GTT ATT TTC CAT-3′) containing an SmaI restriction site. Using directional cloning, the candidate P450 ORFs were cloned into pYeDP60, sequenced, and transformed into S. cerevisiae WAT11 (harboring the integrated A. thaliana P450 reductase ATR1) cells (22Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 16-hydroxytabersonine 16-O-methyltransferase (16OMT; GenBankTM accession no. EF444544.1) ORF was amplified from elicited seedling cDNA using a sense primer (5′- AAT AAA GGA TCC ATG GAT GTT CAA TCT GAG G-3′) containing a BamHI restriction site and an antisense primer (5′-ATT TTA TTT TCT CGA GTC AAG GAT AAA CCT CAA TG-3′) containing an XhoI restriction site. Using directional cloning, the ORF was cloned into pYES3-CT and sequenced. Using lithium acetate, the 16OMT-pYES3-CT construct was transformed into S. cerevisiae WAT11 cells already containing the T16H construct (23Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae WAT11 was used as the host strain for the expression candidate P450 genes and the T16H gene in pYeDP60. S. cerevisiae harboring the desired plasmid were grown, and protein expression was induced as reported previously (22Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To functionally characterize CYP71BJ1, a 5-ml S. cerevisiae WAT11 cell culture expressing this ORF was grown for 5 h after induction at 28 °C, at which point, the cell culture was supplemented with 147 μm of tabersonine (from a 73.3 mm dimethyl sulfoxide stock solution). After 24 h, the cells were removed by centrifugation, and the medium was extracted with ethyl acetate and analyzed by LC-MS. Two 500-ml cultures of S. cerevisiae WAT11 cells harboring the CYP71BJ1 construct were grown and induced, and after 5 h of protein expression, the medium was supplemented with 147 μm tabersonine. Cells were removed 24 h later by centrifugation at 3810 × g for 15 min. The combined medium was then extracted with 1 liter of ethyl acetate three times and concentrated. The CYP71BJ1 enzymatic product was purified by column chromatography. A mobile phase of hexanes:ethyl acetate (1:1) was used for the first column, and dichloromethane:methanol (99.5:0.5) was used for the second column. 1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY, and 1H,13C HSQC spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer. Exact mass measurements were made on a Bruker Daltonics APEXIV 4.7 Tesla Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer with electrospray ionization. 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 8.91 (1H, s), 7.27 (1H, d, J = 6.9), 7.15 (1H, t, J = 7.7), 6.89 (1H, t, J = 7.5), 6.82 (1H, d, J = 7.8), 5.92 (1H, dd, J = 4.9, 10.2), 5.80 (1H, d, J = 9.9), 3.79 (3H, s), 3.47 (1H, dd, J = 4.9, 15.9), 3.30–3.35 (1H, m), 3.23 (1H, d, J = 16.2), 3.06 (1H, t, J = 7.0), 2.89 (1H, dd, J = 15.4), 2.78 (1H, s), 2.73–2.79 (1H, m), 2.49 (1H, d, J = 15.4), 2.07–2.14 (1H, m), 1.83–1.87 (1H, m), 1.55 (1H, d, J = 3.3), 0.88 (3H, d, J = 6.4); 13C NMR (CDCl3): d 168.54, 166.38, 143.03, 137.71, 129.44, 127.81, 126.31, 121.54, 120.93, 109.37, 91.26, 67.00, 66.62, 55.57, 51.29, 51.02, 50.10, 46.31, 43.90, 27.57, 17.36; ESI-MS(C21H24N2O3+) m/z calculated: 353.1860 [M+H]+, found: 353.1848 [M+H]+. The UV absorbance maxima are observed at 229, 296, and 331 nm. C. roseus hairy roots (5 g) were macerated in 50 ml of methanol followed by sonication for 1 h. After filtration, the methanol extract was analyzed on a Beckman Coulter System Gold 125 HPLC equipped with a model 168 photodiode array detector at 330 nm. Analytes were separated on a Lichrosorb reverse phase column (Select B, 25 cm × 4.0 mm column, 5-μm particle size) using 20–50% acetonitrile:water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) for 20 min. Preparative HPLC of lochnericine and hörhammericine was performed on a Beckman Coulter System Gold equipped with a 125 solvent module, and a 166P detector at 330 nm using the same gradient. Analytes were separated on a reverse-phase column (Grace Vydac 2.2 cm × 25 cm, 10-μm particle size). The absorbance maxima and exact mass spectrometry data for lochnericine and hörhammericine are listed in the supplemental data (24Hisiger S. Jolicoeur M. Phytochem. Rev. 2007; 6: 207-234Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Abraham D.J. Farnsworth N.R. Loub W.D. Blomster R.N. J. Org. Chem. 1969; 34: 1575-1576Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Microsomes enriched with CYP71BJ1 or T16H were isolated using the high density procedure according to Pompon et al. (22Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The total microsomal protein content was determined using a bichinchoninic acid assay by Pierce. CYP71BJ1 assays were prepared in a final volume of 100 μl containing 55 μg of microsomal protein, 1 mm NADPH, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ajmaline internal standard, and 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Assays were initiated by the addition of 30 μm substrate unless otherwise noted. The following substrates were assayed with microsomes: tabersonine, yohimbine, catharanthine, dihydrotabersonine, norharmane, lochnericine, 16-hydroxytabersonine (3 μm), 16-methoxytabersonine (300 nm), and vindolinine (5 μm). Dihydrotabersonine was prepared as reported by Liscombe et al. (26Liscombe D.K. Usera A.R. O'Connor S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18793-18798Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Yeast cultures co-expressing T16H and 16OMT enzymes were supplemented with tabersonine (147 μm) to produce 16-hydroxytabersonine and 16-methoxytabersonine. Assays lacking microsomes or NADPH served as negative controls. All assays were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h or overnight, after which 10% of the assay volume was quenched with 1 ml of HPLC-grade methanol. Assays were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min in a microcentrifuge and then analyzed by LC-MS. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography and MS analyses were performed according to Liscombe et al. (26Liscombe D.K. Usera A.R. O'Connor S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18793-18798Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A dimethyl sulfoxide stock (7.3 mm) of tabersonine was prepared and then diluted with water to a final concentration of 5.9 mm. Serial dilutions of this stock were used for enzyme assays. Enzyme assays (0.1-ml reaction volume) contained 1.2 mg of CYP71BJ1 enriched microsomes, 1 μm ajmaline (for an internal standard), 1 mm NADPH in sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.0), and 4 mm dithiothrietol. Reactions were initiated by the addition of tabersonine (290 nm, 550 nm, 570 nm, 590 nm, 1.2 μm, 2.3 μm, 4.8 μm, 5.3 μm, 6.2 μm, 9.2 μm) and incubated at 30 °C. Time points were chosen such that the rate of product formation was linear, to ensure accurate measure of initial rates (between 3 and 15 min after initiation of the reaction). The reactions were analyzed by LC-MS and values of Vmax and Km were estimated using nonlinear fitting (OriginPro; version 7.0, Northampton, MA). The errors reported are based on the 95% confidence of the S.D. of three independent experiments. Aqueous stocks of the suicide inhibitor aminobenzotriazole (ABT) ranging from 64 mm to 250 μm were used for inhibition assays. A concentration of 9.2 μm of tabersonine substrate in the presence of 0, 25 μm, 100 μm, 400 μm, 1.6 mm, and 6.4 mm ABT was used. The errors reported are based on the 95% confidence of the S.D. of three independent experiments. To identify genes encoding cytochrome(s) P450 involved in the oxygenation of tabersonine in C. roseus, we performed hierarchical clustering analysis with expression mapping data. Expression profiles of known alkaloid biosynthetic genes (tryptophan decarboxylase, geraniol 10-hydroxylase, loganic acid methyltransferase, secologanin synthase, strictosidine synthase, strictosidine glucosidase, T16H, 16OMT, 2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxytabersonine-N-methyltransferase, desacetoxyvindoline-4-hydroxylase, deacetylvindoline acetyltransferase, and minovincinine 19-hydroxy-O-acetyltransferase (5O'Connor S.E. Maresh J.J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2006; 23: 532-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 6Laflamme P. St-Pierre B. De Luca V. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Liscombe D.K. Usera A.R. O'Connor S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18793-18798Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) and putative P450 genes were included in the analysis. The results of hierarchical clustering were visualized as a heat map, a section of which is presented in Fig. 2, showing the clusters that we focused on in this study (supplemental data). Contigs 92197, 80887, 63935, 91544, and 89777 all represented partial ORFs. However, two contigs (88716 and 87898) that clustered with minovincinine 19-hydroxy-O-acetyltransferase (Fig. 2), which acetylates the 19-hydroxyl group of minovincinine and hörhammericine (Fig. 1) (6Laflamme P. St-Pierre B. De Luca V. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), were determined by manual sequence analysis to represent the same gene transcript and could be assembled to form the full-length ORF encoding CYP71BJ1 (supplemental Fig. S1). Two other apparent full-length ORFs (41747 and CYP81Z1) were also present in the cluster and were selected for further characterization. The gene candidates were cloned from methyl jasmonate-elicited seedling cDNA, cloned into the yeast expression vector pYeDP60, and expressed in S. cerevisiae WAT11 cells, a yeast strain optimized for plant P450 protein expression (22Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We developed a whole cell yeast assay to functionally characterize P450s. As a positive control, we cloned a synthetic, yeast codon-optimized version of the previously characterized T16H gene (16Schröder G. Unterbusch E. Kaltenbach M. Schmidt J. Strack D. De Luca V. Schröder J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) into the pYeDP60 vector and transformed the resulting T16H-pYeDP60 construct into yeast. Protein expression was induced in a 5-ml yeast culture for 5 h, at which point the medium was supplemented with tabersonine. In 24 h, 16-hydroxytabersonine was detected in the yeast medium as evidenced by LC-MS analysis (Fig. 3). With the success of this positive control, we used this assay to detect products derived from tabersonine in yeast cultures expressing CYP71BJ1, 41747, and CYP81Z1 candidate P450s. Yeast cultures that expressed CYP71BJ1 were supplemented with tabersonine, and after 24 h, the tabersonine starting material was completely converted to a more hydrophilic compound with a mass consistent with hydroxylation or epoxidation (Fig. 3). Notably, the CYP71BJ1 product exhibited a retention time distinct from that observed for the T16H product, 16-hydroxytabersonine (Fig. 3). No enzymatic product was observed when tabersonine was incubated with yeast cultures harboring the empty pYeDP60 plasmid (Fig. 3) or those expressing the other candidate P450s, 41747 and CYP81Z1. We isolated and purified the tabersonine-derived CYP71BJ1 product from 1 liter of yeast culture supplemented with 147 μm tabersonine. The enzymatic product was identified as (R)-19-hydroxytabersonine, as evidenced by high resolution mass spectrometry, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, COSY (Fig. 4), and HSQC NMR (supplemental Figs. S2–S4). The COSY spectrum shows a cross-peak between the doublet at 1.55 ppm corresponding to the proton in the 19-hydroxyl group and the doublet at 2.78 ppm corresponding to the proton at C19 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, we observed a cross-peak between the protons at C18 (0.88 ppm) and the proton at the 19-position (Fig. 4). Microsomes were isolated from yeast cultures expressing CYP71BJ1 and assayed with a variety of alkaloids representing different terpene indole alkaloid skeletons to determine the substrate scope of the enzyme (supplemental Fig. S5). Assays lacking NADPH cofactor or CYP71BJ1-enriched microsomes served as negative controls. Although neither lochnericine nor hörhammericine are available commercially, both are known to be present in hairy root cultures and in the roots of mature C. roseus plants (9Kutney J.P. Choi L.S. Kolodziejczyk P. Sleigh S.K. Stuart K.L. Worth B.R. Kurz W.G. Chatson K.B. Constabel F. Phytochemistry. 1980; 19: 2589-2595Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Morgan J.A. Shanks J.V. Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Abraham D.J. Farnsworth N.R. Loub W.D. Blomster R.N. J. Org. Chem. 1969; 34: 1575-1576Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We could isolate small quantities of lochnericine, a potential physiological substrate for CYP71BJ1 (Fig. 1), from hairy roots. Although we could not obtain quantities sufficient for characterization by NMR, the isolated standard exhibited the correct exact mass and UV signature (24Hisiger S. Jolicoeur M. Phytochem. Rev. 2007; 6: 207-234Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, a microsomal fraction enriched in CYP71BJ1 converted this isolated compound to a product with an exact mass and UV signature consistent with hörhammericine (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S6 and Table S1) (24Hisiger S. Jolicoeur M. Phytochem. Rev. 2007; 6: 207-234Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Abraham D.J. Farnsworth N.R. Loub W.D. Blomster R.N. J. Org. Chem. 1969; 34: 1575-1576Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Only tabersonine and lochnericine were transformed by CYP71BJ1. CYP71BJ1-enriched microsomes assayed with tabersonine demonstrate Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent Km of 300 ± 50 nm and Vmax of 5.0 ± 0.2 μm min−1 μg−1 (Fig. 6). We also observed reduced activity when increasing concentrations of the ABT-P450 monooxygenase suicide inhibitor was added to the assay. CYP71BJ1 activity decreased to <1% when 6.4 mm ABT is present (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7ABT inhibition of CYP71BJ1 19-hydroxylase activity with tabersonine. Error bars represent the 95% confidence of the S.D. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using co-expression analysis, followed by functional characterization with a whole cell yeast assay, we identified a role for C. roseus CYP71BJ1 in alkaloid biosynthesis. Co-expression data shows that CYP71BJ1 has an expression pattern similar to minovincinine 19-hydroxy-O-acetyltransferase, an enzyme that acetylates the 19-position of hörhammericine or minovincinine to form 19-O-acetylhörhammericine or echitovenine, respectively. Formation of hörhammericine from tabersonine requires the catalytic action of two enzymes, tabersonine 6,7-epoxidase and a 19-hydroxylase. Biochemical evidence strongly suggests that both of these enzymes are P450-dependent (10Morgan J.A. Shanks J.V. Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Rodriguez S. Compagnon V. Crouch N.P. St-Pierre B. De Luca V. Phytochemistry. 2003; 64: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression and subsequent incubation of CYP71BJ1 with tabersonine revealed that this enzyme stereoselectively catalyzes hydroxylation of tabersonine at C19. Large scale whole cell assays allowed isolation of milligram quantities of the enzymatic product for complete structural characterization. Kutney et al. (9Kutney J.P. Choi L.S. Kolodziejczyk P. Sleigh S.K. Stuart K.L. Worth B.R. Kurz W.G. Chatson K.B. Constabel F. Phytochemistry. 1980; 19: 2589-2595Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) hypothesize that hörhammericine biosynthesis proceeds either through a 6,7-epoxidation of tabersonine to yield lochnericine, which is subsequently hydroxylated at the 19-position. Alternatively, hydroxylation at the 19-position can occur directly on tabersonine to yield 19-hydroxytabersonine, which then undergoes a 6,7-epoxidation (9Kutney J.P. Choi L.S. Kolodziejczyk P. Sleigh S.K. Stuart K.L. Worth B.R. Kurz W.G. Chatson K.B. Constabel F. Phytochemistry. 1980; 19: 2589-2595Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Morgan J.A. Shanks J.V. Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). NMR characterization of the CYP71BJ1 enzymatic product revealed that the absence of the 6,7-epoxide in lochnericine does not alter the stereoselectivity of the hydroxylation; the 1H NMR chemical shifts of the enzymatic product of CYP71BJ1 and tabersonine match those of the previously reported (R)-19-hydroxytabersonine (28Langlois N. Andriamialisoa R.Z. J. Org. Chem. 1979; 44: 2468-2471Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Kohl W. Witte B. Hofle G. Z. Naturforsch. B. 1981; 36: 1153-1162Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the order of biosynthetic steps involved in hörhammericine biosynthesis is still ambiguous because CYP71BJ1 accepts lochnericine and tabersonine in vitro. The kinetics of CYP71BJ1 were measured only with tabersonine since limited amounts of lochnericine could be isolated from C. roseus hairy root cultures. As a result, it is not clear whether CYP71BJ1 quantitatively prefers tabersonine to lochnericine in vitro. However, the low Km value for tabersonine suggests that 19-hydroxylation of tabersonine could occur in planta. Both lochnericine and 19-hydroxytabersonine are observed in C. roseus, suggesting that both compounds are plausible biosynthetic intermediates. To further explore the qualitative substrate preference of this enzyme, we subjected microsomes containing CYP71BJ1 to a competition assay. Microsomes were incubated with a 1:1 mixture of tabersonine and lochnericine (55 μm concentration each). After 15 h of incubation, LC-MS analysis indicated that although both substrates were turned over by the enzyme, lochnericine appeared to be the preferred substrate (supplemental Fig. S7). Morgan and Shanks (10Morgan J.A. Shanks J.V. Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) observed a concomitant reduction in hörhammericine and accumulation of lochnericine in C. roseus hairy roots after treatment with the P450 suicide inhibitor ABT. As such, the ABT sensitivity of CYP71BJ1 provides some further support for the involvement of CYP71BJ1 in hörhammericine biosynthesis in vivo, perhaps favoring a biosynthetic route via lochnericine. Further studies to disrupt the function of CYP71BJ1 in plant tissue such as RNAi in hairy roots might resolve these questions and provide further insight into the physiological role of CYP71BJ1. The substrate scope of CYP71BJ1 seems to be controlled partially by the presence of the 2,3-double bond because dihydrotabersonine is not an accepted substrate. Importantly, the vindoline precursors 16-hydroxytabersonine and 16-O-methoxytabersonine are not hydroxylated by CYP71BJ1. Because hydroxylation at the 16-position is the first step in the conversion of tabersonine to vindoline, we speculate that the substrate specificity of CYP71BJ1 may play a role in preventing the 19-hydroxylation of intermediates destined for vindoline biosynthesis. Silencing of CYP71BJ1 in C. roseus may therefore improve the metabolic flux toward the commercially valuable vindoline-derived bisindole alkaloids. In summary, we report that CYP71BJ1, the first member of a new CYP71 subfamily, stereoselectively hydroxylates lochnericine and tabersonine at the 19-position. We are currently assaying more P450 candidates with tabersonine to detect 6,7-epoxidase activity to further understand how vindoline and 19-O-acetylhörhammericine biosynthesis are regulated.

We found that the two expansin domains, D1 and D2, need to be linked for wall extension activity and that D2 mediates EXLX1 binding to whole cell walls and to cellulose via distinct residues on the D2 surface. Binding to cellulose is mediated by three aromatic residues arranged linearly on the putative binding surface that spans D1 and D2. Mutation of these three residues to alanine eliminated cellulose binding and concomitantly eliminated wall loosening activity measured either by cell wall extension or by weakening of filter paper but hardly affected binding to whole cell walls, which is mediated by basic residues located on other D2 surfaces. Mutation of these basic residues to glutamine reduced cell wall binding but not wall loosening activities. We propose domain D2 as the founding member of a new carbohydrate binding module family, CBM63, but its function in expansin activity apparently goes beyond simply anchoring D1 to the wall. Several polar residues on the putative binding surface of domain D1 are also important for activity, most notably Asp82, whose mutation to alanine or asparagine completely eliminated wall loosening activity. The functional insights based on this bacterial expansin may be extrapolated to the interactions of plant expansins with cell walls.

Expansins were discovered in the 1990s as proteins that induce extension and stress relaxation of plant cell walls at low pH (1McQueen-Mason S. Durachko D.M. Cosgrove D.J. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Their biological functions have meanwhile been extended by numerous molecular, genomic, and genetic studies implicating them in diverse physiological and developmental processes, including cell enlargement, fruit softening, pollination, leaf abscission, and leaf primordium emergence (2Cosgrove D.J.

Sex Plant Reprod. 2009; 22: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two expansin families, named α-expansin and β-expansin, are found in all groups of land plants (16Sampedro J.

U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6559-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The action of expansin on the cell wall is not yet understood in molecular detail. The leading hypothesis is that it loosens plant cell walls by disrupting the noncovalent binding of matrix polysaccharides to cellulose (19Yennawar N.H. Li L.C. Dudzinski D.M. Tabuchi A.

Cosgrove D.J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 22Cosgrove D.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of two β-expansins have been solved (Protein Data Bank codes 2HCZ and 1N10), showing them to consist of two compact domains, D1 and D2, tightly packed onto each other with an open, highly conserved surface spanning the two domains. This putative polysaccharide binding surface (PPBS) 3The abbreviations used are: PPBS, putative polysaccharide binding surface; CBM, carbohydrate binding module; CDTA, 1,2-cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid. is lined with aromatic and polar residues suitable for polysaccharide binding (19Yennawar N.H.

The functions of the two domains and of specific PPBS residues have not yet been tested experimentally because heterologous expression of plant expansins has proved difficult, thus limiting detailed structure-function analysis. Opening a potential route around this impasse, a Bacillus subtilis protein, named YOAJ or EXLX1, was found to possess structural features and wall extension activities characteristic of plant expansins (21Kerff F. Amoroso A. Herman R. Sauvage E. Petrella S. Filée P. Charlier P. Joris B. Tabuchi A. Nikolaidis N. Cosgrove D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16876-16881Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Related proteins are found in phylogenetically diverse bacteria that infect plants and cause vascular wilt disease. Gene knock-out studies indicate that these “bacterial expansins” promote plant infection or root surface colonization by bacteria, possibly by modifying plant cell walls (21Kerff F. Amoroso A. Herman R. Sauvage E. Petrella S. Filée P. Charlier P. Joris B. Tabuchi A. Nikolaidis N. Cosgrove D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Plant-Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similar to plant expansins, EXLX1 has a mass of 23 kDa and consists of two compact domains, D1 and D2, connected by a 4-amino acid linker and packed closely against each other. Domain D1 forms a six-stranded double-ψ β-barrel with high structural similarity to D1 of plant expansins, much lower similarity to GH-45 glycoside hydrolases, and even more distant similarity to GH-102 peptidoglycan lytic transglycosylases (21Kerff F. Amoroso A. Herman R. Sauvage E. Petrella S. Filée P. Charlier P. Joris B. Tabuchi A. Nikolaidis N. Cosgrove D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16876-16881Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Aspartic acid residue Asp-82 in EXLX1 corresponds to an aspartic acid residue in the catalytic sites of GH-45 and GH-102 enzymes, but other residues essential for these catalytic activities are missing in EXLX1 as well as in plant expansins. Consistent with this structure, no bona fide lytic activity has been detected in EXLX1 or other expansins (19Yennawar N.H. Li L.C. Dudzinski D.M. Tabuchi A. Cosgrove D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 14664-14671Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20McQueen-Mason S.J. Cosgrove D.J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 21Kerff F.

U.S.A. 1994; 91: 6574-6578Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Domain D2 in EXLX1 is structurally related to domain D2 of plant expansins, forming an Ig-like β-sandwich. An open, nearly planar PPBS, ∼50 Å long, spans the two EXLX1 domains, formed by Asp-82 and other polar residues in domain D1 and by three aromatic residues (Trp-125, Trp-126, and Tyr-157) in D2 (21Kerff F. Amoroso A. Herman R. Sauvage E. Petrella S. Filée P. Charlier P. Joris B. Tabuchi A. Nikolaidis N. Cosgrove D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16876-16881Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this study, we exploited the ease of EXLX1 expression in Escherichia coli to create protein variants to assess the roles of the two domains for plant cell wall loosening and binding activities. Additionally, we modified conserved residues on the PPBS to assess their importance for wall loosening and binding activities with results that may be extrapolated to plant expansin function. Avicel (FMC BioPolymer, PH-101), fibrous cotton fibers (Sigma, C-6288) and filter paper (Whatman No. 3 and VWR 413) were used as cellulose substrates. Phosphoric acid-swollen cotton fibers and phosphoric acid-swollen Avicel were prepared as described (25Hall M. Bansal P. Lee J.H. Realff M.J. Bommarius A.S. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Insoluble arabinoxylan from wheat flour was purchased from Megazyme (lot number 20301). Wheat coleoptiles (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Pennmore) were prepared as described (26Li L.C. Bedinger P.A. Volk C. Jones A.D. Cosgrove D.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 2073-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fresh celery (Apium graveolens) was purchased from a local market. Parenchyma strips (10 × 1.5 × 0.5 mm) for wall extension assays were prepared from the apical 5-cm region of the inner five to six petioles. Wheat coleoptile cell walls were prepared by an adapted protocol (27Carpita N.C. Defernez M. Findlay K. Wells B. Shoue D.A. Catchpole G. Wilson R.H. McCann M.C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 28Carpita N.C. Plant Physiol. 1984; 76: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Five grams of wheat coleoptiles (1–1.5 cm long, abraded) were ground to fine powder in liquid N2 and washed five times with 50 ml of 1 m NaCl at 4 °C for 2 h by inversion. The residues (mostly cell walls) were vacuum-dried for 2 h and stored at room temperature. For binding studies, cell walls were resuspended in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. For sequential extractions, cell walls were first resuspended by inversion in 50 ml of 50 mm CDTA in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7 overnight at room temperature and washed five times with deionized H2O for 1 h. CDTA was used to solubilize pectins. The wall residues were then resuspended in 50 ml of 0.1 m KOH + 0.3% NaBH4, inverted overnight at room temperature to solubilize loosely bound hemicelluloses, and then washed five times with deionized H2O for 1 h. Finally, to solubilize tightly bound hemicelluloses, residues were resuspended in 50 ml of 4 m KOH + 4% H3BO3 + 0.5% NaBH4, inverted overnight at room temperature, and washed five times with deionized H2O for 1 h. NaN3 (3 mm) was included in steps longer than 2 h to prevent microbial growth. Gluconacetobacter xylinus was grown as described (29Whitney S.E. Gidley M.J. McQueen-Mason S.J. Plant J. 2000; 22: 327-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, G. xylinus cultures were grown in Hestrin-Schramm medium (30Hestrin S. Schramm M. Biochem. J. 1954; 58: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) with 2% (w/v) glucose at 30 °C for 72 h under static conditions. Cellulose pellicles were extensively washed with deionized H2O and stored in 3 mm NaN3 at 4 °C. Pellicle strips (10 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm) were prepared for extension assays. EXLX1 was amplified from B. subtilis genomic DNA by PCR using 5′-GGTTCCATGGCATATGACGACCTGCATGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CAGCTCGAGTTATTCAGGAAACTGAAC-3′ as primers. Subsequently, EXLX1 was cloned between NcoI and XhoI sites of pET22b (Novagen). The original signal peptide of EXLX1 was substituted with pelB, and a methionine was added at the N terminus of the mature EXLX1. D1 and D2 domains were amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GCAGCATATGGACGACCTGCATG-3′ and 5′-CAGCTCGAGTTAGACAACACGCCATTTAAT-3′ and primers 5′-CAGCATATGAATTTCACGTACCGGATC-3′ and 5′-CAGCTCGAGTTATTCAGGAAACTGAAC-3′, respectively. D1 and D2 were cloned into pET22b between the NdeI and XhoI sites. EXLX1 variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange kit). The primers used to generate EXLX1 variants for structure-function analysis are listed in supplemental Table S1. All modifications were confirmed by sequencing. EXLX1 and variants were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3-pLys). Cultures were grown to A600 = 0.6 at 37 °C and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at room temperature. Wild type EXLX1 and all EXLX1 variants (except D1) were purified as described (21Kerff F. Amoroso A. Herman R. Sauvage E. Petrella S. Filée P. Charlier P. Joris B. Tabuchi A. Nikolaidis N. Cosgrove D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16876-16881Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) except that 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 was used instead of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. The purity of 10-μg samples was visualized by 10% SDS-PAGE (15% for domains D1 and D2) and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The cell pellet from a 1-liter culture was resuspended in 40 ml of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 1% CHAPS, 1 mm EDTA, and ½ pellet of protease inhibitors (SIGMAFAST, Sigma-Aldrich). Proteins were precipitated by addition of 24 ml of 3.5 m ammonium sulfate, mixed at 4 °C for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 to a final volume of 2.5 ml and desalted on a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). The sample was filtered through a 0.2-μm Whatman GD/X polyether sulfone (PES) filter and loaded onto a HiPrep Sephacryl S-100 column (GE Healthcare) using 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 + 0.15 m NaCl as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The purified protein was desalted and concentrated with an Amicon 10-kDa filter (Millipore). In contrast to EXLX1 and D2, D1 precipitated when stored at 4 °C for more than 3 days. Therefore, D1 was stored at −80 °C until use. Binding of EXLX1 and variants to cellulose, insoluble arabinoxylans, and wheat coleoptile cell walls, including sequentially extracted cell walls, was analyzed by depletion isotherms. In brief, variable amounts of EXLX1 were added to buffer containing a fixed amount of binding substrate. The mixture was shaken on a Thermomixer R (Eppendorf) set at 1100 rpm and 25 °C until equilibrium was reached (1 h). The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the binding substrate. Protein in the supernatant was quantified by the Bradford assay (Pierce) using BSA for calibration. Soluble protein was subtracted from the protein initially added to obtain the protein bound to the insoluble polysaccharides. Dissociation constants (Kd) and binding capacities were calculated by fitting the data to a single site Langmuir isotherm with Origin 7 (OriginLab). Wheat coleoptiles, celery, and G. xylinus strips were clamped in a constant force extensometer at 25-, 12.5-, and 20-g force, respectively, in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Specimen length was recorded at 30-s intervals before and after addition of wild type EXLX1 or EXLX1 variants as described (1McQueen-Mason S. Durachko D.M. Cosgrove D.J. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 18Cosgrove D.J. Bedinger P. Durachko D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6559-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To weaken wheat coleoptiles, the specimen was incubated in 70 mm NaOH for 20 min, washed extensively with deionized H2O, and finally incubated in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 or other buffer as indicated in the text. Proteins were dialyzed extensively against 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. CD spectra of EXLX1 and variants were collected on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter from 190 to 240 nm with a step of 1.0 nm and a 2-s averaging time. Four replicates per EXLX1 variant were averaged. After subtraction of buffer spectra, CD spectra were smoothed by the means-movement method and analyzed using the DichroWeb on-line server (31Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar, 32Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Biopolymers. 2008; 89: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). The CONTINLL program was used to deconvolute CD spectra using SP175 as a reference data set (33Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar, 34van Stokkum I.H. Spoelder H.J. Bloemendal M. van Grondelle R. Groen F.C. Anal.

The secondary structure of EXLX1 and variants was compared with the actual secondary structure of EXLX1 as determined from Protein Data Bank code 3D30 structure (21Kerff F. Amoroso A. Herman R. Sauvage E. Petrella S. Filée P. Charlier P. Joris B. Tabuchi A. Nikolaidis N. Cosgrove D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16876-16881Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Whatman filter paper No. 3 was cut into 10 × 1.5-mm strips. Ten strips were incubated with 120 μg/ml EXLX1 and variants in 1 ml of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The samples were gently inverted for 4 h at 25 °C. Strips were clamped onto an extensometer and extended at 1.5 mm/min until breakage. The force at the point of breakage was recorded. Amino acid residue Asp-96 in EXLX1 was changed to a cysteine to enable the protein to be labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5-maleimide (Invitrogen). The change was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChange kit) with 5′-CGGCAATATGAAATGCGGAAAAATCAATATTAAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTTAATATTGATTTTTCCGCATTTCATATTGCCG-3′ as primers. Asp-96 is located in domain D1, but it is not part of the PPBS. D96C (92 μm) was incubated in 1.2 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 1 mm Alexa Fluor 488 for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Alexa Fluor 488-labeled D96C was separated on a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) three times to remove all traces of free Alexa Fluor 488. Labeled protein was concentrated in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 on an Amicon 10-kDa filter. Labeled protein (5 μg/ml) was incubated with 10 mg/ml Avicel or 0.5 mg/ml fresh wheat coleoptile cross-sections in 0.3 ml of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 for 1 h on a Thermomixer R (Eppendorf) set at 1100 rpm and 25 °C. Labeled samples were washed five times with 1 ml of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 for 1 h with shaking, mounted onto glass slides, and viewed on a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope with a GFP filter set. Protein alignment was done by using the MUSCLE server (36Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (31027) Google Scholar). Sequence logos were generated by WebLogo server (37Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8449) Google Scholar). Protein structures were visualized with University of California San Francisco Chimera software (38Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (29000) Google Scholar). Wall loosening by expansins may be measured by clamping cell wall specimens in a constant force extensometer and measuring the rate of wall extension before and after addition of expansin (1McQueen-Mason S. Durachko D.M. Cosgrove D.J. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 18Cosgrove D.J. Bedinger P. Durachko D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6559-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Because EXLX1 exhibits relatively low specific activity in such “creep assays” compared with plant expansins (21Kerff F. Amoroso A. Herman R. Sauvage E. Petrella S. Filée P. Charlier P. Joris B. Tabuchi A. Nikolaidis N. Cosgrove D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16876-16881Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we first sought to increase its activity for our structure-function analysis. To that end, we tested walls of differing composition, including cell walls from wheat coleoptiles and celery parenchyma as well as cellulose pellicles from G. xylinus. EXLX1 induced wall creep with all these materials (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C), but activity was weak, variable, or both. The best results were obtained with wheat coleoptile walls pretreated briefly with 70 mm NaOH, which increased EXLX1 response ∼5-fold (supplemental Fig. S1, A and D). Additionally, this pretreatment reduced sample-to-sample variability. The sensitivity and reproducibility gained by this pretreatment made structure-function analysis of EXLX1 feasible. The rate of wall extension depended on EXLX1 concentration, increasing steeply in the 0–25 μg/ml range and approaching saturation at concentrations >50 μg/ml (Fig. 1A). At >200 μg/ml, the wall samples tended to break after a short time, making accurate estimation of the maximum rate of wall extension difficult. For our analysis (below), EXLX1 variants were routinely tested for activity at 30 μg/ml. Higher protein amounts were used for EXLX1 variants with little or no activity. EXLX1 induced cell wall creep at pH values from 5.5 to 9.5 (Fig. 1B); at pH = 4.5, the activity was very low, whereas at lower pH values, EXLX1 precipitated. Activity was reduced at pH 10.5 and was not detected at pH 11.5. Two different buffers were tested at pH 10.5 and 11.5 with similar results, reducing the possibility of buffer-specific inhibition. Based on these results, the activity of EXLX1 variants was routinely assayed in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. In addition to these wall creep assays, we tested the ability of EXLX1 to weaken Whatman filter paper (a network of pure cellulose) by extending uniform strips under increasing force until they broke (39Kim E.S. Lee H.J. Bang W.G. Choi I.G. Kim K.H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2009; 102: 1342-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Preincubation of strips with EXLX1 reduced the breakage force by 20% compared with preincubation with buffer (Fig. 2A). Although this effect was reproducible, it was not sensitive enough to be used alone for structure-function analysis of EXLX1. Instead, we used it as a supplemental assay to test EXLX1 variants with little or no cell wall extension activity. We designed protein variants consisting of single domains or full-length proteins with specific PPBS residues modified by site-directed mutagenesis. EXLX1 variants were expressed in E. coli, purified by cation exchange chromatography, and tested for wall loosening activities or for wall binding. Protein purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S2). The secondary structure of EXLX1 variants, including single domain variants, was assessed by circular dichroism spectra to ensure that the proteins were not denatured or seriously misfolded (supplemental Table S2). To test the hypothesis that wall loosening activity is mediated solely by one of the domains, each EXLX1 domain was expressed as described above and tested for wall creep activity. No activity was detected for either domain at concentrations as high as 100 μg/ml (Fig. 3). On a molar basis, this concentration is ∼26-fold higher than an EXLX1 concentration of 7.5 μg/ml, which induced a substantial creep response (Fig. 1A). Likewise, a mixture of D1 and D2 together did not result in activity (Fig. 3). These results indicate that D1 and D2 by themselves have negligible wall extension activity and need to be connected for effective wall extension activity. Thr-12 and Asp-82 in domain D1 (shown in Fig. 4) are absolutely conserved among expansins as well as in some distantly related enzymes (19Yennawar N.H. Li L.C. Dudzinski D.M. Tabuchi A. Cosgrove D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 14664-14671Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 21Kerff F. Amoroso A. Herman R. Sauvage E. Petrella S. Filée P. Charlier P. Joris B. Tabuchi A.

Despite its strict conservation, Thr-12 was not essential for activity because the T12A variant exhibited ∼70% wall extension activity compared with wild type EXLX1 (Fig. 5A). Therefore, the role of Thr-12 may be subtle or not related to wall loosening. In contrast, neither D82A nor D82N showed detectable creep activity even at 200 μg/ml (Fig. 5A), whereas the D82E variant had 30% activity compared with wild type EXLX1 (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that the carboxyl group of Asp-82 is crucial for wall extension activity.FIGURE 5Creep activity of EXLX1 variants. A, creep activity of amino acid variants in domain D1 relative to wild type EXLX1. B, creep activity of amino acid variants in domain D2 relative to wild type EXLX1. Alkali-pretreated wheat coleoptiles were used as substrate. When activity was tested at 200 instead of 30 μg/ml, the number 200 appears next to the name of the EXLX1 variant. Error bars indicate S.E.

D71A showed greatly reduced activity, whereas D71N had moderate activity (∼50%) compared with wild type EXLX1 (Fig. 5A). Thus, the carboxyl group at Asp-71 is important but not essential for wall creep activity. Y73A activity was severely reduced, whereas a more conservative substitution, Y73F, gave good activity (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the aromatic ring of Tyr-73, but not its hydroxyl group, is important for activity. The roles of Thr-14 and Ser-16 were studied by altering them to alanine. Thr-14 is close to Asp-82 (3.6 Å) and could form H-bonds with Asp-82 or with a polysaccharide ligand. Indeed, T14A showed an ∼60% reduction in activity compared with wild type (Fig. 5A). S16A was only moderately reduced in activity (39%; Fig. 5A). Likewise, E75A and E75Q activities were reduced by 30–35% (Fig. 5A), indicating that Glu-75 plays a moderate role in wall creep activity. Finally, alanine substitutions of Lys-95 and Lys-98 (Fig. 4) did not affect activity. Collectively, these results show that many residues on the conserved D1 surface contribute to activity with mutation of Asp-82 resulting in complete loss of activity, whereas mutations of other residues resulted in reduced activity. Because Lys-119 along with the aromatic amino acids Trp-125, Trp-126, and Tyr-157 are part of the PPBS spanning D1 and D2, their importance for wall creep activity was tested by mutagenesis. K119A, W125A, W126A, and Y157A variants showed reduced activity by ∼50, ∼25, ∼35, and ∼65%, respectively, compared with wild type EXLX1 (Fig. 5B). The double change in W125A/W126A almost entirely eliminated a"

It also catalyzes the reduction of a number of non-physiological doubly and triply bonded small molecules (e.g. C(2)H(2), N(2)O). Carbon monoxide (CO) is not reduced by the wild-type molybdenum nitrogenase but instead inhibits the reduction of all substrates catalyzed by nitrogenase except protons. Here, we report that when the nitrogenase MoFe protein α-Val(70) residue is substituted by alanine or glycine, the resulting variant proteins will catalyze the reduction and coupling of CO to form methane (CH(4)), ethane (C(2)H(6)), ethylene (C(2)H(4)), propene (C(3)H(6)), and propane (C(3)H(8)). The rates and ratios of hydrocarbon production from CO can be adjusted by changing the flux of electrons through nitrogenase, by substitution of other amino acids located near the FeMo-cofactor, or by changing the partial pressure of CO. Increasing the partial pressure of CO shifted the product ratio in favor of the longer chain alkanes and alkenes. The implications of these findings in understanding the nitrogenase mechanism and the relationship to Fischer-Tropsch production of hydrocarbons from CO are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2037665777,"Carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs) of TDP-43 aggregate to form the diagnostic signature inclusions of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but the biological significance of these CTFs and how they are generated remain enigmatic. To address these issues, we engineered mammalian cells with an inducible tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease that cleaves TDP-43 containing a TEV cleavage site. Regions of TDP-43 flanking the second RNA recognition motif (RRM2) are efficiently cleaved by TEV, whereas sites within this domain are more resistant to cleavage. CTFs containing RRM2 generated from de novo cleavage of nuclear TDP-43 are transported to the cytoplasm and efficiently cleared, indicating that cleavage alone is not sufficient to initiate CTF aggregation. However, CTFs rapidly aggregated into stable cytoplasmic inclusions following de novo cleavage when dynein-mediated microtubule transport was disrupted, RNA was depleted, or natively misfolded CTFs were introduced into these cells. Our data support a ""two-hit"" mechanism of CTF aggregation dependent on TDP-43 cleavage."

https://openalex.org/W2019058511,"NDRG1 and KAI1 belong to metastasis suppressor genes, which impede the dissemination of tumor cells from primary tumors to distant organs. Previously, we identified the metastasis promoting transcription factor, ATF3, as a downstream target of NDRG1. Further analysis revealed that the KAI1 promoter contained a consensus binding motif of ATF3, suggesting a possibility that NDRG1 suppresses metastasis through inhibition of ATF3 expression followed by activation of the KAI1 gene. In this report, we found that ectopic expression of NDRG1 was able to augment endogenous KAI1 gene expression in prostate cancer cell lines, whereas silencing NDRG1 was accompanied with significant decrease in KAI1 expression in vitro and in vivo. In addition, our results of ChIP analysis indicate that ATF3 indeed bound to the promoter of the KAI1 gene. Importantly, our promoter-based analysis revealed that ATF3 modulated KAI1 transcription through cooperation with other endogenous transcription factor as co-activator (ATF3-JunB) or co-repressor (ATF3-NFκB). Moreover, loss of KAI1 expression significantly abrogated NDRG1-mediated metastatic suppression in vitro as well as in a spontaneous metastasis animal model, indicating that KA11 is a functional downstream target of the NDRG1 pathway. Our result of immunohistochemical analysis showed that loss of NDRG1 and KAI1 occurs in parallel as prostate cancer progresses. We also found that a combined expression status of these two genes serves as a strong independent prognostic marker to predict metastasis-free survival of prostate cancer patients. Taken together, our result revealed a novel regulatory network of two metastasis suppressor genes, NDRG1 and KAI1, which together concerted metastasis-suppressive activities through an intrinsic transcriptional cascade.

Although significant advances have been made in reducing mortality rates, the majority of cancer patients are still diagnosed at an advanced stage and ultimately die from sequelae of metastatic disease. Metastasis involves a complex process through which malignant cancer cells leave a primary organ site, journey to a distant site via circulation, and finally establish a clinically detectable mass in a distant organ, and therefore, the metastatic progression requires dysregulation of a series of genes and related signaling. Metastasis suppressor genes are negative regulators of metastasis, which inhibit metastasis but do not affect the ability of the transformed cells to generate a tumor at the primary site (1Berger J.C.

More than 20 metastasis suppressors have been discovered so far, and they appear to be involved in several pivotal steps of metastasis, including invasion (NM23, DLC1, KAI1, and NDRG1), dissemination (KAI1, CD44), survival (BRMS1, caspase-8), and growth in distant sites (NM23, KAI1, RHOGD12, KISS1, Raf kinase inhibitor protein, and MKK4/6) (4Steeg P.S.

However, the detailed molecular mechanism of how these genes are regulated and their functions are less elucidated. KAI1, also known as CD82, was discovered initially from T-cell activation study and was identified later as a prostate-specific tumor metastasis suppressor gene (8Gaugitsch H.W. Hofer E. Huber N.E.

It is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues with high mRNA levels in spleen, placenta, kidney, and prostate, whereas decrease or loss of its expression is constantly found in the clinically advanced cancers (12Liu W.M. Zhang X.A. Cancer Lett. 2006; 240: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Consistently, inverse correlations between KAI1 expression and the invasive and metastatic potential as well as poor survival of patients have been observed frequently in a wide range of malignancies (12Liu W.M. Zhang X.A. Cancer Lett. 2006; 240: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). KAI1 belongs to the tetraspanin transmembrane protein superfamily, and it is found to be associated with other tetraspanins (CD9 and CD81), integrins (β1 and β2), immunoreceptors (MHCI and II, EWI1/PGRL, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD46), growth factors and receptors (EGF and EGFR), as well as intracellular signaling proteins (PKC) (12Liu W.M. Zhang X.A. Cancer Lett. 2006; 240: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). KAI1 was found previously to inhibit cell motility by regulating the biological activities of its associated proteins and/or reorganizing plasma membrane microdomains (12Liu W.M. Zhang X.A. Cancer Lett. 2006; 240: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This process occasionally induces apoptosis by releasing intracellular glutathione and accumulating intracellular reactive oxygen intermediates (13Ono M. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S.I. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2335-2339PubMed Google Scholar, 14Schoenfeld N. Bauer M.K. Grimm S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have demonstrated recently that KAI1 exerts its metastasis suppressor function by directly binding to Duffy blood group, chemokine receptor on endothelial cells, thereby inducing senescence signaling in tumor cells in circulation (15Bandyopadhyay S. Wang Y. Zhan R. Pai S.K. Watabe M. Iiizumi M. Furuta E. Mohinta S. Liu W. Hirota S. Hosobe S. Tsukada T. Miura K. Takano Y. Saito K. Commes T. Piquemal D. Hai T. Watabe K. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11983-11990Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because mutations and loss of heterozygosity of the KAI1 gene is rare, the down-regulation of this gene is not likely because of genetic alterations but is rather due to modulation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation (16Dong J.T.

However, how KAI1 is down-regulated in metastatic cancer cells is largely unknown. Previously, we showed that p53 is able to bind to the KAI1 promoter and turn on its transcription (21Mashimo T.

Other molecules involved in KAI1 transcriptional regulation include NFκB, β-catenin/Reptin, Tip60/Fe65, N-CoR/TBL2/HDAC3 and AP-1 (23Telese F. Bruni P. Donizetti A. Gianni D. D'Ambrosio C. Scaloni A.

Interestingly, these transcription factors were frequently found to coordinately regulate the expression of KAI1 as either co-activator or co-repressor. Therefore, studies on these transcription factors may aid in elucidating the mechanism leading to KAI1 suppression and following metastatic progression. NDRG1 (N-Myc downstream regulated gene 1) was originally isolated as a novel gene that was induced strongly during differentiation of colon carcinoma cell lines (29van Belzen N. Dinjens W.N. Diesveld M.P. Groen N.A. van der Made A.C. Nozawa Y. Vlietstra R. Trapman J. Bosman F.T. Lab. Invest. 1997; 77: 85-92PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that the NDRG1 gene is controlled by a variety of factors and stimuli related to cancer progression, including oncogenes, tumor suppressors, hypoxic microenvironment, and hormone dysregulation (30Kovacevic Z. Richardson D.R. Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 2355-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 31Ellen T.P. Ke Q. Zhang P. Costa M. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Clinical studies also provided compelling evidence that reduced expression of the NDRG1 gene was significantly associated with poor overall survival rate in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, glioma, prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers (32Iiizumi M. Liu W. Pai S.K. Furuta E. Watabe K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1786: 87-104PubMed Google Scholar). The significant inverse correlation of NDRG1 expression with the extent of metastasis in a clinical setting raised an important question as to whether the down-regulation of NDRG1 is cause or result of metastases. To address this issue, we overexpressed the NDRG1 gene in a highly metastatic prostate cell line AT6.1 and implanted it into severe combined immunodeficiency mice (33Bandyopadhyay S. Pai S.K.

Our results indicate that NDRG1 has the ability to suppress the metastatic process of prostate cancer cells without affecting tumorigenicity in vivo. Similar metastasis suppressor effect of NDRG1 was also observed in other animal models including colon, bladder, and pancreatic carcinoma cells (34Guan R.J. Ford H.L. Fu Y. Li Y. Shaw L.M.

A recent study employing whole genome gene array analysis in examining the functions of NDRG1 in a number of different cancer cells strongly indicate the pleiotropic nature of NDRG1 in suppressing metastasis (39Xu X. Sutak R. Richardson D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We previously performed the Affymetrix gene array analysis and found that NDRG1 suppressed metastasis of prostate tumor cells by inhibiting the transcription factor ATF3 (15Bandyopadhyay S. Wang Y. Zhan R. Pai S.K. Watabe M. Iiizumi M. Furuta E. Mohinta S. Liu W. Hirota S. Hosobe S. Tsukada T. Miura K. Takano Y. Saito K. Commes T. Piquemal D. Hai T. Watabe K. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11983-11990Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Consistent with our observation, Ishiguro et al. (40Ishiguro T. Nakajima M. Naito M. Muto T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 875-879PubMed Google Scholar) showed that ectopic expression of ATF3 converted the low metastatic potential melanoma cell line to become highly metastatic. Moreover, ATF3 expression appears to be required for the maintenance of a high metastatic state of melanoma and colon cancer cells (41Ishiguro T. Nagawa H. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 2000; 91: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ATF3 is a member of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (ATF/CREB) family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors (42Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that ATF3 plays a critical role in metastatic progression in a cell context-dependent manner. To gain further mechanistic insight into the functional role of NDRG1, we sought to identify and characterize the possible downstream targets of ATF3 that are involved in tumor metastasis. The result of our bioinformatic analysis for the promoters of metastasis-related genes revealed that there were a number of genes whose promoter contained the ATF3-responsive consensus sequence, TGACGTCA. Among these, we identified proapoptotic gene GADD153/CHOP10, cell adhesion molecular E-selectin, tumor suppressor p53, and metastasis suppressor KAI1 as potential targets of ATF3. These clues prompted us to examine a possible link between two metastasis suppressor genes, NDRG1 and KAI1, through ATF3 in the current study. Human prostate cancer cell line PC3mm and rat prostatic carcinoma cell line AT6.1 were kindly provided by Drs. I. J. Fidler (The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) and C. Rinker-Schaeffer (University of Chicago), respectively. The PC3mm/Tet 2The abbreviations used are: Tet, tetracycline; TRAMP, transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate. cell line was established previously as a derivative of PC3mm and contains a tetracycline-inducible suppressor. The human prostate cancer cell line DU145, prostate epithelial cell line RWPE1, and colon cancer cell line HT38 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). NDRG1- and KAI1-overexpressing stable clones of AT6.1 cells were established as described previously (33Bandyopadhyay S. Pai S.K. Gross S.C. Hirota S. Hosobe S. Miura K. Saito K. Commes T. Hayashi S. Watabe M. Watabe K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1731-1736PubMed Google Scholar). For AT6.1/NDRG1/shKAI1, shRNA for KAI1 (Open Biosystems) or the vector alone was transfected into AT6.1/NDRG1 cells, and the puromycin-resistant clones were selected. The expression of KAI1 in the cloned cells was tested by RT-PCR. All cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and 250 nm dexamethasone (Sigma) and grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For all transfection experiments, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. The luciferase activities were measured by using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, MI) and a luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Huntsville, Alabama). For each transfection experiment, the Renilla expression plasmid phRG-TK (Promega) was co-transfected as an internal control, and the promoter activities were normalized accordingly. Immunohistochemical analysis on paraffin-embedded, surgically resected specimens of prostate and breast was carried out using anti-NDRG1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (from Dr. Commes) and anti-KAI1 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Yoshie). Briefly, sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and heated at 80 °C for 20 min in 25 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 9) for antigen exposure. They were then treated with 3% H2O2 to block endogenous peroxidase activity and further incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at 24 °C. After washing with Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20, the sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit-specific IgG (Dako). The sections were washed extensively, and 3,3-diaminobenzidine substrate chromogen solution was applied followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. The GEO database (accession no. GSE21034, n = 218) was used to evaluate the clinical relevance of NDRG1 and KAI1 in prostate cancer. The data were log2-transformed, with the median set as zero and with S.D. set as one. Each patient was assigned to have positive or negative expression of each gene and was matched with metastasis-free survival. The gene expressions in normal, primary tumor, or metastatic sites in patients who have either metastatic or nonmetastatic disease were compared using Box-and-whisker plot analysis and evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test. The association between genes and clinical outcomes was calculated by the Pearson χ2 test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the overall survival rate, and prognostic significance was evaluated by the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis for the prognostic value of gene signatures was performed by the Cox proportional hazard regression model. For all statistical analysis, Prism and SPSS software were used. For in vitro experiments and animal studies, results are reported as mean ± S.D. (or mean ± S.E.) as indicated in the figure legends. Statistical significance was determined by a two-sided Student's test. 4–6-Week-old severe combined immunodeficiency mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were used for the spontaneous metastasis studies. 0.5 × 106 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS were injected subcutaneously into the dorsal flank of mice. Mice were monitored daily, and the tumor volume was measured as an index of the growth rate and calculated as (width + length)/2 × width × length × 0.5236. Mice were sacrificed 30 days after the inoculation of cells, and metastatic lesions were counted macroscopically. We first examined the effect of NDRG1 on the expression of the KAI1 gene in two human prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3mm/Tet-FLAG-NDRG1 (referred to as PC3mm/Tet), by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. NDRG1 expression was induced by tetracycline treatment in PC3mm-Tet cells. Alternatively, the NDRG1 expression plasmid was transfected into DU145 cells. We found that the expression of KAI1 gene was significantly up-regulated by ectopic expression of NDRG1 (Fig. 1A). To further examine whether NDRG1 has an effect on the transcription of the KAI1 gene, we transfected the KAI1 reporter plasmid into PC3mm/Tet and DU145 cells, which were then forced to overexpress the NDRG1 gene. As shown in Fig. 1B, our results showed that NDRG1 expression indeed significantly augmented KAI1 gene transcription. Moreover, when PC3mm cells were treated with Dp44mT, an NDRG1-specific agonist, the expression of the KAI1 gene was also significantly elevated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C, lower panel). The increased KAI1 expression in the Dp44mT-treated cells was also confirmed by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Furthermore, we introduced NDRG1 shRNA into nonmalignant prostate epithelial cell RWPE1 or NDRG1 siRNA into colon carcinoma cell HT38 because both cell lines are known to express the KAI1 gene. We found that the specific knockdown of NDRG1 indeed significantly down-regulated the expression of the KAI1 gene in these cell lines (Fig. 1D). We also examined the expression of KAI1 and NDRG1 in a panel of prostate and breast cancer cell lines (n = 11 and 39 for prostate and breast cancer cell lines, respectively). We found that KAI1 mRNA expression was significantly correlated with NDRG1 expression in multiple cancer cell lines (p = 0.0014 and 0.0004 for prostate (upper panel) and breast (lower panel) cancer cell lines, respectively, Fig. 1E), indicating that the expression of NDRG1 and KAI1 generally has a positive correlation in human prostate and breast cancer cells. To further examine the relevance of NDRG1 and KAI1 in vivo, we compared the expression of Ndrg1 and Kai1 in NDRG1 knock-out (Ndrg1−/−) and syngenic wild type mice (Ndrg1+/+). Consistent with the results of our in vitro studies, we found that Kai1 mRNA expressed at a significantly lower level in Ndrg1 knock-out mice compared with that in wild type mice (Fig. 1F). To identify the NDRG1-responsive sequence on the KAI1 promoter, we generated a series of luciferase reporter plasmids containing up to −2900, −1118, −730, and −332 bases of the KAI1 promoter, and luciferase reporter activities were measured in PC3mm/Tet cells with or without induction of NDRG1 expression. As shown in Fig. 2A, the deletion between −1118 and −730 bases of the KAI1 promoter region almost completely abolished the ability of this promoter to respond to NDRG1. We also examined the KAI1 promoter activity in DU145 cells, which was transfected with the NDRG1 expression plasmid and observed a similar result. These results suggest that the region between −1118 and −730 contains an NDRG1-responsive sequence. When we examined the sequence of this region, we found three potential binding sites for ATF3, and one of these was a complete match to the consensus sequence. To further determine whether ATF3 binds to the KAI1 promoter, ChIP assay was performed, and the results clearly showed that ATF3 indeed bound to the predicted region of the KAI1 promoter, whereas induction of NDRG1 expression significantly blocked this binding (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Consistently, we found that silencing the expression of ATF3 by siRNA in PC3mm cells resulted in significant up-regulation of KAI1 mRNA expression (Fig. 2B). Therefore, our results strongly suggest that NDRG1 regulates KAI1 expression by modulating ATF3 signaling pathway. Surprisingly, however, we found that ectopic expression of ATF3 in PC3mm cells significantly up-regulated KAI1 promoter activity and that the mutation of the ATF3-binding consensus sequence on the KAI1 promoter abolished this responsiveness to ATF3 (Fig. 2C, left panel). ATF3 is known to be a bidirectional transcription factor, which either activates or represses transcription dependent on its dimerized partner in a cell context-dependent manner (42Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the NFκB subunit p50 was reported previously to be involved in a protein complex that was capable of inhibiting KAI1 transcription (25Kim J.H. Kim B. Cai L. Choi H.J. Ohgi K.A. Tran C. Chen C. Chung C.H. Huber O. Rose D.W. Sawyers C.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Baek S.H. Nature. 2005; 434: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and p50 is also known to be able to form a dimeric complex with ATF family members (53Gilchrist M. Thorsson V. Li B. Rust A.G. Korb M. Roach J.C. Kennedy K. Hai T. Bolouri H. Aderem A. Nature. 2006; 441: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined a possibility that ATF3 coordinates with p50 to repress KAI1 transcription. We found that ATF3 was indeed pulled down with p50 (Fig. 2C, right panel) and works together to suppress KAI1 promoter activity after co-transfection of ATF3 and p50 expression plasmids in PC3mm cells (Fig. 2C, left panel). However, ATF3 and p50 failed to down-regulate KAI1 promoter activity when ATF3 binding sites were mutated (Fig. 2C, left panel), suggesting that p50 cooperates with ATF3 to suppress KAI1 expression. To further verify this result, we examined an effect of the p50 inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, on the expression of the KAI1 gene in the presence or absence of NDRG1. As shown in Fig. 2D, either induction of NDRG1 or inhibition of p50 significantly up-regulated KAI1 transcriptional activity in the PC3mm cell, and a combination of NDRG1 and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate further up-regulated KAI1 promoter activity. However, neither of the treatments induced suppression of KAI1 promoter activity when the ATF3 consensus binding site was mutated. These results strongly support our notion that NDRG1 up-regulates KAI1 by blocking the suppressor activity of the ATF3-p50 complex on the KAI1 promoter. Notably, it was reported previously that p50 dimerized and bound to a region between −6631 and −6996 bp upstream of the KAI1 gene transcription start site (23Telese F. Bruni P. Donizetti A. Gianni D. D'Ambrosio C. Scaloni A. Zambrano N. Rosenfeld M.G. Russo T. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). To further corroborate that p50 is involved in ATF3-mediated KAI1 transcriptional regulation, we performed a ChIP assay by precipitating the p50-chromatin complex followed by quantitative PCR analysis with the pairs of primers specific to the region of ATF3 binding site. We found that p50 indeed bound to the proximal region of ATF3 binding site on the KAI1 promoter by forming a complex with ATF3, which was negatively regulated by NDRG1 (Fig. 2E). ATF3 can form a complex with various other members in the ATF family such as ATF2 and ATF4, as well as AP-1 proteins (27Marreiros A. Dudgeon K. Dao V. Grimm M.O. Czolij R. Crossley M. Jackson P. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Marreiros A. Czolij R. Yardley G. Crossley M. Jackson P. Gene. 2003; 302: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that ATF3, in combination with the AP-1 family protein JunB, significantly enhanced KAI1 transcriptional activity compared with each alone (Fig. 2F). Taken together, our result indicates that ATF3 modulates KAI1 expression through an intrinsic mechanism that is dependent on the dynamic cellular context of tumor progression. The positive regulatory role of NDRG1 in KAI1 expression prompted us to examine the functional relevance of these two metastasis suppressors in tumor progression. We established permanent cell lines expressing NDRG1 with or without knocking down the KAI1 gene using the highly metastatic prostate cancer cell line AT6.1 (Fig. 3, A and B). These cell lines were then examined for their metastatic behavior through a series of functional assays. As we have reported previously, the expression of NDRG1 sign"
https://openalex.org/W2068689195,"Cellular cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by Scap, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein with eight transmembrane helices. In cholesterol-depleted cells, Scap transports sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) to the Golgi, where the active fragment of SREBP is liberated by proteases so that it can activate genes for cholesterol synthesis. When ER cholesterol increases, Scap binds cholesterol, and this changes the conformation of cytosolic Loop 6, which contains the binding site for COPII proteins. The altered conformation precludes COPII binding, abrogating movement to the Golgi. Consequently, cholesterol synthesis declines. Here, we identify the cholesterol-binding site on Scap as Loop 1, a 245-amino acid sequence that projects into the ER lumen. Recombinant Loop 1 binds sterols with a specificity identical to that of the entire Scap membrane domain. When tyrosine 234 in Loop 1 is mutated to alanine, Loop 6 assumes the cholesterol-bound conformation, even in sterol-depleted cells. As a result, full-length Scap(Y234A) cannot mediate SREBP processing in transfected cells. These results indicate that luminal Loop 1 of Scap controls the conformation of cytosolic Loop 6, thereby determining whether cells produce cholesterol."

In this study the stability of the mammalian HRD1-SEL1L complex was assessed by performing siRNA-mediated knockdown of each of its components. Although endogenous SEL1L is a long-lived protein, the half-life of SEL1L was greatly reduced when HRD1 is silenced. Conversely, transiently expressed SEL1L was rapidly degraded but was stabilized when HRD1 was coexpressed. This was in contrast to the yeast Hrd1p-Hrd3p, where Hrd1p is destabilized by the depletion of Hrd3p, the SEL1L homologue. Endogenous HRD1-SEL1L formed a large ERAD complex (Complex I) associating with numerous ERAD components including ERAD lectin OS-9, membrane-spanning Derlin-1/2, VIMP, and Herp, whereas transiently expressed HRD1-SEL1L formed a smaller complex (Complex II) that was associated with OS-9 but not with Derlin-1/2, VIMP, or Herp. Despite its lack of stable association with the latter components, Complex II supported the retrotranslocation and degradation of model ERAD substrates α1-antitrypsin null Hong-Kong (NHK) and its variant NHK-QQQ lacking the N-glycosylation sites.

While NHK-QQQ is degraded more rapidly when SEL1L is transiently expressed, the simultaneous transfection of HRD1 diminishes this effect. Accordingly, a model is proposed whereby formation and stabilization of HRD1-SEL1L ERAD complex regulates mammalian ERAD.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we analyzed the effect of silencing SEL1L or HRD1 on the ERAD complex and found that SEL1L turnover is determined by HRD1. The half-life of endogenous SEL1L was longer than 12 h in our assay system, which coincides with the previously reported 15-h half-life of endogenous and transfected HRD1 in HeLa cells (10Kikkert M. Doolman R. Dai M. Avner R. Hassink G. van Voorden S. Thanedar S. Roitelman J. Chau V. Wiertz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3525-3534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). When the relative amount of HRD1 was decreased, SEL1L was more rapidly degraded. Thus, the mode of HRD1-SEL1L ubiquitin-ligase complex regulation in the ER membrane is completely different from that of the yeast homologue Hrd1p-Hrd3p, in which unstable Hrd1p is stabilized by its association with Hrd3p (8Plemper R.K. Bordallo J. Deak P.M. Taxis C. Hitt R. Wolf D.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4123-4134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gardner R.G. Swarbrick G.M. Bays N.W. Cronin S.R. Wilhovsky S. Seelig L. Kim C. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The half-life of endogenous SEL1L is reported to be 3 h in human U373 glioblastoma-astrocytoma cells (13Mueller B. Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which is inconsistent with our present results. Because we used human 293 cells, the discrepancy might depend upon the cell lines used. The amount of SEL1L and HRD1 synthesized in some cell lines may not be stoichiometric, which would result in a rapid degradation of the excess SEL1L that was not associated with HRD1. Additional studies are required to clarify this discrepancy.Sedimentation analyses revealed that the ERAD lectin OS-9 dissociates from the large ERAD complex when either SEL1L or HRD1 is silenced (Fig. 7). OS-9 in 293 cells is composed of two splice variants, v1 and v2. Interestingly, OS-9v2 but not v1 preferentially associated with overexpressed HRD1-SEL1L. This finding suggests a functional difference between the two splice variants. Two models have been proposed for the function of OS-9. OS-9 may carry misfolded ERAD substrates to the membrane ERAD complex and/or may stably associate with the membrane complex to proofread the substrates (Ref. 31Christianson J.C. Shaler T.A. Tyler R.E. Kopito R.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar; for review, see Refs. 28Tamura T. Cormier J.H. Hebert D.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 298-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar and 30Hosokawa N. Kamiya Y. Kato K. Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These two models are not mutually exclusive. Association of endogenous OS-9 with overexpressed HRD1-SEL1L suggests that at least a portion of OS-9 is a stable component of the complex. It is also unclear whether OS-9 regulates glycosylated substrates only as a lectin or if it also recognizes the misfolded polypeptides. Additional studies are required to clarify the function of OS-9. Moreover, near-stoichiometric association of OS-9 to the HRD1-SEL1L complex (∼1:3) suggests that HRD1-SEL1L has room for additional OS-9. Alternatively, the surface of SEL1L used for OS-9 binding can be occupied by other molecules, such as XTP3-B.The sedimentation rates of Derlin-1/2, Herp, and VIMP did not change when either SEL1L or HRD1 was silenced. Both Herp (47Kokame K. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9199-9205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and Derlin-2 (48Oda Y. Okada T. Yoshida H. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) are ER stress-responsive genes and are up-regulated by SEL1L depletion, as SEL1L deficiency causes ER stress (49Francisco A.B. Singh R. Li S. Vani A.K. Yang L. Munroe R.J. Diaferia G. Cardano M. Biunno I. Qi L. Schimenti J.C. Long Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13694-13703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although we also detected an increase in Herp and Derlin-2, the sedimentation profiles of these proteins remained unchanged (supplemental Fig. S3). Collectively, these results suggest that the large membrane ERAD complex is composed of the dynamic association of two sub-complexes; one containing Derlin-1/2, Herp, and VIMP and the other containing HRD1-SEL1L and OS-9.In yeast, the Hrd1p-Hrd3p complex is required for both ERAD-C and ERAD-M pathways. However, Der1p and Usa1p are dispensable for the ERAD-M pathway (26Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), and the association of Der1p to the Hrd1p-Hrd3p complex is relatively weak (23Gauss R. Sommer T. Jarosch E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1827-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologues of Der1p and Usa1p are Derlin-1/2/3 and Herp, respectively. Therefore, the HRD1-SEL1L complex may be formed similar to the complex assembled in yeast ER, with non-inclusion of Derlin-1/2(/3) and Herp (Complex II).Transiently expressed HRD1-SEL1L formed a smaller complex (Complex II) in addition to the large endogenous complex (Complex I) (Fig. 7). Complex II was associated with OS-9 but did not cosediment with Derlin-1/2, Herp, and VIMP. This is consistent with the two-subcomplex model suggested by the knockdown of either SEL1L or HRD1. NHK degradation depends on the Derlin2/3 complex (48Oda Y. Okada T. Yoshida H. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Because Complex II supports the extraction and degradation of ERAD substrates of both glycosylated NHK and non-glycosylated NHK-QQQ, Complex II likely interacts transiently or weakly with the Derlin-containing complex. Alternatively, the HRD1-SEL1L complex may be too saturated for cosedimentation with Derlins/Herp/VIMP. In the latter case, HRD1-SEL1L may associate with another complex for the retrotranslocation of ERAD clients when the Derlin-containing complex is unavailable.Transiently expressed SEL1L was rapidly degraded by the proteasomal pathway with a half-life of 1 h, but coexpression of HRD1 markedly stabilized SEL1L. Conversely, when endogenous SEL1L was dissociated from HRD1 (i.e. by way of siRNA-mediated HRD1 knockdown), SEL1L became destabilized. These stabilization effects of HRD1 were independent of the ubiquitin-ligase activity. Thus, HRD1-unassociated SEL1L is degraded by another ubiquitin-ligase localized in the ER membrane (Fig. 7C, an E3, shown in pink).NHK-QQQ was degraded more rapidly when SEL1L was overexpressed, decreasing the t½ of NHK-QQQ from 60 to 30 min. Although coimmunoprecipitation of NHK-QQQ with SEL1L was easily detected, it is unlikely that NHK-QQQ was degraded in its SEL1L-bound form, as the half-life of overexpressed SEL1L is 1 h. Rather, the faster degradation was likely because of the function of the E3 that recognized NHK-QQQ (Fig. 7, an E3, shown in pink). The requirement of the HRD1-SEL1L complex for ERAD likely prevents the rapid degradation of discrete substrates and affords time for proofreading. Various ERAD substrates require SEL1L or HRD1 for degradation (10Kikkert M. Doolman R. Dai M. Avner R. Hassink G. van Voorden S. Thanedar S. Roitelman J. Chau V. Wiertz E. J. Biol.

The stabilization and assembly of the HRD1-SEL1L complex thus play a central role in mammalian ERAD regulation.

The level of non-esterified AA is controlled by the relative activities of phospholipases, lysophospholipid acyl transferases (25Pérez-Chacón G. Astudillo A.M. Balgoma D. Balboa M.A. Balsinde J.

The cPLA2α enzyme is regulated through a series of phosphorylation events leading to its activation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it selectively hydrolyzes phospholipids containing AA at the sn-2 position (29Hefner Y.

However, it is currently unknown whether CD36 plays a role in the regulation of AA release and eicosanoid production during cellular activation. The identification of such a role for CD36 would provide an important link between its pleiotropic functions and cellular inflammatory responses. Here, we demonstrate that CD36 participates in the activation of membrane calcium channels in response to ER calcium depletion or purinergic stimulation and in the phosphorylation and translocation of cPLA2α to membranes to release AA from phospholipids.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrate that CD36 participates in the regulation of cellular calcium influx in response to depletion of ER calcium stores triggered either via inhibition of SERCA (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+/ATPase) or by purinergic receptor activation. Moreover, our results show that an important consequence of this role of CD36 is activation of the cellular events that result in AA release and eicosanoid formation.CD36 Modulates Calcium Entry in Response to ER Calcium DepletionStore-operated or receptor-operated calcium channels in the plasma membrane (PM) are activated by depletion of intracellular calcium stores to promote calcium influx, resulting in a sustained rise in intracellular calcium. Using thapsigargin, a SERCA inhibitor, or UTP, which signals via membrane purinergic receptors and the inositol triphosphate pathway for release of ER calcium, we demonstrated that CD36 expression mediated cellular calcium entry in response to ER calcium depletion. Thapsigargin- and UTP-induced calcium signals in the absence or presence of extracellular calcium exhibited a biphasic process reflecting intracellular store calcium release and calcium influx across the plasma membrane. Overall, the data indicate that CD36 predominantly affects plasma membrane-mediated calcium influx. However, it is worth noting that in primary macrophages from WT or CD36 null mice, CD36 deficiency also blunted the effect of thapsigargin on calcium release from the ER in addition to reducing PM calcium entry. This suggests that genetic ablation of CD36 may result in chronic reduction of ER calcium stores.The role of CD36 in calcium dynamics remains at the earliest stages of understanding. In isolated hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus neurons, the addition of oleic acid resulted in alterations of intracellular calcium oscillations, and these effects were reduced by the CD36 inhibitor SSO (67Le Foll C. Irani B.G. Magnan C. Dunn-Meynell A.A. Levin B.E. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2009; 297: R655-R664Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). More evidence for a link between CD36 and cellular calcium was obtained using taste bud cells sorted based on CD36 expression (68El-Yassimi A. Hichami A. Besnard P. Khan N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12949-12959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It was shown that exposure of CD36-positive cells to extracellular linoleate increased intracellular calcium through 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated release of ER calcium. In the presence of extracellular calcium, the increase in intracellular calcium was more significant, reflecting the contribution of membrane calcium channels and resulting in the release of monoamine neurotransmitters. Our studies employed ectopic expression of WT CD36 and an inactive ubiquitination mutant of CD36 in CHO cells to link the protein to calcium dynamics. In addition, regardless of whether ER calcium depletion was initiated at the ER by thapsigargin or at the plasma membrane by UTP, CD36 was found to modulate the activation of PM calcium channels, supporting its involvement in the maintenance of intracellular calcium stores. Intracellular calcium signaling regulates a wide range of cellular functions, including contraction, secretion, and metabolism. Whether the activation of calcium influx channels is important for CD36 function in phagocytosis, apoptosis (2Tabas I. Circ.

Platelets. 2010; 21: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) is unknown and requires further study.CD36 Enhances AA ReleaseAmong the consequences of the rise in intracellular calcium in cells expressing cytosolic PLA2α is the stimulation of AA release from the sn-2 position of phospholipids and its use for synthesis of eicosanoids (70Chang W.C. Parekh A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29994-29999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which are potent mediators of a wide range of proinflammatory effects (19Brash A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1339-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 20Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (2997) Google Scholar, 21Furuyashiki T. Narumiya S. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2009; 9: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cellular arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) derived from dietary sources or synthesized from linoleic acid can constitute up to 25% of the fatty acyl moieties present in phospholipids. Arachidonic acid release is tightly regulated by PLA2 enzymes, which are activated through a variety of surface receptors for hormones and cytokines (71Newcomer M.E. Gilbert N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 25109-25114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cytosolic PLA2α plays a major role in AA release through its calcium-dependent translocation to cellular membranes to hydrolyze AA esterified to membrane phospholipids. The activity of cPLA2α is also enhanced by MAPK-dependent phosphorylation (18Murakami M. Kudo I. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 3-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Our results show that the CD36-dependent AA release was decreased by 80% by the cPLA2α inhibitor PYR. In addition, chelation of extracellular calcium by EGTA completely abolished AA release, indicating that it was calcium-dependent and thereby consistent with cPLA2α activation. Furthermore, cPLA2α translocation and phosphorylation were blunted in cells expressing mutated K/A CD36, which were deficient in their ability to release AA.The trafficking of CD36 between the plasma membrane and multiple intracellular compartments is regulated by a number of factors (3Su X. Abumrad N.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20: 72-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 4Glatz J.F. Luiken J.J. Bonen A. Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 367-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that signals that induce release of ER calcium promote CD36 membrane localization. The ubiquitination mutant of CD36 (K/A) used in the current study, which is resistant to thapsigargin-induced membrane recruitment, was inefficient in enhancing calcium influx, cPLA2α phosphorylation, or AA release. Plasma membrane localization of CD36 is probably important for the CD36-associated Fyn kinase to access and regulate the opening of PM calcium channels (30Hisatsune C. Kuroda Y. Nakamura K. Inoue T. Nakamura T. Michikawa T. Mizutani A. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18887-18894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although we could not detect differences in Fyn phosphorylation in cells expressing WT versus mutated CD36, the altered localization of CD36-Fyn in CD36 K/A-expressing cells provides a potential mechanism for the inability of this mutant to induce calcium entry and AA release.The findings in this study suggest that the role of CD36 in inflammation may in some cases be related to its regulation of AA release. In agreement with the results utilizing CHO cells, we found that thapsigargin- or UTP-triggered calcium signaling, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and cPLA2α, and subsequent AA release were impaired in mouse intraperitoneal macrophages isolated from CD36−/− as compared with WT mice. In addition, siRNA knockdown of CD36 in mouse RAW 246.7 macrophages led to a decrease of cPLA2α phosphorylation. The liberation of AA from arachidonate-containing phospholipids in monocytes and macrophages is physiologically important during inflammation and determines the rate of synthesis of eicosanoids, which have potent proinflammatory actions and are implicated in multiple aspects of cell physiology (19Brash A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1339-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 20Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (2997) Google Scholar, 21Furuyashiki T. Narumiya S.

The data in Fig. 7 showing enhanced PGE2 production by CD36−/− macrophages despite reduced AA release suggest that cyclooxygenase expression and resultant PGE2 production may be regulated by the availability of free AA. Despite the decrease in thapsigargin-induced AA release from CD36−/− macrophages, production of PGE2 was enhanced, apparently as a result of significantly increased expression of Cox-2 and, to a lesser extent, Cox-1. Thus, chronic CD36 ablation resulted in a compensatory response to the defect in the AA liberation through the increased production of Cox-2. Consistent with these findings, it was recently shown in vascular cells that although acute down-regulation of ACSL4 (acyl-CoA synthetase 4), which selectively acylates AA to AA-CoA for esterification, resulted in increased PGE2 release, the opposite response occurred (i.e. a reduction in PGE2 release) with stable, long term reduction of ACSL4 (26Golej D.L.

Lipid Res. 2011; 52: 782-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).In summary (Fig. 8), CD36 modulates the pathways that maintain calcium homeostasis in response to depletion of ER calcium. One aspect of this role involves cPLA2α activation and liberation of arachidonic acid for eicosanoid formation. Eicosanoids are mediators of pleiotropic inflammatory effects and have been linked to multiple pathologies (19Brash A.R. J. Clin.

A key feature during this process is the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and cleavage of collagen. Hyaluronic acid (HA), a major component of the dermal matrix, decreases after chronic UVB exposure. However, the factors that govern the decline of HA synthesis during the course of actinic aging are largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore whether collagen degradation causes inhibition of HA synthesis in human skin fibroblasts. After treatment of fibroblasts with collagen fragments (CF) in vitro, resolution of the actin cytoskeleton and inhibition of HA secretion occurred because of specific down-regulation of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) expression. The αvβ3-agonist, RGDS, latrunculin A, and an inhibitor of Rho-activated kinase inhibited HAS2 expression. Conversely, blocking antibodies to αvβ3 abolished the down-regulation of HAS2 and the cytoskeletal effects. Furthermore, inhibition of cofilin phosphorylation in response to CF was prevented by αvβ3-blocking antibodies. The key role of ERK signaling was shown by reduced nuclear accumulation of phosphoERK and of ELK-1 phosphorylation in response to CF. In addition, the ERK inhibitor PD98059 reduced HAS2 expression. Also, UVB irradiation of fibroblasts caused down-regulation of HAS2, which was sensitive to matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and to αvβ3-blocking antibodies. In conclusion, these data suggest that CF activate αvβ3-integrins and in turn inhibit Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling and nuclear translocation of phosphoERK, resulting in reduced HAS2 expression.

Datta S.C. Varani J. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1419-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). However, photoaging of the skin also affects the phenotype of embedded cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and dendritic cells, either by direct effects of irradiation on the cells or indirectly by the remodeled and aged ECM. In contrast to collagen, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control the remodeling of other ECM molecules within the dermal matrix in response to UVB irradiation. The present study focuses on hyaluronan (HA), which is a major component of the dermal ECM (4Manuskiatti W. Maibach H.I. Int. J. Dermatol. 1996; 35: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). HA is an unbranched polymeric carbohydrate consisting of alternating disaccharide units (d-glucuronic acid β(1–3)-d-N-acetyl-glucosamine β(1–4)). HA is synthesized at the plasma membrane by HA synthases 1–3 (HAS1–3) that assemble activated UDP-glucosamine and glucuronic acid and extrude the growing HA polymer into the extracellular compartment (5Itano N. Kimata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). HA serves as a scaffold for the ECM because it allows multiple interactions with HA-binding proteins such as versican, tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6, or serum proteins such as inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (6Day A.J. Prestwich G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4585-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Thereby HA is thought to critically determine the extracellular micromilieu and cellular phenotypes. Cellular signaling of HA is mediated by CD44 and RHAMM (receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility), which are thought to mediate pro-migratory and pro-proliferative effects in fibroblasts (7Toole B.P. Wight T.N. Tammi M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 8Yoneda M. Yamagata M. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 265-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the organ level, HA is a major contributor to the water content of the skin, the turgidity, and the diffusion gradients (4Manuskiatti W. Maibach H.I. Int. J. Dermatol. 1996; 35: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Loss of HA has been associated with skin aging (9Margelin D. Medaisko C. Lombard D. Picard J. Fourtanier A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 505-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Takahashi Y. Ishikawa O. Okada K. Kojima Y. Igarashi Y. Miyachi Y. J. Dermatol.

Sci. 1995; 10: 139-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the loss of HA during actinic aging. It has been described before that transforming growth factor β receptor II is down-regulated in the skin of chronically irradiated mice (12Dai G. Freudenberger T. Zipper P. Melchior A. Grether-Beck S. Rabausch B. de Groot J. Twarock S. Hanenberg H. Homey B. Krutmann J. Reifenberger J. Fischer J.W. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 171: 1451-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that decreased growth factor expression or growth factor signaling is an important mechanism of how the decline of HA production occurs. In line with this assumption is the fact that up to now, direct negative regulators of HA synthesis have not been identified in dermal fibroblasts. In the present study, the possibility was considered that cross-talk may exist between collagen fragmentation and loss of HA. Collagen fragments (CF) are known to be bioactive. In smooth muscle cells, CF cause cleavage of focal adhesion kinase (13Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and inhibit apoptosis by activation of αvβ3-integrins (14von Wnuck Lipinski K. Keul P. Lucke S. Heusch G. Wohlschlaeger J. Baba H.A. Levkau B. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly in skin fibroblasts, CF inhibit de novo collagen synthesis (15Varani J. Warner R.L.

Therefore, the specific aim was to investigate whether CF regulate HA synthesis in human dermal fibroblasts and thereby identify a possible link between UVB-induced collagen cleavage and loss of HA during actinic aging. matrix metalloproteinases collagen fragments extracellular matrix hyaluronic acid hyaluronan synthase HA-binding protein cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein Rho kinase phospho. Reagents were obtained from the indicated sources: latrunculin A, Y27632, and lysophosphatidic acid from Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany); Streptomyces hyaluronidase from MP Biomedicals Germany (Eschwege, Germany); αvβ3-blocking antibody LM609 and the respective isotype control from Millipore (Schwalbach, Germany); MMP inhibitor I (300 nm/liter), anisomycin (10 μm), and SP600125 (10 μm) from Sigma-Aldrich; and PD98059 and SB203580 (1 μm) from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Collagen neoepitopes were detected by immunostaining using collagen 2 3/4Cshort polyclonal rabbit antibody (IBEX; Mont Royal, Canada). Human dermal fibroblasts derived from male and female donors were purchased from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany) and maintained in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin-G). The cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidified air. Type I collagen gels (3.0 mg/ml collagen type I derived from bovine skin) were prepared as described previously (14von Wnuck Lipinski K. Keul P. Lucke S. Heusch G. Wohlschlaeger J. Baba H.A. Levkau B. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) by neutralizing the collagen solution (PureCol® Advanced BioMatrix, Tucson, AZ) with DMEM and incubation at 37 °C for 24 h until complete polymerization. CF were prepared by digestion of the collagen gels with 2 mg/ml collagenase type 3 (Worthington Biochemical Corp.) at 37 °C for 30 min. Afterward, collagenase activity was inhibited by the addition of an equal volume of DMEM containing 10% FBS. The solution was diluted with DMEM to a final concentration of 125 μg/ml CF. Three-dimensional fibroblast cultures were prepared by seeding 100,000 cells into 500 μl of the above described neutralized collagen solution. To prevent attachment to the dish, the cell suspension was incubated in mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h and transferred to DMEM containing 10% FCS after polymerization. UVB irradiation of the cells was performed with a Bio-Sun irradiation system (Vilbert Lourmat; Munich, Germany) containing two 30-watt UVB sources (312 nm). Dermal equivalents were prepared as described previously (16Majora M. Wittkampf T. Schuermann B. Schneider M. Franke S. Grether-Beck S. Wilichowski E. Bernerd F. Schroeder P. Krutmann J. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 175: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) was performed using annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA) as described previously (17Weber A.A. Przytulski B. Schumacher M. Zimmermann N. Gams E. Hohlfeld T. Schrör K. Br. J. Haematol. 2002; 117: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were gated according to their scatter properties, and the mean fluorescence of Alexa Fluor 488 was determined. As positive control, staurosporine (Sigma-Aldrich) was used. Cells were fixed in acid-formalin/ethanol (3.7% formaldehyde/PBS, 70% ethanol, and 5% glacial acetic acid, all v/v). After rinsing with PBS, cells were stained for HA using a biotinylated HA-binding protein (bHABP, Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) followed by streptavidin-FITC (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin as described previously (18Evanko S.P. Angello J.C. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). As negative control, cells were digested with Streptomyces hyaluronidase prior to staining, which abolished HA staining (data not shown). Imaging of the cells was performed using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope and a 63× objective. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formalin and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). After rinsing with PBS, actin stress fibers were stained by FITC-phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:1000). pERK was detected using pERK primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000) followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclei were counterstained by Hoechst 33342 solution (Invitrogen; Darmstadt, Germany; 1:10000). Nuclear translocation of pERK was detected using a Zeiss LSM 700 microscope and a 63× objective (see Fig. 5C) or Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 ApoTome microscope and a 63× objective (supplemental Fig. S3). HA released into the culture medium was measured with an HABP-based commercial kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Corgenix, Broomfield, CO) 24 h after stimulation (19Twarock S. Tammi M.I. Savani R.C. Fischer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23276-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The quantity of HA was calculated as the ratio of HA and total cellular protein. Dermal fibroblasts were incubated with 20 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine for 24 h in the presence and absence of collagen fragments. The conditioned, [3H]glucosamine-labeled medium was divided equally. One-half was digested with hyaluronidase (Streptomyces hyaluronidase, 0.5 units of enzyme/200 μl). Subsequently, both samples were prepurified on a column of Sephadex G50 (Sigma-Aldrich) to separate non-incorporated [3H]glucosamine from the tritiated macromolecular fraction. Comparison of the relative molecular size of secreted HA was performed as described previously (20Wilkinson T.S. Potter-Perigo S. Tsoi C. Altman L.C. Wight T.N. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using Sephacryl S-1000 (GE Healthcare; Munich, Germany).Only the hyaluronidase-sensitive counts that represent the [3H]glucosamine-labeled HA were plotted. Total RNA from fibroblasts was isolated using RNeasy total RNA kits (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). The RNA concentration was determined via photometric measurement at 260/280. Total RNA (aliquots of 1000 ng) was transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript III first strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). To analyze the mRNA expression in human fibroblasts, primers were designed employing Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) based on published cDNA sequences.

PCR was carried out using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) as described (12Dai G. Freudenberger T. Zipper P. Melchior A. Grether-Beck S. Rabausch B. de Groot J. Twarock S. Hanenberg H. Homey B. Krutmann J. Reifenberger J. Fischer J.W. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 171: 1451-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The 2(−ΔΔC(T)) method was used for comparison of the relative expression in RT-PCR between control and treated cells. For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the following primary antibodies were used: pERK1/2, ERK1/2, pELK-1, Cofilin, pCofilin, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, p38, and pp38 (Cell Signaling Technology) and β-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich). They were detected by infrared fluorescent-coupled secondary antibodies allowing fluorescent detection on a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system. All data sets were analyzed either by analysis of variance and the Bonferroni post hoc test or by Student's t test as appropriate. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was assigned at the level of p < 0.05. CF were generated by collagenase type 3 digestion of purified bovine collagen type 1. Skin fibroblasts were incubated with these CF for 24 h. In preliminary experiments (supplemental Fig. S1, A–D), a dose-response experiment using CF at 50–250 μg/ml was performed, revealing slightly increased apoptosis starting at 250 μg/ml as evidenced by annexin V FACS analysis. Classical poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage was not detected up to 250 μg/ml. Fibroblast proliferation measured as [3H]thymidine incorporation was suppressed starting at 150 μg/ml. Therefore, CF were used in all subsequent experiments at 125 μg/ml to avoid anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic effects. The morphology of fibroblast-treated CF (125 μg/ml) was dramatically changed, characterized by reduced spreading (Fig. 1A) and retraction. However, microscopic surveillance indicated recovery up to 96 h in cells after the addition of CF (supplemental Fig. S1D). Furthermore, pericellular HA strands were markedly reduced (Fig. 1B), and the amount of HA secreted into the conditioned medium was decreased. In addition, the size distribution of secreted HA was shifted to lower molecular mass as evidenced by Sephacryl S-1000 chromatography of [3H]glucosamine-labeled HA. Analysis of the relative amount of HAS mRNA transcripts revealed that HAS2 was the prominent isoform, accounting for more than 95% of HAS transcripts (Fig. 1E). CF caused differential regulation of HAS isoenzymes, as indicated by increased HAS1 mRNA, decreased HAS2 mRNA, and unchanged HAS3 mRNA levels (Fig. 1F). Based on quantitative real time RT-PCR, HAS2 is the most abundant HAS isoform. Therefore, the data suggest that inhibition of HAS2 mRNA is responsible for decreased HA secretion in response to CF. HAS isoforms are thought to generate HA of different chain length. HAS2 and HAS1 synthesize higher molecular weight HA as compared with HAS3 (21Itano N. Sawai T. Yoshida M. Lenas P. Yamada Y. Imagawa M. Shinomura T. Hamaguchi M. Yoshida Y. Ohnuki Y. Miyauchi S. Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Therefore, the decrease of HAS2 expression likely also explains the loss of the high molecular weight fractions in the supernatants of CF-treated fibroblasts. However, in addition, the mRNA expression of hyaluronidases 1 and -2 was analyzed and revealed 2-fold increased hyaluronidase 2 mRNA (data not shown), hinting toward involvement of HA degradation in the molecular weight shift. Collagen fragments have been shown to activate αvβ3-integrin signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (22von Wnuck Lipinski K. Keul P. Ferri N. Lucke S. Heusch G. Fischer J.W. Levkau B. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1490-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, CF were used in the presence and absence of blocking antibodies to αvβ3. As shown in Fig. 2A, these blocking antibodies abolished both the CF-induced up-regulation of HAS1 and down-regulation of HAS2. Furthermore, the αvβ3-agonist RGDS (23Ortega-Velázquez R. Díez-Marqués M.L. Ruiz-Torres M.P. González-Rubio M. Rodríguez-Puyol M. Rodríguez Puyol D. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Marchand-Brynaert J. Detrait E. Noiset O. Boxus T. Schneider Y.J. Remacle C. Biomaterials. 1999; 20: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) induced HAS1 and reduced HAS2 expression (Fig. 2B). Immunocytochemistry revealed expression of αvβ3-integrin in a pattern resembling focal adhesions and was not changed by CF (Fig. 2C). CF also caused partial disruption of actin stress fibers, which underlies the morphological change presented in Fig. 1. Interestingly the changes of morphology and actin stress fibers were also prevented by preincubation with blocking αvβ3-antibodies (Fig. 2D). Therefore, the data strongly suggested that αvβ3-integrin signaling mediated the effects of CF on HAS expression, HA synthesis, and the actin cytoskeleton. Next the downstream effectors of αvβ3-integrin signaling that might cause down-regulation of HAS2 were investigated. αvβ3 is known to signal through various pathways depending on the cell type and the experimental conditions (25Putnam A.J. Schulz V.V. Freiter E.M. Bill H.M. Miranti C.K. Cell Commun. Signal. 2009; 7: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Lee D.Y. Yeh C.R. Chang S.F. Lee P.L. Chien S. Cheng C.K. Chiu J.J. J. Bone Miner Res. 2008; 23: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27Ahmed M. Kundu G.C. Mol. Cancer. 2010; 9: 101Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because CF and αvβ3 had a pronounced effect on the cytoskeleton and HAS2, it was addressed whether these two effects were interrelated. Interestingly, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin A (28de Oliveira C.A. Mantovani B. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 1825-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) resulted in the same pattern of HAS isoform expression as compared with CF (Fig. 3A). HAS1 was induced, HAS2 was inhibited, and HAS3 was unchanged by latrunculin A. Furthermore, the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y27632 increased HAS1, decreased HAS2, and had no effect on HAS3 expression. A role of ROCK was further supported by the use of the ROCK activator lysophosphatidic acid (29van Leeuwen F.N. Giepmans B.N. van Meeteren L.A. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1209-1212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Masiero L. Lapidos K.A. Ambudkar I. Kohn E.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3205-3213PubMed Google Scholar), which blocked the effect of CF on HAS expression (Fig. 3B). ROCK is known to cause via LIM-kinase the phosphorylation of cofilin (31Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), which in the phosphorylated state loses its actin-depolymerizing activity. Actin cytoskeleton in turn is essential for the translocation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 into the nucleus (32Pouysségur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was tested whether cofilin phosphorylation was specifically affected by CF and αvβ3-integrin signaling. Indeed Cofilin phosphorylation was significantly reduced by CF, and this response was abrogated by blocking αvβ3-antibodies (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the time course of HAS2 down-regulation and inhibition of cofilin phosphorylation were similar (Fig. 4, B and C). Actin filaments contribute to the formation of compartments and translocation pathways to facilitate signaling. In this context, it has been shown that pERK translocation into the nucleus is in part dependent on the cytoplasmic actin network (33Aplin A.E. Stewart S.A. Assoian R.K. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was considered that CF-mediated activation of αvβ3 may inhibit HAS2 expression via the effects on the cytoskeleton and in turn interference with ERK1/2 translocation in the nucleus. In line with this hypothesis, the ERK inhibitor PD98059 specifically inhibited HAS2 expression (Fig. 5A). However, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 as measured by immunoblotting in total cell lysates was increased in response to CF (Fig. 5B). Therefore, immunocytochemistry and confocal imaging were used to investigate whether translocation of ERK1/2 into the nucleus was affected by CF. As shown in Fig. 5C, nuclear pERK1/2 was significantly reduced in response to CF in human skin fibroblasts. After UVB irradiation of skin fibroblasts, decreased nuclear pERK1/2 was detected by confocal microscopy and the MMP inhibitor restored the nuclear ERK1/2 content (supplemental Fig. S3). In addition to nuclear targeting of pERK1/2, the transcription activator ELK-1 was less phosphorylated in response to CF, supporting the hypothesis that nuclear ERK1/2 activity was in fact reduced in response to CF. In conclusion, these results are consistent with a role of αvβ3-mediated signaling of CF that causes inhibition of ROCK and actin-dependent translocation of ERK1/2 into the nucleus and thus inhibits HAS2 transcription.FIGURE 4CF inhibit cofilin phosphorylation.

To identify the responsible downstream signaling, three different MAPK inhibitors were used. Although inhibition of ERK1/2 and Jun N-terminal kinase had no effect (data not shown), the p38 inhibitor SB203580 inhibited HAS1 mRNA induction by CF (supplemental Fig. S2), and anisomycin, an p38 activator (not shown), increased HAS1 mRNA. Increased p38 phosphorylation in response to CF was detected and occurred at the same time (24 h) as the induction of HAS1 mRNA. Furthermore, blocking antibodies to αvβ3-integrins inhibited CF-induced p38 phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 2). Collectively these data strongly suggest that HAS1 is induced by αvβ3-integrins via p38 at the same time at which HAS2 is suppressed via inhibition of ROCK. Next it was tested whether exposure of fibroblast cultures and dermal equivalents to UVB irradiation affects HAS2 expression. First collagen fragmentation in response to UVB irradiation was visualized by collagen neoepitope staining in dermal equivalents. After a single dose of UVB, the appearance of collagen neoepitopes (34Billinghurst R.C. Dahlberg L. Ionescu M. Reiner A. Bourne R. Rorabeck C. Mitchell P. Hambor J. Diekmann O. Tschesche H. Chen J. Van Wart H. Poole A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1534-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) was monitored during the course of 96 h (Fig. 6, A and B). In addition, mRNA was isolated from the dermal equivalents during the indicated times after UVB irradiation. Induction of MMP1 mRNA expression was detected 48 h after UVB exposure (Fig. 6C). Notably the decline of HAS2 mRNA expression in response to UVB occurred at 96 h, which was after the peak of MMP1 expression and at the same time when the highest accumulation of collagen neoepitopes was detected (Fig. 6D). In three-dimensional cultures of human fibroblasts in collagen gels, the MMP1 inhibitor abolished UVB-mediated decrease of HAS2 expression (Fig. 6E). To prove that the endogenously generated collagen fragments signal through αvβ3-integrins, the blocking antibody LM609 was applied to the three-dimensional cultures prior to UVB irradiation. As shown in Fig. 6F, the blocking αvβ3-antibody indeed inhibited HAS2 down-regulation. To further prove that endogenous CF generated in response to UVB down-regulate HAS2, fibroblasts were incubated with collagen and were irradiated to allow cleavage of collagen in response to UVB-induced MMP activity. After 3 days, these supernatants were removed and added without further treatment to fibroblasts to investigate the effect of the endogenous CF in the supernatants. The glucose concentration of this high glucose medium was not reduced significantly by the 3 days of conditioning (data not shown). After 24 h, a significant down-regulation of HAS2 expression was detected. In line with the previous experiments, this down-regulation was sensitive to bot"

The characteristic clinical presentation of GA1 is a sudden onset of dystonia during catabolic situations, resulting from acute striatal injury. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, but the high levels of GA and 3OHGA that accumulate during catabolic illnesses are believed to play a primary role. Both GA and 3OHGA are known to be substrates for Na+-coupled dicarboxylate transporters, which are required for the anaplerotic transfer of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediate succinate between astrocytes and neurons. We hypothesized that GA and 3OHGA inhibit the transfer of succinate from astrocytes to neurons, leading to reduced TCA cycle activity and cellular injury. Here, we show that both GA and 3OHGA inhibit the uptake of [14C]succinate by Na+-coupled dicarboxylate transporters in cultured astrocytic and neuronal cells of wild-type and Gcdh−/− mice. In addition, we demonstrate that the efflux of [14C]succinate from Gcdh−/− astrocytic cells mediated by a not yet identified transporter is strongly reduced. This is the first experimental evidence that GA and 3OHGA interfere with two essential anaplerotic transport processes: astrocytic efflux and neuronal uptake of TCA cycle intermediates, which occur between neurons and astrocytes. These results suggest that elevated levels of GA and 3OHGA may lead to neuronal injury and cell death via disruption of TCA cycle activity.

This enzyme catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of glutaryl-CoA in the degradative pathway of the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan. GCDH deficiency leads to the accumulation of the dicarboxylic acids (DC) glutaric acid (GA) and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid (3OHGA) in tissues and body fluids. Affected patients during a time window from birth to 36 months of age are at risk for the development of encephalopathic crises triggered by catabolic situations such as infectious diseases, fever, vomiting or diarrhea, accompanied with a further increase of GA and 3OHGA concentrations (1Goodman S.I.

The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of GA and 3OHGA are not fully understood. In cultured primary neuronal cells prepared from rat and chicken brains the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has been reported upon incubation with GA and 3OHGA in vitro (3Ullrich K.

Furthermore, inhibition of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis and the impairment of mitochondrial energy production due to inhibition of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and depletion of creatine phosphate are suggested to be relevant for neuronal death (3Ullrich K.

In addition, it has been shown that GA and 3OHGA impair the integrity of endothelial barriers in vitro and in vivo (10Mühlhausen C. Ott N. Chalajour F. Tilki D. Freudenberg F. Shahhossini M. Thiem J. Ullrich K. Braulke T. Ergün S. Pediatr. Res. 2006; 59: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The physiologic significance of these studies, however, is unclear, because they have been performed with cells exhibiting enzymatically active endogenous GCDH. Gcdh−/− mice display a biochemical phenotype similar to human GA1 patients with an accumulation of GA and 3OHGA in tissues and body fluids (11Koeller D.M. Woontner M. Crnic L.S. Kleinschmidt-DeMasters B. Stephens J. Hunt E.L. Goodman S.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 347-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The administration of a high protein diet to young Gcdh−/− mice leads to the induction of an encephalopathic crisis accompanied by vacuolation in the brain and death within 3–5 days. Under these conditions, a further increase of GA and 3OHGA concentrations in urine, serum, and tissues is observed (12Zinnanti W.J. Lazovic J. Wolpert E.B. Antonetti D.A. Smith M.B. Connor J.R.

Recently, we identified the sodium-dependent dicarboxylate co-transporter 3 (NaC3) and organic anion transporters (OAT) 1 and 4 as low and high affinity transporters, respectively, for the translocation of GA and 3OHGA through membranes (14Stellmer F. Keyser B. Burckhardt B.C. Koepsell H. Streichert T. Glatzel M. Jabs S. Thiem J. Herdering W. Koeller D.M. Goodman S.I. Lukacs Z. Ullrich K. Burckhardt G. Braulke T. Mühlhausen C. J. Mol.

Pflugers Arch. 2008; 457: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The concerted action of NaC3, OAT1, and OAT4 in renal proximal tubule cells may be important for the urinary excretion of GA and 3OHGA (16Mühlhausen C. Burckhardt B.C. Hagos Y. Burckhardt G. Keyser B. Lukacs Z. Ullrich K. Braulke T. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2008; 31: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). How these metabolites are transported in the brain, however, and which transporters are involved are still unclear. In addition to renal proximal tubule cells, NaC3 and OAT1 have been reported to be expressed in murine and human choroid plexus, respectively (17Pajor A.M. Gangula R. Yao X. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1215-C1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Alebouyeh M. Takeda M. Onozato M.L. Tojo A. Noshiro R. Hasannejad H. Inatomi J. Narikawa S. Huang X.L. Khamdang S. Anzai N. Endou H. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 93: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been concluded from mRNA and immunocytochemical expression studies in cultured primary cells from rat brain that NaC3 is expressed in astrocytes, whereas in neurons NaC2 is present (19Yodoya E. Wada M. Shimada A. Katsukawa H. Okada N. Yamamoto A. Ganapathy V. Fujita T. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both transporters have a broad substrate specificity and translocate dicarboxylates such as succinate, α-ketoglutarate, malate, and fumarate with high affinity (17Pajor A.M. Gangula R. Yao X. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1215-C1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Inoue K. Fei Y.J. Zhuang L. Gopal E. Miyauchi S. Ganapathy V. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Neurons depend on the anaplerotic supply of these dicarboxylates from astrocytes required as substrates for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to maintain energy metabolism and the synthesis of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA (21Hertz L.

Glia. 1997; 21: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Based on the ability of NaC3 to transport GA and 3OHGA (14Stellmer F. Keyser B. Burckhardt B.C. Koepsell H. Streichert T. Glatzel M. Jabs S. Thiem J. Herdering W. Koeller D.M. Goodman S.I. Lukacs Z. Ullrich K. Burckhardt G. Braulke T. Mühlhausen C. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the increased concentrations of GA and 3OHGA in the brain of GA1 patients during an encephalopathic crisis, and induced in Gcdh−/− mice, impair the anaplerotic supply of TCA cycle intermediates from astrocytes to neurons in a competitive manner. In the present study, we have demonstrated for the first time that GA and 3OHGA inhibit the uptake of [14C]succinate into primary neuronal cells of wild-type and Gcdh−/− mice. Most important, the efflux of [14C]succinate from Gcdh-deficient astrocytic cells has been found to be strongly retarded compared with wild-type cells. GA and succinate were purchased from Fluka (Taufkirchen, Germany). 3OHGA was synthesized as described previously (14Stellmer F. Keyser B. Burckhardt B.C. Koepsell H. Streichert T. Glatzel M. Jabs S. Thiem J. Herdering W. Koeller D.M. Goodman S.I. Lukacs Z. Ullrich K. Burckhardt G. Braulke T. Mühlhausen C. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 1,4-[14C]-Labeled succinate was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). DNase I, papain, and AraC were purchased from Sigma. Minimal essential medium (MEM), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), neurobasal A medium, and horse serum were from Invitrogen. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was from PAA Laboratories (Pasching, Austria), and B27 supplement was obtained from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or higher. Rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody was purchased from DAKO Cytomation (Glostrup, Denmark), and mouse anti-neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) antibody was from Millipore. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Sheep anti-mouse IgG coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3 were from Sigma. Gcdh−/− or wild-type mice were bred from homozygous (Gcdh−/− or Gcdh+/+, respectively) parents and sacrificed at P0–P2. The genetic background in all mice groups used in this study was C57BL6/SJ129 hybrid. Genotypes were confirmed by PCR and measurement of glutarylcarnitine concentration in dried blood spots as described previously (13Keyser B. Glatzel M. Stellmer F. Kortmann B. Lukacs Z. Kölker S. Sauer S.W. Muschol N. Herdering W. Thiem J. Goodman S.I. Koeller D.M. Ullrich K. Braulke T. Mühlhausen C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1782: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mice were housed in the animal facility of the University Medical Center with a 12-h light-dark cycle and allowed water and food ad libitum. Animal care and experiments were carried out in accordance with institutional guidelines as approved by local authorities. The immortalized murine astrocytoma cell line 11+/+ was cultured as described previously (24Matzner U. Habetha M. Gieselmann V. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For the preparation of primary neuronal cells from mouse cortex, Gcdh−/− or wild-type pups were sacrificed at P0–P1. Preparation and maintenance of cells were performed according to Ref. 25Quitsch A. Berhörster K. Liew C.W. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. After decapitation and removal of vessels and meninges, cortices were removed and washed in Hanks' buffered salt solution (1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm Na2HPO4·2H2O, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.7 mm CaCl) and subsequently incubated in papain solution (10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 10 mm glucose, 50 μl of DNase I, 2.5 mg of papain) for 30 min at 37 °C on a shaker. Afterward, cortices were washed three times in plating medium (0.6% glucose, 10% horse serum in MEM) followed by homogenization of tissue by repeated resuspension through yellow pipette tips. Subsequently, cells were counted and plated at a density of ∼500 cells/mm2 on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine, 12-well plates, or 35-mm dishes. After 4 h, medium was changed to medium 1 (neurobasal A medium supplemented with 2% B27, 0.5 mm glutamine, 25 μm glutamate, 20 units/ml penicillin, and 20 μg/ml streptomycin). Cells were grown in medium 1 for 3 days, maintained another 4 days in medium 2 (medium 1 without glutamate) supplemented with 10 μm AraC, and another 3 days in medium 2 without AraC. Primary neuronal cells were used for experiments after a total of 10 days in culture. For preparation of astrocytic cells, whole brains of Gcdh−/− or wild-type mice at P0–P2 were excised, vessels and meninges removed, and brains washed three times in Hanks' buffered salt solution. Subsequently, brains were dissected in small pieces and homogenized in 5 ml of medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 0.6% glucose, 25 mm NaHCO3, 200 nm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C by passing the tissue repeatedly through a Pasteur pipette. Cells were separated by sequentially passing the cell suspension through 180-, 140-, and 30-μm nylon net filters (Millipore) with a 10-ml syringe. Finally, cells were plated at a density of ∼1,000 cells/mm2. Medium was changed every 2–3 days, and cells were used for experiments 7 days after preparation. For uptake experiments, either primary neuronal cells cultured for 10 days or astrocytic cells cultured for 7 days on 12-well plates were used. After washing with prewarmed (37 °C) transport buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5 mm glucose), cells were incubated for 10 or 20 min at 37 °C/5% CO2 with 0.3 ml of uptake buffer (transport buffer supplemented with 0.1 μCi of [14C]-labeled succinate in the absence or presence of 2 mm effectors GA, 3OHGA, or nonlabeled succinate). After removal of uptake buffer, cells were immediately washed three times with ice-cold transport buffer and lysed in 0.2 m NaOH. The amount of cell-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Tri-Carb 2900TR liquid scintillation analyzer; Packard, Groningen, The Netherlands or Rotiszint eco plus liquid scintillation mixture; Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and related to the protein content (Roti-Quant protein assay; Roth). Cells were incubated with [14C]succinate for 20 min as described above. After removal of the radioactive buffer, cells were further incubated in transport buffer for the indicated times. The supernatant was collected, and cells were lysed in 0.2 m NaOH. Radioactivity was determined in supernatant and cell lysates and related to cellular protein content. The content of cell pellets and supernatants of [14C]succinate efflux assays was determined by anion exchange HPLC analyses using a Mono Q PC 1.6/5 column connected to a SMART system (GE Healthcare). A mobile phase consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, operated at a flow rate of 100 μl/min at ambient temperature was utilized with a gradient of 0–0.25 m NaCl within 20 min. Supernatants from efflux experiments were centrifuged at 20,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris and divided into four aliquots of 50 μl. Cell pellets from efflux experiments were sonicated for 3 × 20 s, and proteins were denatured by incubation of samples for 5 min at 95 °C. Cell debris and denatured proteins were sedimented by centrifugation at 20,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting cell extract was divided into four aliquots of 50 μl each. Aliquots of efflux supernatants and cell extracts were diluted 1:20 in mobile phase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.5) and loaded onto the HPLC column. Bound anions were eluted by an NaCl gradient, and fractions of 100 μl were collected. Radioactivity in pooled HPLC fractions of four sequential HPLC runs was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Elution profiles of unlabeled standard anions (1–100 nmol; aspartic acid, fumaric acid, glutamic acid, α-ketoglutaric acid, oxaloacetic acid, sodium citrate, sodium succinate; Sigma) were recorded at 210 nm. Total RNA was prepared from cell pellets with a TRI®-Reagent RNA preparation kit (Sigma). RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). For qRT-PCR, 6-carboxy-fluorescein dye-labeled murine TaqMan MGB probes (Applied Biosystems) were used in 96-well optical reaction plates, and triplicates were quantified in an Mx3000P® qRT-PCR system (Stratagene). TaqMan assay ID numbers are as follows: NaC2, Mm01334459_m1; NaC3, Mm00475280_m1; Oat1, Mm00456258_m1; β-actin, Mm00607939_s1; GAPDH, Mm99999914_g1. The relative level of each mRNA was determined using the DART-PCR method and software (26Peirson S.N. Butler J.N. Foster R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e73Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the Roti-Quant protein assay (Roth). For double immunofluorescence microscopy, primary astrocytic or neuronal cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, fixed, permeabilized, and stained using rabbit anti-GFAP (1:250) and mouse anti-NeuN (1:50) as primary antibodies as described previously (27Keyser B. Mühlhausen C. Dickmanns A. Christensen E. Muschol N. Ullrich K. Braulke T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 3854-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For staining of nuclei with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI; Sigma), cells were washed with PBS and subsequently incubated with 200 μl of 5 μg/ml DAPI in PBS for 5 min. Data were analyzed using either one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffé's test or unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests as applicable. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Calculations were operated using SPSS® 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and Microsoft® Office Excel 2003 software. Astrocytic cells were isolated from wild-type mouse brain and cultured for 7 days. Double immunofluorescence staining of cultures with astrocyte-specific GFAP and NeuN antibodies was performed. About 80–90% of cells were GFAP-positive, and no anti-NeuN immunoreactivity was observed (supplemental Fig. S1). Staining of primary astrocytic cells from Gcdh−/− mice showed similar results (data not shown). Incubation of primary astrocytic cells prepared from wild-type mice with [14C]succinate revealed a time-dependent internalization of radioactivity (Fig. 1). Logarithmic regression analysis generated a fitted curve, where the time point of 10 min was located in the linear slope region of the curve, whereas the rate of [14C]succinate internalized after 30 min reached the saturation level. Further uptake experiments were performed by incubating cells with [14C]succinate for 10 and/or 20 min as indicated. The uptake of [14C]succinate into wild-type astrocytic cells required the presence of Na+ ions (supplemental Fig. S2A). An excess of unlabeled succinate (2 mm) inhibited the uptake of [14C]succinate both into wild-type and Gcdh−/− astrocytic cells to 8–10% of control during an incubation time of 10 min (Fig. 2A), indicating the specificity of [14C]succinate transport into these cells. In the presence of GA (40 μm), succinate (25 μm), and the GA derivative l-2-hydroxyglutaric acid (L2OHGA, 267 μm), concentrations corresponding to the Km values of NaC3 for these effectors (15Hagos Y. Krick W. Braulke T. Mühlhausen C. Burckhardt G. Burckhardt B.C. Pflugers Arch. 2008; 457: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the uptake of [14C]succinate was reduced to 55, 44, and 56%, respectively, of control as expected (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2B). In contrast, incubation of cells in the presence of 930 μm 3OHGA (corresponding to Km of 3OHGA for NaC3) showed an inhibition of [14C]succinate uptake to 77.3 ± 22.1% of control. Therefore, the concentration-dependent inhibition of [14C]succinate into primary astrocytic cells derived from wild-type mice in the presence of 3OHGA was tested. The strongest inhibition of [14C]succinate uptake (approximately 50%) was observed in the presence of 2 mm 3OHGA (supplemental Fig. S2A). In the presence of 2 mm GA, the uptake of [14C]succinate into wild-type and Gcdh−/− astrocytic cells was significantly reduced to 14–20% of controls (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that uptake of [14C]succinate into astrocytic cells is sodium-dependent and can be inhibited in a competitive manner by dicarboxylates such as succinate, GA, and 3OHGA.TABLE 1Dicarboxylate-dependent inhibition of [14C]succinate uptake into astrocytic cellsCompoundKmaAccording to Ref. 15.[14C]Succinate uptakeb[14C]succinate uptake was determined in the absence (control) or presence of dicarboxylates at concentrations corresponding to their Km values for NaC3.mm% of controlGA0.04 ± 0.0254.9 ± 12.93OHGA0.93 ± 0.2577.3 ± 22.1Succinate0.02544.1 ± 9.3L2OHGA0.267 ± 0.04855.9 ± 12.2a According to Ref. 15Hagos Y.

Open table in a new tab Next, the uptake of [14C]succinate was determined in neuronal cells. Primary neuronal cells prepared from wild-type and Gcdh−/− mice cultured for 10 days were 80–90% NeuN-positive (supplemental Fig. S1). The uptake of [14C]succinate into neuronal cells during an incubation time of 10 min was strongly inhibited by an excess of unlabeled succinate and GA to 2–6% of controls (Fig. 2B), whereas 2 mm 3OHGA reduced the uptake only to 42–44%. There were no significant differences between astrocytic or neuronal cells from wild-type and Gcdh−/− mice in the relative (percent of respective control, Fig. 2) or absolute amount of radioactivity (cpm/mg of protein, data not shown) accumulated. To investigate the efflux of [14C]succinate from the intracellular compartment, primary wild-type or Gcdh−/− astrocytic or neuronal cells were preincubated with [14C]succinate for 20 min. After washing, cells were incubated in fresh nonradioactive medium for various time periods. Subsequently, radioactivity was measured in medium and cell lysates (Fig. 3). [14C]Succinate disappeared from primary astrocytic cells of wild-type mice with a half-efflux time (t½ efflux) of 5.6 ± 2.6 min upon incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 3A). Between 20 and 25% of the initial radioactivity remained intracellular, and 75 to 80% was released into the medium. In contrast, the t½ efflux rate of [14C]succinate in astrocytic cells of Gcdh−/− mice was significantly retarded to 20.2 ± 8.6 min (p < 0.05; Fig. 3B). In addition, after 30 min of incubation, only 60% of the initial cell-associated radioactivity was released into the medium. The t½ efflux rates of [14C]succinate from neuronal cells prepared from wild-type and Gcdh−/− mice were not significantly different (13.5 ± 9 min versus 12.6 ± 2.7 min, respectively; Fig. 3, C and D). Of note, the percentage of radioactivity remaining in neuronal cells after 30 min comprised approximately 40% in both wild-type and Gcdh−/− cells, respectively. The direct comparison of t½ efflux rates of [14C]succinate from astrocytic and neuronal cells of wild-type and Gcdh−/− mice is summarized in supplemental Fig. S3. To elucidate whether the measured radioactivity effused from astrocytic and neuronal cells represents [14C]succinate or metabolized [14C]-labeled compounds, HPLC analyses of efflux media and cell extracts were performed. First, anionic exchange HPLC conditions were established allowing the separation of the TCA cycle intermediates succinate (fractions 9 and 10), α-ketoglutarate (fractions 11 and 12), fumarate (fraction 13), and citrate (fractions 15 and 16) as well as aspartate/glutamate (both co-eluting in overlapping fractions 4 and 5; supplemental Fig. S4). [14C]Succinate co-eluted with unlabeled succinate in fractions 9 and 10. HPLC analyses of cell extracts of efflux experiments from wild-type astrocytic cells revealed that after loading (efflux t = 0 min) 69% of radioactivity bound to the column represented intracellular [14C]succinate, whereas 17, 2, and 5% of total column-bound radioactivity co-eluted with aspartate/glutamate, fumarate, and citrate, respectively. These data indicate that intracellular [14C]succinate was partially metabolized to these compounds (Fig. 4A). After 10 and 20 min (data not shown) and 30 min of efflux (Fig. 4B), the amount of intracellular radioactivity co-eluting with succinate was reduced to 33–39% of total column-bound radioactivity, whereas the proportion of bound radioactivity co-eluting with aspartate/glutamate, fumarate, and citrate was 35–43, 3, and 7%, respectively. HPLC analyses of efflux media from wild-type astrocytic cells after 10- and 20-min (data not shown) and 30-min efflux (Fig. 4C) showed that the majority (86–91%) of radioactivity co-eluted with unlabeled succinate in fractions 9 and 10. These data provide evidence that virtually all of the effused radioactivity represents [14C]succinate. HPLC analyses of media and cell pellets from Gcdh−/− astrocytic cells revealed similar results (data not shown). HPLC analyses of efflux media and cell extracts from wild-type neuronal cells revealed that the majority of effused radioactivity in the media after 10 and 20 min (data not shown), and 30 min (Fig. 4F) corresponds to [14C]succinate, representing 67–82% of total column-bound radioactivity.

HS contains sulfated domains known as N-S domains and low sulfate domains known as N-Ac domains. The distribution of the domain structures is likely governed by the action of glucosaminyl N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST). Here, we sought to determine the substrate specificity of NDST using model substrates and recombinant NDST protein. We discovered that NDST-1 carries out the modification in a highly ordered fashion. The enzyme sulfates the substrate from the nonreducing end toward the reducing end consecutively, leading to the product with a cluster of N-sulfo glucosamine residues. Furthermore, a preexisting N-sulfo glucosamine residue prevents the action of NDST-1 at the residues immediately located at the nonreducing end, allowing the formation of an N-Ac domain. Our results provide the long sought evidence for understanding the formation of sulfated versus nonsulfated domains in the HS isolated from cells and tissues. The study demonstrates the regulating role of NDST-1 in mapping the sulfation patterns of HS.

In this study, we have used peptide amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe the solution structural and conformational dynamics of full-length Epac2 in the presence and absence of cAMP. The results support a mechanism in which cAMP-induced Epac2 activation is mediated by a major hinge motion centered on the C terminus of the second cAMP binding domain. This conformational change realigns the regulatory components of Epac2 away from the catalytic core, making the later available for effector binding. Furthermore, the interface between the first and second cAMP binding domains is highly dynamic, providing an explanation of how cAMP gains access to the ligand binding sites that, in the crystal structure, are seen to be mutually occluded by the other cAMP binding domain. Moreover, cAMP also induces conformational changes at the ionic latch/hairpin structure, which is directly involved in RAP1 binding. These results suggest that in addition to relieving the steric hindrance imposed upon the catalytic lobe by the regulatory lobe, cAMP may also be an allosteric modulator directly affecting the interaction between Epac2 and RAP1. Finally, cAMP binding also induces significant conformational changes in the dishevelled/Egl/pleckstrin (DEP) domain, a conserved structural motif that, although missing from the active Epac2 crystal structure, is important for Epac subcellular targeting and in vivo functions.

https://openalex.org/W2005871152,"The HECT-type ubiquitin ligase (E3) Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1) targets various substrates, including Smad1/5, RhoA, Prickle 1, MEKK2, and JunB for degradation and thereby regulates adult bone formation and embryonic development. Here, we identify the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized Wolfram syndrome protein (WFS1) as a specific degradation substrate of Smurf1. Mutations in the WFS1 gene cause Wolfram syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy. WFS1 negatively regulates the ER stress response, and WFS1 deficiency in mice increases ER stress and triggers apoptosis. We show that Smurf1 interacts with WFS1 at the ER and promotes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of WFS1. A C-terminal luminal region in WFS1, including residues 667-700, is involved in this degradation. Wild-type WFS1 as well as a subset of WFS1 mutants that include this degron region are susceptible to Smurf1-mediated degradation. By contrast, pathophysiological deletion mutants of WFS1 lacking the degron, such as W648X, Y660X, and Q667X, are resistant to degradation by Smurf1. Depletion of Smurf1 by RNA interference results in increased WFS1 and decreased ATF6α levels. Furthermore, we show that ER stress induces Smurf1 degradation and WFS1 up-regulation. These findings reveal for the first time that Smurf1 targets an ER-localized protein for degradation and that Smurf1 is regulated by ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W2087527232,"Nogo-A limits axon regeneration and functional recovery after central nervous system injury in adult mammals. Three regions of Nogo-A (Nogo-A-24, Nogo-66, and Nogo-C39) interact with the neuronal Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NgR1). Nogo-66 also interacts with a structurally unrelated cell surface receptor, paired immunoglobulin-like receptor (PirB). We show here that the other two NgR1-interacting domains, Nogo-A-24 and Nogo-C39, also bind to PirB with high affinity. A purified 22-kDa protein containing all three NgR1- and PirB-interacting domains (Nogo-22) is a substantially more potent growth cone-collapsing molecule than Nogo-66 for chick dorsal root ganglion neurons and mature cortical neurons. Moreover, Nogo-22 inhibits axon regeneration of mature cortical neurons in vitro more potently than does Nogo-66. Although all three NgR1-interacting domains of Nogo-A also interact with PirB, expression of PirB in mature cortical cultures is nearly undetectable. Consistent with a relatively minor role for PirB in mature cortical neurons, Nogo-22 inhibition of axon regeneration is abolished by genetic deletion of NgR1. Thus, NgR1 is the predominant receptor for Nogo-22 in regenerating cortical neurons."

AI-2 mediates interspecies communication and facilitates regulation of bacterial behaviors such as biofilm formation and virulence. A variety of bacterial species have the ability to sequester and process the AI-2 present in their environment, thereby interfering with the cell-cell communication of other bacteria. This process involves the AI-2-regulated lsr operon, comprised of the Lsr transport system that facilitates uptake of the signal, a kinase that phosphorylates the signal to phospho-DPD (P-DPD), and enzymes (like LsrG) that are responsible for processing the phosphorylated signal. Because P-DPD is the intracellular inducer of the lsr operon, enzymes involved in P-DPD processing impact the levels of Lsr expression. Here we show that LsrG catalyzes isomerization of P-DPD into 3,4,4-trihydroxy-2-pentanone-5-phosphate. We present the crystal structure of LsrG, identify potential catalytic residues, and determine which of these residues affects P-DPD processing in vivo and in vitro. We also show that an lsrG deletion mutant accumulates at least 10 times more P-DPD than wild type cells. Consistent with this result, we find that the lsrG mutant has increased expression of the lsr operon and an altered profile of AI-2 accumulation and removal.

Understanding of the biochemical mechanisms employed by bacteria to quench signaling of other species can be of great utility in the development of therapies to control bacterial behavior. Many bacteria regulate gene expression as a function of the density of the population. This process, called quorum sensing, enables these organisms to coordinate behaviors that are most beneficial when cells are working in unison (1Waters C.M. Bassler B.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

AI-2 is produced by the enzyme LuxS, which synthesizes (S)-4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD; Fig. 1A, 1), the linear form of a set of interconverting molecules with AI-2 activity (6Schauder S.

AI-2 (or its synthase LuxS) has been shown to regulate important bacterial behaviors such as biofilm formation and the production of virulence factors (4Xavier K.B. Bassler B.L. Curr. Opin.

Microbiol. 2008; 6: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, one strategy for controlling these behaviors is to control the concentration (or availability) of AI-2. We have previously shown that certain bacteria can employ this strategy by processing AI-2 and thus quenching interspecies signaling (11Xavier K.B. Bassler B.L. Nature. 2005; 437: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These bacteria include most members from the Enterobacteriaceae family (like the commensal Escherichia coli K12 and the pathogens E. coli O157 and Salmonella typhimurium) but also more distantly related bacteria such as the plant symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti and the pathogen Bacillus anthracis (12Pereira C.S. de Regt A.K.

In these bacteria, AI-2 controls the expression of a system (named Lsr for luxS-regulated) capable of processing both endogenous and exogenous AI-2 (13Taga M.E. Semmelhack J.L. Bassler B.L. Mol.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8350-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Using the Lsr system, these bacteria remove AI-2 from the environment and, thus, eliminate the ability of others to utilize AI-2 to regulate their behaviors (11Xavier K.B. Bassler B.L. Nature. 2005; 437: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Upon internalization by the Lsr transporter, AI-2 is phosphorylated to phospho-DPD (P-DPD, Fig. 1A, 2) by the kinase LsrK (17Taga M.E. Miller S.T. Bassler B.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1411-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 18Xavier K.B. Miller S.T. Lu W. Kim J.H. Rabinowitz J. Pelczer I. Semmelhack M.F. Bassler B.L. ACS Chem. Biol. 2007; 2: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). P-DPD is the inducer of the Lsr system and acts by binding to and inactivating the transcriptional repressor LsrR (18Xavier K.B. Miller S.T. Lu W. Kim J.H. Rabinowitz J. Pelczer I. Semmelhack M.F. Bassler B.L. ACS Chem. Biol. 2007; 2: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 19Xue T. Zhao L. Sun H. Zhou X. Sun B. Cell Res. 2009; 19: 1258-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, P-DPD triggers the induction of the Lsr system, causing a fast uptake of extracellular AI-2 and processing of internalized AI-2. Therefore, it is expected that every enzyme acting on P-DPD has a significant impact on AI-2 internalization and, hence, on AI-2-dependent interspecies cell-cell signaling. We have previously shown that LsrG is one of the enzymes involved in processing of P-DPD (18Xavier K.B. Miller S.T. Lu W. Kim J.H. Rabinowitz J. Pelczer I. Semmelhack M.F. Bassler B.L. ACS Chem. Biol. 2007; 2: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We showed that under aerobic conditions, in vitro incubation of LsrG with P-DPD results in the production of phosphoglycolate as well as multiple other compounds that accumulate to low levels. Neither the catalytic mechanism of LsrG nor the other compounds produced in the LsrG reaction were identified. Here, we characterize the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by LsrG. We show that LsrG catalyzes the conversion of P-DPD to the isomer 3,4,4-trihydroxy-2-pentanone-5-phosphate (P-TPO, Fig. 1A, 3) and propose the reaction that leads to the formation of this compound (Fig. 1A). Under reducing conditions (i.e. the conditions typically found in the cytoplasm) P-TPO and the non-hydrated form of this compound (3-hydroxy-2,4-pentadione-5-phosphate (P-HPD, Fig. 1A, 4) are stable and do not degrade readily. However, under oxidizing conditions, P-TPO and P-HPD are oxidized to a compound we identify as 3,3,4,4-tetrahydroxy-2-pentanone-5-phosphate (P-TetraPO, Fig, 1B, 5), which in turn degrades into phosphoglycolate and other smaller molecules produced in minor concentrations. We also present the crystal structure of LsrG. LsrG shares a fold with proteins belonging to the cofactor-independent monooxygenase family (20Fetzner S. Steiner R.A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 86: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Sciara G. Kendrew S.G. Miele A.E. Marsh N.G. Federici L. Malatesta F. Schimperna G. Savino C. Vallone B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the location of the LsrG active site is the same as in monooxygenases, the identity of the residues in the active site is not highly conserved. The LsrG structure has allowed us to identify potential catalytic residues, identifications that were then validated in vitro and in vivo. Finally, to determine the role of LsrG in the process of interference with AI-2 mediated signaling, we measured the impact of LsrG mutants on the intracellular accumulation of P-DPD, on the expression of the lsr operon, and on extracellular AI-2 accumulation/removal. Characterization of LsrG and the role it plays in AI-2 processing is essential for understanding how organisms that possess the Lsr system act to quench AI-2 signaling. This knowledge opens the door to the potential exploitation of these mechanisms as a means for controlling quorum sensing. E. coli LsrG was cloned into the pProEXHTb plasmid for overexpression as an N-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein. After transformation of the plasmid into E. coli strain BL21, cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (Sigma) with shaking at 37 °C to an A595 of 0.3. The temperature was lowered to 22 °C, and growth continued until an A595 of 0.9 was reached. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 15 h of growth at 22 °C with shaking post-induction, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μg ml−1 DNase, 2.5 μg ml−1 leupeptin, and 2.5 μg ml−1 aprotinin. Cells were lysed using a M-110Y Microfluidizer (Microfluidics). Lysates were clarified via centrifugation. The His6-LsrG fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). After application of the lysate, the columns were washed with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The fusion protein was eluted from the columns using 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Protein-containing fractions were pooled. The pooled protein was buffer swapped into 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol by size exclusion chromatography using a G25 column (GE Healthcare). The protein was then purified by ion exchange chromatography in the new buffer using a SourceQ column (GE Healthcare) with a gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl. Fusion protein with the His6 tag to be left on was then subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) and eluted in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was concentrated to 3.0 mg ml−1. For the LsrG protein, where the His6 tag was removed, 1 mg of His6-tobacco etch virus protease per 30 mg of His6-LsrG fusion protein was added to the post-ion exchange His6-LsrG. The solution was incubated overnight at 22 °C. The tag and protease were removed by passing the solution over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. LsrG was eluted with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protein-containing fractions were pooled. LsrG was then buffer-swapped into 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). The purified protein was concentrated to 3.1 mg ml−1. Four LsrG point mutants (E54A, H65A, N25A, and H70A) were created using the QuikChange Lightning kit (Agilent) per the manufacturer's instructions using primers designed using the QuikChange Primer Design tool. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing, and mutant plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21. Mutant protein was expressed and purified, leaving the His6-tag on, as described above. DPD protected with a cyclohexylidene group was chemically synthesized by the recently developed method as reported in Ascenso et al. (22Ascenso O.S. Marques J.C. Santos A.R. Xavier K.B. Ventura M.R. Maycock C.D. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2011; 19: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and dissolved in water to 10 mm. The cyclohexylidene-protecting group was removed with acidic Dowex 50WX8 resin (100 mg ml−1 of sample) also as reported previously (22Ascenso O.S. Marques J.C. Santos A.R. Xavier K.B. Ventura M.R. Maycock C.D. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2011; 19: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Deprotected DPD was then neutralized with a final concentration of 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The released cyclohexanone was removed by liquid-liquid extraction with an equal volume of deuterated chloroform. Removal of cyclohexanone is essential to facilitate assignment of the resonances in the methyl region of the NMR spectra. To determine the final concentration of DPD, quantification was performed by 1H NMR using formate as an internal concentration standard. Unless otherwise stated, all spectra were acquired on a Bruker AVANCE III 800 spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) working at a proton operating frequency of 800.33 MHz, equipped with a four-channel 5-mm inverse detection probe head with pulse-field gradients along the Z axis. Spectra were run at 4 °C (to avoid compound degradation) using standard Bruker pulse programs. 1H and 13C chemical shifts were referenced to 3-(trimethylsilyl)propane sulfonic acid. 31P chemical shifts were referenced to external 85% phosphoric acid. Standard Bruker pulse programs were used to acquire the heteronuclear 13C,1H two-dimensional correlation spectra. In the 13C,1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum, a delay of 3.45 ms was used for evolution of 1JCH, whereas a delay of 62.5 ms was used for the 1H,31P correlation spectra. In the heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity (HMBC) spectrum a delay of 73.5 ms was used for evolution of long range couplings. In the HSQC type spectra, proton decoupling was achieved using the GARP4 sequence (23Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar). For the enzyme kinetics determinations, spectra were acquired on a Bruker AVANCE II 500 spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a 5-mm broadband inverse detection probe head, working at 30 °C with a proton operating frequency of 500.43 MHz. Typically, 1H NMR spectra were acquired with water presaturation using a 60° flip angle and a repetition delay of 5.23 s. The same conditions were used to analyze the cell extracts, but spectra were collected at 4 °C. For quantification purposes formate was added as an internal concentration standard, and an extra relaxation delay of 30 s was used. All samples contained a mixture of D2O/H2O with 5% D2O. For the identification of P-HPD, the correlation spectra were performed in 100% D2O; in this case, the LsrG reaction was performed with P-DPD that had been lyophilized and was suspended in D2O before the addition of LsrG. P-DPD was produced enzymatically by the phosphorylation of DPD with purified LsrK and ATP. LsrK was purified as described previously (18Xavier K.B. Miller S.T. Lu W. Kim J.H. Rabinowitz J. Pelczer I. Semmelhack M.F. Bassler B.L. ACS Chem. Biol. 2007; 2: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 30 μg ml−1 LsrK, 2–3 mm DPD, 6 mm ATP, 24 mm MgCl2, 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.2, and 5% D2O. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and terminated by placing the samples in ice. Typically, these conditions ensured a complete conversion of DPD to P-DPD, and this was always confirmed by 1H NMR or 31P NMR spectra (at 4 °C to avoid degradation). To analyze the products of the LsrG reaction, 3 μg ml−1 final concentration of purified enzyme was added to the reaction mixture containing enzymatically prepared P-DPD. To ensure reducing conditions, samples were degassed with argon for 5 min, and freshly prepared DTT was added to a final concentration of 10 mm (unless mentioned otherwise) before the addition of LsrG. Incubation of these mixtures for 2 min at 30 °C was sufficient to ensure complete consumption of P-DPD. In cases where the LsrG reaction was performed in anaerobiosis, the LsrK reaction products were degassed by three cycles of vacuum and argon, and the LsrG enzyme and the diethylpyrocarbonate solution were left in an inert atmosphere glove box for 20 min. Mixtures were created in anaerobic conditions. To inhibit LsrG, diethylpyrocarbonate was used at a final concentration of 50 mm. The enzymatic activity of LsrG and its mutants was determined by monitoring the kinetics of P-DPD decrease at 30 °C by acquiring sequential 1H NMR spectra (1.5 min each). For these experiments a batch of P-PDP was prepared as detailed above and quantified by 1H NMR using formate as an internal reference. This mixture was kept in ice until use. Before each reaction an aliquot of 650 μl of the P-DPD sample was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C in a 5-mm NMR tube, and the reaction was started by adding the LsrG or its mutants and placed in the spectrometer. The first spectra were started 1.5 min after enzyme addition. Controls with no enzyme or no substrate were performed for all conditions. To determine the specific enzyme activity, the concentration of protein added was adjusted to ensure that the rate of substrate consumption was linear at least in the first 10–12 min. For wild type (WT) LsrG, 1 μg ml−1 of protein was used, but for the point mutants, concentrations up to 20 μg ml−1 were tested. Crystals of WT LsrG with the His6 tag removed were grown via the sitting drop method with a well solution of 1.65 m sodium citrate, pH 6.5. Crystals were cryoprotected in paratone and flash-frozen in the diffractometer cryostream. Data were collected at National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X25. The crystals (P21, a = 44.64 Å, b = 83.39 Å, c = 63.59Å, β = 89.52°) diffracted to 1.8 Å resolution. Data were processed using Denzo, Scalepack, and CCP4 (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The strain JCM16 ΔlsrG::Cm was constructed by replacing the lsrG gene in KX1123 by a chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance cassette as described previously (31Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1984: 107-111Google Scholar). To construct JCM23, Cm was removed from strain JCM16 with pcp20 as described (31Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11305) Google Scholar). To obtain JCM62 (ΔlsrK::Kan) a P1 lysate from the strain JW1504 ΔlsrK::Kan (obtained from National BioResource Project (Japan):E. coli) was used to introduce this deletion into KX1123 by generalized P1 transduction.

Bassler B.L. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To test the effect of the expression of LsrG and its mutants, the strains containing the pProExHTb plasmid and its derivatives were cultured in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, ampicillin (100 mg liter−1) and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 μg liter−1). Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added 2.5 h after inoculation to mimic the start of lsrG induction in the WT strain. To assay β-galactosidase activity, cells were collected and harvested when cultures reached A595 = 3. To measure lsr-lacZ expression in cell cultures during growth, extracts were created from 1 ml of culture aliquots collected in triplicate at the indicated times. All assays were performed in triplicate. To monitor extracellular AI-2 activity in cell cultures during growth, aliquots were collected at the indicated times and cell-free culture fluids were prepared by the filtration of liquid cultures (34Surette M.G. Bassler B.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 35Surette M.G. Bassler B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7046-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and then analyzed for AI-2 activity. Quantification of AI-2 was performed using the in vitro assay based on the LuxP-FRET method established by Rajamani et al. (36Rajamani S. Zhu J. Pei D. Sayre R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3990-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and optimized for 96-well plate reading using a multilabel counter (1420 Victor 3, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Specifically, serial dilutions of sample were added to 12.5 μg ml−1 CFP-LuxP-YFP chimeric protein in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8, 35 mm NaCl, and 1 mm borate. Samples (2.5 μl) were added to a 280-μl reaction volume, and AI-2 concentrations of the samples were calculated from the FRET ratio (527/485 nm). Binding of AI-2 to the CFP-LuxP-YFP protein causes a dose-dependent decrease in the FRET signal, and concentration can be determined by comparing the FRET ratios of each sample with a calibration curve performed with AI-2 samples of known concentration produced and quantified as described in Schauder et al. (6Schauder S. Shokat K. Surette M.G. Bassler B.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Concentrations between 1 and 60 μm AI-2 were used for the calibration curve, corresponding to the linear range of this assay. All assays were performed in triplicate. Each strain was cultured to A595 = 3 (conditions at which expression of lsr expression is high) and harvested by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm MgCl2; the cell pellets were resuspended in the same buffer and incubated with 2 mm DPD. After the addition of DPD, the cell suspension had a final volume of 3 ml and a calculated A595 of 70–80. This mixture was incubated at 30 °C with aeration. Efficient mixing and supply of oxygen to the cell suspension were achieved by bubbling oxygen and using an airlift system (37Santos H. Turner D.L.

Here we further characterize the DGCR8-heme interaction using biochemical and spectroscopic methods. The DGCR8-heme complex is highly stable, with a half-life exceeding 4 days. Mutation of the conserved proline 351 to an alanine increases the rate of heme dissociation and allows the DGCR8-heme complex to be reconstituted biochemically.

We identified Pin1 in the immunoprecipitates of overexpressed IRS-1 with myc and FLAG tags in mouse livers and confirmed the association between IRS-1 and Pin1 by not only overexpression experiments but also endogenously in the mouse liver. The analysis using deletion- and point-mutated Pin1 and IRS-1 constructs revealed the WW domain located in the N terminus of Pin1 and Ser-434 in the SAIN (Shc and IRS-1 NPXY binding) domain of IRS-1 to be involved in their association. Subsequently, we investigated the role of Pin1 in IRS-1 mediation of insulin signaling. The overexpression of Pin1 in HepG2 cells markedly enhanced insulin-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation and its downstream events: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding with IRS-1 and Akt phosphorylation. In contrast, the treatment of HepG2 cells with Pin1 siRNA or the Pin1 inhibitor Juglone suppressed these events. In good agreement with these in vitro data, Pin1 knock-out mice exhibited impaired insulin signaling with glucose intolerance, whereas adenoviral gene transfer of Pin1 into the ob/ob mouse liver mostly normalized insulin signaling and restored glucose tolerance. In addition, it was also demonstrated that Pin1 plays a critical role in adipose differentiation, making Pin1 knock-out mice resistant to diet-induced obesity. Importantly, Pin1 expression was shown to be up-regulated in accordance with nutrient conditions such as food intake or a high-fat diet.

https://openalex.org/W1969538906,"Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a membrane-bound, tumor-related enzyme whose expression is often considered a marker for hypoxia, an indicator of poor prognosis in the majority of cancer patients, and is associated with acidification of the tumor microenvironment. Here, we describe for the first time the catalytic properties of native CAIX in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that exhibit hypoxia-inducible CAIX expression. Using (18)O exchange measured by membrane inlet mass spectrometry, we determined catalytic activity in membrane ghosts and intact cells. Exofacial carbonic anhydrase activity increases with exposure to hypoxia, an activity which is suppressed by impermeant sulfonamide CA inhibitors. Inhibition by sulfonamide inhibitors is not sensitive to reoxygenation. CAIX activity in intact cells increases in response to reduced pH. Data from membrane ghosts show that the increase in activity at reduced pH is largely due to an increase in the dehydration reaction. In addition, the kinetic constants of CAIX in membrane ghosts are very similar to our previous measurements for purified, recombinant, truncated forms. Hence, the activity of CAIX is not affected by the proteoglycan extension or membrane environment. These activities were measured at a total concentration for all CO(2) species at 25 mm and close to chemical equilibrium, conditions which approximate the physiological extracellular environment. Our data suggest that CAIX is particularly well suited to maintain the extracellular pH at a value that favors the survival fitness of tumor cells."

Most evidence indicates that soluble mhtt species, rather than insoluble aggregates, are the important mediators of HD pathogenesis. However, the differential roles of soluble monomeric and oligomeric mhtt species in HD and the mechanisms of oligomer formation are not yet understood. We have shown previously that copper interacts with and oxidizes the polyglutamine-containing N171 fragment of huntingtin. In this study we report that oxidation-dependent oligomers of huntingtin form spontaneously in cell and mouse HD models. Levels of these species are modulated by copper, hydrogen peroxide, and glutathione. Mutagenesis of all cysteine residues within N171 blocks the formation of these oligomers. In cells, levels of oligomerization-blocked mutant N171 were decreased compared with native N171. We further show that a subset of the oligomerization-blocked form of glutamine-expanded N171 huntingtin is rapidly depleted from the soluble pool compared with “native ” mutant N171. Taken together, our data indicate that huntingtin is subject to specific oxidations that are involved in the formation of stable oligomers and that also delay removal from the soluble pool. These findings show that inhibiting formation of oxidation-dependent huntingtin oligomers, or promoting their dissolution, may have protective effects in HD by decreasing the burden of soluble mutant huntingtin.

Previous biochemical studies revealed that DinB family DNA polymerases, including Escherichia coli DNA polymerase IV and human DNA polymerase κ, efficiently incorporate the correct nucleotide opposite some N(2)-modified 2'-deoxyguanosine derivatives. Herein, we used shuttle vector technology and demonstrated that deficiency in Polk or Poli in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells resulted in elevated frequencies of G→T and G→A mutations at N(2)-(1-carboxyethyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine (N(2)-CEdG) and N(2)-carboxymethyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (N(2)-CMdG) sites. Steady-state kinetic measurements revealed that human DNA polymerase ι preferentially inserts the correct nucleotide, dCMP, opposite N(2)-CEdG lesions. In contrast, no mutation was found after the N(2)-CEdG- and N(2)-CMdG-bearing plasmids were replicated in POLH-deficient human cells or Rev3-deficient MEF cells. Together, our results revealed that, in mammalian cells, both polymerases κ and ι are necessary for the error-free bypass of N(2)-CEdG and N(2)-CMdG. However, in the absence of polymerase κ or ι, other translesion synthesis polymerase(s) could incorporate nucleotide(s) opposite these lesions but would do so inaccurately."
https://openalex.org/W2162103271,"Protein kinase inhibitors with enhanced selectivity can be designed by optimizing binding interactions with less conserved inactive conformations because such inhibitors will be less likely to compete with ATP for binding and therefore may be less impacted by high intracellular concentrations of ATP. Analysis of the ATP-binding cleft in a number of inactive protein kinases, particularly in the autoinhibited conformation, led to the identification of a previously undisclosed non-polar region in this cleft. This ATP-incompatible hydrophobic region is distinct from the previously characterized hydrophobic allosteric back pocket, as well as the main pocket. Generalized hypothetical models of inactive kinases were constructed and, for the work described here, we selected the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase family as a case study. Initial optimization of a FGFR2 inhibitor identified from a library of commercial compounds was guided using structural information from the model. We describe the inhibitory characteristics of this compound in biophysical, biochemical, and cell-based assays, and have characterized the binding mode using x-ray crystallographic studies. The results demonstrate, as expected, that these inhibitors prevent activation of the autoinhibited conformation, retain full inhibitory potency in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP, and have favorable inhibitory activity in cancer cells. Given the widespread regulation of kinases by autoinhibitory mechanisms, the approach described herein provides a new paradigm for the discovery of inhibitors by targeting inactive conformations of protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1990633920,"The PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase, PHLPP, plays a central role in controlling the amplitude of growth factor signaling by directly dephosphorylating and thereby inactivating Akt. The cellular levels of PHLPP1 have recently been shown to be enhanced by its substrate, activated Akt, via modulation of a phosphodegron recognized by the E3 ligase β-TrCP1, thus providing a negative feedback loop to tightly control cellular Akt output. Here we show that this feedback loop is lost in aggressive glioblastoma but not less aggressive astrocytoma. Overexpression and pharmacological studies reveal that loss of the feedback loop does not result from a defect in PHLPP1 protein or in the upstream kinases that control its phosphodegron. Rather, the defect arises from altered localization of β-TrCP1; in astrocytoma cell lines and in normal brain tissue the E3 ligase is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas in glioblastoma cell lines and patient-derived tumor neurospheres, the E3 ligase is confined to the nucleus and thus spatially separated from PHLPP1, which is cytoplasmic. Restoring the localization of β-TrCP1 to the cytosol of glioblastoma cells rescues the ability of Akt to regulate PHLPP1 stability. Additionally, we show that the degradation of another β-TrCP1 substrate, β-catenin, is impaired and accumulates in the cytosol of glioblastoma cell lines. Our findings reveal that the cellular localization of β-TrCP1 is altered in glioblastoma, resulting in dysregulation of PHLPP1 and other substrates such as β-catenin."

MutS is composed of seven domains (mismatch-binding, connector, core, lever, clamp, ATPase, and dimerization/tetramerization domains) (see Fig. 1) (9Mendillo M.L. Putnam C.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol.

MutL has been dissected into a 40-kDa N-terminal half (LN40) and a 20-kDa C-terminal dimerization domain (LC20) (13Ban C. Yang W.

LN40 comprises the ATPase domain and transducer domain and is connected by a non-conserved linker to the LC20 domain (13Ban C. Yang W.

In this asymmetric complex, only the conserved Phe-X-Glu-motif of the mismatch-binding domain of one subunit is in direct contact with the mismatch, resulting in a 45–60° kink at the mismatch (10Lamers M.H.

In E. coli, the mismatched base is stacked onto Phe-36 and hydrogen-bonded to Glu-38, and stacking of Phe-36 between the bases is important for mismatch recognition and prevents MutS from sliding on the DNA (20Yamamoto A. Schofield M.J. Biswas I. Hsieh P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3564-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A hallmark of the mismatch recognition process by MutS is the ATP-induced transition from a stationary clamp bound to the mismatched DNA to a long lived mobile sliding clamp (21Gradia S. Acharya S.

For the formation of the sliding clamp, conformational changes involving movement of the mismatch-binding domain have been proposed (24Lamers M.H. Georgijevic D. Lebbink J.H. Winterwerp H.H.

ATP and Mg2+ binding was shown to be crucial not only for the formation of a sliding clamp but also for the formation of a dynamic ternary complex comprising DNA-MutS-MutL (27Mendillo M.L. Mazur D.J.

This ternary complex coordinates all subsequent steps in DNA repair (e.g. strand discrimination and DNA unwinding) and is also involved in signaling the DNA mismatch/damage to other cellular responses (29Polosina Y.Y. Cupples C.G. BioEssays. 2010; 32: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that MutS undergoes substantial conformational changes during this transition; however, until recently few structural details were known (30Mendillo M.L. Putnam C.D.

A recent study with yeast MutSα suggested that ternary complex formation and sliding clamp formation are distinct steps involving different nucleotide states of MutS. Moreover, it was suggested that the ternary complex precedes sliding clamp formation (30Mendillo M.L. Putnam C.D. Mo A.O. Jamison J.W. Li S. Woods Jr., V.L. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol.

Attempts to get high resolution structural information on the ternary complex or the sliding clamp, e.g. by x-ray crystallography, have been hampered by the dynamic nature of the ternary complex, the mobility, and lack of DNA sequence specificity of the MutS sliding clamp. Mutational analyses and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry analyses suggested that the connector domain of MutS contains residues critical for the interaction with MutL (32Mendillo M.L. Hargreaves V.V. Jamison J.W. Mo A.O. Li S. Putnam C.D. Woods Jr., V.L. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 22223-22228Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here, we used Cys-mediated cross-linking to shed light onto these two key events in DNA mismatch repair. To this end, we generated a set of cysteine variants of MutS and MutL and tested the proteins for cross-linking using the highly specific and reactive maleimide cross-linking chemistry. In addition, we used site-specifically labeled MutS and MutL single cysteine variants to monitor the ternary complex formation in solution using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Based on our results and data from the literature, we provide a model of the MutS-MutL-MutH complex and its implication for the MMR process. Linear DNA substrates (484 bp with or without a GT mismatch) were generated from two 484-bp PCR products amplified by Pfu DNA polymerase with a 5′-phosphate at the top or the bottom strand, respectively, using plasmids pET-15b-XhoI (with a GC base pair) and/or pET-15b-HindIII (with an AT base pair), respectively, with primers (BBseq A302/pA302, 5′-ATC TTC CCC ATC GGT GAT GTC-3′; and BBseq B111/p111, 5′-TCA TCC TCG GCA CCG TCA C-3′) essentially as described previously (33Thomas E. Pingoud A. Friedhoff P. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated strands were digested by λ-exonuclease, and the top strand (containing a G at position 385) was annealed to the bottom strand (containing a C or a T at position 385, respectively) to give either a 484-bp homoduplex (GC484) or heteroduplex (GT484), respectively. A 42-bp GT heteroduplex (GT42) corresponding to positions 365–406 of GT484 was generated by annealing the two oligonucleotides TAT TAA TTT CGC GGG CTC GAG AGC TTC ATC CTC TAC GCC GGA and TCC GGC GTA GAG GAT GAA GCT TTC GAG CCC GCG AAA TTA ATA (the underlined bases indicate the position of the GT mismatch). The generation of circular DNA substrates (described in detail in the supplemental information) containing a single GT mismatch within a hemimethylated Dcm site at position 169 and a hemimethylated GATC site at position 356 (3315 bp with GT mismatch) was performed essentially as published before (34Heinze R.J.

Plasmids encoding the gene for a cysteine-free MutS (MutS-CF) and dimeric MutS-CF/D835R have been described before (8Manelyte L. Urbanke C. Giron-Monzon L. Friedhoff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5270-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Single cysteine MutS variants (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a modification of the QuikChange protocol (35Kirsch R.D. Joly E.

MutS and MutL proteins were stored in 10 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.9), 200 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA (for MutS proteins 10% glycerol was added). MutS and MutL were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined from UV absorbance spectra using the theoretical molar extinction coefficients (MutS, 68,000 m−1 cm−1; or MutL, 54,800 m−1 cm−1) and are given in monomeric equivalents (39Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). Variants of MutS and MutL were tested for their ability to activate the MutH endonuclease using a covalently closed circular heteroduplex DNA substrate (3315 bp) containing a GT mismatch and a hemimethylated GATC site separated by 186 bp. DNA (15 nm) was incubated with 200 nm MutH, 400 nm MutL, and 400 nm MutS in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 125 mm KCl buffer at 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were taken after different time points (0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 300, and 600 s), and the reactions were stopped with 2 μl of 250 mm EDTA, 25% sucrose, 1.25% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 1 μl of 10 units/μl proteinase K. Samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis (1% agarose in Tris-phosphate-EDTA containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide). MutH activity was monitored by the conversion of covalently closed circular DNA to nicked DNA (open circular). The intensity of the ethidium bromide-stained DNA bands was quantified using TotalLab v2.01 software and analyzed with Origin8.5 software. A single exponential functional was used to fit the time course to yield apparent first order rate constants (kobs). The homobifunctional maleimide cross-linkers of varying length, 1,11-bismaleimidotetraethylene glycol (BM[PEO]4) and bismaleimidoethane, and the methanethiosulfonate cross-linker were obtained from Pierce and Toronto Research Chemicals, respectively. Stock solutions of 10 mm were made in water or DMSO. MutL (10 μm) variants were incubated with 5 mm nucleotide (ADP, ATP, or AMPPNP) and MutS (0.57 μm) variants with homo- or heteroduplex DNA on ice for 25 min in buffer HK (20 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.01 mm EDTA) and 125 or 150 mm KCl. MutS and MutL were mixed with final concentrations as indicated. After 10-min incubation at room temperature followed by 2 min at 37 °C, 50 μm cross-linker was added to the samples (at least 50-fold molar excess over thiol groups) and incubated for 1–2 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by adding DTT (50 mm final concentration for maleimide cross-linker) or N-ethylmaleimide (50 mm final concentration for methanethiosulfonate cross-linker). Samples were subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (AppliChem). Gels were analyzed with a video documentation system (Bio-Rad). The intensity of the stained protein bands was quantified using TotalLab v2.01 software. Cross-linking yields were calculated as %S×L=I(S×L)Mr,S+Mr,LI(S)Mr,S+I(S×L)Mr,S+Mr,L+I(S×S)Mr,S(Eq. 1) where I (S x L) is the intensity of the MutS-MutL band, I (S x S) is the intensity of the MutS-MutS band, and I (S) is the intensity of the MutS band. Mr,S = 97,000 and Mr,L = 70,000, i.e. the Mr (molecular weight) of MutS and MutL, respectively. MutS and MutL variants were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 in a 1:3 or 1:4 molar ratio, respectively. After 30-min incubation on ice, the samples were twice purified over Zeba Desalt Spin Columns (Pierce, Thermo Scientific) followed by the measurement of the concentration using absorbance spectroscopy, cprot=A280−Amax×CF∈prot(Eq. 2) where A280 is the absorbance at 280 nm, Amax is the absorbance of the Alexa Fluor 594 or Alexa Fluor 488, CF is the correction factor for the used dye (CFA488 = 0.12 and CFA594 = 0.57), and ϵprot is the theoretical molar extinction coefficients of the respective protein at 280 nm. The degree of labeling (DOL) was determined using the equation DOL=Amax×∈prot(A280−Amax×CF)×∈max(Eq. 3) where ϵmax is the molar extinction coefficients of Alexa Fluor 488 (71,000 m−1 cm−1) or Alexa Fluor 594 (73,000 m−1 cm−1), respectively. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman Coulter ProteomeLab XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a fluorescence detection system (Aviv Biomedical) using an An50Ti rotor at 20 °C and speeds from 22,000 to 33,000 rpm. The concentration profiles were measured using the analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a fluorescence detection system with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and emission was detected through a pair of long pass (>505-nm) dichroic filters. Programming of the centrifuge and data recording were performed using the AOS software (Aviv Biomedical) on a computer attached to the centrifuge. Special cell housings (Nanolytics) were used that allow the placement of standard 3-mm double sector centerpieces directly beneath the upper window of the cell. The cells were filled with 100 μl of sample. The experiments were performed in buffer HKT (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 125 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01 mm EDTA, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 to prevent protein adsorption to surfaces). For MutS-449C and MutL-297C, the Alexa Fluor 488-labeled proteins were examined at concentrations between 100 nm and 1 μm. The experiments for MutS-246C-Alexa Fluor 488 were done at a concentration of 100 nm. To test the influence of bound nucleotide on the sedimentation behavior, the experiments were performed in the presence of 1 mm ADP, ATP, or AMPPNP, respectively. To check whether the fluorescently labeled MutS variants are still able to bind to heteroduplex DNA, a 100 nm concentration of the respective protein was incubated in the presence of 1 mm ADP with 500 nm GT42 and subjected to sedimentation velocity analysis. The measured concentration profiles were evaluated using the program package SEDFIT (40Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar), which provides a model for diffusion-corrected differential sedimentation coefficient distributions (c(s) distributions). For hydrodynamic analyses, measured s values were corrected to s20,w using the partial specific volumes calculated from amino acid composition (41Durchschlag H. Hinz H.J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 45-128Google Scholar). Because the partial specific volume of complexes of different macromolecules with unknown composition cannot be calculated, such a correction could not be performed, and uncorrected sedimentation coefficients (sexp) are given in these cases. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained using a FluoroMax-4 (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) with excitation wavelength λex at 470 or 575 nm and band width set to 1.8 nm. Emission spectra were recorded at 20 °C in a total volume of 100 μl in buffer HKT. Spectra were normalized to the maximum of fluorescence intensity at 515 nm. Docking runs were performed with the Hex software to automatically get thousands of configurations (42Ritchie D.W. Kemp G.J. Proteins. 2000; 39: 178-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In a first docking run, we used the mismatch-binding and connector domains of MutS (Protein Data Bank code 1e3m, chain B, residues 2–266) and the N-terminal domains of MutL (Protein Data Bank code 1b63, chain A and B, residues 1–331), and in a second docking run, the N-terminal domains of MutL and MutH (Protein Data Bank code 2azo, chain B) (37Giron-Monzon L. Manelyte L. Ahrends R. Kirsch D. Spengler B. Friedhoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49338-49345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were used. Docking solutions were used to generate structural models of the full-length MutS with MutL and MutH. These models were filtered using the experimentally derived distance constraints (this work and Ref. 37Giron-Monzon L. Manelyte L. Ahrends R. Kirsch D. Spengler B. Friedhoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49338-49345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For details of the procedure, see the supplemental information. In a previous report, we demonstrated that the single cysteine MutL variant (MutL-131C) modified with benzophenone at Cys-131 in the ATPase domain could be photo-cross-linked to MutS (43Plotz G. Welsch C. Giron-Monzon L. Friedhoff P. Albrecht M. Piiper A. Biondi R.M. Lengauer T. Zeuzem S. Raedle J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6574-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, using the thiol-specific bismaleimide reagent BM[PEO]4 (Fig. 1A), we were able to obtain a MutS-MutL cross-link in the presence of a GT mismatch DNA and ATP (43Plotz G. Welsch C. Giron-Monzon L. Friedhoff P. Albrecht M. Piiper A. Biondi R.M. Lengauer T. Zeuzem S. Raedle J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6574-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This indicated that one or more of the six endogenous cysteine residues of MutS are in proximity to the N-terminal domain of MutL (Fig. 1B). Here we investigated the cross-link formation between MutS and MutL-131C in more detail. In the presence of ATP, the formation of a cross-link was dependent on the length of the DNA and was observed with a long 484-bp GT-containing DNA (Fig. 1C, lane 2) but was almost absent when the DNA was only 42 bp long (Fig. 1C, lane 5). Moreover, the cross-link formation was mismatch-dependent as we only observed the MutS-MutL cross-link in the presence of heteroduplex (GT) DNA but not with the corresponding homoduplex (GC) DNA (supplemental Fig. S1). To test whether ATP binding or ATP hydrolysis is required to form the cross-link, we replaced ATP by ADP or the non-hydrolyzable analogue AMPPNP. It has been noticed before that MutS is not able to recognize mismatches when ATP is bound but cannot be hydrolyzed, e.g. in the absence of Mg2+ or by using non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue ATPγS or AMPPNP (44Jacobs-Palmer E.

As expected from the DNA dependence of the cross-link formation, no MutS-MutL cross-link was observed when MutS was incubated with AMPPNP prior to the addition of DNA and MutL (data not shown). In contrast, when MutS was bound to DNA prior to the addition of MutL and AMPPNP, MutS-MutL cross-link formation was as efficient as with ATP, indicating that ATP binding but not hydrolysis is required for cross-link formation (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 4). No cross-link formation was observed in the presence of ADP (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Moreover, using MutS-E694A, which is defective in ATP hydrolysis (47Baitinger C. Burdett V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49505-49511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 48Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), cross-link formation was observed only when MutS was first bound to DNA followed by the addition of ATP, MutL, and the cross-linker (data not shown). To identify the cysteine residue involved in the chemical cross-linking reaction, we tested variants in which one or more of the endogenous cysteine residues were replaced by other amino acid residues (supplemental Table S2). The six non-conserved cysteine residues in MutS are located in the mismatch-binding domain (Cys-93), the connector domain (Cys-235 and Cys-239), the core domain (Cys-297), and the ATPase domain (Cys-569 and Cys-711) (Fig. 1B). In the crystal structure of MutS in complex with mismatched DNA and bound ADP, only three of these cysteine residues (235, 297, and 569) are solvent-exposed (49Natrajan G. Lamers M.H. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H. Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4814-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).

Although the Smad pathway is fundamental for the majority of these responses, recent evidence indicates that non-Smad pathways may also have a critical role. Here we report a novel mechanism whereby the nonreceptor tyrosine focal adhesion kinase (FAK) functions as an adaptor necessary for cell type-specific responses to TGF-β. We show that in contrast to Smad actions, non-Smad pathways, including c-Abl, PAK2, and Akt, display an obligate requirement for FAK. Interestingly, this occurs in Src null SYF cells and is independent of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, kinase activity, and/or proline-rich sequences in the C-terminal FAT domain. FAK binds the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) p85 regulatory subunit following TGF-β treatment in a subset of fibroblasts but not epithelial cells and has an obligate role in TGF-β-stimulated anchorage-independent growth and migration. Together, these results uncover a new scaffolding role for FAK as the most upstream component regulating the profibrogenic action of TGF-β and suggest that inhibiting this interaction may be useful in treating a number of fibrotic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2048760173,"The homeodomain transcription factor Shox2 plays a crucial regulatory role in the development of sinoatrial node (SAN) by repressing the expression of Nkx2.5, as demonstrated by failed differentiation of SAN in Shox2 null mice. The SHOX (short stature homeobox) gene family consists of two closely related members, SHOX and SHOX2 in humans, but a SHOX ortholog does not exist in the mouse genome. These two genes exhibit overlapping and distinct expression patterns in many developing organs but whether they share functional redundancy is not known. In this study, we set to investigate possible functional redundancy between SHOX and SHOX2 in vitro and in vivo. We first showed that human SHOX and SHOX2 and mouse Shox2 possess similar transcriptional repressive activities in cell cultures, particularly the repressive effects on the Nkx2.5 promoter activity. We further created an SHOX/Shox2 knock-in mouse line (replacement of Shox2 with SHOX, referred as Shox2(KI/KI)). Mice carrying the hypomorphic Shox2(KI+Neo/KI+Neo) allele exhibit bradycardia and arrhythmia and die a few days after birth. However, mice carrying the Shox2(KI/KI) allele grow to adulthood. Physiological, histological, and molecular analyses demonstrate a fully developed SAN and normal pacemaking function in Shox2(KI/KI) mice. Our results demonstrate a functional redundancy between human SHOX and mouse Shox2 in the regulation of SAN formation and pacemaking function in addition to several other organs. The SHOX/Shox2 dose appears to be critical for normal pacemaking function."
https://openalex.org/W2064199906,"Protein degradation by eukaryotic proteasomes is a multi-step process involving substrate recognition, ATP-dependent unfolding, translocation into the proteolytic core particle, and finally proteolysis. To date, most investigations of proteasome function have focused on the first and the last steps in this process. Here we examine the relationship between the stability of a folded protein domain and its degradation rate. Test proteins were targeted to the proteasome independently of ubiquitination by directly tethering them to the protease. Degradation kinetics were compared for test protein pairs whose stability was altered by either point mutation or ligand binding, but were otherwise identical. In both intact cells and in reactions using purified proteasomes and substrates, increased substrate stability led to an increase in substrate turnover time. The steady-state time for degradation ranged from ∼5 min (dihydrofolate reductase) to 40 min (I27 domain of titin). ATP turnover was 110/min./proteasome, and was not markedly changed by substrate. Proteasomes engage tightly folded substrates in multiple iterative rounds of ATP hydrolysis, a process that can be rate-limiting for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2011664297,"Phosphorylation of connexins is an important mechanism regulating gap junction channels. However, the role(s) of connexin (Cx) phosphorylation in vivo are largely unknown. Here, we showed by mass spectrometry that Ser-395 in the C terminus of chicken Cx50 was phosphorylated in the lens. Ser-395 is located within a PKA consensus site. Analyses of Cx50 phosphorylation by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography tryptic phosphopeptide profiles suggested that Ser-395 was targeted by PKA in vivo. PKA activation increased both gap junction dye coupling and hemichannel dye uptake in a manner not involving increases in total Cx50 expression or relocation to the cell surface or gap junctional plaques. Single channel recordings indicated PKA enhanced transitions between the closed and ∼200-pS open state while simultaneously reducing transitions between this open state and a ∼65-pS subconductance state. The mutation of Ser-395 to alanine significantly attenuated PKA-induced increases in dye coupling and uptake by Cx50. However, channel records indicated that phosphorylation at this site was unnecessary for enhanced transitions between the closed and ∼200-pS conductance state. Together, these results suggest that Cx50 is phosphorylated in vivo by PKA at Ser-395 and that this event, although unnecessary for PKA-induced alterations in channel conductance, promotes increased dye permeability of Cx50 channels, which plays an important role in metabolic coupling and transport in lens fibers."
https://openalex.org/W1965555525,"Tuberculosis remains a serious global health threat, with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains highlighting the urgent need for novel antituberculosis drugs. The enzyme 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS) catalyzes the first step of the shikimate pathway for the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds. This pathway has been shown to be essential in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen responsible for tuberculosis. DAH7PS catalyzes a condensation reaction between P-enolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate to give 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate. The enzyme reaction mechanism is proposed to include a tetrahedral intermediate, which is formed by attack of an active site water on the central carbon of P-enolpyruvate during the course of the reaction. Molecular modeling of this intermediate into the active site reported in this study shows a configurational preference consistent with water attack from the re face of P-enolpyruvate. Based on this model, we designed and synthesized an inhibitor of DAH7PS that mimics this reaction intermediate. Both enantiomers of this intermediate mimic were potent inhibitors of M. tuberculosis DAH7PS, with inhibitory constants in the nanomolar range. The crystal structure of the DAH7PS-inhibitor complex was solved to 2.35 Å. Both the position of the inhibitor and the conformational changes of active site residues observed in this structure correspond closely to the predictions from the intermediate modeling. This structure also identifies a water molecule that is located in the appropriate position to attack the re face of P-enolpyruvate during the course of the reaction, allowing the catalytic mechanism for this enzyme to be clearly defined."
https://openalex.org/W2049679236,"The γ-secretase membrane protein complex is responsible for proteolytic maturation of signaling precursors and catalyzes the final step in the production of the amyloid β-peptides implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. The incorporation of PEN-2 (presenilin enhancer 2) into a pre-activation intermediate, composed of the catalytic subunit presenilin and the accessory proteins APH-1 (anterior pharynx-defective 1) and nicastrin, triggers the endoproteolysis of presenilin and results in an active tetrameric γ-secretase. We have determined the three-dimensional reconstruction of a mature and catalytically active γ-secretase using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. γ-Secretase has a cup-like shape with a lateral belt of ∼40-50 Å in height that encloses a water-accessible internal chamber. Active site labeling with a gold-coupled transition state analog inhibitor suggested that the γ-secretase active site faces this chamber. Comparison with the structure of a trimeric pre-activation intermediate suggested that the incorporation of PEN-2 might contribute to the maturation of the active site architecture."

IntroductionVarious members of the genus Leishmania cause leishmaniasis, which threatens ∼350 million people worldwide and gives rise to about two million clinical cases each year, of which ∼25% are of the fatal visceral form (1Desjeux P. Clin. Dermatol. 1996; 14: 417-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The disease is largely endemic to developing countries, and current treatments are expensive and can result in undesirable side effects for the patient (1Desjeux P. Clin. Dermatol. 1996; 14: 417-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). This, combined with the increasing drug resistance that is developing in the Leishmania species, means that new and novel anti-parasitic drug targets are urgently required.Deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) 2The abbreviations used are: dUTPase, deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase; LmdUTPase, dUTPase from L. major; TcdUTPase, dUTPase from T. cruzi; TbdUTPase, dUTPase from T. brucei; CjdUTPase, dUTPase from C. jejuni; dUTP, 2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate; dUDP, 2′-deoxyuridine 5′-diphosphate; dUMP, 2′-deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate; dU, 2′-deoxyuridine; dUpNpp, α,β-imino-deoxyuridine triphosphate; dUpNp, α,β-imino-deoxyuridine diphosphate; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation(s); TLS, Translation Libration Screw-motion. represents such a target. dUTPases catalyze the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate (2Shlomai J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3305-3312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This provides the starting material for the synthesis of dTMP by thymidylate synthase and in addition maintains the ratio of dTTP:dUTP in the cell at a high enough level to prevent excessive misincorporation of dUMP into the genome during DNA replication (3Pearl L.H. Savva R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 485-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). dUTPase activity is essential as was shown by gene knock-outs in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Inhibition of dUTPase activity results in futile cycles of DNA repair that ultimately cause the fragmentation of DNA and cell death (4el-Hajj H.H. Zhang H. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gadsden M.H. McIntosh E.M. Game J.C. Wilson P.J. Haynes R.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4425-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). dUTPase activity also appears to be essential in L. major (6Hidalgo-Zarco F. González-Pazanowska D. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2001; 2: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the related parasite Trypanosoma brucei, where an RNAi approach was used to knock down dUTPase expression, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and growth in both procyclic and bloodstream forms of the organism (7Castillo-Acosta V.M.

Most organisms, including humans, have trimeric dUTPases with structures largely consisting of β-pleated sheet (8Persson R. Cedergren-Zeppezauer E.S. Wilson K.S. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2001; 2: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Three active sites are formed at the trimer interfaces by five characteristic sequence motifs. Each subunit contributes to every active site present in the trimer, with a single divalent metal ion bound in each of the active sites in the presence of substrate (9Barabás O. Pongrácz V. Kovári J.

This metal ion has been implicated in substrate binding and catalysis as the presence of Mg2+ reduces the Km of the E. coli enzyme by a 0.5 to 1 order of magnitude and increases the value of kcat 2- to 3-fold in the Drosophila melanogaster enzyme (11Kovári J. Barabás O. Takács E. Békési A. Dubrovay Z. Pongrácz V. Zagyva I. Imre T. Szabó P. Vértessy B.G. J. Biol.

Monomeric dUTPases also have been identified that appear to have arisen by gene duplication merging two protomers of the trimeric enzyme into a single polypeptide (13McGeoch D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4105-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These monomeric enzymes are found only in mammalian herpes viruses and have the same five characteristic sequence motifs as the trimeric enzymes but in a different order.The enzymes from L. major (LmdUTPase), Trypanosoma cruzi (TcdUTPase), and Trypanosoma brucei (TbdUTPase) as well as some bacterial species show markedly different structural and biochemical properties to the trimeric enzymes (14Galperin M.Y. Moroz O.V. Wilson K.S. Murzin A.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These enzymes act as dimers and are able to hydrolyze not only dUTP but also dUDP (15Hidalgo-Zarco F. Camacho A.G. Bernier-Villamor V. Nord J. Ruiz-Pérez L.M. González-Pacanowska D. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1426-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), whereas dUDP has been shown to be an inhibitor of the trimeric enzyme in E. coli (16Larsson G. Nyman P.O. Kvassman J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24010-24016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). They are, in addition, subject to product inhibition by dUMP (17Camacho A. Hidalgo-Zarco F. Bernier-Villamor V. Ruiz-Pérez L.M. González-Pacanowska D. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The structure of TcdUTPase revealed a dimeric all α-helical structure that is very distinct from the trimeric enzymes (18Harkiolaki M. Dodson E.J. Bernier-Villamor V. Turkenburg J.P. González-Pacanowska D. Wilson K.S. Structure. 2004; 12: 41-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), with which they share no sequence similarity. The dimeric dUTPases also have five sequence motifs responsible for forming the active site, but these are quite different from those in the trimeric dUTPases. The structure of the T. cruzi enzyme has been determined in the apo open form and in the closed form in complex with dUDP (18Harkiolaki M. Dodson E.J. Bernier-Villamor V. Turkenburg J.P. González-Pacanowska D. Wilson K.S. Structure. 2004; 12: 41-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These structures revealed a large conformational change in the protein upon substrate binding with the mobile domain moving as much as 20 Å with the concomitant rearrangement of secondary structure elements in this domain. Subsequently, a structure of the closed form of the dimeric dUTPase from Campylobacter jejuni (CjdUTPase) was determined in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable substrate analogue dUpNp (19Moroz O.V. Harkiolaki M. Galperin M.Y. Vagin A.A. González-Pacanowska D. Wilson K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1583-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This revealed the presence of three Mg2+ ions in the active site adjacent to the phosphate groups of the substrate. The metals were implicated in substrate binding and led to the proposal that these dimeric dUTPases utilize a mechanism of reaction similar to that used in the phosphoryl transfer reactions catalyzed by DNA polymerases (20Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 21Steitz T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 31-38Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Indeed, the dimeric enzyme, like the trimeric one, requires divalent metal ions for activity (17Camacho A. Hidalgo-Zarco F. Bernier-Villamor V. Ruiz-Pérez L.M. González-Pacanowska D. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).The essential nature of dUTPases and the marked differences between the two forms of the enzyme in different species make the dimeric dUTPases an attractive target for anti-parasitic drug development. With this in mind, we have undertaken a structural characterization of the L. major dUTPase in complex with various substrate fragments to better understand the substrate binding determinants and the requirements to induce closure of this family of enzymes. Here, we present crystal structures of the closed L. major dUTPase in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable substrate analogues α,β-imino-deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUpNpp) and α,β-imino-deoxyuridine diphosphate (dUpNp) and divalent metal ions supporting the proposed mechanism for these dimeric enzymes. Subsequent structures with deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) and deoxyuridine (dU) bound reveal a completely closed conformation with sulfate ions bound to the enzyme, showing the importance of the negatively charged 5′ region of the substrate to induce enzyme closure. We also present the structure of the CjdUTPase in complex with dUpNpp with important implications for the metal-binding properties of this family of enzymes.

The structure of TcdUTPase revealed a dimeric all α-helical structure that is very distinct from the trimeric enzymes (18Harkiolaki M. Dodson E.J. Bernier-Villamor V. Turkenburg J.P. González-Pacanowska D. Wilson K.S. Structure. 2004; 12: 41-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), with which they share no sequence similarity. The dimeric dUTPases also have five sequence motifs responsible for forming the active site, but these are quite different from those in the trimeric dUTPases. The structure of the T. cruzi enzyme has been determined in the apo open form and in the closed form in complex with dUDP (18Harkiolaki M. Dodson E.J. Bernier-Villamor V. Turkenburg J.P. González-Pacanowska D. Wilson K.S. Structure. 2004; 12: 41-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These structures revealed a large conformational change in the protein upon substrate binding with the mobile domain moving as much as 20 Å with the concomitant rearrangement of secondary structure elements in this domain. Subsequently, a structure of the closed form of the dimeric dUTPase from Campylobacter jejuni (CjdUTPase) was determined in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable substrate analogue dUpNp (19Moroz O.V.

This revealed the presence of three Mg2+ ions in the active site adjacent to the phosphate groups of the substrate. The metals were implicated in substrate binding and led to the proposal that these dimeric dUTPases utilize a mechanism of reaction similar to that used in the phosphoryl transfer reactions catalyzed by DNA polymerases (20Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 21Steitz T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 31-38Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Indeed, the dimeric enzyme, like the trimeric one, requires divalent metal ions for activity (17Camacho A. Hidalgo-Zarco F. Bernier-Villamor V. Ruiz-Pérez L.M. González-Pacanowska D. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).The essential nature of dUTPases and the marked differences between the two forms of the enzyme in different species make the dimeric dUTPases an attractive target for anti-parasitic drug development. With this in mind, we have undertaken a structural characterization of the L. major dUTPase in complex with various substrate fragments to better understand the substrate binding determinants and the requirements to induce closure of this family of enzymes. Here, we present crystal structures of the closed L. major dUTPase in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable substrate analogues α,β-imino-deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUpNpp) and α,β-imino-deoxyuridine diphosphate (dUpNp) and divalent metal ions supporting the proposed mechanism for these dimeric enzymes. Subsequent structures with deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) and deoxyuridine (dU) bound reveal a completely closed conformation with sulfate ions bound to the enzyme, showing the importance of the negatively charged 5′ region of the substrate to induce enzyme closure. We also present the structure of the CjdUTPase in complex with dUpNpp with important implications for the metal-binding properties of this family of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2120256365,"The cellular interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF-4), which is a member of IRF family, is involved in the development of multiple myeloma and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-mediated transformation of B lymphocytes. However, the molecular mechanism of IRF-4 in cellular transformation is unknown. We have found that knockdown of IRF-4 leads to high expression of IRF-5, a pro-apoptotic member in the IRF family. Overexpression of IRF-4 represses IRF-5 expression. Reduction of IRF-4 leads to growth inhibition, and the restoration of IRF-4 by exogenous plasmids correlates with the growth recovery and reduces IRF-5 expression. In addition, IRF-4 negatively regulates IRF-5 promoter reporter activities and binds to IRF-5 promoters in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of IRF-5 rescues IRF-4 knockdown-mediated growth inhibition, and IRF-5 overexpression alone is sufficient to induce cellular growth inhibition of EBV-transformed cells. Therefore, IRF-5 is one of the targets of IRF-4, and IRF-4 regulates the growth of EBV-transformed cells partially through IRF-5. This work provides insight on how IRFs interact with one another to participate in viral pathogenesis and transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2070767926,"The radical S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) enzyme superfamily is remarkable at catalyzing chemically diverse and complex reactions. We have previously shown that NosL, which is involved in forming the indole side ring of the thiopeptide nosiheptide, is a radical AdoMet enzyme that processes L-Trp to afford 3-methyl-2-indolic acid (MIA) via an unusual fragmentation-recombination mechanism. We now report the expansion of the MIA synthase family by characterization of NocL, which is involved in nocathiacin I biosynthesis. EPR and UV-visible absorbance spectroscopic analyses demonstrated the interaction between L-Trp and the [4Fe-4S] cluster of NocL, leading to the assumption of nonspecific interaction of [4Fe-4S] cluster with other nucleophiles via the unique Fe site. This notion is supported by the finding of the heterogeneity in the [4Fe-4S] cluster of NocL in the absence of AdoMet, which was revealed by the EPR study at very low temperature. Furthermore, a free radical was observed by EPR during the catalysis, which is in good agreement with the hypothesis of a glycyl radical intermediate. Combined with the mutational analysis, these studies provide new insights into the function of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of radical AdoMet enzymes as well as the mechanism of the radical-mediated complex carbon chain rearrangement catalyzed by MIA synthase."

https://openalex.org/W2032779534,"Alginate is a major cell wall polymer of brown algae. The precursor for the polymer is GDP-mannuronic acid, which is believed to be derived from a four-electron oxidation of GDP-mannose through the enzyme GDP-mannose dehydrogenase (GMD). So far no eukaryotic GMD has been biochemically characterized. We have identified a candidate gene in the Ectocarpus siliculosus genome and expressed it as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. The GMD from Ectocarpus differs strongly from related enzymes in bacteria and is as distant to the bacterial proteins as it is to the group of UDP-glucose dehydrogenases. It lacks the C-terminal ∼120 amino acid domain present in bacterial GMDs, which is believed to be involved in catalysis. The GMD from brown algae is highly active at alkaline pH and contains a catalytic Cys residue, sensitive to heavy metals. The product GDP-mannuronic acid was analyzed by HPLC and mass spectroscopy. The K(m) for GDP-mannose was 95 μM, and 86 μM for NAD(+). No substrate other than GDP-mannose was oxidized by the enzyme. In gel filtration experiments the enzyme behaved as a dimer. The Ectocarpus GMD is stimulated by salts even at low molar concentrations as a possible adaptation to marine life. It is rapidly inactivated at temperatures above 30 °C."
https://openalex.org/W2063536761,"Ca(2+) signaling plays an important role in B cell survival and activation and is dependent on Ca(2+) trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and on extracellular Ca(2+). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can immortalize B cells and contributes to lymphomagenesis. Previously, we showed that the ER Ca(2+) content of Burkitt lymphoma cell lines was increased following infection with immortalization-competent virus expressing the full set of EBV latency genes (B95-8). In contrast, infection with an immortalization-deficient virus (P3HR-1) not expressing LMP-1 is without effect. LMP-1 protein expression was sufficient to increase the ER Ca(2+) content and to increase the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)). In this follow-up study, we showed that the resting [Ca(2+)](cyt) of P3HR-1-infected cells was decreased, implying that EBV not only modified the ER homeostasis but also affected the cytosolic Ca(2+) homeostasis. Furthermore, even if the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) of these cells was normal, the [Ca(2+)](cyt) increase after thapsigargin + CaCl(2) stimulation was blunted. In contrast, the resting [Ca(2+)](cyt) of B95-8 infected cells was not changed, even if their SOCE was increased significantly. When expressed alone, LMP-1 induced an increase of the SOCE amplitude and the expression of the protein allowing this influx, Orai1, showing the effect of EBV on SOCE of B cells are mediated by LMP-1. However, other hitherto unidentified EBV processes, unmasked in P3HR-1 infected cells, counteract this LMP-1-dependent increase of SOCE amplitude to impair a general and potentially toxic increase of [Ca(2+)](i). Thus, EBV infection modifies the cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis by acting on the ER and plasma membrane transporters."

IN is one of three retrovirally encoded enzymes that are essential for retroviral replication and therefore is an important target for drugs to treat HIV/AIDS. One IN active site-directed inhibitor, raltegravir, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this purpose, and a second, elvitegravir, is in advanced clinical trials. The availability of such drugs offer hope to HIV-positive individuals, especially those who have developed resistance to therapies that target the other two viral enzymes, reverse transcriptase and protease. Nevertheless, the inevitable development of drug-resistant HIV mutants drives a continuing need for additional strategies to block the activity of this viral enzyme. Unfortunately, progress has been limited by a lack of critical details concerning the molecular structure of full-length HIV IN protein and its functional multimers. Much of the difficulty arises from the fact that the HIV protein is relatively insoluble and therefore difficult to study using biophysical methods. As retroviral INs are likely to share architectures for active complexes (1Jaskolski M. Alexandratos J.N. Bujacz G. Wlodawer A. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2926-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we have focused our studies on avian sarcoma virus (ASV) IN (2Katz R.A. Merkel G. Kulkosky J. Leis J. Skalka A.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), which is more soluble than HIV IN and, as we show here, suitable for structural analyses. IN proteins are composed of three distinct structural domains (Fig. 1, A and B). The largest (amino acids 50–207 in ASV IN) is the central catalytic core domain (CCD or “core”). This domain contains the DD(35)E motif of acidic residues that coordinate the required divalent metal ions, Mg2+ or Mn2+ (3Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A.

An IN dimer appears to be the most catalytically active form for the endonucleolytic processing of a single end viral DNA substrate in vitro (31Guiot E. Carayon K. Delelis O. Simon F. Tauc P.

However, as two processed DNA ends must be joined by IN to host DNA in a concerted fashion in vivo, a tetramer is assumed to be the minimal functional multimer for this step. Indeed, analysis of ASV IN-DNA complexes imaged by atomic force microscopy revealed that assembly of a tetramer is induced upon interaction with a “disintegration” substrate, which represents a viral-host DNA integration intermediate, and that four IN monomers are required for a single catalytic turnover with this substrate (32Bao K.K. Wang H. Miller J.K. Erie D.A. Skalka A.M. Wong I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1323-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Purification and analysis of covalently cross-linked multimers of HIV-1 IN showed that although a dimer could process and join a single viral DNA end substrate, only a tetramer was capable of catalyzing the concerted integration of two viral ends into a target DNA (33Faure A.

Analyses of in vitro assembled HIV IN synaptic complexes containing viral and target DNA substrates also indicate that concerted integration is catalyzed by an IN tetramer (34Li M. Mizuuchi M. Burke Jr., T.R. Craigie R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Models for IN dimers (Fig. 1C) and tetramers have been derived from consolidation of the crystal structures of two-domain protein fragments and other studies (13Yang Z.N. Mueser T.C. Bushman F.D. Hyde C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 35Gao K. Butler S.L. Bushman F.

However, their validity has been difficult to evaluate, as experimental knowledge has been lacking concerning the disposition of the three domains with respect to each other, in the intact full-length monomer or multimers. The crystal structure of full-length IN from the human prototype foamy virus (PFV) was recently solved in complex with viral DNA (38Hare S. Gupta S.S. Valkov E. Engelman A. Cherepanov P. Nature. 2010; 464: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) revealing two different dimer interfaces for IN within the “intasome” structures. Here, we report the use of small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and biochemical cross-linking analyses to determine the architecture of full-length ASV IN monomers and dimers, in the absence of DNA substrates. Our results show that the solution dimer interface is distinct from that previously proposed in models derived from two-domain crystal structures and more closely resembles that in the DNA-binding “inner” dimer in PFV intasome (38Hare S. Gupta S.S. Valkov E. Engelman A. Cherepanov P. Nature. 2010; 464: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 39Maertens G.N. Hare S. Cherepanov P. Nature. 2010; 468: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Analyses of the ASV apo-IN architecture described herein highlight key domain interactions and the specific conformational changes that may occur upon DNA substrate binding. Measurements were made with a Protein Solutions DynaPro temperature-controlled microsampler. Samples were adjusted to the desired concentration, and particulates were removed by filtration through a 0.2-μm Millipore filter and subsequent clearing by brief centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The protein concentration was then determined directly using absorbance at 280 nm and a calculated molar extinction coefficient, taking the average of three readings. All samples were analyzed under conditions of 10 °C in a buffer of 25 mm BisTris, pH 6.1, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol. The apparent molecular mass (MW-I) was calculated from the static light scattering measurements (at least 300 acquisitions per protein sample) using the DynaPro software. X-ray scattering experiments were performed at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratories, 5ID-D beamline. Data were collected at 10 keV (1.24 Å) with the SAXS detector at a distance of 2.584 m and simultaneous WAXS detector at 291 cm, which produced an accessible q range of 0.005 to 1.8 Å−1 (where q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). To minimize protein damage, four 10-s exposures were typically taken at 10 °C with sample flowing at 4 μl/s using a 0.3 × 0.3 mm2 collimated x-ray beam. Exactly matched dialysates were sampled under the same conditions to subtract from protein samples, which were tested in the range of 0.8–3 mg/ml in the same buffer conditions used for light scattering. Samples were filtered and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g just prior to placement in the sampler. Combining of SAXS and WAXS data and subsequent data reduction were as published previously (40Baker N.M. Weigand S. Maar-Mathias S. Mondragón A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although initial Rg estimates were made at APS by a linear fit of a typical Guinier plot in the q range of 0.5–1.2/Rg, subsequent data analysis using Irena software developed at APS (41Ilavsky J. Jemian P.R. J. Appl.

Goodness of fit was assessed with the reduced χ2 parameter. In all cases, equivalent results were obtained by regularization with the program GNOM (42Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (573) Google Scholar). A dilution series was performed with the wild type ASV IN protein and, using the ATSAS program PRIMUS (43Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar), these data were extrapolated to infinite dilution. The results (not included) showed no significant variation in Rg, confirming the absence of any concentration-dependent effects. Accordingly, our data analyses assume a single component ideal behavior under the concentrations tested. Subsequent ab initio shape modeling was performed with both DAMMIN and GASBOR programs (43Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar), with and without P2 symmetry when appropriate. In each case, several qmax cutoff values were sampled in the range of 0.3–0.9, with the standard final processing using a qmax of 0.4. These produced dummy atom output files that were then used to generate the final envelopes with the Situs software (44Wriggers W. Birmanns S. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To test for uniqueness, 10 shape reconstructions were performed with the program GASBOR for wild type ASV IN dimers and monomers (supplemental Fig. S1). The results showed a high degree of stability and convergence in the shape modeling for both monomer (normalized spatial discrepancies (NSDs) of 1.0 to 1.19) and dimer (NSDs of 1.0 to 1.34) envelopes, with ranges comparable with those reported in other SAXS analyses (45Gupta K. Diamond T. Hwang Y. Bushman F. Van Duyne G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20303-20315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A mixture of 1:1 unlabeled and isotopically labeled ASV IN proteins (6.5 μm each) was equilibrated overnight (46Kessl J.J. Eidahl J.O. Shkriabai N. Zhao Z. McKee C.J. Hess S. Burke Jr., T.R. Kvaratskhelia M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 824-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and dialyzed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol. Freshly prepared BS3 (Pierce) homo-bifunctional cross-linker was used at increasing concentrations. After addition of the cross-linker, the reaction was allowed to continue at 37 °C for 5 min and then quenched by addition of 20 μl of 2 m glycine and left on ice for 30 min. The reactants were precipitated with acetone and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol. The products were separated on a denaturing NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel using MES running buffer and Coomassie Blue stain. We confirmed that sample recovery was unaffected by acetone precipitation. Furthermore, treatment with a different reagent, EDC/NHS (Pierce), produced a similar distribution of cross-linked products (data not shown). Monomer, dimer, and tetramer bands from a reaction in which the molar ratio of protein to BS3 was 1:20 were excised and destained (50% MeOH, 5% HOAC in water) overnight, after which they were dehydrated completely using 100% acetonitrile. Reduction and alkylation were performed by adding 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and 50 mm iodoacetamide. After a second dehydration, gel bands were rehydrated at 4 °C for 45 min in trypsin solution (10 ng/μl, Promega sequencing grade modified trypsin, 10 mm NH4HCO3, 10% acetonitrile). Proteins were digested overnight at 34 °C. The digested samples were acidified with 0.3% formic acid before being injected into an LC/MS/MS instrument QSTAR (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Foster City, CA). An Agilent nano-HPLC (Agilent, Wilmington, DE) was equipped to interface the Q-TOF mass spectrometer. Samples were automatically loaded onto a C-18 trap column (ZORBAX 300SB-C18, 0.3 × 5 mm, 5 mm) and then eluted to a reversed-phase C-18 analytical column (ZORBAX 300SB-C18, 100 × 150 mm, 3.5 mm). A typical HPLC gradient for the tryptic mixture of peptides was 5–80% organic solvent over a period of about 85 min, followed by 80–100% organic solvent for the next 15 min and 100 to 5% in the last 15 min. The 300-nl/min flow from the column elution was sprayed through a coated emitter (FS360-50-5-CE, New Objective Inc., Woburn, CA) into a mass spectrometer with a set voltage of +2.5 kV. The system was equilibrated for 15 min at the end of the gradient. The acquisition method of QSTAR was set at a 2-s TOF-MS “survey” scan followed by three MS/MS scans (3s, 4s, and 5s, respectively). Parent ions with charge state of +2 and +3 or intensity above 15 counts were fragmented. The mass range for survey scan was 400–1000 atomic mass units and was 100–2000 atomic mass units for MS/MS scan. The MS wiff files were processed into MGF files using Mascot Distiller with default parameters. Data were searched with MassMatrix PC suite 1.1.3 program (47Xu H. Freitas M.A. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 1548-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and search parameters were as follows: MS accuracy, 10 ppm; MS/MS accuracy, 0.8 Da (at this level of search stringency, no peptide adducts were identified that are inconsistent with the reaching dimer); enzyme, trypsin; specificity, fully tryptic; allowed number of missed cleavages, four; fixed modifications, carbamidomethylation on cysteine. Further allowed variable modifications were K+8 for lysine; R+10 for arginine; oxidation of methionine, tryptophan, and histidine; deamidation of asparagine and glutamine. End products of BS3 mono-cross-linked adducts with lysine and N termini were allowed with water or glycine. Results of the cross-linked peptides were also manually validated using GPAMW program (48Hojrup P. Hedin A. General Protein Mass Analysis (GPMA), a Convenient Program in Studies of Proteins by Mass Analysis. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1990: 61-66Google Scholar). Static light scattering provided a direct measure of the MW-I of our proteins and protein complexes in solution. The molecular uniformity of these preparations in the concentration range appropriate for SAXS analysis, 1–4 mg/ml (32–128 μm), was also evaluated by use of dynamic light scattering. As summarized in Table 1, we obtained an MW-I of 69 kDa for wild type IN, only in slight excess of the calculated mass of a dimer, 64 kDa. This difference could reflect the presence of a minor amount of higher order multimers in the preparation. However, the values calculated from static light scattering can also differ somewhat from the theoretical because of the dynamic exchange of subunits in multimeric complexes (46Kessl J.J. Eidahl J.O. Shkriabai N. Zhao Z. McKee C.J. Hess S. Burke Jr., T.R. Kvaratskhelia M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 824-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity assays confirmed that this wild type protein preparation catalyzes single end cutting and joining of viral DNA as well as concerted integration (Table 1). Among the other ASV IN derivatives prepared and analyzed, several contain an F199K substitution (Fig. 1, B and C). Structural alignments show that residue Phe-199 in ASV IN is adjacent to that of Phe-185 in HIV-1 IN (1Jaskolski M. Alexandratos J.N. Bujacz G. Wlodawer A. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2926-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and as with HIV, its replacement enhances protein solubility, a feature that was required for successful crystallization of the respective two-domain IN fragments of ASV and HIV-1 IN. To examine the effects of this substitution on ASV IN multimerization, we analyzed full-length derivatives containing the F199K substitution alone, or in combination with other substitutions. The MW-I values observed, 71 and 72 kDa, were not appreciably different from the value for wild type IN, indicating that these preparations also contained primarily dimers under the conditions tested. These results are noteworthy, as Phe-199 lies at the core-core interface in crystals of the isolated core domain or the core + CTD of ASV IN, and substitution of this large hydrophobic side chain is predicted to reduce the stability of this interface, as illustrated with HIV-1 IN (49Al-Mawsawi L.Q. Hombrouck A. Dayam R. Debyser Z. Neamati N. Virology. 2008; 377: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although our data (Table 1) show that the F199K substitution in full-length ASV IN does not compromise either dimerization or single end cutting and joining of viral DNA, a role in formation of higher order IN complexes (i.e. a tetramer) is likely, as the F199K derivative is unable to catalyze concerted integration.TABLE 1Light scattering and activity summaryProteinConcentrationMW-IaApparent molecular mass was determined by static light scattering.

Open table in a new tab The importance of the ASV CTD for IN multimerization is illustrated by comparison of the molecular mass of IN fragments in which either the NTD or CTD is absent. The MW-I of ASV IN(49–286), which lacks the NTD, is 54 kDa, exactly twice the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence of a respective monomer, 27 kDa. In contrast, under comparable conditions the MW-I of the ASV IN(1–207), which lacks the CTD, is 28 kDa, a value close to the calculated monomer mass of 23 kDa. These light scattering data are consistent with previously published results from size exclusion chromatography of these same IN fragments (50Andrake M.D. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29299-29306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). SAXS analyses provide a rotationally averaged version of the scattering of a single particle, from which size and shape can be determined. Certain features can be established unambiguously, i.e. the radius of gyration (Rg) and the longest dimension of the particle (Dmax). As verification of our methods, we performed SAXS on a preparation of the two-domain fragment lacking the NTD, ASV IN(49–286) F199K, and we compared the results with the shape and size determined from the published crystal structure of the same fragment (13Yang Z.N. Mueser T.C. Bushman F.D. Hyde C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the light scattering data and the P(r) function for this fragment from which we determined the Dmax to be 75 Å, close to the maximum of 81 Å calculated from the coordinates of the crystal structure. A low resolution shape of the dimer was derived from the SAXS data (51Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Computational methods were used in reverse to calculate the expected scattering and P(r) function from the published atomic coordinates of the dimer. As shown in Fig. 2, these results were nearly super-imposable on the experimental data, and the SAXS-derived envelope was found to accommodate the atomic model of the crystal dimer neatly within its borders (Fig. 2B, right). SAXS was then applied to the full-length wild type ASV IN protein, which is a homogeneous dimer at the relevant concentrations (Table 1). From the results in Fig. 3A, a Dmax of 109.4 Å was established for this dimer. Fig. 3B shows a plot of the scattering intensity (I(q)) versus Q2 (a “Guinier plot”) for this protein; an Rg of ∼32.8 Å was calculated from the slope of a linear fit of these data in the Q·Rg <1.2 region. A similar value (Rg = 33.1 ± 0.6 Å) was obtained from a nonlinear regression fitting (41Ilavsky J. Jemian P.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2009; 42: 347-353Crossref Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). The linearity of the data at low angles verifies that the preparation was free of aggregates. A SAXs-derived envelope for the ASV IN dimer is shown in Fig. 3C (see also supplemental Fig. S1A).

https://openalex.org/W2032451415,"Ratiometric measurements with FRET-based biosensors in living cells using a single fluorescence excitation wavelength are often affected by a significant ion sensitivity and the aggregation behavior of the FRET pair. This is an important problem for quantitative approaches. Here we report on the influence of physiological ion concentration changes on quantitative ratiometric measurements by comparing different FRET pairs for a cAMP-detecting biosensor. We exchanged the enhanced CFP/enhanced YFP FRET pair of an established Epac1-based biosensor by the fluorophores mCerulean/mCitrine. In the case of enhanced CFP/enhanced YFP, we showed that changes in proton, and (to a lesser extent) chloride ion concentrations result in incorrect ratiometric FRET signals, which may exceed the dynamic range of the biosensor. Calcium ions have no direct, but an indirect pH-driven effect by mobilizing protons. These ion dependences were greatly eliminated when mCerulean/mCitrine fluorophores were used. For such advanced FRET pairs the biosensor is less sensitive to changes in ion concentration and allows consistent cAMP concentration measurements under different physiological conditions, as occur in metabolically active cells. In addition, we verified that the described FRET pair exchange increased the dynamic range of the FRET efficiency response. The time window for stable experimental conditions was also prolonged by a faster biosensor expression rate in transfected cells and a greatly reduced tendency to aggregate, which reduces cytotoxicity. These properties were verified in functional tests in single cells co-expressing the biosensor and the 5-HT1A receptor.

Several constructs of fluorescent proteins have been developed to measure cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration ([cAMP]) in living cells (1Salonikidis P.S. Zeug A. Kobe F. Ponimaskin E.

The binding of cAMP to the biosensors leads to a conformational change, which alters the relative distance and/or orientation between the FRET pair, thus changing the efficiency of energy transfer and donor and acceptor fluorescence emission. For such biosensors with fixed donor-acceptor stoichiometry, common ratiometric fluorescence measurements can be performed to identify changes in FRET. These changes can be calibrated with reference ligand solutions using a single fluorescence excitation wavelength (e.g. see Ref. 8Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). In contrast to multi-excitation wavelength approaches like the EfDA/γ analysis (1Salonikidis P.S. Zeug A. Kobe F.

Ratiometric analysis also gives a better signal-to-noise ratio than the more complex approaches (11Woehler A. Wlodarczyk J. Neher E. Biophys.

Day R.N. Piston D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 837-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) might be critical when ratiometric cAMP measurements are performed with single-channel fluorescence excitation, as demonstrated in a previous work (1Salonikidis P.S. Zeug A. Kobe F. Ponimaskin E. Richter D.W. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 5412-5423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Such ratiometric FRET analysis of the intensity ratio between eCFP and eYFP emission of the Epac1 biosensor CFP-Epac(δDEP-CD)–YFP (Ponsioen et al. (7Ponsioen B. Zhao J. Riedl J.

EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar)) is susceptible to eYFP fluorescence intensity changes whenever ion concentrations fluctuate (e.g. [Cl−] (13Jayaraman S. Haggie P. Wachter R.M. Remington S.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar)). Considering that ion concentrations change significantly during physiologically cellular activities (e.g. [H+] and [Cl−] change with normal synaptic interactions of neurons) (e.g. see Refs. 14Ballanyi K. Mückenhoff K. Bellingham M.C. Okada Y. Scheid P. Richter D.W. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar and 15Duebel J. Haverkamp S. Schleich W. Feng G. Augustine G.J. Kuner T. Euler T. Neuron. 2006; 49: 81-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), FRET signals can be affected by secondary effects and may not reliably monitor the real [cAMP]. The condition becomes worse under pathologic conditions, when ionic homeostasis is unbalanced, further falsifying [cAMP] readouts. During hypoxia, for example, intracellular pH decreases, and chloride ions accumulate within neurons, whereas calcium influx is increased or calcium is released from intracellular stores (16Müller M. Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Yao H. Haddad G.G. Cell Calcium. 2004; 36: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Exchange of the FRET pair had already been used to gain a higher FRET efficiency of the traditional cAMP biosensor (18van der Krogt G.N. Ogink J. Ponsioen B. Jalink K. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar); no special focus, however, was directed on ion sensitivity. Particularly for quantitative ratiometric FRET analysis in vivo, it seemed necessary, therefore, to exchange the conventional FRET pair eCFP/eYFP for other fluorophores that are less sensitive to changes in these ion concentrations. From a variety of improved CFP and YFP derivatives, we have chosen mCerulean and mCitrine, which are less sensitive to pH changes and show only insignificant halide sensitivity. mCitrine also has a much higher photostability as compared with eYFP and has an improved folding efficiency (19Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). mCerulean is a better FRET donor than eCFP when combined with mCitrine (20Rizzo M.A. Springer G.

Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Förster distance R0 of the mCerulean/mCitrine FRET pair is almost 10% larger than for eCFP/mCitrine as calculated by a 68% larger quantum yield of mCerulean. Another important advantage also is that the monomeric versions (22Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar) of Cerulean and Citrine show a much lower tendency to oligomerization as compared with the eCFP/eYFP pair, which may cause additional artifacts. enhanced cyan fluorescence protein serotonin receptor subtype 1A selective 5-HT1AR antagonist cAMP-detecting FRET biosensor CFP–Epac(δDEP-CD)–YFP cAMP-detecting FRET biosensor mCerulean–Epac(δDEP-CD)–mCitrine enhanced yellow fluorescence protein mouse neuroblastoma cell line monomeric CFP with S72A/Y145A/H148D/A206K point mutations monomeric YFP with Q69M/A206K point mutations 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt. Here, we report a reduced ion sensitivity (to pH and Cl− and indirectly also Ca2+) of quantitative radiometric measurements by exchanging the eCFP/eYFP FRET pair of the biosensor for mCerulean/mCitrine. In addition, we report an improvement of the biosensor aggregation behavior. Plasmids encoding mCerulean and mCitrine were obtained from Addgene, and their coding sequences were amplified by PCR, introducing recombinant recognition sites for restriction enzymes using the primers mCerulean-NotI-for (5′-GCGGCCGC aat ggt gag caa ggg cga gga g-3′), mCerulean-EcoRV-rev (5′-GATATC gag atc tga gtc cgg act tgt aca gct cgt cca tgc c-3′), mCitrine-NheI-for (5′-GCTAGC gag ctc atg gtg agc aag ggc gag gag-3′), and mCitrine-EcoRI-rev (5′-GAATTC ctt gta cag ctc gtc cat gcc-3′). Resultant PCR products were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pTarget (Promega), which served for positive controls in FRET measurements. mCerulean and mCitrine were isolated from the vectors with the restriction enzyme pairs NotI/EcoRV and NheI/EcoRI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into corresponding sites in the vector pcDNA3.1-CFP-Epac(δDEP-CD)–YFP (7Ponsioen B.

Mouse N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells from the American Type Culture collection (LGC Promochem, Wesel, Germany) were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Neuroblastoma cells were seeded at low density (1 × 106 cells) either in 60-mm dishes (for fluorescence spectroscopy measurements) or in 10-mm dishes, including glass coverslips on the bottom (for microscopic measurements). After 24 h, cells were transfected with appropriate vectors using Lipofectamine2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight and then used in the experiment. We had to avoid longer incubation periods, because EPAC* proteins aggregated, which impedes direct comparison with the biosensor CEPAC*. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared according to Dityatev et al. (24Dityatev A. Dityateva G. Schachner M. Neuron. 2000; 26: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Hippocampi from postnatal (P1 or P2) NMRI mice were isolated, and cells were dissociated with trypsin (6 mg/2 ml) and centrifuged (100 × g, 2 × 15 min, 4 °C,) and then were planted on 10-mm glass coverslips (cell density 700 cells/mm2) coated with 100 g/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 μg/ml laminin (Roche Applied Science). From the first day, cells were incubated in minimum essential Eagle's medium containing glucose (25.2 mm), transferrin (1.3 mm), insulin (25 μg/ml), Glutamax I (2 mm), gentamicin (0.5 μl/ml), and horse serum (0.1 ml/ml) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 4 days, primary cells were transfected with CEPAC* or EPAC* using an optimized protocol of 1 μg of DNA and 1 μl of Lipofectamine2000 per coverslip in 500 μl of serum-free medium. The transfection mix was removed after 1 h, and cells were incubated for the following days in Neurobasal-A medium containing l-glutamine (0.5 mm), basic fibroblast growth factor (125 ng/ml), B-27 supplement (20 μl/ml), penicillin/streptomycin (10 μl/ml), and cytosine arabinoside (5 μm) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. To change the intracellular pH (pHi) of N1E cells, we used a modified protocol described previously (25Flögel U. Willker W. Leibfritz D. NMR Biomed. 1994; 7: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), using extracellular buffer exchange with different pH values to affect intracellular conditions. Extracellular buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm sodium-d-glucose) was prepared with pH values ranging from pH 6.5 to pH 8.0 and given to the N1E cells, immediately producing a pHi shift from 7.05 to 7.4, respectively. Under normal culture conditions at an extracellular pH of 7.4, N1E neuroblastoma cells exhibit a pHi of 7.35. The pHi shift was verified by pH indicator dye SNARF-5F (Invitrogen), which was also used to calibrate the pH range. The experiments with cAMP biosensor transfected cells were performed in an upright fluorescent microscope, whereas the experiments with SNARF-5F were performed in a laser-scanning microscope with a spectral resolving emission unit in order to measure the full emission spectrum of SNARF-5F. N1E-115 cells co-transfected with 5-HT1AR and either cAMP biosensor were kept in an extracellular solution of 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm sodium-d-glucose (pH 7.4), and 100 nm forskolin. 5-HT1AR agonist and antagonist were applied by exchanging the standard bath solution for a solution containing or 1 μm serotonin or WAY 100635 (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively. Experiments were performed in an upright fluorescence microscope. To test the viability of cells transfected with either of the two constructs, the MTS cell proliferation assay (Promega) was used. Approximately 5 × 103 N1E cells were seeded into 96-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Transfection with a mock control, CEPAC*, or EPAC* was carried out with Lipofectamine2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 h, absorbance at 485 nm of triplicates of each transfection was measured in a SkanIt plate reader (Thermo Scientific). MTS is reduced by cells into a formazan product, and the quantity of formazan product as measured by the amount of absorbance is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. Normalized absorbance was plotted against time after transfection. Primary neurons transfected with the cAMP biosensors were kept in an extracellular solution of 128 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm sodium-d-glucose (pH 7.4). Dendritic spines could be captured using an inverse laser-scanning microscope. The sample preparation was obtained as described previously (1Salonikidis P.S. Zeug A. Kobe F. Ponimaskin E. Richter D.W. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 5412-5423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and only modifications are mentioned here. For [cAMP] measurements, transfected N1E-115 cells were suspended in a buffer and lysed by ultrasonic treatment (DIGITAL Sonifier S-450D, Branson (Danbury, CT)). The homogenate was centrifuged for 1.5 h at 16,000 × g and 4 °C to extract the cytosol. For [cAMP] measurements, the lysis buffer contained 140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.2. For measuring the pH dependence, the solution contained 140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.2. For measuring the Ca2+ dependence, a calcium-free lysis buffer was used containing 140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.2. Such lysate contained a free [Ca2+] below 10 nm as a starting condition for the calcium titration as proven by calcium measurements with Fluo-5 (Invitrogen) (data not shown). The nominal free [Ca2+] was changed by titrating a defined amount of calcium to the cuvette and was estimated by the Max Chelator Ca-Mg-ATP-EGTA Calculator version 1 (26Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 27Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12 (876-879): 870-874PubMed Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web). Addition of high calcium concentrations led to a pH change due to proton release from EGTA. Therefore, the pH in the cuvette was adjusted during each test. For measuring the Cl− dependence, a chloride-free lysis buffer was used, containing 140 mm K+, 5 mm Na+, 1 mm Mg2+, 147 MeSO3−, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.2. A basal [Cl−] in the cell lysate of about 200 μm Cl− was determined with a chloride-selective electrode (DC235, Mettler Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland). Spectroscopic measurements were performed as described previously (1Salonikidis P.S. Zeug A. Kobe F. Ponimaskin E. Richter D.W. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 5412-5423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with a Fluorolog-322 (Horiba Jovbin Yvon, Munich, Germany). A donor excitation wavelength of 420/2 nm was chosen. A second excitation wavelength of 500/2 nm was necessary to apply the formalism of Equation 2. Reference emission spectra (FDref(λ) and FAref(λ)) of the donor and acceptor fluorophores used for the unmixing procedure (see Equation 1) were obtained at 420/2 nm excitation from cells transfected with donor or acceptor only. To estimate the spectral contributions of light scattering and autofluorescence of cells as an additional background component, reference spectra of pcDNA-transfected cells were used. A glass coverslip carrying the biosensor transfected or loaded N1E-115 cells or primary neurons was positioned in a perfused bath chamber of a microscope. Cells were perfused with an appropriate bath solution at room temperature. For sequential measurements with different solutions, total solution exchanges in the chamber were performed in a time range of 1 min. We used an upright epifluorescence microscope equipped with a water immersion objective (XLUMPlanFI, ×20, numerical aperture 0.95, Olympus, Germany). A 100-watt xenon lamp attached to a monochromator (Optoscan, Kinetic Imaging) served as an excitation light source and was coupled to the microscope via fiber optics. Emission intensities were measured at two excitation wavelengths using 420/10 nm (λ1) and 500/10 nm (λ2), frequently called donor and acceptor excitation, respectively. Fluorescence emission was separated from the excitation light by a dichroic mirror (505 nm). Using a DualView (Optical Insights, Tucson, AZ), the fluorescence emission signal was split by a dichroic mirror (515 nm) for the donor channel at 470/30 nm and the acceptor channel at 535/30 nm. This allowed us to acquire three images with an iXon camera DV887DCS (Andor Technology, South Windsor, CT): (a) the “donor image” at donor excitation and donor emission wavelength; (b) the “FRET image” at donor excitation and acceptor emission wavelength; (c) the “acceptor image” at acceptor excitation and acceptor emission wavelength. Due to the DualView, the donor image and the “FRET image” were obtained simultaneously, which required only two exposures. Exposure times (of about 3 s) were chosen according to the fluorescence intensity of the cells and were equal for all image series of an individual experiment. Special care was taken that bleaching can be ignored. For capturing dendritic spines and for recording intracellular pH in single cells with SNARF-5F, we used a confocal laser-scanning microscope LSM 510 META from Zeiss (Göttingen, Germany). CEPAC* in spines was observed at 458 nm excitation, and a bright emission bandwidth was observed from 464 to 603 nm using a C-Apochromat × 63/1.2 W corrected objective. For the pHi recording, the emission spectrum (562–646 nm) of SNARF-5F was detected by using the META DETECTOR with a resolution of 8 points (10 nm bandwidth) at an excitation of 543 nm and a Plan-Neofluar × 40/1.3 oil objective. Single images were taken with a wide field microscope at various times after transfection to measure protein aggregation seen as “granules” with the ImageJ software version 1.41 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Protein aggregation was determined in each cell using a line scan through the entire cells, excluding obvious organelle structures, such as the nucleus. This line scan represents the fluorescence intensity at any given pixel. Calculating the S.D. value for each given fluorescence intensity plot gave a measure of the granularity of the cell because the line profile did not vary greatly in cells showing a uniform fluorophore expression, whereas in cells showing aggregates, the line profile changed between regions with high and low fluorescence. For the different time points, at minimum, six cells were analyzed, and the mean granularity (as the sum of S.D. values from different scans) was plotted over time after transfection. To image a single primary cell, multiple images were taken and stitched together using the ImageJ plugin MosaicJ (28Thévenaz P. Unser M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2007; 70: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Neurite length was then measured on the reconstructed image using the ImageJ plugin NeuronJ (29Meijering E. Jacob M. Sarria J.C. Steiner P. Hirling H. Unser M. Cytometry A. 2004; 58: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Captured z-stacks of dendritic spine pictures were projected on a single picture by using the maximal z-projection of the ImageJ software version 1.41. We calibrated the [cAMP] sensitivity of CEPAC* and EPAC* by the “sensitized emission” FRET signal using a fluorescence spectrometer (1Salonikidis P.S. Zeug A. Kobe F. Ponimaskin E. Richter D.W. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 5412-5423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as described previously. Spectra were obtained at two excitation wavelengths (λi): at donor excitation wavelength (λ1), where mainly the donor is excited, and at the acceptor excitation wavelength (λ2), where the donor must not be excited (9Hoppe A. Christensen K. Swanson J.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3652-3664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). For each excitation wavelength, the CEPAC* as well as the EPAC* fluorescence signals Fi(λ) were fitted with a linear combination of the donor D and acceptor A reference spectra.Fi(λ)=[Di]FDref(λ)+[Ai]FAref(λ)Eq. 1 The apparent donor concentration, [Di], and the apparent acceptor concentration, [Ai], were used as fitting factors. The donor FDRef and the acceptor FARef reference spectra for both excitation wavelengths λi were obtained in a reference measurement of cells containing only donor and acceptor, respectively. The apparent acceptor concentrations [Ai] at both excitation wavelengths were used to calculate the following term,EfDA/γ=[A1]-α[A2]α[A2]Eq. 2 where α represents the relative acceptor emission intensity ratio used for the two excitations obtained in a separate experiment using an “acceptor only” sample, γ is the relative acceptor/donor extinction ratio, and fDA is the fraction of biosensor proteins in FRET state. For calibration of the FRET biosensors CEPAC* and EPAC*, the cAMP dependence of EfDA/γ was fitted by an adapted Hill equation,EfDA/γ=(pmax-p0)⋅[cAMP]nH(EC50)nH-[cAMP]nH+poEq. 3 where nH is the Hill coefficient, indicating the amount of cAMP-binding places; po and pmax are offset and maximum amplitude parameters, respectively; and EC50 is [cAMP] when 50% of the cAMP binding sites are occupied. Also the cAMP dependence of the acceptor/donor ratio as well as the ion dependences were fitted by a similar Hill equation. The apparent FRET efficiency (EfDA) was calculated from the donor fluorescence signal in quenched (FD,FRET) and non-quenched (FD,NON-FRET) state (30Lakowicz R.J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Springer, New York2006: 443-476Crossref Google Scholar).EfDA=1-FD,FRETFD,NON-FRETEq. 4 [cAMP] calibration curves of both biosensors were measured to ensure similar binding properties and to compare the dynamic range of the FRET signals. We exposed cell lysates from CEPAC* or EPAC*-transfected cells to various [cAMP] values, ranging from nominal 0 to 1 mm, and measured the biosensor FRET signal acceptor/donor ratio or EfDA/γ as a function of [cAMP]. Fluorescence spectra were recorded, as described previously (1Salonikidis P.S. Zeug A. Kobe F. Ponimaskin E. Richter D.W. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 5412-5423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the contributions of the donor and acceptor reference spectra were calculated as shown in Fig. 1, A and B. Both biosensors revealed a similar behavior regarding the contribution of reference spectra; the donor emission signal was decreased, and the acceptor emission signal increased with a rise of [cAMP], as expected for FRET changes. During donor excitation, photon counts for the donor and acceptor component of CEPAC* reached similar values in contrast to EPAC*, which is beneficial for the signal/noise ratio of the ratiometric FRET analysis. For both biosensors, we compared the FRET signal acceptor/donor channel ratio as the ratio between the acceptor and donor intensities (here at 420 nm excitation; Fig. 1, C and D). The intensities of the acceptor and donor channels were corrected for spectral bleed-through and background, whereas the channel bandwidth was adapted to that used in the microscope. Due to the higher energy transfer efficiency of the FRET pair mCerulean/mCitrine compared with eCFP/eYFP, the [cAMP] calibration curves of the acceptor/donor channel ratio of CEPAC* started at a higher value (0.94 ± 0.03) than for EPAC* (0.43 ± 0.005). For maximal [cAMP], the acceptor/donor channel ratio dropped to approximately half in both biosensors (to 0.53 ± 0.06 for CEPAC* and 0.23 ± 0.01 for EPAC*), indicating a similar dynamic range of the acceptor/donor channel ratio. The calibration curves were fitted by the Hill equation (Equation 3) to compare the binding affinity of cAMP to the biosensors. Both biosensors exhibited a Hill coefficient for the binding of cAMP of about 1 (nH for CEPAC* = 1.13 ± 0.6; nH for EPAC* = 0.96 ± 0.18). The range of [cAMP] sensing was also comparable, as seen in similar EC50 values for CEPAC* and EPAC* (23.6 ± 12.2 and 30.8 ± 6.9 μm)"
https://openalex.org/W2011963149,"The spindle pole body of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as a model system for understanding microtubule organizing centers, yet very little is known about the molecular structure of its components. We report here the structure of the C-terminal domain of the core component Cnm67 at 2.3 Å resolution. The structure determination was aided by a novel approach to crystallization of proteins containing coiled-coils that utilizes globular domains to stabilize the coiled-coils. This enhances their solubility in Escherichia coli and improves their crystallization. The Cnm67 C-terminal domain (residues Asn-429-Lys-581) exhibits a previously unseen dimeric, interdigitated, all α-helical fold. In vivo studies demonstrate that this domain alone is able to localize to the spindle pole body. In addition, the structure reveals a large functionally indispensable positively charged surface patch that is implicated in spindle pole body localization. Finally, the C-terminal eight residues are disordered but are critical for protein folding and structural stability."

However, beneficial effects on central nervous system manifestations are very limited because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents the transfer of enzyme from the circulation to the brain parenchyma. Preclinical studies in mouse models of metachromatic leukodystrophy, however, showed that arylsulfatase A (ASA) is able to cross the BBB to some extent, thus reducing lysosomal storage in brain microglial cells. The present study aims to investigate the routing of ASA across the BBB and to improve the transfer in vitro using a well established cell culture model consisting of primary porcine brain capillary endothelial cells cultured on Transwell filter inserts. Passive apical-to-basolateral ASA transfer was observed, which was not saturable up to high ASA concentrations. No active transport could be determined. The passive transendothelial transfer was, however, charge-dependent as reduced concentrations of negatively charged monosaccharides in the N-glycans of ASA or the addition of polycations increased basolateral ASA levels. Adsorptive transcytosis is therefore considered to be the major transport pathway. Partial inhibition of the transcellular ASA transfer by mannose 6-phosphate indicated a second route depending on the insulin-like growth factor II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor, MPR300. We conclude that cationization of ASA and an increase of the mannose 6-phosphate content of the enzyme may promote blood-to-brain transfer of ASA, thus leading to an improved therapeutic efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy behind the BBB.

https://openalex.org/W2041775238,"Transcription of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mitochondrial (mt) genome is catalyzed by nuclear-encoded proteins that include the core RNA polymerase (RNAP) subunit Rpo41 and the transcription factor Mtf1. Rpo41 is homologous to the single-subunit bacteriophage T7/T3 RNAP. Its ∼80-kDa C-terminal domain is highly conserved among mt RNAPs, but its ∼50-kDa N-terminal domain (NTD) is less conserved and not present in T7/T3 RNAP. To understand the role of the NTD, we have biochemically characterized a series of NTD deletion mutants of Rpo41. Our studies show that NTD regulates multiple steps of transcription initiation. Interestingly, NTD functions in an autoinhibitory manner during initiation, and its partial deletion increases the efficiency of RNA synthesis. Deletion of 1-270 amino acids (DN270) reduces abortive synthesis and increases full-length to abortive RNA ratio relative to full-length (FL) Rpo41. A larger deletion of 1-380 amino acids (DN380), decreases RNA synthesis on duplex but not on premelted promoter. We show that DN380 is defective in promoter opening near the transcription start site. Most strikingly, both DN270 and DN380 catalyze highly processive RNA synthesis on the premelted promoter, and unlike the FL Rpo41, the mutants are not inhibited by Mtf1. Both mutants show weaker interactions with Mtf1, which explains many of our results, and particularly the ability of the mutants to efficiently transition from initiation to elongation. We propose that in vivo the accessory proteins that bind NTD may modulate interactions of Rpo41 with the promoter/Mtf1 to activate and allow timely release from Mtf1 for transition into elongation."

IntroductionType IV secretion systems (T4SSs) 3The abbreviations used are: T4SS, type IV secretion system; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering. translocate DNA and protein substrates across the cell envelope of bacteria to a wide number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic target cells (1Christie P.J.

Conjugative T4SSs are used by bacteria to mediate the transfer of DNA and proteins to conjugation recipient cells, resulting in the widespread transmission of antibiotic resistance genes among pathogenic bacteria (3Fischer W.

Rev. 2006; 30: 942-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and are essential for virulence and for plasmid transfer (12Berger B.R. Christie P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1723-1734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They contain consensus Walker A and B NTP binding motifs and have been suggested to energize substrate translocation across the T4SS (13Rabel C. Grahn A.M. Lurz R. Lanka E. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1045-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). VirB4 and VirB11 ATPases have been shown to influence the disposition of VirB2, the T4SS membrane-integrated pilin (14Kerr J.E. Christie P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 4923-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that TrwK, the VirB4 homologue in the R388 conjugative system, is able to hydrolyze ATP in the absence of potential substrates (8Arechaga I. Peña A. Zunzunegui S. del Carmen Fernández-Alonso M. Rivas G. de la Cruz F. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5472-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The ability to hydrolyze ATP by VirB4 proteins has been later confirmed for other TrwK homologues (15Durand E. Oomen C. Waksman G. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 2315-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (16Rangrez A.Y. Abajy M.Y. Keller W. Shouche Y. Grohmann E. BMC. Biochem. 2010; 11: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Little is known about the atomic structure of VirB4 proteins. Based on computer predictions using the atomic coordinates of the coupling protein TrwB of plasmid R388 as a template, a model of the C terminus (residues 426–787) of A. tumefaciens VirB4 was created (17Middleton R. Sjölander K. Krishnamurthy N. Foley J. Zambryski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1685-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This finding suggested the possibility that VirB4 subunits might assemble as higher order homohexamers and work as docking sites for substrate transport. TraB, the VirB4 homologue in the conjugative plasmid pKM101, also assembles in hexameric form in solution, although it is dimeric when extracted from the membranes (15Durand E. Oomen C. Waksman G. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 2315-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, structural studies by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) of the membrane-extracted dimeric form of TraB have provided insights into the size and form of this protein (18Durand E. Waksman G. Receveur-Brechot V. BMC. Struct. Biol. 2011; 11: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Here, we used a bioinformatic approach to generate a model of the C-half domain of TrwK_R388. Secondary structure predictions of TrwK and TrwB revealed the presence of three α-helices in the C terminus that are conserved in all VirB4 proteins but absent in TrwB. Therefore, we decided to generate truncated variants of TrwK where these α-helical structures were sequentially removed and their in vitro and in vivo properties were analyzed. Enzymatic analysis of these mutants revealed that removal of the C-terminal α-helices of TrwK induced a large increase in ATP turnover relative to wild-type TrwK. Interestingly, this ATPase increment could be specifically reverted upon addition of an exogenous peptide consisting of the amino acid residues Gly802-Val823 of the C terminus of TrwK. The results suggest that the C-terminal end of VirB4 proteins plays a key functional regulatory role in the biological activity of T4SS.DISCUSSIONIn a previous report we demonstrated that TrwK, a VirB4 homologue of the conjugative plasmid R388 was able to hydrolyze ATP (8Arechaga I. Peña A. Zunzunegui S. del Carmen Fernández-Alonso M. Rivas G. de la Cruz F. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5472-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), thus settling down an old debate on the ability of these proteins to perform such a task. These results were later confirmed in similar studies carried out with TraB, the VirB4 homologue of the conjugative plasmid pKM101 (32Durand E. Oomen C. Waksman G. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 2315-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and TraE of Aeromonas veronii (16Rangrez A.Y. Abajy M.Y. Keller W. Shouche Y. Grohmann E. BMC. Biochem. 2010; 11: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To gather further understanding of the role of ATP hydrolysis by VirB4 proteins in effector transport and/or pilus assembly, the study of its activity and regulation is essential. In the work presented here we have identified a region of TrwK that could be crucial in the regulation of its activity.A previous model of the C-half of A. tumefaciens VirB4 (17Middleton R. Sjölander K. Krishnamurthy N. Foley J. Zambryski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1685-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggested that these proteins assemble as hexamers much like VirD4 (26Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. Pérez-Luque R. González A. Cabezón E. de la Cruz F. Coll M. Nature. 2001; 409: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and VirB11 (33Yeo H.J. Savvides S.N. Herr A.B. Lanka E. Waksman G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1461-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, the oligomeric state in solution of TraB of pKM101, has been shown to be predominantly hexameric, although it is dimeric when extracted from membranes (15Durand E. Oomen C. Waksman G. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 2315-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The A. tumefaciens VirB4 model, obtained by a bioinformatic approach, was generated using the atomic structure of TrwB, the R388 ATPase involved in DNA transfer, as a template (26Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. Pérez-Luque R. González A. Cabezón E. de la Cruz F. Coll M. Nature. 2001; 409: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Here, we used a similar approach to create a model of the C-half of TrwK (residues 413–772). However, it was not possible to extend this model to the last 51 amino acid residues of TrwK since the template, TrwB, lacked this C-terminal region. Secondary structure predictions revealed that this C-terminal region, which is present in TrwK but absent in TrwB, consisted of three α-helices. These terminal α-helical structures seem to be a general feature in all VirB4 proteins.Sequential removal of the three α-helices of the C-terminal domain of TrwK resulted in mutant variants with ATP hydrolysis rates over 10 times higher than those obtained with wt TrwK. The remaining kinetic parameters (Km(app) and Hill coefficient) were not affected by these mutations suggesting that these deletions did not induce conformational changes in the nucleotide binding site. In contrast, these mutants were unable to complement the in vivo activity of TrwK in bacterial conjugation experiments, indicating that this C-terminal domain must play an essential role in conjugation. Interestingly, experiments where both wt TrwK and mutant variants were co-expressed within the donor cells, showed that expression of the mutants was not affecting the function of TrwK, suggesting that either these truncated variants are unable to associate with the wild-type protein or, if they do so, the absence of the C-terminal region in one monomer does not affect the activity of the putative heterohexamer.The results shown here suggest that the C-terminal domain of TrwK acts as an autoinhibitory region that prevents futile ATP hydrolysis in the resting state. Interaction with specific effectors and/or with other partners of the transport machinery would produce a conformational change in this C-terminal region, resulting in stimulation of ATP hydrolysis. Similar autoinhibitory mechanisms have been found in a large variety of proteins, including kinesin (34Seiler S. Kirchner J. Horn C. Kallipolitou A. Woehlke G. Schliwa M. Nat. Cell.

Moreover, in some of these cases, synthetic peptides consisting of amino acid sequences corresponding to the respective regulatory domains have been used to characterize the inhibitory mechanism of these proteins (41Reddy L.G.

Commun. 2006; 343: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In some other cases, ATPase inhibition is carried out by a peptide encoded by a different gene, so regulation is controlled externally. That is the case of mitochondrial F1-ATPase, which is inhibited by an α-helical peptide called IF1 (51Walker J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This inhibitor protein binds to the interface between the α- and β- subunits of F1-ATPase, thereby blocking rotary catalysis (52Cabezón E. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 53Gledhill J.R. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15671-15676Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interestingly, and in contrast to the mitochondrial enzyme, E. coli F1-ATPase inhibition is carried out by large conformational changes of the C-terminal domain of one of its components, the ϵ subunit (54Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J. Aggeler R. Wilce M.C. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), thus regulation is controlled internally without the need of encoding a specific external protein. Here, we show that the observed increase in ATP turnover upon removal of its C-terminal region is reverted upon exogenous addition of a synthetic peptide comprising the amino acid residues previously removed. It is enticing to speculate that the well characterized mechanism of inhibition of ATPase activity by IF1 is a general feature shared among a large family of hexameric ATPases (see supplemental Fig. S3).In summary, this work suggests a regulatory mechanism in Type IV secretion systems, based on modulation of the ATPase activity of VirB4, the largest and most conserved component of the translocation machinery. As discussed above, the auto-inhibitory mechanism of TrwK ATPase activity seems to be a general feature in a large variety of ATPases to prevent energy waste at a resting state. IntroductionType IV secretion systems (T4SSs) 3The abbreviations used are: T4SS, type IV secretion system; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering. translocate DNA and protein substrates across the cell envelope of bacteria to a wide number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic target cells (1Christie P.J. Atmakuri K. Krishnamoorthy V. Jakubowski S. Cascales E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 451-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 2Fronzes R. Christie P.J. Waksman G. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Conjugative T4SSs are used by bacteria to mediate the transfer of DNA and proteins to conjugation recipient cells, resulting in the widespread transmission of antibiotic resistance genes among pathogenic bacteria (3Fischer W. Haas R. Odenbreit S. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 292: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 4Waters V.L. Front Biosci. 1999; 4: D433-D456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other T4SSs are used by several plant and human pathogens, such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Helicobacter pylori, Bordetella pertusis, Brucella suis, etc., to deliver virulence-related effectors to eukaryotic target cells (5Covacci A. Telford J.L. Del Giudice G. Parsonnet J. Rappuoli R. Science. 1999; 284: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 6Burns D.L. Curr. Opin.

Three of these proteins, VirB11, VirB4, and VirD4, are ATPases that energize DNA and protein substrate transfer as well as pilus assembly (8Arechaga I. Peña A.

They contain consensus Walker A and B NTP binding motifs and have been suggested to energize substrate translocation across the T4SS (13Rabel C. Grahn A.M. Lurz R. Lanka E. J.

Recently, we demonstrated that TrwK, the VirB4 homologue in the R388 conjugative system, is able to hydrolyze ATP in the absence of potential substrates (8Arechaga I. Peña A.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5472-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), thus settling down an old debate on the ability of these proteins to perform such a task. These results were later confirmed in similar studies carried out with TraB, the VirB4 homologue of the conjugative plasmid pKM101 (32Durand E. Oomen C. Waksman G. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 2315-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and TraE of Aeromonas veronii (16Rangrez A.Y. Abajy M.Y. Keller W. Shouche Y. Grohmann E. BMC. Biochem. 2010; 11: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To gather further understanding of the role of ATP hydrolysis by VirB4 proteins in effector transport and/or pilus assembly, the study of its activity and regulation is essential. In the work presented here we have identified a region of TrwK that could be crucial in the regulation of its activity.A previous model of the C-half of A. tumefaciens VirB4 (17Middleton R. Sjölander K. Krishnamurthy N. Foley J. Zambryski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1685-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggested that these proteins assemble as hexamers much like VirD4 (26Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. Pérez-Luque R. González A. Cabezón E. de la Cruz F. Coll M. Nature. 2001; 409: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and VirB11 (33Yeo H.J. Savvides S.N. Herr A.B. Lanka E. Waksman G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1461-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, the oligomeric state in solution of TraB of pKM101, has been shown to be predominantly hexameric, although it is dimeric when extracted from membranes (15Durand E. Oomen C. Waksman G. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 2315-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The A. tumefaciens VirB4 model, obtained by a bioinformatic approach, was generated using the atomic structure of TrwB, the R388 ATPase involved in DNA transfer, as a template (26Gomis-Rüth F.X. Moncalián G. Pérez-Luque R. González A. Cabezón E. de la Cruz F. Coll M. Nature. 2001; 409: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Here, we used a similar approach to create a model of the C-half of TrwK (residues 413–772). However, it was not possible to extend this model to the last 51 amino acid residues of TrwK since the template, TrwB, lacked this C-terminal region. Secondary structure predictions revealed that this C-terminal region, which is present in TrwK but absent in TrwB, consisted of three α-helices. These terminal α-helical structures seem to be a general feature in all VirB4 proteins.Sequential removal of the three α-helices of the C-terminal domain of TrwK resulted in mutant variants with ATP hydrolysis rates over 10 times higher than those obtained with wt TrwK. The remaining kinetic parameters (Km(app) and Hill coefficient) were not affected by these mutations suggesting that these deletions did not induce conformational changes in the nucleotide binding site. In contrast, these mutants were unable to complement the in vivo activity of TrwK in bacterial conjugation experiments, indicating that this C-terminal domain must play an essential role in conjugation. Interestingly, experiments where both wt TrwK and mutant variants were co-expressed within the donor cells, showed that expression of the mutants was not affecting the function of TrwK, suggesting that either these truncated variants are unable to associate with the wild-type protein or, if they do so, the absence of the C-terminal region in one monomer does not affect the activity of the putative heterohexamer.The results shown here suggest that the C-terminal domain of TrwK acts as an autoinhibitory region that prevents futile ATP hydrolysis in the resting state. Interaction with specific effectors and/or with other partners of the transport machinery would produce a conformational change in this C-terminal region, resulting in stimulation of ATP hydrolysis. Similar autoinhibitory mechanisms have been found in a large variety of proteins, including kinesin (34Seiler S. Kirchner J. Horn C. Kallipolitou A. Woehlke G. Schliwa M. Nat. Cell.

Moreover, in some of these cases, synthetic peptides consisting of amino acid sequences corresponding to the respective regulatory domains have been used to characterize the inhibitory mechanism of these proteins (41Reddy L.G.

In some other cases, ATPase inhibition is carried out by a peptide encoded by a different gene, so regulation is controlled externally. That is the case of mitochondrial F1-ATPase, which is inhibited by an α-helical peptide called IF1 (51Walker J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This inhibitor protein binds to the interface between the α- and β- subunits of F1-ATPase, thereby blocking rotary catalysis (52Cabezón E. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 53Gledhill J.R. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15671-15676Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interestingly, and in contrast to the mitochondrial enzyme, E. coli F1-ATPase inhibition is carried out by large conformational changes of the C-terminal domain of one of its components, the ϵ subunit (54Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J. Aggeler R. Wilce M.C. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), thus regulation is controlled internally without the need of encoding a specific external protein. Here, we show that the observed increase in ATP turnover upon removal of its C-terminal region is reverted upon exogenous addition of a synthetic peptide comprising the amino acid residues previously removed. It is enticing to speculate that the well characterized mechanism of inhibition of ATPase activity by IF1 is a general feature shared among a large family of hexameric ATPases (see supplemental Fig. S3).In summary, this work suggests a regulatory mechanism in Type IV secretion systems, based on modulation of the ATPase activity of VirB4, the largest and most conserved component of the translocation machinery. As discussed above, the auto-inhibitory mechanism of TrwK ATPase activity seems to be a general feature in a large variety of ATPases to prevent energy waste at a resting state.

These regulators serve as mediators between environmental or endogenous signals and the transcriptional machinery governing mitochondrial biogenesis.

We investigated the effects of the S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine-NO donor, on the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular metabolic functions in FTC-133 and RO82 W-1 cells by measuring lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activities.

Mitochondrial proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation system are encoded by the nuclear as well as the mitochondrial genomes. The mitochondrial energy function requires coordination of the transcription of nuclear genes coding for the majority of oxidative phosphorylation subunits and the mitochondrial genes coding for 13 essential oxidative phosphorylation subunits. Several nucleus-encoded transcription factors, such as the nuclear respiratory factors (NRFs), 2The abbreviations used are: NRFnuclear respiratory factorERRestrogen-related receptorCREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinPRCPGC-1-related coactivatorCOXcytochrome c oxidaseCYT Ccytochrome cTFAMtranscription factor A, mitochondrialLDHlactate dehydrogenaseBAPTA/AM1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl esterCScitrate synthase[Ca2+]ccytosolic calcium concentrationSNAPS-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine. estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), and the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), are known to ensure this coordination. The transcriptional efficiency of these factors is controlled by coactivators from the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 (PGC-1) family (i.e. PGC-1α, PGC-1β, and the PGC-1-related coactivator (PRC)), which regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and function, depending on various environmental signals (1Scarpulla R.C. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 611-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). The founding member of the coactivator family, PGC-1α, has been identified through its role in adaptative thermogenesis (2Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). PGC-1α and PGC-1β are highly expressed in oxidative tissues, such as the heart, kidney, muscle, brown adipose tissue, and brain. In contrast, PRC, which is ubiquitously and rapidly expressed by serum induction in proliferating cells, is considered to be a regulator of cell growth (3Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3738-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). PGC-1α and PRC interact with NRF-1, ERRα, CREB, and transactivating promoters of target genes involved in mitochondrial respiration, such as cytochrome c (4Gleyzer N. Vercauteren K. Scarpulla R.C.

In the cross-talk between nucleus and mitochondria, retrograde signaling has been shown to be induced between mitochondria and nucleus in response to respiratory dysfunction. The events initiating this process are not clearly understood, but nitric oxide (NO) and calcium are suspected of mediating this retrograde cross-talk in mammals (7Butow R.A. Avadhani N.G. Mol.

NO has different effects on mitochondria, depending on the level and duration of its production. In various cell types, long term treatment with low levels of NO induces biogenesis of functional mitochondria through a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)/PGC-1α pathway (8Nisoli E. Clementi E. Paolucci C. Cozzi V. Tonello C. Sciorati C. Bracale R. Valerio A. Francolini M. Moncada S. Carruba M.O. Science. 2003; 299: 896-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 9Nisoli E. Falcone S. Tonello C. Cozzi V. Palomba L. Fiorani M. Pisconti A. Brunelli S. Cardile A. Francolini M. Cantoni O. Carruba M.O. Moncada S. Clementi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 16507-16512Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Moreover, compared with the case of wild-type animals, cold-induced mitochondrial biogenesis and oxygen consumption decreased in the brown adipose tissue of mice with a null mutation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase. We have demonstrated that NO also mediates mitochondrial biogenesis through the cGMP/PRC pathway in a model of mitochondrion-rich thyroid tumors (10Raharijaona M. Le Pennec S. Poirier J. Mirebeau-Prunier D. Rouxel C. Jacques C. Fontaine J.F. Malthiery Y. Houlgatte R. Savagner F. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7964Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that PRC and PGC-1α induce mitochondrial biogenesis when endothelial nitric-oxide synthase produces a chronic supply of NO at a low level. However, if this activity is acute, NO may bind to cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and reversibly inhibit mitochondrial chain respiration by competing with oxygen (11Cleeter M.W. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S. Schapira A.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 12Moncada S. Bolaños J.P. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1676-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Calcium may also modulate respiratory chain activity and mitochondrial biogenesis. However, the reported effects of calcium on mitochondrial biogenesis and function are contradictory and may depend on the cellular model used. Thus, in the bovine heart, the increase in Ca2+ concentration enhanced complex I and ATP synthase activities while reversing the allosteric cAMP inhibition of COX by modulating its phosphorylation status (13Bender E. Kadenbach B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Harris D.A. Das A.M. Biochem.

In contrast, in L6E9 myotubes and isolated rat brain mitochondria, the increase in Ca2+ concentration was found to inhibit COX activity (17Calderón-Cortés E. Cortés-Rojo C. Clemente-Guerrero M.

Interestingly, COX inhibition may depend on NO production by the Ca2+-activated mitochondrial NOS. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration by means of Ca2+ ionophores A23187 or ionomycin enhanced cytochrome c expression in muscle cells (18Freyssenet D. Irrcher I. Connor M.K. Di Carlo M. Hood D.A.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This was associated with an increase in NRF-dependent transcription activity and the overexpression of COX I, PGC-1α, and the transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM) (19Ojuka E.O. Jones T.E.

However, another study found no variation in the expression of nucleus-encoded COX subunits (COX IV, Vb, and VIc) and reported decreased expression in TFAM and mitochondrion-encoded COX subunits (COX II and III) (18Freyssenet D. Irrcher I. Connor M.K. Di Carlo M. Hood D.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C1053-C1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally, in mitochondrial DNA-depleted cells, mitochondrial biogenesis was stimulated by the increased concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ and CREB activation (22Arnould T. Vankoningsloo S. Renard P. Houbion A. Ninane N. Demazy C. Remacle J. Raes M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 23Mercy L. Pauw A. Payen L. Tejerina S. Houbion A. Demazy C. Raes M. Renard P. Arnould T. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5031-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have shown that the XTC.UC1, FTC-133, and RO82 W-1 follicular thyroid carcinoma cell lines differ in their metabolic status. In effect, the metabolism of XTC.UC1 and FTC-133 cells, particularly rich in mitochondria, is essentially oxidative; in contrast, the metabolism of RO82 W-1 cells, which are rather poor in mitochondria, is mainly glycolytic (24Mirebeau-Prunier D. Le Pennec S. Jacques C. Gueguen N. Poirier J. Malthiery Y. Savagner F. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, in XTC.UC1 cells, only the PRC coactivator is overexpressed, whereas in FTC-133 and RO82 W-1 cells, the ratio between the mRNA expressions of PRC and PGC-1α varies. Thus, in our investigation of the endogenous cellular pathways that might be involved in the fine regulation of mitochondrial function and biogenesis, we examined the effects of NO and calcium in FTC-133 and RO82 W-1 cells. We measured the expression levels of the PRC and PGC-1α coactivators as well as those of the main factors required for mitochondrial biogenesis and studied their effects on the respiratory chain function and cell metabolism by measuring COX and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities. In particular, we investigated the role of calcium in mitochondrial network remodeling in the RO82 W-1 glycolytic cell line. Two human follicular thyroid carcinoma cell lines cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 were used: FTC-133 and RO82 W-1 (Interlab Cell Line Collection, National Institute for Cancer Research, Genoa, Italy). FTC-133 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 (Jacques Boy, Reims, France), and RO82 W-1 cells were grown in a mixed 60:30 DMEM/F-12 plus endothelial basal medium (PAA, Pasching, Austria). Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Jacques Boy), 1% l-glutamine (Dominique Dutscher, Brumath, France), and an antibiotic mixture (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). To study the effects of NO, the two cell lines were treated once a day for 4 days with the nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP) (Merck Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) made up to a final concentration of 50 or 100 μm (corresponding to 50 and 100 nm equivalent NO during several h) in the selected medium or with equivalent volumes of DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) for the control cells. We verified that the 4.6-h half-life of SNAP was sufficient to increase nitrite production by 2.3-fold (50 μm) and 4.1-fold (100 μm) after 24 h of treatment. To control the mediating effect of NO/cGMP on PRC-related mitochondrial biogenesis, cells were pretreated with a 1 μm concentration of the protein kinase G inhibitor KT5823 (EMD, San Diego, CA) 30 min before 50 μm SNAP treatment during 96 h. To study the effects of calcium on mitochondrial biogenesis and function, RO82 W-1 cells were treated 5 h/day for 4 days with the calcium ionophore ionomycin (Merck Calbiochem) made up to a final concentration of 2 μm in the culture medium. We further used the cytosolic calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM) (Merck Calbiochem) made up to a final concentration of 2–8 μm, with a combination of ionomycin and BAPTA/AM or with equivalent volumes of DMSO for control cells. To avoid cell death due to the toxic effects of intracellular Ca2+ ion chelation, the BAPTA/AM concentration was adjusted to cell density in the flask for each day of treatment as follows: 2 μm the first day, 4 μm the second day, 6 μm the third day, and 8 μm the fourth day. Duplicate cell counts were made with a Z1 Coulter particle counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). To control the mediating effect of calcium on PRC-related mitochondrial biogenesis, cells were pretreated with a 10 μm concentration of the calcineurin inhibitor CN585 (EMD) during ionomycin and BAPTA/AM treatments. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The integrity of RNA was determined using a Bio-Analyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Reverse transcription was performed on 2 μg of RNA with the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech), following the manufacturer's recommendations. cDNA real-time quantifications were performed in a 96-well plate on a Chromo4 apparatus (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green I dye as a fluorescent signal (iQ SYBR Green Supermix, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression of eight selected genes (CREB1, cytochrome c (CYT C), ERRα, NRF-1, PGC-1α, PRC, SOD2, and UCP2) was measured to determine the impact of calcium and NO modulation on key factors controlling mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive oxygen species production. For RO82W-1 cells treated with ionomycin and BAPTA/AM, some of the most differentially expressed genes on microarray, such as DRP1, TEP1, CRYAB, FIS1, PDE1A, GREB1, TFAM, RINT1, and MFN2, were controlled by quantitative RT-PCR. The amount of cDNA for selected genes was normalized by the quantification of β2-microglobulin (B2M) or β-globin (for microarray confirmation) cDNA. Each sample was assayed in duplicate using the primers described in Table 1.TABLE 1Primer sequences used for real-time quantitative RT-PCRPrimerSequenceβ-GlobinForward5′-ACACAACTGTGTTCACTAGC-3′Reverse5′-CAACTTCATCCACGTTCACC-3′β2-microglobulinForward5′-TTGTCTTTCAGCAAGGACTG-3′Reverse5′-ATCTTGGGCTGTGACAAAGT-3′CREB1Forward5′-GTGTTACGTGGGGAGAGAA-3′Reverse5′-GGGCTAATGTGGCAATCTGT-3′CRYABForward5′-GTTGGAGTCTGATCTTTTCCC-3′Reverse5′-GATAGCACTACCTGGACTATT-3′CYT CForward5′-CCAGTGCCACACCGTTGAA-3′Reverse5′-TCCCCAGATGATGCCTTTGTT-3′DRP1Forward5′-GGAGCCAGCTAGATATTAACA-3′Reverse5′-GCTCTTCTAGACGTTTGATTTG-3′ERRαForward5′-AAGACAGCAGCCCCAGTGAA-3′Reverse5′-ACACCCAGCACCAGCACCT-3′FIS1Forward5′-GGAGGAACAGCGGGATTACGT-3′Reverse5′-CTTCATGGCCTTGTCAATGAGC-3′GREB1Forward5′-CCCGGGCAAGTCAGGGG-3′Reverse5′-GACTGCTCGGTGGATGTCAT-3′MFN2Forward5′-GAAGAACAGGTTCTGGACGTC-3′Reverse5′-CCTCATGGCCATCTGTGCCC-3′NRF-1Forward5′-TCAAAGGCATACAAAAGGTC-3′Reverse5′-TACTCTACAGGTCGGGGAAA-3′PDE1AForward5′-CTCAAAAGCCGAAACTTCTTC-3′Reverse5′-CGTCTTAGTGCATCAGCAATG-3′PGC-1αForward5′-GTTTCATTACCTACCGTTATAC-3′Reverse5′-GCCATCCCTCTGTCATCCTC-3′PRCForward5′-CACTGGTTGACCCTGTTCCT-3′Reverse5′-GTGTTTCAGGGCTTCTCTGC-3′RINT1Forward5′-CCACAGGCCACGCTGGCT-3′Reverse5′-GCATTGAGTCCATTTTTGAAG-3′SOD2Forward5′-GCTGCACCACAGCAAGCAGTCC-3′Reverse5′-CCAGCAACTCCCCTTTGGGT-3′TEP1Forward5′-GTTCCAGAGTCTACAGATATC-3′Reverse5′-GCCATCTTCTTTTCCTGAAG-3′TFAMForward5′-GTTGGAGGGAACTTCCTGA-3′Reverse5′-CCCTTAGCTTCTTGGAATCT-3′UCP2Forward5′-CCAGTGCGCGCTACAGTCA-3′Reverse5′-GTGGTGCTGCCTGCTAGGAG-3′ Open table in a new tab Dry cell pellets were mixed with a buffer containing 10 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were collected, and the protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic assay kit (Uptima, Interchim, Montluçon, France) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Samples containing 20 μg of total protein were applied to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and hybridized with either cytochrome c (Ab13575) or α-tubulin (Ab7291) antibodies at a dilution of 1:5000 (both from Abcam, Paris, France). Cytochrome c was chosen as validated target gene for direct regulation by PRC and PGC-1α coactivators (5Vercauteren K. Pasko R.A. Gleyzer N. Marino V.M. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7409-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation with primary antibodies, membranes were washed before incubation with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody, which was detected with a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). All of the assays were performed in triplicate. The activities of COX, citrate synthase (CS), and LDH were measured on cell lysates, at 37 °C, in a cell buffer (250 mm saccharose, 20 mm Tris, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) (50 μl/106 cells) using a Beckman U 640B spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter). COX activity was measured in a 100 mm KH2PO4 buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin using 15 μm reduced cytochrome c and 2.5 mm β-D dodecylmaltoside (25Rustin P. Munnich A. Rötig A. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The CS activity was measured in a reaction medium consisting of 0.15 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.5 mm oxaloacetic acid, 0.3 mm acetyl-CoA, and Triton X-100 (0.1%). The LDH activity was measured in a reaction medium consisting of 95 mm Tris, 10 mm pyruvate, and Triton X-100 (0.25%) using 300 μm NADH. Specific enzymatic activities were expressed in mIU (i.e. nmol of cytochrome c, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), NADH/min/mg protein, respectively). The cellular protein content was determined using the bicinchoninic assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. All of the reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich except for Tris and saccharose (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France). FTC-133 and RO82 W-1 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate to a density of 50,000 cells/well 15 h before the experiment and were grown in the selected medium. Cells were then loaded with 5 μm FURA-2/AM (Merck Calbiochem) and 0.1% pluronic acid F-127 (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 40 min in a PSS buffer (140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 330 μm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Hepes, 11.1 mm glucose, pH 7.4) with or without 2 mm CaCl2 (Redundant), supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (PSS/BSA). Cells were washed once with PSS/BSA and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 200 μl of PSS/BSA to allow the complete de-esterification of the dye. The buffer was then removed, and cells were loaded with 2 to 8 μm of BAPTA/AM at 37 °C for 40 min in PSS/BSA. Cells were washed once with PSS/BSA and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 200 μl of PSS/BSA. The buffer was then removed, and 90 μl of PSS/BSA were added to each well before kinetic measurement of fluorescence intensity at 37 °C using a Mithras LB940 spectrophotometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). For each well, the cell preparation was alternatively excited for 30 s at two wavelengths, 340 and 380 nm, and the fluorescence emission was detected at 510 nm with a counting time of 150 ms. The ionomycin solution was then injected to attain a final concentration of 2 μm/well, and the plate was shaken before measurement of fluorescence intensity at 510 nm for 160 s. The background was determined by measuring the fluorescence of a well loaded without FURA-2/AM and BAPTA/AM. The fluorescence intensity ratio, F340/F380, was used to evaluate variations in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c). cDNA preparations obtained from RO82 W-1 cells after treatments with ionomycin and BAPTA/AM were hybridized in duplicate on human 4 × 44,000 expression chips (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) after RNA amplification and cDNA labeling using Cy3/Cy5 dyes according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Slides were analyzed with the feature extraction software after scanning on the DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies). Data are available in the GEO data base (GSE 26237). The hierarchical gene clustering was computed on median gene-centered and log-transformed data using average linkage and uncentered correlation distances. Computations and visualization were performed using Cluster and TreeView software (26Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13268) Google Scholar). The Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) and Gene Set analysis were used to determine the statistical over represented and differentially expressed genes (27Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9802) Google Scholar). Gene ontology enrichments in gene lists were searched for by means of the GOMiner (28Zeeberg B.R. Feng W. Wang G. Wang M.D. Fojo A.T. Sunshine M. Narasimhan S. Kane D.W. Reinhold W.C. Lababidi S. Bussey K.J. Riss J. Barrett J.C. Weinstein J.N. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most abundant gene ontology terms, representing at least 5% of the genes in the lists, with p values lower than 0.05, were considered for interpretation. FTC-133 and RO82 W-1 cells were grown on coverslips and treated with either ionomycin (4 days at 2 μm) or BAPTA/AM (days 1–2, 2 μm; day 3, 4 μm; day 4, 6 μm). Mitochondrial staining was performed by incubating cells with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (100 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C, and endoplasmic reticulum staining was performed by incubating cells with ER-Tracker Green FM (1 μm) for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were subsequently washed twice in PBS and fixed for 15 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and nuclei were stained with 300 nm DAPI (Invitrogen). Cells were mounted with Vectorshield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed on a Zeiss LSM700 scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) equipped with a ×63 oil immersion objective. The 555-nm laser was used for excitation of MitoTracker Red, the 488-nm laser was used for ER-Tracker Green, and the 405-nm laser was used for DAPI. Image analysis was performed using Zeiss Zen-light 4.8 software. Data are represented as mean values ± S.D., with n representing the number of experiments. The statistical significance of the variations observed was assessed using the Mann-Whitney test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Significances of differential expression between microarray and quantitative RT-PCR results were assessed by the t test. All analyses were performed using StatView 5.0 (SAS Institute, Gary, NC). At 96 h of SNAP treatment, cell proliferation decreased by 41.5% (50 μm SNAP) or 74.0% (100 μm SNAP) in FTC-133 cells and by 56.0% (50 μm SNAP) or 80.9% (100 μm SNAP) in RO82 W-1 cells, compared with time 0 (Fig. 1A). We controlled that the decrease in cell proliferation was due to quiescence rather than to cell death. Thus, the inhibitory action of SNAP was similarly effective on cell proliferation in the oxidative and the glycolytic cell lines. To evaluate the effects of SNAP on mitochondrial function and glycolytic metabolism, we measured the enzymatic activities of mitochondrial complex IV (COX) and LDH (Fig. 1B). Whereas the inhibition of COX activity was proportional to SNAP concentration at 24 h in both cell lines, differences were observed at 96 h; with 100 μm SNAP, a toxic effect was observed in RO82 W-1 cells with complete inhibition of COX activity and enhancement of LDH activity. For FTC-133 cells, the inhibition of COX activity was proportional to the duration of treatment and the SNAP concentration, but the remaining COX activity was sufficient to maintain an oxidative metabolism with no increase of LDH activity. Conversely, the basal COX activity was very low in RO82 W-1 cells compared with FTC-133 cells (24Mirebeau-Prunier D. Le Pennec S. Jacques C. Gueguen N. Poirier J. Malthiery Y. Savagner F. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, 50 μm SNAP induced a greater decrease of COX activity at 96 h in FTC-133 cells, which mainly depend on oxidative phosphorylation to produce energy, compared with the glycolytic RO82 W-1 cells. The decrease in FTC-133 cell proliferation was proportional to that of COX activity, whereas the decrease in RO82 W-1 cell proliferation could not be exclusively attributed to changes in mitochondrial metabolism. To determine the role of the NO pathway in the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, we investigated the effects of SNAP on the transcriptional efficiency of several genes involved in mitochondrial function, transcriptional regulation, and coactivation (Fig. 2A). Because the 100 μm SNAP treatment led to a toxic effect at 96 h in RO82 W-1 cells, we explored the NO effect only for the 50 μm SNAP treatment. At 96 h of SNAP treatment, PRC expression was significantly higher in both cell lines compared with controls. However, this increase was greater in RO82 W-1 cells (108.5%) than in FTC-133 cells (48.0%). PGC-1α mRNA expression was also enhanced at 96 h of SNAP treatment but at a lower level than that of PRC: 72.8% in RO82 W-1 cells and 27.6% in FTC-133 cells. Among the transcription factors, CREB, NRF-1, and ERRα, known to be involved in either PGC-1α- or PRC-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis, NRF-1 and ERRα were overexpressed in RO82 W-1 cells at 96 h, whereas CREB and NRF-1 were overexpressed in FTC-133 cells. Interestingly, SNAP enhanced the mRNA expression of ERRα by 58.7% at 96 h only in RO82 W-1 cells in which the PRC/PGC-1α ratio as well as the induction of PRC were higher. The expression of cytochrome c, a marker of mitochondrial biogenesis, was exclusively increased in RO82 W-1 cells, by 89.2% for mRNA and by 1.38-fold for protein at 96 h of SNAP treatment (Fig. 2B). No change in cytochrome c expression was found in FTC-133 cells at the same time. Thus, in these thyroid cell lines, NO induced mitochondrial biogenesis more efficiently through the PRC than the PGC-1α coactivator pat"
https://openalex.org/W1971335946,"The exposure of the plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA) to the surrounding phospholipids was assessed by measuring the incorporation of the photoactivatable phosphatidylcholine analog [<sup>125</sup>I]TID-PC/16 to the protein. In the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> both calmodulin (CaM) and phosphatidic acid (PA) greatly decreased the incorporation of [<sup>125</sup>I]TID-PC/16 to PMCA. Proteolysis of PMCA with V8 protease results in three main fragments: N, which includes transmembrane segments M1 and M2; M, which includes M3 and M4; and C, which includes M5 to M10. CaM decreased the level of incorporation of [<sup>125</sup>I]TID-PC/16 to fragments M and C, whereas phosphatidic acid decreased the incorporation of [<sup>125</sup>I]TID-PC/16 to fragments N and M. This suggests that the conformational changes induced by binding of CaM or PA extend to the adjacent transmembrane domains. Interestingly, this result also denotes differences between the active conformations produced by CaM and PA. To verify this point, we measured resonance energy transfer between PMCA labeled with eosin isothiocyanate at the ATP-binding site and the phospholipid RhoPE included in PMCA micelles. CaM decreased the efficiency of the energy transfer between these two probes, whereas PA did not. This result indicates that activation by CaM increases the distance between the ATP-binding site and the membrane, but PA does not affect this distance. Our results disclose main differences between PMCA conformations induced by CaM or PA and show that those differences involve transmembrane regions."
https://openalex.org/W2068589010,"The avid binding of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) to matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is crucial for the regulation of pericellular and extracellular proteolysis. The interactions of the catalytic domain (cd) of MMP-1 with the inhibitory domains of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 (N-TIMPs) and MMP-3cd with N-TIMP-2 have been characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry and compared with published data for the N-TIMP-1/MMP-3cd interaction. All interactions are largely driven by increases in entropy but there are significant differences in the profiles for the interactions of both N-TIMPs with MMP-1cd as compared with MMP-3cd; the enthalpy change ranges from small for MMP-1cd to highly unfavorable for MMP-3cd (-0.1 ± 0.7 versus 6.0 ± 0.5 kcal mol(-1)). The heat capacity change (ΔC(p)) of binding to MMP-1cd (temperature dependence of ΔH) is large and negative (-210 ± 20 cal K(-1) mol(-1)), indicating a large hydrophobic contribution, whereas the ΔC(p) values for the binding to MMP-3cd are much smaller (-53 ± 3 cal K(-1) mol(-1)), and some of the entropy increase may arise from increased conformational entropy. Apart from differences in ionization effects, it appears that the properties of the MMP may have a predominant influence in the thermodynamic profiles for these N-TIMP/MMP interactions."
