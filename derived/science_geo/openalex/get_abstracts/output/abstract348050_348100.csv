https://openalex.org/W2031258910,"Understanding the complementary roles of surface energy and roughness on natural nonwetting surfaces has led to the development of a number of biomimetic superhydrophobic surfaces, which exhibit apparent contact angles with water greater than 150 degrees and low contact angle hysteresis. However, superoleophobic surfaces-those that display contact angles greater than 150 degrees with organic liquids having appreciably lower surface tensions than that of water-are extremely rare. Calculations suggest that creating such a surface would require a surface energy lower than that of any known material. We show how a third factor, re-entrant surface curvature, in conjunction with chemical composition and roughened texture, can be used to design surfaces that display extreme resistance to wetting from a number of liquids with low surface tension, including alkanes such as decane and octane."
https://openalex.org/W2104978512,"It has recently been demonstrated that mouse and human fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into an embryonic stem cell–like state by introducing combinations of four transcription factors. However, the therapeutic potential of such induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells remained undefined. By using a humanized sickle cell anemia mouse model, we show that mice can be rescued after transplantation with hematopoietic progenitors obtained in vitro from autologous iPS cells. This was achieved after correction of the human sickle hemoglobin allele by gene-specific targeting. Our results provide proof of principle for using transcription factor–induced reprogramming combined with gene and cell therapy for disease treatment in mice. The problems associated with using retroviruses and oncogenes for reprogramming need to be resolved before iPS cells can be considered for human therapy."

Although it was in principle scalable, the massive resource overhead made the scheme practically daunting. However, several simplifications were followed by proof-of-principle demonstrations, and recent approaches based on cluster states or error encoding have dramatically reduced this worrying resource overhead, making an all-optical architecture a serious contender for the ultimate goal of a large-scale quantum computer. Key challenges will be the realization of high-efficiency sources of indistinguishable single photons, low-loss, scalable optical circuits, high-efficiency single-photon detectors, and low-loss interfacing of these components."
https://openalex.org/W1965060558,"Alfvén waves have been invoked as a possible mechanism for the heating of the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, to millions of degrees and for the acceleration of the solar wind to hundreds of kilometers per second. However, Alfvén waves of sufficient strength have not been unambiguously observed in the solar atmosphere. We used images of high temporal and spatial resolution obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope onboard the Japanese Hinode satellite to reveal that the chromosphere, the region sandwiched between the solar surface and the corona, is permeated by Alfvén waves with strong amplitudes on the order of 10 to 25 kilometers per second and periods of 100 to 500 seconds. Estimates of the energy flux carried by these waves and comparisons with advanced radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations indicate that such Alfvén waves are energetic enough to accelerate the solar wind and possibly to heat the quiet corona."

https://openalex.org/W2061902128,"Abuse of the dissociative anesthetic ketamine can lead to a syndrome indistinguishable from schizophrenia. In animals, repetitive exposure to this N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor antagonist induces the dysfunction of a subset of cortical fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, with loss of expression of parvalbumin and the gamma-aminobutyric acid-producing enzyme GAD67. We show here that exposure of mice to ketamine induced a persistent increase in brain superoxide due to activation in neurons of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. Decreasing superoxide production prevented the effects of ketamine on inhibitory interneurons in the prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that NADPH oxidase may represent a novel target for the treatment of ketamine-induced psychosis."

https://openalex.org/W2136399909,"After amputation, freshwater planarians properly regenerate a head or tail from the resulting anterior or posterior wound. The mechanisms that differentiate anterior from posterior and direct the replacement of the appropriate missing body parts are unknown. We found that in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea , RNA interference (RNAi) of β -catenin or dishevelled causes the inappropriate regeneration of a head instead of a tail at posterior amputations. Conversely, RNAi of the β-catenin antagonist adenomatous polyposis coli results in the regeneration of a tail at anterior wounds. In addition, the silencing of β- catenin is sufficient to transform the tail of uncut adult animals into a head. We suggest that β-catenin functions as a molecular switch to specify and maintain anteroposterior identity during regeneration and homeostasis in planarians."
https://openalex.org/W2078358572,"Coronal magnetic fields are dynamic, and field lines may misalign, reassemble, and release energy by means of magnetic reconnection. Giant releases may generate solar flares and coronal mass ejections and, on a smaller scale, produce x-ray jets. Hinode observations of polar coronal holes reveal that x-ray jets have two distinct velocities: one near the Alfvén speed (∼800 kilometers per second) and another near the sound speed (200 kilometers per second). Many more jets were seen than have been reported previously; we detected an average of 10 events per hour up to these speeds, whereas previous observations documented only a handful per day with lower average speeds of 200 kilometers per second. The x-ray jets are about 2 × 10 3 to 2 × 10 4 kilometers wide and 1 × 10 5 kilometers long and last from 100 to 2500 seconds. The large number of events, coupled with the high velocities of the apparent outflows, indicates that the jets may contribute to the high-speed solar wind."
https://openalex.org/W1966725992,"The role of dopamine in monitoring negative action outcomes and feedback-based learning was tested in a neuroimaging study in humans grouped according to the dopamine D2 receptor gene polymorphism DRD2-TAQ-IA. In a probabilistic learning task, A1-allele carriers with reduced dopamine D2 receptor densities learned to avoid actions with negative consequences less efficiently. Their posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC), involved in feedback monitoring, responded less to negative feedback than others' did. Dynamically changing interactions between pMFC and hippocampus found to underlie feedback-based learning were reduced in A1-allele carriers. This demonstrates that learning from errors requires dopaminergic signaling. Dopamine D2 receptor reduction seems to decrease sensitivity to negative action consequences, which may explain an increased risk of developing addictive behaviors in A1-allele carriers."
https://openalex.org/W2025779835,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) occurs in cells in nucleoids containing several copies of the genome. Previous studies have identified proteins associated with these large DNA structures when they are biochemically purified by sedimentation and immunoaffinity chromatography. In this study, formaldehyde cross-linking was performed to determine which nucleoid proteins are in close contact with the mtDNA. A set of core nucleoid proteins is found in both native and cross-linked nucleoids, including 13 proteins with known roles in mtDNA transactions. Several other metabolic proteins and chaperones identified in native nucleoids, including ATAD3, were not observed to cross-link to mtDNA. Additional immunofluorescence and protease susceptibility studies showed that an N-terminal domain of ATAD3 previously proposed to bind to the mtDNA D-loop is directed away from the mitochondrial matrix, so it is unlikely to interact with mtDNA in vivo. These results are discussed in relation to a model for a layered structure of mtDNA nucleoids in which replication and transcription occur in the central core, whereas translation and complex assembly may occur in the peripheral region.

Eukaryotic cells typically contain thousands of mtDNA 2The abbreviations used are: mtDNAmitochondrial DNAmtRNAmitochondrial RNA. genomes assembled into hundreds of aggregates known as nucleoids (1Chen X.J.

These nucleoids show considerable dynamic stability, raising the possibility that this higher order organization is very important to the inheritance and segregation of mtDNAs. Nucleoid organization is thought to contribute to the rapid segregation of mtDNA mutations during oocyte maturation, the so-called “bottleneck” (4Laipis P. Walle M.V.D. Hauswirth W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8107-8110Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Marchington D. Macaulay V. Hartshorne G. Barlow D. Poulton J. Am. J. Hum. Gen. 1998; 63: 769-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), since early primordial germ cells appear to have only a small number of segregation units (6Cao L. Shitara H. Horii T. Nagao Y. Imai H. Abe K. Hara T. Hayashi J-I. Yonekawa H. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The degree of mtDNA heteroplasmy varies considerably during embryonic development of somatic tissues as well, reflecting an uneven distribution of mtDNA genotypes that may be influenced by the clustered organization of mtDNA. A high rate of mitochondrial fusion appears to be essential for the maintenance of mtDNA in nucleoids (7Chen H. Chomyn A. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26185-26192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 8Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Cell. 2007; 130: 548-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). One of the consequences of active cycling of mitochondrial fusion and fission may be to permit an individual nucleoid to have access to a larger pool of diffusible proteins required for replication or transcription than it would if it were trapped within a single mitochondrion. mitochondrial DNA mitochondrial RNA. Quantitative analysis of the size and mtDNA content of nucleoids in cultured mammalian cells suggests that an average nucleoid may contain 5-7 mtDNA genomes packed in a space with a diameter of only 70 nm (9Iborra F. Kimura H. Cook P. BMC Biol. 2004; 2: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A human mtDNA nucleoid with seven 16.6-kb mtDNA genomes is a large structure containing 70 million daltons of DNA and a comparable mass of protein. These nucleoids resemble their counterparts in eubacteria, which employ abundant basic DNA binding proteins to package their genomes in a restricted volume. The packing density of bacterial nucleoids is impressive, since 4700 kb of E. coli DNA is folded into a volume of 0.08-0.24 μm3 (10Woldringh C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). If 5-7 mtDNA molecules are packed in a sphere with a diameter of 70 nm, the calculated packing density of mtDNA nucleoids would be similar to that of a bacterial nucleoid. The parallel between bacterial and mitochondrial nucleoids is extended by the recognition that both are tethered to membrane components. For the case of the mtDNA genome, the concept that the DNA may be physically associated with the inner membrane was raised shortly after the discovery of mtDNA (11Nass M. Science. 1969; 165: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The identity of a possible membrane anchor has been an open question since the pioneering work from the Attardi laboratory (12Albring M. Griffith J. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1348-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) implicated a specific interaction with an unknown protein. The packaging of animal mtDNA in nucleoids is accomplished with the aid of DNA-binding proteins, including two particularly abundant proteins, TFAM and mtSSB. Although a recent study has suggested that the properties of TFAM may be especially important for the compaction of mtDNA in nucleoids (13Kaufman B.A. Durisic N. Mativetsky J.M. Costantino S. Hancock M.A. Grutter P. Shoubridge E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), there is some controversy regarding the number of TFAM molecules per mtDNA. Some studies have suggested that there is sufficient TFAM to literally coat the mtDNA genome (14Alam T.I. Kanki T. Muta T. Ukaji K. Abe Y. Nakayama H. Takio K. Hamasaki N. Kang D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1640-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), whereas others have reported much lower levels (15Wiesner R.J. Zsurka G. Kunz W.S. Free Radical Res. 2006; 40: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Cotney J. Wang Z. Shadel G.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4042-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The ratio of TFAM per mtDNA is developmentally regulated in Xenopus oocytes (17Shen E.L. Bogenhagen D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2822-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Immature oocytes that are actively replicating and transcribing mtDNA have a lower ratio of TFAM to mtDNA. TFAM accumulates to high levels in mature oocytes as mtDNA replication and transcription become repressed. Somatic cell types generally require active transcription of mtDNA to provide subunits of respiratory complexes and frequent replication to replace mtDNA genomes lost to turnover. We previously characterized a set of proteins associated with human mtDNA nucleoids using gentle lysis of mitochondria with nonionic detergents followed by sedimentation and immunoaffinity purification using polyclonal antibodies directed against TFAM and mtSSB (18Wang Y. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25791-25802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We found that the use of two distinct antibody reagents identified a common set of protein components, including many of the proteins previously known to function in mtDNA replication and transcription. However, this procedure also identified several metabolic proteins and chaperones as well as evidence of association of large nucleoid structures with cytoskeletal elements. The fact that this gentle approach to purify native nucleoids used nondenaturing conditions raised the possibility that some of the proteins recovered were not actually intrinsic nucleoid proteins but might simply represent abundant or “sticky” proteins that contaminated the preparation. In the present study, we adopted a different procedure for biochemical isolation of nucleoids that is intended to identify the subset of nucleoid proteins that are in close contact with mtDNA. We prepared nucleoprotein complexes from formaldehyde-treated mitochondria under conditions that exposed the complexes to harsh ionic detergents and high salt to strip away all proteins not covalently bound to the DNA. Formaldehyde cross-linking has been used in previous studies of the protein composition of yeast mtDNA nucleoids (19Kaufman B. Newman S. Hallberg R. Slaughter C. Perlman P. Butow R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) that identified a number of metabolic proteins in contact with mtDNA. Formaldehyde has desirable properties for such cross-linking studies, since it has a very short range of action and is reversible at high temperatures. This accounts for the popularity of this method as a probe of DNA-protein interactions in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (20Orlando V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 99-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We found that only a subset of the nucleoid proteins found in our native nucleoid preparations were cross-linked to mtDNA, including TFAM and mtSSB, along with DNA metabolic proteins, such as DNA polymerase γ and mtRNA polymerase, and a small number of other proteins that we consider to be components of the nucleoid core. An important advantage of this cross-linking study is that it distinguished a class of proteins found in association with native nucleoids that were not represented in the formaldehyde-cross-linked set, including a number of chaperone proteins. We studied one of these proteins, ATAD3, in greater detail, since this protein has recently been claimed to have the ability to bind mtDNA D-loop structures directly (21He J. Mao C-C. Reyes A. Sembongi H. Di Re M. Granycome C. Clippingdale A.B. Fearnley I.M. Harbour M. Robinson A.J. Reichelt S. Spelbrink J.N. Walker J.E. Holt I.J. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence indicated that it is not confined to nucleoids, which is consistent with our inability to cross-link it to mtDNA. Limited proteolysis of mitochondria showed that the putative DNA-binding domain of ATAD3 reported by He et al. (21He J. Mao C-C. Reyes A. Sembongi H. Di Re M. Granycome C. Clippingdale A.B. Fearnley I.M. Harbour M. Robinson A.J. Reichelt S. Spelbrink J.N. Walker J.E. Holt I.J. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) is not directed toward the mitochondrial matrix, so that it is not properly positioned to bind D-loop structures. Our results are discussed with reference to a layered model of nucleoid structure in which replication and transcription occur within a central core, and RNA processing, translation, and respiratory complex assembly may occur in a peripheral zone. Formaldehyde Cross-linking and Preparation of NucleoidsMitochondria were prepared from 4 liters of suspension-cultured HeLa cells as described (18Wang Y. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25791-25802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), including a nuclease treatment step, but omitting treatment with digitonin to produce mitoplasts. Following the final pelleting, mitochondria were resuspended in 0.9 ml of MSH buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), mixed with 0.1 ml of 10% formaldehyde in MSH, and incubated on a rotator at 4 °C for 30 min. 125 μl of 2 m glycine, pH 7.3, was added for an additional 5 min before mitochondria were lysed by the addition of one-tenth volume of 20% SDS. The lysate was layered onto two preformed composite gradients in Beckman SW41 polyallomer tubes. The top gradient buffer contained 15% glycerol, and the bottom contained 30% glycerol plus 30% Nycodenz (Histodenz; Sigma). Gradients contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 0.5% Sarkosyl (sodium sarcosinate; Sigma), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin throughout and were generated by layering over a pad of 0.6 ml of 5.7 m CsCl. Gradients were centrifuged for 4.5 h at 38,000 rpm (247,000 × g) at 4 °C. Fractions of ∼0.8 ml were collected and assayed for DNA either by staining with Picogreen with detection by fluorometry (22Bogenhagen D.F. Wang Y. Shen E.L. Kobayashi R. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1205-1216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or by digestion with restriction endonuclease HindIII and agarose gel analysis to identify mtDNA fragments. When restriction analysis was performed, as in Fig. 2, 50 μl of each fraction was treated as described below to reverse cross-links and deproteinized by extraction with phenol-CHCl3. DNA was precipitated with ethanol, treated with HindIII restriction endonuclease, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis using standard methods. Fractions containing mtDNA were diluted to 10 ml with gradient buffer lacking either glycerol or Nycodenz and layered over a pad of 5.7 m CsCl in an SW41 tube. Samples were centrifuged for 6-8 h at 38,000 rpm and 4 °C to sediment nucleoids to the CsCl shelf. The upper buffer was withdrawn, and the interface was collected and mixed with 7 m CsCl to adjust the solution density to 1.5-1.55 g/ml as determined by refractometry. Gradients were centrifuged to equilibrium for 40-44 h at 18 °C and 40,000 rpm (215,000 × g) in a Beckman SW60Ti rotor. Fractions were collected and analyzed for DNA content using Picogreen fluorescence as described above. Fractions containing the peak of DNA fluorescence at a density of 1.5-1.6 g/ml were pooled and rebanded. Following measurement of density and DNA content, fractions from the second gradient surrounding the peak of DNA fluorescence were diluted with TE buffer to 0.5 ml and precipitated with two volumes of ethanol. If a dense white CsCl precipitate formed, the samples were resuspended in 0.3 ml of 0.3 m sodium acetate, and ethanol precipitation was repeated. Following a rinse with 70% ethanol, the samples were dried briefly and redissolved in 75 μl of SDS sample loading buffer (10% glycerol, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS). Samples were heated at 80 °C for 3 h to reverse formaldehyde cross-links. Protein Analysis and SequencingFollowing reversal of cross-links, protein samples from gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on gels containing 8-12% polyacrylamide, depending on the molecular weight range desired. Proteins were detected by silver staining (23Morrissey J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar) or were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes that were probed with various antibodies. Polyclonal antisera directed against TFAM, mtSSB, polymerase γA, SHMT, and DHX30 were prepared in the Bogenhagen laboratory and were used at a dilution of 1:1000-1:5000. Antibodies directed against the ATAD3 N-terminal sequence PAPKDKWSNFDP (residues 51-62) and the C-terminal sequence LKAEGPGRGDEPSPS (residues 620-634) were prepared in the Rousseau laboratory. Additional antipeptide antibodies directed against ATAD3 sequences were obtained from Dr. Olivier Gires (University of Munich). Antibodies directed against mTERF (from Dr. Giuseppi Attardi, Caltech), LRPPRC (from Dr. Serafin Pinol-Roma, CUNY), PDIP38 (from Dr. Marietta Lee, New York Medical College), and Lon and Tid1 (from Dr. Carolyn Suzuki, New Jersey Medical School) were used as directed by the suppliers. Other antibodies obtained from commercial sources directed against prohibitin (Neomarkers), Tom20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and DNA (Fitzgerald Industries) were used as recommended by the suppliers. Following incubation of blots with primary antibodies, membranes were washed with several changes of 0.5% Tween 80 in PBS prior to incubation with secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Complexes were incubated with reagents from the Pierce Supersignal kit to develop a chemiluminescent signal detected using an Alpha Innotech CCD imager. Antibodies were also used for immunofluorescence microscopy as described (18Wang Y. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25791-25802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). For protein sequencing, the gel lanes of interest were divided into 10-16 zones, as shown in Fig. 4. Proteins were digested to peptides with sequencing grade trypsin and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as described (18Wang Y. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25791-25802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cross-linked NucleoidsThe protocol employed to prepare formaldehyde-cross-linked nucleoids from HeLa cells (Fig. 1) began with purification of mitochondria as described in our previous work on native nucleoids (18Wang Y. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25791-25802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In the modified protocol, the mitochondria in mannitol-sucrose buffer were incubated with 1% formaldehyde for 30 min before glycine was added to react with excess formaldehyde. Mitochondria were then lysed with 2% SDS, and DNA-protein complexes were separated from free protein by sedimentation through a composite glycerol/Nycodenz gradient containing 0.5% Sarkosyl. Following sedimentation, mtDNA was found in a broad peak in the center of the gradient in association with a significant fraction of the TFAM and mtSSB. TFAM and mtSSB molecules not cross-linked to mtDNA were released and remained at the top of the gradient with the vast majority of mitochondrial protein (Fig. 2). In the experiment shown in Fig. 2, 40-45% of both TFAM and mtSSB was contained in cross-linked complexes, although the extent of cross-linking varied somewhat from one preparation to another. Fragments of nuclear DNA contaminating the preparation were also enriched at the top of the gradient (data not shown). The fractions containing mtDNA were identified and pooled. To concentrate the cross-linked complexes, they were first diluted with gradient buffer lacking glycerol or Nycodenz to reduce the density of the solution. The complexes were then concentrated by sedimentation onto a pad of 5.7 m CsCl. This pad was collected and adjusted to a CsCl density of 1.5-1.55 g/ml and centrifuged to equilibrium in an SW60Ti rotor. For a typical preparation beginning with 4 liters of HeLa cells in suspension culture, two CsCl gradients were used for the first round of isopycnic centrifugation. Since early pilot experiments showed that a considerable amount of free protein was contained at the top of these initial gradients, the mtDNA peaks from two CsCl gradients were pooled and rebanded. mtDNA-protein complexes were found at a density of 1.5-1.57 g/ml in the second CsCl gradient (Fig. 3A). Following reversal of the formaldehyde cross-links with heat, a sample of each fraction was digested with restriction endonuclease HindIII to confirm that the DNA in the gradients has a digestion pattern characteristic of mtDNA (Fig. 3B). Another fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE to detect proteins. This revealed that the DNA complexes that banded at lighter density contained a larger amount of cross-linked protein than those on the dense side of the peak, as expected (compare the protein/DNA ratios of fractions 3 and 5 in Fig. 3, B and C). No significant amount of free protein was detected at the top of the gradient when the complexes were purified using two rounds of isopycnic centrifugation.FIGURE 3Isopycnic centrifugation of cross-linked nucleoids. Nucleoids prepared by sedimentation as shown in Fig. 2 were further purified by isopycnic centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A shows the fluorescence of picogreen dye bound to mtDNA in gradient fractions normalized to that of the peak fraction as well as the CsCl density gradient (▪, DNA fluorescence; ♦, density). B shows a HindIII restriction analysis of DNA in the gradient fractions to confirm that the picogreen fluorescence in A is entirely due to mtDNA, with arrows indicating the 10.2- and 5.5-kb fragments as in Fig. 2. Lane M contains 1-kb ladder DNA markers (Invitrogen). C shows the proteins in gradient fractions detected in a silver-stained SDS protein gel.

This revealed a very reproducible pattern of polypeptides. Each gel lane was divided into a series of slices containing proteins of decreasing molecular mass, and each slice was processed by in situ trypsin digestion to generate peptides. The peptides from the two lanes shown in Fig. 4 were analyzed using a total of 27 liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry runs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins identified by at least two high confidence peptide hits are listed insupplemental Table 1. In a few cases, such as for PDIP38 and DNAJ3 (Hsp40, TID1), proteins identified by a single high confidence peptide hit were included when the protein was already characterized as a nucleoid component. Occasional peptide hits representing keratins and histones were omitted from this list, since keratins were considered to be introduced by sample handling, and the histones appeared to result from trace contamination with nuclear DNA fragments. In addition to the list of proteins and peptides insupplemental Table 1, we observed peptides representing numerous ribosomal proteins and other proteins involved in translation. Interestingly, these represent both mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial ribosomes. These cytoplasmic ribosomes may be contaminants, since it is estimated that a HeLa cell has about 160 times as many cytoplasmic ribosomes as mitochondrial ribosomes (24Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Still, their presence may be significant in light of the model of Iborra et al. (9Iborra F. Kimura H. Cook P. BMC Biol. 2004; 2: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), suggesting that nucleoids are centers for mitochondrial translation and occur near sites where proteins synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes docked to the outer membrane may be co-translationally imported. However, since we could not rule out the possibility that these peptide hits represent proteins cross-linked to rRNA, we did not include these insupplemental Table 1 but listed them separately insupplemental Table 2. Although the model for co-translational import and respiratory complex assembly is of great interest, a comprehensive test of this is beyond the scope of the present paper. As expected from the complexity of the silver-stained gel patterns in Fig. 4, peptide analysis led to the identification of a large number of peptides listed insupplemental Table 1. The proteins identified are listed in Table 1 along with a comparison with the set of proteins we found in native nucleoids (18Wang Y. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25791-25802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The proteins in Table 1 are divided into three classes. Class I includes 31 proteins observed in both native and cross-linked nucleoid preparations. Class II includes 10 proteins observed in native nucleoids but not found cross-linked to mtDNA. These appear to represent peripheral proteins that might have been retained in native preparations on the basis of their interactions with other nucleoid components. We cannot rule out the possibility that some of these peripheral nucleoid proteins are merely contaminants, although nucleoid-associated roles for some of them, such as Hsp60 and prohibitin, are supported by other data. The third class of proteins listed in Table 1 is a set of 16 proteins identified in cross-linked nucleoids but not in native nucleoids. In most cases, these were identified in only one of the two experiments. It is most likely that these proteins were adventitiously cross-linked to core nucleoid proteins, and they are not considered further.TABLE 1Proteins identified in nucleoidsProteinGeneAccession numberNative APCross-linkedReferenceα-TFAMα-mtSSB12Class I.

Open table in a new tab We performed a series of immunoblotting experiments to validate the identification of a number of the nucleoid proteins and to test for the presence of certain other proteins of interest. In these experiments, two independent cross-linked nucleoid preparations were generated, and proteins released by heat treatment of the nucleoid peak fraction and flanking fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed for reactivity with a series of antisera. In most cases, a positive control lane was included, containing a portion of the mitochondrial protein preparation before cross-linking. Fig. 5A shows the DNA distribution for one of these final CsCl gradients, displaying a peak in fraction 7. Immunoblots of proteins from fractions 5-9 of this gradient are shown in Fig. 5B, whereas Fig. 5C shows the immunoblots from a similar analysis of samples from an independent nucleoid preparation. Results in Fig. 5 confirm that TFAM, mtSSB, polymerase γA, SUV3L, SHMT, and DHX30 are contained in CsCl gradient fractions containing the nucleoid peak. We note that for mtSSB and DHX30, gradient fractions on the lighter side of the DNA peak showed greater reactivity with antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W1974698513,"Cavity quantum electrodynamics, the study of coherent quantum interactions between the electromagnetic field and matter inside a resonator, has received attention as both a test bed for ideas in quantum mechanics and a building block for applications in the field of quantum information processing. The canonical experimental system studied in the optical domain is a single alkali atom coupled to a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity. Progress made in this system has recently been complemented by research involving trapped ions, chip-based microtoroid cavities, integrated microcavity-atom-chips, nanocrystalline quantum dots coupled to microsphere cavities, and semiconductor quantum dots embedded in micropillars, photonic crystals and microdisks. The last system has been of particular interest owing to its relative simplicity and scalability. Here we use a fibre taper waveguide to perform direct optical spectroscopy of a system consisting of a quantum dot embedded in a microdisk. In contrast to earlier work with semiconductor systems, which has focused on photoluminescence measurements, we excite the system through the photonic (light) channel rather than the excitonic (matter) channel. Strong coupling, the regime of coherent quantum interactions, is demonstrated through observation of vacuum Rabi splitting in the transmitted and reflected signals from the cavity. The fibre coupling method also allows us to examine the system's steady-state nonlinear properties, where we see a saturation of the cavity-quantum dot response for less than one intracavity photon. The excitation of the cavity-quantum dot system through a fibre optic waveguide is central to applications such as high-efficiency single photon sources, and to more fundamental studies of the quantum character of the system."
https://openalex.org/W2073226506,"The heating of the solar chromosphere and corona is a long-standing puzzle in solar physics. Hinode observations show the ubiquitous presence of chromospheric anemone jets outside sunspots in active regions. They are typically 3 to 7 arc seconds = 2000 to 5000 kilometers long and 0.2 to 0.4 arc second = 150 to 300 kilometers wide, and their velocity is 10 to 20 kilometers per second. These small jets have an inverted Y-shape, similar to the shape of x-ray anemone jets in the corona. These features imply that magnetic reconnection similar to that in the corona is occurring at a much smaller spatial scale throughout the chromosphere and suggest that the heating of the solar chromosphere and corona may be related to small-scale ubiquitous reconnection."
https://openalex.org/W2066972948,"Planarian flatworms can regenerate heads at anterior-facing wounds and tails at posterior-facing wounds throughout the body. How this regeneration polarity is specified has been a classic problem for more than a century. We identified a planarian gene, Smed- β catenin-1 , that controls regeneration polarity. Posterior-facing blastemas regenerate a head instead of a tail in Smed- β catenin-1(RNAi) animals. Smed- β catenin-1 is required after wounding and at any posterior-facing wound for polarity. Additionally, intact Smed- β catenin-1(RNAi) animals display anteriorization during tissue turnover. Five Wnt genes and a secreted Frizzled-related Wnt antagonist-like gene are expressed in domains along the anteroposterior axis that reset to new positions during regeneration, which suggests that Wnts control polarity through Smed- β catenin-1 . Our data suggest that β-catenin specifies the posterior character of the anteroposterior axis throughout the Bilateria and specifies regeneration polarity in planarians."

https://openalex.org/W2056680298,"Many bacterial pathogens have long, slender pili through which they adhere to host cells. The crystal structure of the major pilin subunit from the Gram-positive human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes at 2.2 angstroms resolution reveals an extended structure comprising two all-β domains. The molecules associate in columns through the crystal, with each carboxyl terminus adjacent to a conserved lysine of the next molecule. This lysine forms the isopeptide bonds that link the subunits in native pili, validating the relevance of the crystal assembly. Each subunit contains two lysine-asparagine isopeptide bonds generated by an intramolecular reaction, and we find evidence for similar isopeptide bonds in other cell surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria. The present structure explains the strength and stability of such Gram-positive pili and could facilitate vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2093322419,"Superfluidity--liquid flow without friction--is familiar in helium. The first evidence for 'supersolidity', its analogue in quantum solids, came from torsional oscillator measurements involving 4He. At temperatures below 200 mK, the torsional oscillator frequencies increased, suggesting that some of the solid decoupled from the oscillator. This behaviour has been replicated by several groups, but solid 4He does not respond to pressure differences, and persistent currents and other signatures of superflow have not been seen. Both experiments and theory indicate that defects are involved; these should also affect the solid's mechanical behaviour. Here we report a measurement of the shear modulus of solid 4He at low frequencies and strains. We observe large increases below 200 mK, with the same dependence on measurement amplitude, 3He impurity concentration and annealing as the decoupling seen in the torsional oscillator experiments. We explain this unusual elastic behaviour in terms of a dislocation network that is pinned by 3He at the lowest temperatures but becomes mobile above 100 mK. The frequency changes in the torsional oscillator experiments appear to be related to the motion of these dislocations, perhaps by disrupting a possible supersolid state."

https://openalex.org/W1994191822,"An outstanding climate anomaly 8200 years before the present (B.P.) in the North Atlantic is commonly postulated to be the result of weakened overturning circulation triggered by a freshwater outburst. New stable isotopic and sedimentological records from a northwest Atlantic sediment core reveal that the most prominent Holocene anomaly in bottom-water chemistry and flow speed in the deep limb of the Atlantic overturning circulation begins at approximately 8.38 thousand years B.P., coeval with the catastrophic drainage of Lake Agassiz. The influence of Lower North Atlantic Deep Water was strongly reduced at our site for approximately 100 years after the outburst, confirming the ocean's sensitivity to freshwater forcing. The similarities between the timing and duration of the pronounced deep circulation changes and regional climate anomalies support a causal link."
https://openalex.org/W2028310816,"Regulated intramembrane proteolysis by members of the site-2 protease (S2P) family is an important signaling mechanism conserved from bacteria to humans. Here we report the crystal structure of the transmembrane core domain of an S2P metalloprotease from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. The protease consists of six transmembrane segments, with the catalytic zinc atom coordinated by two histidine residues and one aspartate residue approximately 14 angstroms into the lipid membrane surface. The protease exhibits two distinct conformations in the crystals. In the closed conformation, the active site is surrounded by transmembrane helices and is impermeable to substrate peptide; water molecules gain access to zinc through a polar, central channel that opens to the cytosolic side. In the open conformation, transmembrane helices alpha1 and alpha6 separate from each other by 10 to 12 angstroms, exposing the active site to substrate entry. The structure reveals how zinc embedded in an integral membrane protein can catalyze peptide cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1996840708,"About 25% of the world's fisheries are depleted such that their current biomass is lower than the level that would maximize the sustained yield (MSY). By using methods not previously applied in the fisheries conservation context, we show in four disparate fisheries (including the long-lived and slow-growing orange roughy) that the dynamic maximum economic yield (MEY), the biomass that produces the largest discounted economic profits from fishing, exceeds MSY. Thus, although it is theoretically possible that maximizing discounted economic profits may cause stock depletions, our results show there is a win-win: In many fisheries at reasonable discount rates and at current prices and costs, larger fish stocks increase economic profits. An MEY target that exceeds MSY and transfers from higher, future profits to compensate fishers for the transition costs of stock rebuilding would help overcome a key cause of fisheries overexploitation, industry opposition to lower harvests."
https://openalex.org/W2070423545,"The Sun continuously expels a huge amount of ionized material into interplanetary space as the solar wind. Despite its influence on the heliospheric environment, the origin of the solar wind has yet to be well identified. In this paper, we report Hinode X-ray Telescope observations of a solar active region. At the edge of the active region, located adjacent to a coronal hole, a pattern of continuous outflow of soft-x-ray-emitting plasmas was identified emanating along apparently open magnetic field lines and into the upper corona. Estimates of temperature and density for the outflowing plasmas suggest a mass loss rate that amounts to approximately 1/4 of the total mass loss rate of the solar wind. These outflows may be indicative of one of the solar wind sources at the Sun."
https://openalex.org/W2052921451,"Mammalian dosage compensation involves silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in females and is controlled by the X-inactivation center (Xic). The Xic, which includes Xist and its antisense transcription unit Tsix/Xite, somehow senses the number of X chromosomes and triggers Xist up-regulation from one of the two X chromosomes in females. We found that a segment of the mouse Xic lying several hundred kilobases upstream of Xist brings the two Xics together before the onset of X inactivation. This region can autonomously drive Xic trans-interactions even as an ectopic single-copy transgene. Its introduction into male embryonic stem cells is strongly selected against, consistent with a possible role in trans-activating Xist. We propose that homologous associations driven by this novel X-pairing region (Xpr) of the Xic enable a cell to sense that more than one X chromosome is present and coordinate reciprocal Xist/Tsix expression."

https://openalex.org/W1980786879,"Cassini images of Saturn's small inner satellites (radii of less than ∼100 kilometers) have yielded their sizes, shapes, and in some cases, topographies and mean densities. This information and numerical N -body simulations of accretionary growth have provided clues to their internal structures and origins. The innermost ring-region satellites have likely grown to the maximum sizes possible by accreting material around a dense core about one-third to one-half the present size of the moon. The other small satellites outside the ring region either may be close to monolithic collisional shards, modified to varying degrees by accretion, or may have grown by accretion without the aid of a core. We derived viscosity values of 87 and 20 square centimeters per second, respectively, for the ring material surrounding ring-embedded Pan and Daphnis. These moons almost certainly opened their respective gaps and then grew to their present size early on, when the local ring environment was thicker than it is today."

The cytosolic domain of Tom22 appears to function as a receptor in cooperation with Tom20, but how its substrate specificity differs from that of Tom20 remains unclear. To reveal possible differences in substrate specificities between Tom20 and Tom22, if any, we deleted the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22 in mitochondria in vitro by introducing cleavage sites for a tobacco etch virus protease between the receptor domains and transmembrane segments of Tom20 and Tom22. Then mitochondria without the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22 were analyzed for their abilities to import various mitochondrial precursor proteins targeted to different mitochondrial subcompartments in vitro.

Evidence has been accumulated that the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of Tom22, which are rich in acidic residues, constitute binding sites for positively charged presequences, with Tom20 on the cytosolic side and with Tom40 and Tom7 on the IMS sides of the outer membrane (21Kiebler M.

Nevertheless, the difference in the substrate specificity of the cytosolic domain of Tom22 from that of Tom20 has remained elusive for the following reasons. First, Tom22, especially the central transmembrane segment, is essential for yeast cell growth under most culturing conditions, rendering it difficult to deplete Tom22 without abrogating functional integrity of the TOM40 complex (31van Wilpe S. Ryan M.T. Hill K. Maarse A.C. Meisinger C. Brix J. Dekker P.J. Moczko M. Wagner R. Meijer M. Guiard B. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Nature. 1999; 401: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Second, genetic deletion of Tom20 in turn accompanies a decrease in the amount of Tom22, so the effects of the defective receptor functions of Tom20 and Tom22 on protein import cannot be analyzed separately (22Lithgow T. Junne T. Suda K. Gratzer S. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11973-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Third, because the isolated cytosolic domain of Tom22 hardly takes an ordered structure, but still binds to presequences, 6T. Shodai and T. Endo, unpublished observations. analyses of presequence binding to the isolated receptor domain of Tom22 may not be reliable. To overcome those experimental difficulties in assessing the substrate specificities of Tom20 and Tom22, we set up a system to delete the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22 with minimal effects on the other subunits of the TOM40 complex after isolation of mitochondria. Briefly, we constructed genes for Tom20TEV and Tom22TEV that contain a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage sequence between the cytosolic receptor domains and transmembrane segments (32Dougherty W.G. Semler B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 781-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then mitochondria were isolated from the yeast cells expressing Tom20TEV or Tom22TEV from the plasmid instead of wild-type Tom20 or Tom22 from the genome DNA and were treated with TEV protease to remove the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22 in vitro. The obtained mitochondria without the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22 were analyzed for their abilities to import various mitochondrial precursor proteins targeted to different mitochondrial subcompartments in vitro. We found that the effects of deletion of the receptor domains on the import of different mitochondrial proteins are quite similar between Tom20 and Tom22. Therefore Tom20 and Tom22 are involved in the same step or sequential steps along the same pathway for targeting signal recognition. Plasmids–The TOM20 gene containing its own promoter and terminator was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CAA GAC TCG AGC AGA TCT TGC ATT C-3′ and 5′-GCA TGA GCT CAT TTA GGC TAG AGA AAT G-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with XhoI and SacI and introduced into pRS314 to generate pRS314/TOM20(WT). Construction of pRS314/TOM22(WT) was reported previously (33Nakai M. Kinoshita K. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 51: 30571-30575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The plasmids containing genes for Tom20TEV and Tom22TEV were constructed as follows. The TEV protease recognition site (ENLYFQS) was inserted between residues 73 and 74 of Tom20 and between residues 74 and 75 of Tom22 by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using primers 5′-GGT TAC CGA ATT CTT AGA AAA CTT GTA CTT TCA ATC CAT GGA ATT AGC C-3′ and 5′-CCC CCC AGG TAA GAG AGA AAA CTT GTA CTT TCA ATC TCA AAC AAT TTC TAA-3′ to yield pRS314/TOM20(TEV) and pRS314/TOM22(TEV), respectively. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions–Yeast haploid strains SNY1005 (34Iwahashi J. Yamazaki S. Komiya T. Nomura N. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18467-18472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and MNMS1-C (33Nakai M. Kinoshita K. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 51: 30571-30575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with chromosomal disruption of the TOM20 or TOM22 gene were used as parental strains in this study. SNY1005 was transformed with a TRP1 plasmid harboring the wild-type TOM20 gene (pRS314/TOM20(WT)) or the gene for Tom20TEV (pRS314/TOM20(TEV)) to construct 20W and 20T strains, respectively. MNMS1-C was transformed with a TRP1 plasmid harboring the wild-type TOM22 gene (pRS314/TOM22(WT)) or the gene for Tom22TEV (pRS314/TOM22(TEV)) and then selected on 5-fluoroorotic acid plates to construct 22W and 22T strains. Yeast strains were grown in 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% casamino acid, 2% lactate, and 0.05% glucose with the appropriate supplements at 23 or 30 °C. Import Assays–The radiolabeled precursor proteins were synthesized in a cell-free translation system with rabbit reticulocyte lysate or PURESYSTEM (Post Genome Institute Co., Ltd.) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Isolated mitochondria were incubated with radiolabeled precursor proteins in import buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm methionine, 2 mm NADH, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) at 25 °C. For cytochrome c import, 5 mm dithiothreitol and 5 μm hemin were added to import buffer. Import reactions were stopped by the addition of valinomycin to 10 μg/ml and treated with proteinase K (50–200 μg/ml) for 20–30 min on ice. Proteolytic reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Alkaline extraction with Na2CO3 and preparation of mitoplasts were performed as described previously (35Yamano K. Ishikawa D. Esaki M. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10011-10017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After import and proteinase K treatment, mitochondria were re-isolated by centrifugation, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and radioimaging. For blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) analyses of the TOM40 complex, mitochondria were solubilized with 0.4 or 1% digitonin, and the soluble fraction was recovered after centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Purification of TEV Protease–TEV protease was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) from the plasmid pBG153.6, which was a gift from S. Gould. Transformants were grown to A600 ∼ 0.8 in 2YT medium (0.5% yeast extract, 1% Tryptone, and 85 mm NaCl) supplemented with 1% glucose and 50 mg/liter kanamycin at 37 °C and induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2.5 h at 37 °C. Cells from 1.2 liters of culture were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 ml of resuspension buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, and 100 mm NaCl), and disrupted by sonication. TEV protease recovered as inclusion bodies was washed twice with 50 ml of resuspension buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and then solubilized with 25 ml of 6 m urea buffer (6 m urea, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl). The solubilized fraction after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column equilibrated with 6 m urea buffer. The column was washed with wash buffer (6 m urea, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole) and then eluted with elution buffer (6 m urea, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole). The eluted fraction was diluted with 6 m urea buffer to 1 mg protein/ml and subjected to refolding by gel filtration with a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with refolding buffer (90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.8 mm EDTA, 9 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Refolded TEV protease was collected; concentrated to 1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol; and stored at –80 °C. TEV Protease Treatment–100 μg of protein from isolated mitochondria were incubated with or without 20 μg of purified TEV protease in 200 μl of TEV buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 30 °C for 20 min. Deletion of the Receptor Domains of Tom20 and Tom22 by TEV Protease Treatment in Vitro–To establish a system in which only the cytosolic receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22 can be deleted in vitro, we introduced a cleavage site for TEV protease between the receptor domain and transmembrane segment of Tom20 or Tom22 at the DNA level (Fig. 1A). The modified proteins, Tom20TEV and Tom22TEV, are fully functional because replacement of endogenous Tom20 or Tom22 did not affect cell growth even at 37 °C (data not shown). We isolated 20T or 22T mitochondria and incubated them with TEV protease for 20 min at 30 °C. SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Tom20 or anti-Tom22 antibodies showed that the receptor domain of Tom20TEV or Tom22TEV was completely deleted in 20T or 22T mitochondria, respectively, whereas the amounts of Tom20TEV in 20T and Tom22TEV in 22T before TEV protease treatment were nearly the same as those of Tom20 and Tom22 in wild-type mitochondria (20W and 22W) (Fig. 1B). TEV protease treatment did not affect the level of Tom22 in 20T mitochondria or Tom20 in 22T mitochondria, either. We also analyzed the levels of other subunits of the translocator complexes (Tom40 and Tom70 in the TOM40 complex; Tim22 in the TIM22 complex; Tim23 in the TIM23 complex; and Tob55, Mas37, and Tom38 in the TOB/SAM complex) to confirm that they did not change upon TEV protease treatment. We then solubilized wild-type (20W and 22W) mitochondria and 20T and 22T mitochondria before or after TEV protease treatment with 1% digitonin and analyzed the complex structures of the TOM40 complex by BN-PAGE. The wild-type TOM40 core complex consisting of Tom40, Tom22, Tom5, Tom6, and Tom7 migrates as an ∼400-kDa form on BN-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1C, 20W and 22W). The intact assembly structure of the TOM40 complex was not significantly affected by deletion of the receptor domain of Tom20 (20T) or Tom22 (22T) by TEV protease treatment, although deletion of the acidic receptor domain of Tom22 by TEV protease treatment reduced the apparent molecular mass to ∼300–350 kDa (Fig. 1C, 20T and 22T). Solubilized wild-type (22W) mitochondria and 22T mitochondria before or after TEV protease treatment with 1% digitonin were also analyzed by glycerol density gradient centrifugation, and similar results were obtained (Fig. 1D). Although the TOM40 complex solubilized from 22T mitochondria without TEV protease treatment migrated slightly faster than the one from WT mitochondria on the BN-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1C), no significant difference in the apparent sizes of the TOM40 complex between 22T mitochondria without TEV treatment and WT mitochondria was observed by glycerol density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1D). Deletion of the Receptor Domains of Tom20 and Tom22 Impairs Mitochondrial Protein Import in a Similar Manner–To analyze the effects of deletion of the receptor domains of Tom20 and Tom22 on mitochondrial protein import, we prepared mitochondria specifically lacking the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22 by in vitro TEV protease treatment of 20T or 22T mitochondria, respectively. Then we performed in vitro protein import assays with reduced amounts of those mitochondria so that binding of mitochondrial precursor proteins to the mitochondrial surface became rate-limiting for the overall import process (36Lithgow T. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14267-14269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To reveal the receptor specificity of Tom20 and Tom22, we performed in vitro import of various radiolabeled mitochondrial precursor proteins into 20T and 22T mitochondria. First, we tested presequence-containing matrix-targeted precursor proteins for their import into mitochondria without the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22. The presequence of subunit 9 of F0-ATPase fused to mouse dihydrofolate reductase (pSu9-DHFR), the precursor to mitochondrial Hsp60 (pHsp60), and the precursor to the β-subunit of F1-ATPase (pF1β) were synthesized with reticulocyte lysate and subjected to import into 20T and 22T mitochondria. Deletion of the receptor domains of Tom20 and Tom22 significantly impaired the import of pSu9-DHFR, pHsp60, and pF1β (Fig. 2), suggesting that both Tom20 and Tom22 function as receptors for these precursor proteins, as expected. When we compared the effects of removal of the receptor domains of Tom20 and Tom22, the reduction of the import rates (60–90%) appears similar for the receptor domain deletion of Tom20 and Tom22. Next, we analyzed the in vitro import of presequence-less inner membrane proteins ADP/ATP carrier (AAC), Tim17, and Tim23. These presequence-less polytopic inner membrane proteins are known to use the TIM22 complex to be inserted into the inner membrane. AAC and Tim23 were also shown to use another outer membrane receptor, Tom70, for targeting to mitochondria (16Söllner T. Pfaller R. Griffiths G. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1990; 62: 107-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 17Hines V. Brandt A. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Brütsch H. Schatz G.

Cell. 1998; 9: 2577-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although in the absence of Tom70, AAC import becomes Tom20-dependent as well (18Steger H.F. Söllner T. Kiebler M. Dietmeier K.A. Pfaller R. Trülzsch K.S. Tropschug M. Neupert W. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2353-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Deletion of the receptor domains of Tom20 and Tom22 moderately decreased the import rates of these proteins (by 20–30%) (Fig. 3). Therefore even in the presence of Tom70, Tom20 and Tom22, in addition to Tom70, are involved in recognition of internal targeting signals of these presequence-less inner membrane proteins. Then we tested soluble IMS proteins Tim9, Tim13, and cytochrome c for their import into mitochondria without the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22. It was reported that the import of Tim13 (38Lutz T. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4400-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and cytochrome c (39Diekert K. de Kroon A.I. Ahting U. Niggemeyer B. Neupert W. de Kruijff B. Lill R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5626-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was not affected by trypsin treatment of mitochondria, although depletion of the entire Tom22 molecule moderately impaired the import of cytochrome c in vitro (40Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Prinz T. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. Truscott K.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we found that even after specific removal of the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22 by TEV protease treatment, import of these proteins into mitochondria was not affected at all (Fig. 4). Therefore the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22 does not recognize mitochondrial targeting signals of those presequence-less soluble IMS proteins. We also tested outer membrane proteins porin, Tom40, and rat peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) for their import into mitochondria without the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22. Porin and Tom40 are β-barrel proteins in the outer membrane, whereas PBR is a polytopic outer membrane protein with five transmembrane segments. Previous studies showed that integration of porin into the outer membrane (41Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Douglas M.G. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and assembly of Tom40 into the TOB/SAM complex (42Model K. Meisinger C. Prinz T. Wiedemann N. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Ryan M.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) require both Tom20 and Tom22. On the other hand, import of PBR into mammalian mitochondria was found to depend on Tom70, but not on Tom20, Tom22, or even Tom40 (43Otera H. Taira Y. Horie C. Suzuki Y. Suzuki H. Setoguchi K. Kato H. Oka T. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In vitro import of porin into mitochondria without the receptor domain of Tom20 (20T) or Tom22 (22T) was significantly retarded as compared with control mitochondria with intact Tom20 and Tom22 (Fig. 5A). The assembly process of imported Tom40 into the endogenous TOM40 complex can be followed by BN-PAGE after solubilization of mitochondria. Tom40 imported into wild-type control mitochondria (20T or 22T mitochondria without TEV protease treatment) was first associated with the TOB/SAM complex to exhibit the 250-kDa assembly I intermediate and then shifted to the 100-kDa assembly II intermediate (Fig. 5B, upper panels). Prolonged incubation allowed imported Tom40 to shift to the 450-kDa final TOM40 complex (data not shown). Removal of the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22 by TEV protease treatment retarded the formation of the assembly I and assembly II intermediates (lower panels). Reduction of the rates of intermediate formation was similar for removal of the receptor domains of Tom20 and Tom22. On the other hand, import of PBR into mitochondria was not affected by deletion of the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22, suggesting that the targeting signal of PBR was not recognized by Tom20 or Tom22 (Fig. 5C). Deletion of the Tom22 Receptor Domain Impairs Assembly of Tom20 into the TOM40 Complex, but Not Its Insertion into the Outer Membrane–Next, we analyzed the effects of deletion of the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22 on the assembly of Tom20 into the TOM40 complex. Tom20 is a peripheral subunit of the TOM40 complex and is associated with the TOM40 holocomplex only after a mild solubilization process (e.g. with 0.4% digitonin). Radiolabeled Tom20 was incubated with 20T or 22T mitochondria with or without TEV protease treatment. Subsequent BN-PAGE analyses of 20T mitochondria solubilized with 0.4% digitonin showed that assembly of Tom20 into the TOM40 complex was not affected by deletion of the receptor domain of Tom20, which is consistent with a previous observation (44Ahting U. Waizenegger T. Neupert W. Rapaport D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). On the other hand, assembly of Tom20 into the TOM40 complex in vitro significantly depended on the receptor domain of Tom22. First, even without treatment with TEV protease, replacement of wild-type Tom22 with Tom22TEV decreased the assembly efficiency of Tom20 into the TOM40 complex in vitro (Fig. 6A). However, this effect does not appear serious in vivo because 22T mitochondria without TEV protease treatment could import mitochondrial precursor proteins as efficiently as 22W mitochondria did (data not shown). After TEV protease treatment of 22T mitochondria, the assembly efficiency of Tom20 into the TOM40 complex was further decreased significantly as compared with the 22T mitochondria before TEV protease treatment (Fig. 6A). To determine whether the receptor domain of Tom22 catalyzes the assembly of Tom20 into the TOM40 complex or stabilizes the association of Tom20 with the TOM40 complex, we performed in vitro import of Tom20 into 22T mitochondria without cleavage by TEV protease and subsequently subjected the mitochondria to incubation with TEV protease. Now Tom20 assembled in the TOM40 complex was completely gone after digestion with TEV protease (Fig. 6B). Therefore the receptor domain of Tom22 is essential for Tom20 to stay bound to the TOM40 core complex. In contrast, membrane insertion as monitored by alkaline extraction of Tom20 after incubation with 20T and 22T mitochondria was not affected by removal of the receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22 by TEV protease (Fig. 6C). Therefore, whereas insertion of Tom20 into the outer membrane does not require Tom20 or Tom22, the Tom22 receptor domain is essential to stabilize the assembly of Tom20 into the TOM40 complex. Because trypsin treatment of mitochondria, which removes the surface-exposed parts of the receptor subunits of the TOM40 complex, significantly impairs protein import, the outer membrane receptor subunits are collectively important for mitochondrial protein entry, although trypsin-treated mitochondria still retain a residual import ability via the “bypass import” pathway (8Pfaller R. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 34-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the differences or similarities in substrate specificities between Tom20 and Tom22 have not been systematically analyzed. In the present study, we developed a system to delete the cytosolic receptor domain of Tom20 or Tom22 with minimal effects on the other components of the TOM40 complex after isolation of mitochondria, and we analyzed the specific effects of deletion of the Tom20 or Tom22 receptor domain on mitochondrial protein import. The results were quantified and summarized in Fig. 7. Evidently, many presequence-less proteins, including substrates for another receptor, Tom70, such as polytopic inner membrane proteins, are recognized by Tom20 and Tom22. This suggests that Tom20, together with Tom22, is not a mere receptor for a class of mitochondrial proteins, but a master receptor for most mitochondrial proteins. More interestingly, reduction levels in import efficiencies by deletion of the receptor domains of Tom20 and Tom22 are quite similar. This suggests that the receptor domains of Tom20 and Tom22 are involved in the same pathway for mitochondrial targeting signal recognition (Fig. 8). In addition, because this observation holds for the substrates for Tom70 as well, the currently proposed model (45Rehling P. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 639-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) that substrates for Tom70 recognition are transferred to Tom22, but not Tom20, to receive recognition by only Tom22 (Fig. 8B) is questionable. Rather, the present results suggest that recognition substrates for Tom70 may well be passed on to Tom20 for recognition by both Tom20 and Tom22 (Fig. 8A). Are the receptor domains of Tom20 and Tom22 involved in the same step or sequential steps along the same recognition pathway? A previous study showed that the recognition step involving Tom22 is not earlier than that involving Tom20 (21Kiebler M. Keil P. Schneider H. van der Klei I.J. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1993; 74: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because the cytosolic domain of Tom22 is rich in acidic residues, it may well recognize the basic side of the amphiphilic helix formed by presequences through ionic interactions. Therefore Tom20 and Tom22 may recognize opposite sides of the same presequence in the same step, with Tom20 recognizing the hydrophobic surface and Tom22 the hydrophilic surface (25Brix J. Rüdiger S. Bukau B. Schneider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 46Pfanner N. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R412-R415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This interpretation is supported by the recent finding that in Saccharomyces castellii Tom22 has lost an acidic region, whereas Tom20 gained one during evolution, so Tom20 and Tom22 apparently contribute their domains to a single, composite receptor (47Hulett J.M. Walsh P. Lithgow T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1909-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Alternatively, presequences bound to Tom20 through hydrophobic interactions may be cleared from Tom20 by stronger ionic interactions with the acidic receptor domain of Tom22. It is also possible that Tom22 is not directly involved in the recognition of mitochondrial targeting signals, but instead optimizes the receptor function of Tom20 by, for example, physically linking Tom20 to the TOM40 core complex. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that imported Tom20 was not assembled into the TOM40 complex in the absence of the Tom22 cytosolic domain (Fig. 6B). Further information on the high-resolution structure of the cytosolic domain of Tom22 and its interactions with the receptor domains of Tom20 will be important to discriminate those possibilities. We thank Dr. Katsuyoshi Mihara (Kyushu University) for the gene for PBR, Dr. Steve Gould for the expression plasmid for TEV protease, and members of the Endo laboratory for discussion and comments."

https://openalex.org/W2030338986,"Many proteins of the CLC gene family are Cl(-) channels, whereas others, like the bacterial ecClC-1 or mammalian ClC-4 and -5, mediate Cl(-)/H(+) exchange. Mutating a ""gating glutamate"" (Glu-224 in ClC-4 and Glu-211 in ClC-5) converted these exchangers into anion conductances, as did the neutralization of another, intracellular ""proton glutamate"" in ecClC-1. We show here that neutralizing the proton glutamate of ClC-4 (Glu-281) and ClC-5 (Glu-268), but not replacing it with aspartate, histidine, or tyrosine, rather abolished Cl(-) and H(+) transport. Surface expression was unchanged by these mutations. Uncoupled Cl(-) transport could be restored in the ClC-4(E281A) and ClC-5(E268A) proton glutamate mutations by additionally neutralizing the gating glutamates, suggesting that wild type proteins transport anions only when protons are supplied through a cytoplasmic H(+) donor. Each monomeric unit of the dimeric protein was found to be able to carry out Cl(-)/H(+) exchange independently from the transport activity of the neighboring subunit. NO(3)(-) or SCN(-) transport was partially uncoupled from H(+) countertransport but still depended on the proton glutamate. Inserting proton glutamates into CLC channels altered their gating but failed to convert them into Cl(-)/H(+) exchangers. Noise analysis indicated that ClC-5 switches between silent and transporting states with an apparent unitary conductance of 0.5 picosiemens. Our results are consistent with the idea that Cl(-)/H(+) exchange of the endosomal ClC-4 and -5 proteins relies on proton delivery from an intracellular titratable residue at position 268 (numbering of ClC-5) and that the strong rectification of currents arises from the voltage-dependent proton transfer from Glu-268 to Glu-211."
https://openalex.org/W2085742435,"In Arabidopsis, genetic evidence demonstrates that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) plays a fundamental role in at least four RNA silencing pathways whose functions range from defense against transgenes or viruses to endogene regulation in development and in stress responses. Despite its critical role in RNA silencing, the biochemical activities of RDR6 have yet to be characterized. In this study, we transiently expressed Arabidopsis RDR6 in Nicotiana benthamiana and investigated the biochemical activities of immunopurified RDR6 in vitro. We showed that RDR6 possesses terminal nucleotidyltransferase activity as well as primer-independent RNA polymerase activity on single-stranded RNAs. We found that RDR6 cannot distinguish RNAs with or without a cap or poly(A) tail. We also demonstrated that RDR6 has strong polymerase activity on single-stranded DNA. All these activities require the conserved catalytic Asp867 residue. Our findings have important implications on the processes involving RDR6 in vivo and provide new biochemical insights into the mechanisms of RNA silencing in Arabidopsis.

Meister G. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). siRNAs are produced from long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), which in some organisms are generated from single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) templates by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs). In Caenorhabditis elegans, fungi, and plants, genes encoding RDRs are required for RNA silencing (2Cogoni C. Macino G.

Arabidopsis has six genes that encode potential RDRs, and genetic evidence suggests that RDR1, RDR2, and RDR6 act in different biological processes with RDR6 being the major RDR acting in post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) (3Dalmay T.

It is thought that RDR6 initiates RNA silencing by recognizing “aberrant RNAs” and converting them to dsRNAs, which are then processed into siRNAs. In Arabidopsis, genetic evidence suggests that an RNA that lacks a cap or a poly(A) tail is deemed “aberrant” and is preferentially recognized by the silencing machinery (8Gazzani S. Lawrenson T. Woodward C. Headon D. Sablowski R. Science. 2004; 306: 1046-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 9Herr A.J. Molnar A. Jones A. Baulcombe D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Most eukaryotic organisms also produce microRNAs that are similar to siRNAs in length but the biogenesis of microRNAs does not require RDRs (11Bartel D.P.

Amplification of siRNA production constitutes a major step that enhances the efficiency of RNA silencing and this amplification requires RDRs (12Baulcombe D.C. Science. 2007; 315: 199-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Secondary siRNAs produced by the amplification process can originate from regions of the target mRNA not targeted by the primary siRNAs. The production of siRNAs outside of the region targeted by the initial RNA silencing trigger is known as transitivity (13Sijen T. Fleenor J. Simmer F. Thijssen K.L. Parrish S. Timmons L. Plasterk R.H. Fire A. Cell. 2001; 107: 465-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 14Vaistij F.E. Jones L. Baulcombe D.C.

Cell. 1998; 95: 177-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, the amplification process generates secondary siRNAs that bear a 5′ triphosphate and that are predominantly in antisense orientation to the target mRNA, suggesting that they are directly synthesized by RDR through a primer-independent mechanism (16Pak J. Fire A. Science. 2007; 315: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 17Sijen T. Steiner F.A. Thijssen K.L. Plasterk R.H. Science. 2007; 315: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, it was observed with a GFP transgene containing a modified miR171 binding site that small RNA-guided amplification can probably occur without cleavage of the target mRNA. This led to the hypothesis that an RDR uses the small RNA as a primer to copy the target mRNA to lead to 3′ to 5′ transitivity (18Moissiard G. Parizotto E.A. Himber C. Voinnet O. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2007; 13: 1268-1278Google Scholar). However, the priming hypothesis cannot explain secondary siRNAs originating from regions 3′ to the matching primary siRNAs in the target mRNA. In Arabidopsis, the biogenesis of several types of siRNAs requires RDRs. Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), mediated by 24-nucleotide siRNAs that guide histone and DNA methylation, requires RDR2 (6Xie Z. Johansen L.K. Gustafson A.M. Kasschau K.D. Lellis A.D. Zilberman D. Jacobsen S.E. Carrington J.C. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). PTGS initiated by a sense transgene (S-PTGS) or by infection with cucumber mosaic virus or cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV), requires RDR6 (3Dalmay T. Hamilton A. Rudd S. Angell S. Baulcombe D.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 4Mourrain P. Beclin C. Elmayan T. Feuerbach F. Godon C. Morel J.B. Jouette D. Lacombe A.M. Nikic S.

Plant J. 2004; 38: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). More recently, two other PTGS mechanisms, also RDR6-dependent, were found to regulate endogene expression through two new classes of siRNAs, the trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) (20Allen E. Xie Z. Gustafson A.M. Carrington J.C. Cell. 2005; 121: 207-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 21Vazquez F. Vaucheret H. Rajagopalan R. Lepers C. Gasciolli V.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 18002-18007Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Whereas natural cis-acting siRNAs are involved in stress responses, ta-siRNAs control developmental phase transitions such that the absence of ta-siRNAs underlies the developmental defects of rdr6 mutants (25Peragine A. Yoshikawa M. Wu G. Albrecht H.L. Poethig R.S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2368-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The biogenesis of both types of siRNAs occurs via a two-step process. First, a small RNA (an microRNA or an siRNA) guides the cleavage of a target mRNA. Then, the cleavage fragments are presumably copied into dsRNAs by RDR6 and the dsRNAs are processed into the ta-siRNAs or the natural cis-acting siRNAs. Viral RDRs have been biochemically well characterized. Many viral RDRs use a de novo mechanism of initiation in which the first phosphodiester bond is formed between two nucleoside triphosphates, but some use a primer-dependent mechanism (26Honda A.

Except for the tomato RDR, only QDE-1 from Neurospora crassa and Rdp-1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe are cellular RDRs that have been biochemically characterized (38Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2368-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), but the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of RDR6 has been inferred based on sequence homology with the tomato enzyme and has yet to be confirmed and characterized biochemically. Here we report in vitro enzymatic activities of Arabidopsis RDR6 that was overexpressed and purified from Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We show that RDR6 can indeed copy various ssRNAs into dsRNAs but, contrary to expectations, the presence of a cap or poly(A) tail does not affect its activity. In addition, RDR6 possesses strong polymerase activities on ssDNA templates. These findings provide biochemical insights into the molecular mechanisms of RNA silencing in Arabidopsis. Plasmid ConstructionThe full-length cDNA of RDR6 (3.6 kb) was amplified from the ATG to the stop codon by PCR using the primers R6-1 (5′-ccggaattcgagaaatggggtcagagggaaata-3′) and R6-2 (5′-ccgcggccgcaacataaccttttagagacgtgagc-3′). The resulting amplicon was cloned into pENTR1A (Invitrogen) and the pENTR1A-RDR6 construct was verified by sequencing. The pENTR1A-RDR6 plasmid was amplified by PCR using two complementary primers R6-1m (5′-gaccttgacggggccctgtactttgtg-3′) and R6-2m (5′-cacaaagtacagggccccgtcaaggtc-3′) to substitute the putative catalytic residue Asp located at amino acid 867 by an Ala residue. The pENTR1A-RDR6m plasmid was verified by sequencing. Both RDR6 and RDR6m cDNAs were introduced into the pEG201 vector (40Earley K.W. Haag J.R. Pontes O. Opper K. Juehne T. Song K. Pikaard C.S. Plant J. 2006; 45: 616-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), which contains an HA tag for N-terminal fusion, and the reading frame was verified by sequencing. Plant Growth and TransformationPlants were grown in soil in growth chambers at 22 °C under continuous illumination. Arabidopsis transgenic lines were obtained by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using the floral dip procedure (41Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Agrobacteria containing the plasmids pEG201-RDR6 or pEG201-RDR6m were used to transform both wild-type and rdr6–11 (25Peragine A. Yoshikawa M. Wu G. Albrecht H.L. Poethig R.S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2368-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) plants. Transformants were selected on Murashige and Skoog medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. For each construct, 20 independent transformants in both wild-type and rdr6–11 backgrounds were transferred into soil. T2 plants were selected again on kanamycin-containing medium and transferred into soil for phenotypic analysis. Young flowers were harvested from 6 and 2 individual transgenic lines for 35S::HA-RDR6 and 35S::HA-RDR6m, respectively, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C for Northern analysis. Small RNA Northern Blot AnalysisRNA isolation and Northern blotting were performed as described (42Park W. Li J. Song R. Messing J. Chen X. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1484-1495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μg of total RNA was resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel, transferred to a Zeta-Probe GT membrane (Bio-Rad), and hybridized with an end-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Expression and Purification of HA-RDR6 and HA-RDR6m ProteinsTransient expression of HA-RdRp6 and HA-RdRp6m in N. benthamiana was based on the protocol established by Popescu et al. (43Popescu S.C. Popescu G.V. Bachan S. Zhang Z. Seay M. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4730-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Plasmids pEG201-RDR6, pEG201-RDR6m, and p19 (a viral RNA silencing suppressor from the Tomato bushy stunt virus) were first transformed into A. tumefaciens GV3101. One transformed colony (verified by PCR) for each plasmid was cultured at 28 °C until the A600 reached 1 to 1.5. The bacteria were spun for 15 min at 2,000 × g, resuspended in infiltration media (10 mm MES, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm acetosyringone) to a final A600 of 1, and incubated for 3 to 4 h at room temperature. Bacteria were then washed with 1 volume of fresh infiltration media, and mixed at a 1:1 ratio between Agrobacteria containing pEG201-RDR6 or pEG201-RDR6m and those containing p19. The infiltration of bacterial mixtures was performed with a 1-ml syringe on the abaxial side of leaves of 3-week-old N. benthamiana plants. After 48 h, infiltrated leaves were harvested, ground in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. For protein extraction, 1 volume of tissue powder was mixed with 2 volumes of protein lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 protease inhibitor mixture tablet/20 ml (Roche)), and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged one time for 30 min at 1,000 × g at 4 °C, then three times for 30 min each at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. 1/50 volume of anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche) was added to the supernatant and the mixture was incubated on a rotator (8 rpm) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed once with 20 volumes of protein lysis buffer, 4 times with 20 volumes of the washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 protease inhibitor tablet/20 ml) and finally resuspended in 7 volumes of Storage Buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 20 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 protease inhibitor tablet/20 ml), and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. RNA Template SynthesisSingle-stranded RNA templates were synthesized by in vitro transcription of DNA fragments obtained by PCR amplification from a luciferase/nopaline synthasae chimeric template (supplemental Fig. S2A). The PCR primers were designed to introduce the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence in the correct orientation (supplemental Fig. S2B). PCR fragments were gel purified and then used as templates for in vitro transcription using the MEGAscript kit (Ambion). Reactions were stopped by DNase treatment using 2 units of RQ1 (Promega) for 15 min at 37 °C. The RNA products (full-length and truncated forms) were resolved in a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. The bands corresponding to the full-length RNAs were excised, cut into small pieces, and incubated with 3 volumes of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaOAc, 10 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS) for 1 h at 37°C. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the RNAs were precipitated and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate/water at a final concentration ranging between 0.1 and 0.5 μg/μl. The purity of the RNAs was determined by analysis on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. Capped RNAs were generated from gel-purified in vitro transcripts using the ScriptCap™ m7G Capping System (Epicenter). The reactions were stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction and the RNAs were precipitated as previously described. Polyadenylated RNAs (RNAs-An) were synthesized using poly(A) polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The reactions were carried out with 2 μg of RNA, 1 × PAP (20 mm Tris-HCL pH 7.0, 0.6 mm MnCl2, 0.02 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol) reaction buffer, 1 mm ATP, 600 units of PAP enzyme in a 25-μl final volume for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by incubation at 65 °C for 10 min and were directly loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel and the polyadenylated RNAs were excised from the gel and isolated. RDR Activity AssaysRDR activity assays were performed according to Makeyev and Bamford (38Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1417-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, assays were conducted in 30-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 20 mm NH4OAc, 2% (w/v) PEG4000, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 0.1 mm UTP, and 0.8 unit/μl of RNasin. The final quantity of the ssRNA templates was between 5 and 15 pmol. Unless indicated otherwise, the mixture was supplemented with 0.15 mCi/ml of [α-32P]UTP (∼3000 Ci/mmol). Reactions were initiated by adding 2 μl of HA-RDR6 bound on anti-HA-agarose beads, and incubated on a rotator (8 rpm) for 2 h at room temperature (25–27 °C). Reactions were stopped by adding 50 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 2% SDS), 90 μg of proteinase K (Fermentas) in a final volume of 100 μl, followed by incubation for 20 min at 65 °C. The reaction mixtures were extracted with phenolchloroform and the RNAs were precipitated, resolved on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels, and detected by autoradiography or with a PhosphorImager. Nuclease TreatmentsFor RNase I, RNase H, and RQ1 (DNase) treatments, the RDR reactions were supplemented with 14 μl of the RNase I buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2), the RNase H buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol), or the RQ1 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 30 mm MgSO4, 30 mm CaCl2), respectively. Treatments were started by the addition of 50 units of RNase I (New England Biolabs), 10 units of RNase H (New England Biolabs), or 5 units of RQ1 (Promega) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 20 min. The reactions were stopped by proteinase K treatment as described previously. Assays for Priming Activity with an RNA Oligonucleotide30 pmol of miR173* (5′-rGrArUrUrCrUrCrUrGrUrGrUrArArGrCrGrArArArG-3′) was mixed with 15 pmol of the 246R template in a 10-μl solution containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and 100 mm KCl. The mixture was incubated for 3 min at 95 °C and then for 10 min at 42 °C, and then used for RDR assay as previously described. A Conserved Catalytic Residue in Eukaryotic RDRs Is Critical for RDR6 Function in VivoTo study the biochemical properties of Arabidopsis RDR6, we sought to immunopurify sufficient quantities of RDR6 from plants. To this end, full-length RDR6 cDNA was cloned behind the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and in-frame with an N-terminal HA tag. The 35S::HA-RDR6 construct was used to generate transgenic plants in the rdr6–11 mutant background. rdr6–11 plants showed downward curling of rosette leaves (Fig. 1A) (25Peragine A. Yoshikawa M. Wu G. Albrecht H.L. Poethig R.S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2368-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). All 20 independent 35S::HA-RDR6 rdr6–11 transgenic lines analyzed showed a complete restoration of the wild-type seedling phenotype (Fig. 1A), suggesting that HA-RDR6 was functional. To further confirm this, an RNA blot analysis was performed to quantify the levels of two ta-siRNAs (ASRP255, ASRP1511) and a microRNA, miR173, using total RNAs extracted from 6 of 20 35S::HA-RDR6 rdr6–11 transgenic lines (Fig. 1B). Both ta-siRNAs were present in wild-type plants and were not detected in rdr6–11 mutant plants, whereas miR173, used as a loading control, was not affected by the rdr6 mutation (Fig. 1B) (21Vazquez F.

A previous study on two RDR6 homologs, QDE-1 (N. crassa) and Rdp-1 (S. pombe), showed that the conserved aspartate residue (located at amino acid 1011 in QDE1 and amino acid 903 in Rdp-1) is essential for RDR activity (38Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1417-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 39Sugiyama T. Cam H. Verdel A. Moazed D. Grewal S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We introduced a point mutation into the RDR6 cDNA to substitute the corresponding Asp (at position 867) with Ala. As expected, when the mutant construct (35S::HA-RDR6m) was introduced into rdr6–11, none of 20 independent transformants showed any rescue of the rdr6 mutant phenotype (Fig. 1A). The ASRP255 and ASRP1511 ta-siRNAs were not detected in two 35S::HA-RDR6m rdr6–11 transgenic lines tested (Fig. 1B). These results indicated that the Asp867 residue was essential for RDR6 activity. The HA-RDR6m protein served as a negative control in our biochemical analysis of RDR6 in vitro. RDR6 Has Two Distinguishable Activities in VitroTo investigate the biochemical properties of RDR6, we needed to immunopurify relatively large amounts of RDR6 from plants. Although the HA-RDR6 protein could be immunopurified from 35S::HA-RDR6 rdr6–11 plants (supplemental Fig. S1), the amount of the protein was too little for the large numbers of assays we wished to perform. We sought to obtain larger quantities of the protein through transient expression of 35S::HA-RDR6 in N. benthamiana leaves. We found that on average 20-fold more HA-RDR6 was purified with anti-HA-agarose beads when we incubated 10-fold less tissue from infiltrated N. benthamiana leaves than from Arabidopsis transgenic seedlings (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, we used immunopurified HA-RDR6 expressed in N. benthaniana for all our subsequent biochemical assays. The purity of our RDR6 preparation was evaluated by gel electrophoresis followed by SYPRO RUBY staining (supplemental Fig. S1). Although the preparation had very few contaminating proteins, it was essential that the RDR6m preparation was included in the activity assays as a control to ensure that the observed activity was due to RDR6 instead of a contaminating protein. For RDR assays, we first synthesized ssRNAs of various sizes by in vitro transcription (Fig. 2A). Each ssRNA was named by its size in nucleotides followed by the letter F or R to indicate its forward or reverse orientation as compared with the DNA template (sequence in supplemental Fig. S2). The ssRNAs were then gel-purified and used as templates in RDR6 activity assays in the presence of [α-32P]UTP as well as all four cold NTPs. The first assays using HA-RDR6 and HA-RDR6m were performed with an increasing quantity (from 1 to 27 pmol) of the 185F template. The reaction products, containing the radioisotope, were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and detected by phosphorimaging (Fig. 2B). Reactions performed with HA-RDR6 showed a major product, corresponding in size to the 185F template, and the quantity of the product was proportional to that of the template (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4). In contrast, no products were observed in the reaction performed with HA-RDR6m (Fig. 2B, lane 5). This confirmed that the products obtained with HA-RDR6 were due to HA-RDR6 instead of a contaminating protein. Therefore, RDR6 was able to use a ssRNA as a substrate to generate an RNA product of a similar size. To stay within the linear range, all subsequent RDR assays were"

In the standard model, magnetic field lines break and reconnect instantaneously at places where the field mapping is discontinuous. However, another mode may operate where the magnetic field mapping is continuous but shows steep gradients: The field lines may slip across each other. Soft x-ray observations of fast bidirectional motions of coronal loops, observed by the Hinode spacecraft, support the existence of this slipping magnetic reconnection regime in the Sun's corona. This basic process should be considered when interpreting reconnection, both on the Sun and in laboratory-based plasma experiments."

In humans, XOR catalyzes the hydroxylation of hypoxanthine to xanthine as well as xanthine to uric acid, and the mammalian enzyme exists in two alternative forms of the same gene product. Normally, the enzyme exists in a dehydrogenase form (xanthine dehydrogenase) but can be readily converted to an oxidase form (XO) by oxidation of sulfhydryl residues or by limited proteolysis (3Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Xanthine dehydrogenase shows a preference for NAD+ as the oxidizing substrate (although it is also able to react with O2), whereas XO is unable to react with NAD+ and uses O2 exclusively (3Hille R. Nishino T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). This conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to XO is thought to be relevant in the context of ischemia-reperfusion pathology (4Nishino T. Okamoto K. Kawaguchi Y. Hori H. Matsumura T. Eger B.T. Pai E.F. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24883-24894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a target of drugs against gout and hyperuricemia and is often targeted in tandem in chemotherapeutic regimens (5Elion G.B. Science. 1989; 244: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Excellent reviews describing XOR in pharmacology and human pathology are available (6Pacher P. Nivorozhkin A. Szabo C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 87-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 7Berry C.E. Hare J.M. J. Physiol. 2004; 555: 589-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar).Like the human enzyme, the bovine enzyme is a 290-kDa homodimer, each monomer having a molybdenum center plus two [2Fe-2S] clusters (with each iron coordinated by a pair of cysteines) and FAD. Oxidative hydroxylation of the purine substrate occurs at the molybdenum center, which results in the two-electron reduction of the enzyme. After internal electron transfer via the [2Fe-2S] centers to the FAD, reducing equivalents are passed to the final electron acceptor (O2 or NAD+). The crystal structure of the bovine enzyme has been determined (8Enroth C. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Nishino T. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), and it shows that the four redox-active centers of each monomer are found in separate, distinctly folding domains.The catalytic sequence of XOR is thought to be initiated by abstraction of a proton from the Mo–OH group by a universally conserved active site glutamate residue (9Huber R. Hof P. Duarte R.O. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. LeGall J. Hille R. Archer M. Romão M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8846-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), followed by nucleophilic attack of the resulting Mo–O- unit on the carbon center to be hydroxylated and concomitant hydride transfer to the Mo=S of the molybdenum center (Fig. 1). This reaction yields an LMoIV(SH)(OR) intermediate, with OR representing the now hydroxylated product coordinated to the molybdenum via its newly introduced hydroxyl group. The catalytic sequence is completed by displacement of the bound product from the molybdenum coordination sphere by hydroxide from solvent water, electron transfer out of the molybdenum center to the FAD (via the [2Fe-2S] centers), and deprotonation of the MoIV-SH to give the original oxidized LMoVIOS(OH) form of the center. The specific sequence of these latter events varies from one substrate to another as well as with the reaction conditions, but the LMoIV(SH)(OR) species is considered to be an obligatory intermediate. When electron transfer precedes product dissociation, a transient LMoVS(OR) species is generated that gives rise to the well characterized “very rapid” EPR signal of the molybdenum center.In addition to the glutamate residue thought to act as a general base in initiating the reaction, another highly conserved residue in the active site of the xanthine-utilizing enzymes (but not the closely related enzymes that oxidize aldehydes) is Arg-310 (numbering in xanthine dehydrogenase from Rhodobacter capsulatus, Arg-880 in the bovine enzyme) (10Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkuhler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, this residue lies some 10 Å from the molybdenum center, too far to participate directly in catalysis. In the structure of the R. capsulatus enzyme with the mechanism-based inhibitor alloxanthine, however, Arg-310 is hydrogen-bonded to the pyrimidine subnucleus of the heterocycle via one of its carbonyl groups (10Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkuhler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Also, in a model of urate bound to reduced enzyme based on the crystal structure of the aldehyde oxidoreductase from Desulfovibrio gigas (9Huber R. Hof P. Duarte R.O. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. LeGall J. Hille R. Archer M. Romão M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8846-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), the equivalent Arg is suggested to interact similarly with bound product.FIGURE 2The active site molybdenum center of the bovine xanthine oxidase (PDB accession code 1FIQ) with corresponding residue numbers for the Rhodobacter capsulatus enzyme in parentheses (modified from (8Enroth C.

Panel A shows the view from the perspective of an approaching substrate. The molybdenum itself is shown in teal blue, with apical and planar oxygen atoms (shown in red), a planar sulfur (shown in yellow), and the enedithiolate of a pterin ring in the metal's coordination sphere.

The two representations shown differ in being rotated 90° about the vertical axis, with panel B being 90° right of panel A. Substrate wedges between Phe-1009 and Phe-914 in binding at the active site. As shown, the positions of the Mo=O and Mo=S groups of the molybdenum coordination sphere have been reversed between apical and planar positions from those given in the Protein Data Bank file, given the evidence that it is the Mo=O rather than Mo=S that occupies the apical position of the square pyramidal coordination sphere of the molybdenum (as discussed in Ref. 25Hille R. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 2006: 1913-1926Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have recently demonstrated that Arg-310 of the R. capsulatus enzyme plays an important role in catalysis, contributing ∼4.5 kcal/mol toward transition state stabilization, and accounting for a 2 × 104-fold increase in rate acceleration with xanthine as substrate (11Pauff J.M. Hemann C.F. Jünemann N. Leimkühler S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12785-12790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Arg-310 (Arg-880 in the bovine enzyme) appears to lower the activation energy for the reaction by stabilizing negative charge accumulation on the heterocycle through an electrostatic interaction with the C6 carbonyl oxygen of substrate. This in turn implies that substrate binds in an orientation opposite to that seen in the structure of the (reduced) enzyme in complex with the mechanism-based inhibitor alloxanthine but like that seen in the model of urate bound to the D. gigas aldehyde oxidoreductase (9Huber R. Hof P. Duarte R.O. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. LeGall J. Hille R. Archer M. Romão M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8846-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by a kinetic study utilizing a homologous series of purine substrates, which fell into two groups (11Pauff J.M. Hemann C.F. Jünemann N. Leimkühler S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12785-12790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Those that are effective substrates of the wild-type enzyme, presumably binding in an orientation similar to xanthine and making use of the catalytic contribution of Arg-310 to rate acceleration, were strongly affected by mutation of Arg-310 to methionine. On the other hand, those that react slowly with wild-type enzyme (in particular 2,6-diaminopurine and 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine) have functional groups at position 6 (amino and methyl, respectively) that prevented interaction with Arg-310. It was concluded that the poor substrates bound in an inverted orientation to that of xanthine, accounting for both their low reactivity with wild-type enzyme and relative insensitivity to loss of the active site arginine (11Pauff J.M. Hemann C.F. Jünemann N. Leimkühler S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12785-12790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This same principle of orientation is expected to hold true in the case of transition state stabilization by Arg-880 in the bovine enzyme.To further examine the manner in which substrate orientation influences the manner in which the catalytic machinery of xanthine oxidoreductase is utilized, and to directly test our previous hypothesis regarding substrate orientation, we have crystallized bovine xanthine oxidase with the slow substrate 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine (HMP) added to the mother liquor immediately prior to mounting and flash-freezing the crystals. We present here the structure at 2.3 Å resolution of the enzyme-substrate complex trapped at an intermediate stage in catalysis. The structure clearly shows substrate/product coordinated to the molybdenum center in an end-on fashion as previously proposed, and with the purine ring in an orientation fully consistent with our proposed mode of binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials–Magnetic bases for use with the automated express crystallography system at SGX-CAT were obtained from MAR-USA (Evanston, IL). Mounted cryoloops, magnetic cryovials, and crystal growth materials were obtained from Hampton Research (Aliso Viejo, CA). All chemicals and reagents were obtained at the highest quality/purity available from Sigma-Aldrich.Isolation of Xanthine Oxidase–Xanthine oxidase was isolated from fresh, unpasteurized bovine milk (Waterman Farm, Ohio State University) according to published methods (12Massey V. Brumby P.E. Komai H. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1682-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The milk was obtained from a single animal, so as to minimize any heterogeneity in the qualities and characteristics of the isolated protein. Isolated enzyme was stored in N2(l) and passed down a Sephadex G-25 column to remove salicylate prior to use.Crystallization, Data Acquisition, and Structure Determination–Crystals were grown via the batch method, initially following previous conditions (13Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Enroth C. Sato M. Nishino T. Pai E.F. Nishino T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1656-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and using microbridges to hold the batch solutions in the sealed wells of a 24-well tray. After a review of the literature (14Rayment I. Structure. 2002; 10: 147-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), modifications were made in constructing the batch solutions. The most important modification involved premixing the enzyme and precipitant solution volumes together in an Eppendorf tube with very light agitation (no more then 5 s) prior to transfer into the concave indentation of the microbridge. The batch solutions contained 20 μl of enzyme solution mixed with 10 μl of the precipitant solution. We were also able to obtain similar crystals at half these volumes.The final conditions that yielded the best crystals were a precipitant solution of 12–14% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m potassium phosphate at initial pH 6.5, and 0.2 mm EDTA. The enzyme solution contained 10 mg/ml XO in 40 mm Tris-HCl initial pH 7.8, 20 mm pyrophosphate initial pH 8.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The enzyme solution was allowed to sit on ice for 1 h following the addition of dithiothreitol, prior to beginning the construction of the well solutions. The final pH of the well solutions was 7.2 ± 0.1. Crystals grew after 2–3 days at 25 °C in darkness. Initially, we were only able to obtain large numbers of stellate clusters, owing to a high number of nucleation sites within the protein-precipitant batch solution. By lowering the precipitant concentration and substituting polyethylene glycol 8000 for polyethylene glycol 4000, we were able to obtain XO crystals in the form of rectangular plates over the same timeframe. These ranged from 0.1 to 1.0 mm in their longest dimension.A 40–45% polyethylene glycol 200 solution at pH 9.0 containing all proportions of the enzyme and precipitant solutions was used as the cryoprotectant solution. This was introduced by buffer exchange using a micropipette. Following an exchange of greater than the original batch volume, the substrate (also in the same cryoprotectant solution) was introduced from a stock solution to give a 1 mm concentration in the new batch solution. Crystals were mounted and frozen after 1 min. Initial crystals were screened on the home rotating anode source at the Ohio State University. Final diffraction data were collected at Argonne National Laboratory on the SGX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. beamline using a wavelength of 0.9793 Å and an MARCCD 165 detector. Data sets were collected at 2.3-Å resolution for the XO·HMP complex.Data were processed using the MOSFLM package of the CCP4 program suite (15Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr.

The structure of the enzyme was determined by molecular replacement using the MOLREP package of CCP4, with protein data bank file 1FIQ as the search model (8Enroth C. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T.

Initially, non-crystallographic symmetry restraints (set at “medium” in the REFMAC interface) between analogous cofactors and domains of the two subunits of the XO dimer were used, but in subsequent rounds of refinement, removing the NCS restraints entirely resulted in the lowest free R-factor. The weighting term for geometric restraints was also adjusted in REFMAC to minimize Rfree.The 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine molecule was constructed using the PRODRG2 server (22Schuettelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar), and the resulting PDB file was built into the corresponding electron density observed in the XO active site using COOT and verified also in O (23Emsley P.

Following the merging of the HMP with the refined XO structure, the resulting structure was refined again using restrained refinement in REFMAC.

This was particularly true of residues 1316–1328 of one of the two monomers, which were added to fit ordered electron density, as was residue 1292 (glutamate), which was also absent in the previous model structure. The asymmetric unit possessed one molecule of the homodimeric enzyme.As in previous structures of XOR, each monomer consisted of four domains; two N-terminal domains each with a [2Fe-2S] cluster, an FAD-binding domain, and a molybdenum portion of the protein with the molybdenum center sandwiched between two domains at the C-terminal end of the polypeptide (see Fig. 4). All cofactors were accounted for in the electron density map and were successfully fit into the crystal structure. The r.m.s. displacements for the α-carbons of each monomer in the final refined XO·HMP structure relative to that of 1FIQ were 0.345 and 0.340 Å, respectively. The relative orientations and distances between the redox-active centers were essentially identical to those reported previously (8Enroth C. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Nishino T. Pai E.F. Proc.

The omit maps were overlaid with the final model (PDB code 3B9J). The active site in B possesses the catalytic intermediate of HMP bound to the molybdenum oxygen O2 at a distance of 1.6 Å. A and B, 2Fo - Fc maps contoured at +1.0 σ for both active sites of XOR. C and D, Fo - Fc electron density maps calculated after omitting the HMP molecule and contoured at +2.5 σ.

These residues are scattered at random throughout the 2442 amino acids of the structure. Twelve of these residues are fit within strongly observed electron density, and three of these residues are in regions of the structure for which somewhat weaker electron density was observed. These twelve amount to less than 1% of the amino acid residues in the refined structure. The latter three (Leu-1316 and Ala-1324 of one monomer and Glu-1292 of the other) were absent in the search model (1FIQ); the first two were added to fit newly ordered density beyond residue 1315 as mentioned above.2-Hydroxy-6-methylpurine in the Active Site–In both subunits of the crystal structure, the heterocycle is docked with its C8 approaching the equatorial Mo–OH oxygen atom (O2) of the molybdenum center (Fig. 4). In doing so, it stacks on Phe-914 and has a side-on interaction with Phe-1009, consistent with previous work with the inhibitors alloxanthine and FYX-051 (5Elion G.B.

As shown in Fig. 4, the carbonyl oxygen at the C2 position of HMP interacts with Arg-880 in both active sites, while the methyl group at C6 is directed away from this residue, projecting into a hydrophobic pocket. This is the orientation expected on the basis of our previous work (11Pauff J.M. Hemann C.F. Jünemann N. Leimkühler S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12785-12790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), in which it was suggested that this slow substrate binds in an orientation that precludes effective utilization of Arg-880 and presumably opposite that of the physiological substrate xanthine. The carbonyl at the C6 position of xanthine (Fig. 3) allows for effective use of Arg-880 in stabilizing negative charge accumulation at this position, but that at C2 is expected to be significantly less effective. With the C6 carbonyl replaced by a methyl group in HMP, the more favorable interaction is lost and the heterocycle binds in an inverted orientation that is less catalytically effective.FIGURE 3Proposed orientation of xanthine in the active site of xanthine oxidoreductase (Ref.11Pauff J.M.

In this second site, there is obviously continuous electron density connecting C8 and the oxygen, indicating that catalysis has proceeded to the point of C–O bond formation (Fig. 4B). The distance here between Glu-1261 and N9 of HMP is 2.9 Å, suggesting a hydrogen bonding interaction. The C8 of substrate is 3.4 and 3.6 Å from the molybdenum in the two active sites of the dimer. The Mo–S distance in both sites is 2.0 Å with a mean coordinate error of 0.2 Å, most consistent with a Mo=S bond and either a MoVI or MoV oxidation state for the metal, but not MoIV with a Mo–SH ligand. Notwithstanding the known difficulties in determining metal-ligand distances that are associated with Fourier truncation artifacts in the vicinity of a metal as heavy as molybdenum (27Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), particularly at the present resolution, we consider it likely that the Mo–S distance reflects a Mo=S, implying that the metal is in the MoV valence state (see below). Indeed, under conditions very similar to those explored here large amounts of the EPR active MoV state are known to accumulate (28Bray R.C. George G.N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1985; 13: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29McWhirter R.B. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23724-23731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The two active sites appear to represent different points in the catalytic sequence. The first site (Fig. 4A), with the heterocycle positioned somewhat further from the molybdenum center, most likely represents the Michaelis complex for the reaction, with substrate positioned for hydroxylation but no C–O bond formation and the molybdenum center in the MoVI oxidation state prior to substrate coordination. In the second site (Fig. 4B), the reaction has obviously progressed to the point of C–O bond formation given the relatively shorter refined distance (with mean coordinate error considered) and evidence of 2Fo - Fc electron density between the HMP-C8 and planar molybdenum oxygen, presumably also then with reduction of the molybdenum to a +5 or +4 valence state. That the Mo–S distance suggests a Mo=S rather than Mo–SH in turn means that the molybdenum is at the MoV rather than MoIV state, an interpretation consistent with the known kinetic behavior of the enzyme with HMP in which high levels (>80%) of the species giving rise to the “very rapid” EPR signal accumulate in the steady state. The HMP molecule was not defined as being bonded to the planar molybdenum oxygen in either active site prior to refinement, and thus the distance given here is refined as separate MoOOS and HMP monomers in the electron density.The orientation of bound product to the molybdenu"

Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) unmasked a role for the regulatory domain in maintaining Epac in a basal autoinhibited state; deletion of its N terminus converted REM-cdc25-Epac to a constitutively active (cAMP-independent) Rap GEF. The addition of the N terminus in trans to the active C terminus was able to inhibit its GEF activity, and this inhibition could be relieved by cAMP. Mutation analysis indicated a role for the N terminus sequence 321VLVLE325 (as in Epac1) as part of this inhibitory domain, and accordingly, disruption of this domain by conversion of this sequence to 321AAAAA325 (Ala5) in the context of full-length Epac rendered it constitutively active. Thus, a model emerged where at low cAMP, the regulatory domain forms a rigid interaction with the C-terminal GEF, blocking the access of its substrate, Rap. Upon cAMP binding, a conformational change leads to the opening of the Rap-binding domain and activation. The DEP domain is not involved in cAMP-dependent Epac activation (14Kraemer A. Rehmann H.R.

To address the mechanisms involved, the role of cAMP-dependent effector pathways, i.e. Epac and PKA, were investigated. TSH-dependent Rap1 activation shows a rapid onset followed by a sustained phase (Fig. 1a). PKA inhibition by H89 did not affect this profile (Fig. 1b), whereas PKA-dependent CREB phosphorylation was completely blocked. Consistent with these results, TSH activated Rap1-S179A, a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (Fig. 1c) (25Altschuler D. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7527-7531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TSH-dependent activation of Rap1 is independent of PKA action. Epac and PKA Act Synergistically in TSH-mediated Cell Proliferation–cAMP-dependent, PKA-independent activation of Rap1b suggested the involvement of Epac, a Rap GEF enriched in thyroid cells (9Kawasaki H.

Expression of Epac1 in PCCL3 thyroid cells was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1d). Its ability to activate Rap1 was assessed upon stimulation with 8-pMeOPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, a novel cAMP analog able to discriminate between Epac and PKA (10Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat.

Thus, in PCCL3 cells, Epac1 is present and fully functional. We hypothesized that Epac activation of Rap1b might represent the PKA-independent event in cAMP-stimulated mitogenesis. Since the mitogenic effects of cAMP are only manifested in the presence of a co-mitogen (i.e. FBS, IGF-1), we tested whether under these conditions, activators of each pathway, Epac and PKA, alone or in combination, could trigger a mitogenic response. Results presented in Fig. 1f indicate that although Epac-specific analog 8-pMeOPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is not able to trigger a response, it significantly potentiates the action of the PKA-specific analog 6-Bz-cAMP (26Christensen A.E.

Activation of Epac Is Required for TSH-mediated Mitogenesis–To assess whether Epac activation is involved in the physiological response of TSH, an Epac inhibitor is required. Since no specific pharmacological inhibitor is available, a dominant negative genetic approach was devised. A DEP domain present at Epac's N-terminal end (Fig. 2a), which anchors it to a particulate fraction, is required for function (13de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although a DEP-binding partner is currently unknown, we reasoned that expression of a small fragment containing the DEP domain, but devoid of catalytic activity, might displace endogenous Epac from its normal intracellular compartment and block the ability of cAMP to activate endogenous Rap1b. Among the constructs tested, a ∼42-kDa fragment encompassing Epac1 DEP-CBD-REM (N-Epac) was the most stable and was therefore selected to assess its activity as dominant negative (Fig. 2a). We used HEK cells as an initial model system since cAMP did not activate Rap1 in these cells unless exogenous Epac is expressed (Figs. 1d and 2b), thus allowing us to specifically test the effect of N-Epac on cAMP-Epac activity. Co-expression of N-Epac inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the ability of Epac to activate Rap1b upon forskolin stimulation (Fig. 2b). N-Epac, however, did not affect the ability of forskolin to stimulate CREB phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 1). Next, the ability of N-Epac to inhibit TSH action in PCCL3 thyroid cells was assessed. We used myc-N-Epac in transient transfection assays to assess its ability to interfere with TSH stimulation of G1/S progression. As shown in Fig. 2c, transfection of control myc-WT-Rap1b did not induce any proliferative response in these cells (20Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but expression of N-Epac blocked TSH-mediated G1/S progression, demonstrating that Epac activation is critical for cAMP-mediated mitogenesis in thyroid cells. Role of Epac's DEP Domain on cAMP-mediated Mitogenesis–Several scenarios could explain N-Epac's inhibitory action. Although cAMP (i.e. TSH) did not relieve the inhibition, it is possible that the presence of the VLVLE inhibitory domain in N-Epac (15Rehmann H. Rueppel A. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) could act in trans to block endogenous Epac. Hence, inactivation of the VLVLE domain by alanine substitutions (Ala5) (15Rehmann H. Rueppel A. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) should reverse N-Epac's inhibitory action. However, N-Epac-Ala5 remained a potent inhibitor (Fig. 2d). These results are inconsistent with a direct inhibition of Epac by N-Epac; rather, they indicate a dominant negative action consistent with a DEP-mediated displacement of a critical Epac signaling complex by N-Epac. To directly assess this possibility, we tested the effect of an N-Epac construct lacking the first 148 amino acids (ΔDEP-NEpac, Fig. 2a). Despite expression levels similar to N-Epac, ΔDEP-N-Epac (Fig. 2d, inset) did not affect TSH-stimulated mitogenesis, indicating that the absence of the DEP abolished the dominant negative action of N-Epac. These results also rule out the possibility that the inhibitory action of N-Epac was mediated by its ability to titer cAMP levels since the loss-of-function ΔDEP-N-Epac still binds cAMP (13de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 27Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. De Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, N-Epac acts as a bona fide dominant negative, and its inhibition of cAMP-mediated mitogenesis underscores our proposal that Epac and PKA synergize in the transduction of cAMP mitogenic signaling. These results indicate that proper Epac compartmentalization is required for transduction of the cAMP signal. If Epac 1–148 is required for Epac's activity, then two predictions could be tested. An Epac construct missing this targeting domain should be unable to transduce the cAMP response, and the inhibitory action of R279E Epac, a mutation that inhibits cAMP binding (28Qiao J. Mei F.C. Popov V.L. Vergara L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26581-26586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), should be inactive in the absence of the DEP domain. These predictions were confirmed experimentally; ΔDEP-Epac cannot mediate Rap1 activation by forskolin (Fig. 2e), and the inhibitory effect of Epac-R279E on G1/S is lost when its DEP is deleted (Fig. 2f). Thus, these combined results demonstrate that Epac activity is required for cAMP-mediated G1/S entry, in ways that are dependent on its proper targeting via the N-terminal region containing the DEP domain. Although the precise mechanisms whereby cAMP stimulates mitogenesis are poorly understood, it is becoming evident that cAMP engages both PKA-dependent and PKA-independent events. Utilizing both cellular (20Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and mouse models (19Ribeiro-Neto F. Leon A. Urbani-Brocard J. Lou L. Nyska A. Altschuler D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46868-46875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we have previously demonstrated that Rap1b, a substrate for Epac and PKA, plays an essential role in cAMP-mediated cell proliferation. Our studies established a critical role for active and phosphorylated Rap1, indicating its potential function as integrator of both PKA-dependent and PKA-independent cAMP effector pathways. However, prior to this report, it was unclear whether and how the PKA-independent component functions in the cAMP mitogenic response. In this study, we have established a role for Epac, acting synergistically with PKA, in cAMP-mediated cell proliferation. Moreover, we have demonstrated that Epac activity is strictly dependent on its proper compartmentalization, which is determined by its DEP domain. In PCCL3, the PKA-independent effect of cAMP in mitogenesis appears to solely involve Epac activation of Rap1b. PKA-independent Epac activation of Rap1 by cAMP has been reported in other thyroid cells (20Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Surprisingly, in primary dog thyrocyte, apart from Rap1 activation, Epac action played no apparent role in any aspect of cAMP biology, including mitogenesis (30Dremier S. Milenkovic M. Blancquaert S. Dumont J.E. Doskeland S.O. Maenhaut C. Roger P.P. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 4612-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although one could envision numerous scenarios for the lack of action of activated Epac on this model, we note that it has been difficult to unequivocally implicate Epac activation in any specific biological response to cAMP, mainly, contrary to PKA, due to lack of a specific Epac inhibitor. Until now, the experimental approaches have been restricted to the use of PKA-or Epac-selective analogs together with specific inhibitors of PKA. An important contribution of the present report, illustrated by the newly generated Epac inhibitor, N-Epac, is that cAMP-mediated mitogenesis depends on both Epac as well as PKA activation. In this way, the synergy between PKA and Epac in cAMP-mediated G1/S entry reflects the essential role of activated and phosphorylated Rap1b in this vital process (19Ribeiro-Neto F. Leon A.

Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have demonstrated that Epac activity is strictly dependent on its proper compartmentalization mediated by its DEP domain. This was clearly shown by disrupting the DEP-dependent subcellular targeting of Epac, which abolished both cAMP-Epac-mediated Rap1 activation and TSH-stimulated cell proliferation. This argues that Epac, Rap, and PKA are ordered in a signaling complex that is critical for the mitogenic action of cAMP. The precise molecular composition of such a complex in thyroid cells is currently being investigated. Elegant experiments in cardiac myocytes revealed that Epac1 is present in a signaling complex containing minimally the phosphodiesterase PDE4D3, PKA, mAKAP, and the extracellular-regulated kinase ERK5 (31Dodge-Kafka K.L. Kapiloff M.S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Dodge-Kafka K.L. Soughayer J. Pare G.C. Carlisle Michel J.J. Langeberg L.K. Kapiloff M.S. Scott J.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In this context, cAMP promotes a PKA-independent activation of Rap1, which inhibits ERK5 activity and its inhibitory action on PDE, resulting in a negative feedback loop that controls cAMP levels. In this model, Epac interacts with the mAKAP complex via PDE4D3, but whether the DEP domain is involved was not addressed in those studies. As in cardiac myocytes, it is possible that the postulated Epac-binding partner involved in cAMP-mediated mitogenesis in thyroid cells may turn out to be a PDE or an AKAP-like protein. In any case, we predict that such a target shall display a stringent dependence on Epac's DEP domain. The DEP domain comprises a module of ∼90–100 residues, originally identified in Disheveled, Egl-10, and Pleckstrin (33Ponting C.P. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 245-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and later found in other proteins involved in signal transduction, such as RGS and Epac (34Civera C. Simon B. Stier G. Sattler M. Macias M.J. Proteins. 2005; 58: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Structurally, they all share an α/β fold, with a conserved helical core and distinct β-sheets, that most likely play a role in binding specificity (27Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A.

Biol. 2000; 7: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) suggested a role for DEP as a membrane-anchoring device. Specifically, in Epac, cellular fractionation studies showed that the DEP domain served to localize it to the particulate fraction (13de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Likewise, in contrast to N-Epac, we found that ΔDEP-N-Epac, ΔDEP-Epac, and ΔDEP-Epac-R279E, mutants devoid of dominant negative action, localize primarily to the soluble fraction and are enriched in the nuclear compartment (not shown). Thus, the absence of the DEP domain unmasks a potential cryptic nuclear localization signal. These results raise the intriguing possibility that post-translational modifications affecting the interaction of DEP with its putative membrane target might be involved in regulating intracellular Epac localization and function. Although the identity of the elusive Epac's DEP-binding partner is for the moment unknown, our results predict that it plays a critical role in cAMP-mediated mitogenesis, and possibly, other cellular processes regulated by cAMP.

We report here that PINCH-1, a cytoplasmic component of cell-extracellular matrix adhesions, is required for protection of multiple types of cancer cells from apoptosis. Furthermore, using HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells as a model system, we have investigated the signaling pathway through which PINCH-1 contributes to apoptosis resistance. Loss of PINCH-1 markedly increases the level of Bim and promotes Bim translocation to mitochondria, resulting in activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Depletion of Bim completely blocked apoptosis induced by the loss of PINCH-1. Thus, PINCH-1 contributes to apoptosis resistance through suppression of Bim. Mechanistically, PINCH-1 suppresses Bim not only transcriptionally but also post-transcriptionally. PINCH-1 promotes activating phosphorylation of Src family kinase and ERK1/2. Consistent with this, ERK1/2-mediated Ser69 phosphorylation of Bim, a key signal for turnover of Bim, is suppressed by the removal of PINCH-1. Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of multiple types of apoptosis-resistant cancer cells on PINCH-1 and provide new insights into the molecular mechanism by which cancer cells are protected from apoptosis.

Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of multiple types of apoptosis-resistant cancer cells on PINCH-1 and provide new insights into the molecular mechanism by which cancer cells are protected from apoptosis. Apoptosis is a fundamental cellular process that is essential for normal development in embryo and tissue homeostasis in adult. Resistance to apoptosis is crucial for pathogenesis and progression of many common human diseases, including cancer (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22623) Google Scholar). It has been shown, for example, that the metastatic potential of human cancer cells is strictly linked to increased resistance to apoptosis (2Glinsky G.V. Glinsky V.V. Ivanova A.B. Hueser C.J. Cancer Lett. 1997; 115: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Experimental modulation of key antiapoptotic or proapoptotic factors alters metastatic efficiency (reviewed in Ref. 3Mehlen P. Puisieux A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Thus, apoptosis provides a major barrier to metastasis (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22623) Google Scholar, 3Mehlen P. Puisieux A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Overcoming resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis, therefore, represents both a challenge and an exciting opportunity in cancer biology and therapy. To achieve this goal, it is essential to identify proteins that protect cancer cells from apoptosis and determine signaling pathways through which they protect cancer cells from apoptosis. Studies over the past 2 decades suggest that apoptosis is mediated primarily by two distinct signaling pathways, namely the extrinsic (or the death receptor) and the intrinsic (or the mitochondrial) pathways (reviewed in Refs. 4Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar, 5Adams J.M.

The extrinsic pathway is mediated by the FAS receptor (CD95) or members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The intrinsic pathway, on the other hand, involves multiple Bcl-2 family proteins (e.g. proapoptotic proteins, such as Bim and Bax, and prosurvival proteins, such as Bcl-2) (7Huang D.C.S. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 8Puthalakath H. Strasser A.

Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar), which impinge on mitochondrial integrity. The two apoptosis pathways converge on common “executioner” caspases (e.g. caspase-3) that are responsible for execution of apoptosis (10Degterev A. Boyce M. Yuan J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8543-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Although the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways have been well described, how cancer cells evade the activation of the apoptosis pathways remains elusive. The activation of the apoptosis pathways is controlled at least in part by integrin-mediated cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseFAfocal adhesionAbantibodySFKSrc family kinase SFKsiRNAsmall interfering RNA. adhesion (reviewed in Refs. 11Frisch S.M.

Thus, components of the integrin signaling pathway are attractive targets for therapeutic control of tumor growth and metastasis. At the molecular level, cell-ECM adhesion is mediated by a complex protein network consisting of integrins and proteins that are directly or indirectly associated with integrins (15Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H.

How integrins and associated proteins regulate apoptosis, however, is incompletely understood. PINCH-1 and Mig-2 (mitogen-inducible gene-2, also known as kindlin-2) are integrin-proximal scaffolding proteins that are essential for integrin-mediated cell-ECM adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and embryonic development (23Tu Y.

Although the role of PINCH-1 and Mig-2 in FA and cytoskeletal organization has been well established, their functions in apoptosis remain to be determined. Several lines of evidence suggest that PINCH-1 probably functions in the suppression of apoptosis. First, depletion of PINCH-1 from human HeLa cervical carcinoma cells promotes apoptosis (32Fukuda T.

Second, an increase of apoptotic endodermal cells was observed in PINCH-1 null embryoid bodies (33Li S. Bordoy R. Stanchi F. Moser M. Braun A. Kudlacek O. Wewer U.M. Yurchenco P.D. Fassler R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2913-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Third, excessive apoptosis was detected in PINCH-1 null mouse embryos (34Liang X. Zhou Q. Li X. Sun Y. Lu M. Dalton N. Ross Jr., J. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3056-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Finally, knock-out of PINCH-1 in embryonic neural crest cells, which share many characteristics with metastatic cancer cells, induces apoptosis (35Liang X. Sun Y. Schneider J. Ding J.H. Cheng H.

An increase of apoptosis, however, was not reported in PINCH-1-deficient ventricular cardiomyocytes (34Liang X. Zhou Q. Li X. Sun Y. Lu M. Dalton N. Ross Jr., J. Chen J. Mol. Cell.

The current study focuses on the role of PINCH-1 in protection of cancer cells from apoptosis.

One day after DNA transfection, the cells were transfected with PINCH-1 siRNA. Cells were analyzed 2 days after siRNA transfection unless otherwise specified. For treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor, HT-1080 cells were transfected with PINCH-1 siRNA and control RNA as described above. Thirty hours after RNA transfection, the cells were treated with 2 mm sodium butyrate and cultured for an additional 20 h. The cells were then harvested and analyzed by Western blot. Immunofluorescent Staining—The cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with rabbit anti-PINCH-1 Ab and mouse anti-Mig-2 Ab. After rinsing, the primary Abs were detected with Rhodamine RedTX-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Ab and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, respectively. Apoptosis—Cells (as specified in each experiment) were cultured as monolayers in cell culture plates (Greiner Bio-One) and transfected with PINCH-1 siRNA or control RNA as described above. Two days after siRNA transfection, apoptosis was analyzed using a fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate VII (Calbiochem), following the manufacturer's protocol. All samples were analyzed in triplicates. The means ± S.D. from PINCH-1-, Mig-2-, and/or Bim-deficient cells were compared with that of the control cells (normalized to 1). Real Time PCR—Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using the Oligotex Direct mRNA minikit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was prepared from mRNA with the SuperScript™ III first strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). The amounts of Bim transcripts in PINCH-1 knockdown and control cells were analyzed by real time PCR using the SYBR green method. The primers used were 5′-TCCTCCTTGCCAGGCCTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGCAGGTTCAGCCTGCC-3′ (reverse). The samples were analyzed in triplicates using the Mx3000P™ real time PCR system and software (Stratagene). Samples were compared using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a normalizer gene. -Fold increase was calculated using the relative Ct method. FLAG-BimEL Construct, Transfection, and Immunoprecipitation—cDNA encoding the BimEL was generated by PCR from a human lung cDNA library (Clontech) using 5′-gctgaattcatggcaaagcaaccttctg-3′ and 5′-ctgctcgagtcaatgcattctccacacc-3′ as primers and inserted into the pFLAG-CMV-6c vector (Sigma). HT-1080 cells were transfected with the FLAG-BimEL vector using Lipofectamine 2000. Overexpression of FLAG-BimEL induced dramatic increase of apoptosis (data not shown). To prevent cell death, the transfectants were cultured in medium containing 20 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone. One day after DNA transfection, cells were transfected with PINCH-1 siRNA or control RNA. Cells were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and/or Western blotting 1 day after PINCH-1 siRNA transfection. Immunoprecipitation was performed as we described previously (43Zhang Y. Chen K. Tu Y. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41695-41705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell lysates were mixed with agarose beads conjugated with monoclonal anti-FLAG Ab M2 (500 μg of lysates per 20 μl of 50% (v/v) M2 beads). The beads were washed four times, and the proteins bound were analyzed by Western blot. Isolation of Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Fractions—Mitochondrial and mitochondrion-free cytosolic fractions were prepared as described (44Tong T. Ji J. Jin S. Li X. Fan W. Song Y. Wang M. Liu Z. Wu M. Zhan Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4488-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell suspension was passed through a 22-gauge needle 20 times and centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei. The supernatants were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets (mitochondrial fractions) and supernatants (cytosolic fractions) were collected and analyzed by Western blot with Abs for markers of mitochondrial fractions (prohibitin) and nonmitochondrial fractions (tubulin). PINCH-1 and Mig-2 Are Mutually Dependent for Their FA Clustering—PINCH-1 can be clustered into large supramolecular structures at FAs that are detectable by fluorescence microscopy (referred as FA clustering herein), which is important for regulation of several integrin-mediated processes, including cell-ECM adhesion, contractility, migration, and mechanotransduction (45Bershadsky A.D. Balaban N.Q. Geiger B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 677-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). To determine whether PINCH-1-mediated protection against apoptosis depends on FA clustering of PINCH-1, we first sought to develop a method through which we could disrupt FA clustering but not the level of PINCH-1. Toward this end, we tested whether Mig-2, a widely distributed and evolutionally conserved cytoplasmic component of FAs, is required for FA clustering of PINCH-1. HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells, which express abundant PINCH-1 and Mig-2 (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 1), were used. Double immunofluorescent staining with a rabbit anti-PINCH Ab and a mouse anti-Mig-2 Ab showed that HT-1080 cells formed robust FAs in which PINCH-1 (Fig. 1D) and Mig-2 (Fig. 1E) were co-clustered. Transfection of the cells with an siRNA that targets Mig-2 dramatically reduced the level of Mig-2 (Fig. 1B, lane 3) but not that of PINCH-1 (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Equal protein loading was confirmed by probing the same samples with an anti-actin Ab (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 3). Despite the presence of a normal level of PINCH-1 (Fig. 1A, lane 3), FA clustering of PINCH-1 was diminished in Mig-2 knockdown cells (Fig. 1, compare F with D). These results suggest that Mig-2 is required for proper FA clustering of PINCH-1, albeit it is not required for the expression and maintenance of the cellular level of PINCH-1. We next tested the reciprocal (i.e. whether PINCH-1 is required for FA clustering of Mig-2). To do this, we transfected the cells with a PINCH-1 siRNA, which we had previously shown specifically targets the PINCH-1 transcript (32Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Transfection with the PINCH-1 siRNA markedly reduced the level of PINCH-1 (Fig. 1A, compare lane 2 with lane 1). In a control experiment, equal loading was confirmed by probing the same samples with an anti-actin Ab (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2). A similar level of Mig-2 was detected in both the PINCH-1-deficient cells and the control cells (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2), indicating that loss of PINCH-1 did not adversely affect the level of Mig-2. Immunofluorescent staining showed that the clusters of Mig-2 were much smaller and less well organized in PINCH-1 knockdown cells (Fig. 1, compare I with E). Thus, depletion of PINCH-1 also compromises FA clustering of Mig-2. Collectively, these results suggest that PINCH-1 and Mig-2 are mutually dependent for their FA clustering. Loss of one protein adversely affects FA clustering of the other protein. PINCH-1, but Not Mig-2, Is Essential for Protection of HT-1080 Fibrosarcoma Cells from Apoptosis—PINCH-1 is required for the survival of HeLa cervical carcinoma cells (32Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 42Xu Z. Fukuda T. Li Y. Zha X. Qin J. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27631-27637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was not known, however, whether PINCH-1 plays a similar role in protection of other cancer cells against apoptosis. To begin to test this, we analyzed apoptosis in response to depletion of PINCH-1 in HT-1080 cells. Depletion of PINCH-1 from HT-1080 cells markedly increased apoptosis (Fig. 1J). Importantly, knockdown of Mig-2, which diminished FA clustering of PINCH-1 (Fig. 1F), did not dramatically increase apoptosis (Fig. 1J). These results suggest that PINCH-1 is required for protection of HT-1080 cells against apoptosis, and it does so through a mechanism that is independent of Mig-2 (and consequently independent of FA clustering of PINCH-1). PINCH-1 Is Required for Protection of Multiple Types of Human Cancer Cells from Apoptosis—To investigate the role of PINCH-1 in the survival of other types of cancer cells, we depleted PINCH-1 from human colon carcinoma (HCT-116, RKO, and Caco-2), breast carcinoma (MDA-231), prostate carcinoma (PC-3), hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2), lung carcinoma (Calu-6), and nontumorigenic mammary epithelial (MCF-10A) cells. HeLa and HT-1080 cells were used as positive controls. Transfection of the cells with PINCH-1 siRNA efficiently depleted PINCH-1 in all cell types that were tested (Fig. 2, A, C, E, G, I, and K, and Supplemental Fig. 1, A, C, E, and G). Depletion of PINCH-1 markedly increased apoptosis in HeLa (Fig. 2B), HT-1080 (Fig. 2D), HCT-116 (Fig. 2F), RKO (Fig. 2H), MDA-231 (Supplemental Fig. 1B), PC-3 (Supplemental Fig. 1D), Calu-6 (Supplemental Fig. 1F), and Hep G2 (Supplemental Fig. 1H) cells (referred as “PINCH-1 dependent” cells herein). No dramatic increase of apoptosis, however, was observed in Caco-2 (Fig. 2J) and MCF-10A (Fig. 2L) cells (referred as “PINCH-1 independent” cells herein). These results suggest that PINCH-1 is required for protection of many different types of cancer cells from apoptosis, albeit it is dispensable in certain cancer (i.e. Caco-2) and noncancer (i.e. MCF-10A) cells. PINCH-1-mediated Regulation of Apoptosis Requires Bax—We next sought to determine the downstream signaling effectors involved in PINCH-1-mediated regulation of apoptosis. A reverse genetic approach was employed in these studies. p53, PUMA, Bax, and Smac are apoptotic proteins involved in the killing of cancer cells in response to various external apoptotic stimuli. Thus, we first tested whether they are involved. A panel of HCT-116 cells, in which the expression of each of the proteins (p53, PUMA, Bax, or Smac) was ablated (36Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C.

HCT-116 cells that lack p53, PUMA, Bax, or Smac and parental HCT-116 cells as a control, were transfected with PINCH-1 siRNA or a control RNA. Depletion of PINCH-1 in the PINCH-1 siRNA transfectants (Figs. 3, A and C, and Supplemental Fig. 2, A, C, and E, lane 2) but not the control transfectants (Fig. 3, A and C, and Supplemental Fig. 2, A, C, and E, lane 1) or the parental cells (Fig. 3, A and C, and Supplemental Fig. 2, A, C, and E, lane 3) was confirmed by Western blot. As expected, depletion of PINCH-1 markedly increased caspase-3 activity in HCT-116 cells (Fig. 3B). Loss of Bax reduced the increase of caspase-3 activity by more than 70% (Fig. 3D), suggesting a prominent role of Bax in this process. The increase of apoptosis was also reduced (albeit more modestly) in the absence of p53 (Supplemental Figs. 2B). No reduction of apoptosis was observed in the absence of PUMA (Supplemental Fig. 2D) or Smac (Supplemental Fig. 2F). These results suggest that Bax and to a lesser extent p53, but not PUMA or Smac, are involved in PINCH-1-mediated regulation of apoptosis. PINCH-1 Regulates Bim but Not Bax Expression—The finding that the PINCH-1-mediated regulation of apoptosis is largely dependent on Bax prompted us to test whether the level of Bax is altered in response to loss of PINCH-1. Probing the PINCH-1-deficient and control HCT-116 cells with an anti-Bax Ab showed that the level of Bax was not significantly altered in response to loss of PINCH-1 (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 2). To further test this, we analyzed the effect of PINCH-1 on the level of Bax in another nine human cancer cell lines, including both the PINCH-1-dependent (MDA-231, HT-1080, PC-3, HeLa, Calu-6, Hep G2, and RKO) cells and PINCH-1-independent (Caco-2 and MCF-10A) cells. No dramatic alterations of the Bax level were observed in response to loss of PINCH-1 in all of the cells that were analyzed (Fig. 4, lanes 3–10 and Supplemental Fig. 3). Thus, although Bax plays a role in PINCH-1-mediated regulation of apoptosis, it is not a direct target of PINCH-1 signaling. We next sought to identify the signaling target that is regulated by PINCH-1. Because Bax is crucially involved in PINCH-1 regulation of apoptosis, we reasoned that this signaling target probably lies upstream of Bax. BH3-only proteins, including Bim, Bcl-2, and PUMA are known to function upstream of Bax. A role of PUMA was ruled out by our reverse genetic studies (Supplemental Fig. 2, C and D). Bcl-2 was not detected in PC3 (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8), Calu-6 (Supplemental Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2), and Hep G2 (Supplemental Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4) cells, either in the presence or absence of PINCH-1. In other cell types, the level of Bcl-2 was either not changed (e.g. in HeLa and Caco-2 cells) or modestly reduced (e.g. in HCT-116, HT-1080, and RKO) in response to loss of PINCH-1 (Fig. 4 and Supplemental Fig. 3). Notably, loss of PINCH-1 substantially increased the Bim level in many (e.g. MDA-231, HT-1080, PC-3, HeLa, Calu, and Hep G2), albeit not all (e.g. HCT-116 and RKO), types of cancer cells whose survival is dependent on PINCH-1 (Fig. 4 and Supplemental Fig. 3). No significant increase of the Bim level was observed in cells (MCF-10A and Caco-2) whose survival is independent of PINCH-1 (Supplemental Fig. 3, lanes 7–10). Based on these results, we hypothesized that in at least some types of cancer cells, Bim functions as a key apop"
https://openalex.org/W2081295659,"The penumbra of a sunspot is composed of numerous thin, radially extended, bright and dark filaments carrying outward gas flows (the Evershed flow). Using high-resolution images obtained by the Solar Optical Telescope aboard the solar physics satellite Hinode, we discovered a number of penumbral bright filaments revealing twisting motions about their axes. These twisting motions are observed only in penumbrae located in the direction perpendicular to the symmetry line connecting the sunspot center and the solar disk center, and the direction of the twist (that is, lateral motions of intensity fluctuation across filaments) is always from limb side to disk-center side. Thus, the twisting feature is not an actual twist or turn of filaments but a manifestation of dynamics of penumbral filaments with three-dimensional radiative transfer effects."

The homo- or heterodimeric state of 67-kDa LamR has yet to be resolved, but its association with the cell surface is mediated by fatty acid acylation (9Landowski T.H. Dratz E.A. Starkey J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11276-11287Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). LamR expression acts as a prognostic factor in determining the degree of malignancy of human cancer patients (10Menard S. Tagliabue E. Colnaghi M.I. Breast Cancer Res.

The role of LamR as a ribosomal protein is also of significant interest. Intracellular LamR is localized on the 40 S ribosome (11Auth D. Brawerman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Human LamR and Rps0, the homolog in yeast, which does not exhibit laminin binding activity, share 60% sequence identity (see Fig. 1). Rps0 is responsible for 20 S ribosomal RNA processing and maturation of the 40 S ribosomal protein subunit, directly affecting protein synthesis levels (13Ford C.L. Randal-Whitis L. Ellis S.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 704-710PubMed Google Scholar). Both the localization of human LamR to more than one intracellular component and the multiple functions of its homolog in yeast suggest that human LamR may also have numerous functions at the intracellular level. Recombinant LamR Expression and PurificationResidues 1–220 of human 37-kDa LamR precursor protein (LamR220) were subcloned from a full-length LamR cDNA into an Escherichia coli expression vector that includes a tobacco etch virus-cleavable, N-terminal His6 tag. The construct was verified by automated DNA sequencing. The vector encoding LamR220 was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3*), and cultures were grown in Luria broth medium at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) for 12 h at 20 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)), and lysed by French press. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 RPM for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected. The soluble fraction was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (Qiagen) followed by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences). Protein was concentrated in spin concentrators (Amicon, Millipore). Crystallization and Data CollectionCrystals of LamR220 were grown at 17 °C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method in drops containing a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of protein solution at 10 mg/ml and reservoir solution containing 17% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 10,000, 120 mm sodium citrate, 100 mm MES (pH 6.0), and 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1,500.

In Vitro Binding Affinity for laminin-1LamR220 and full-length LamR (LamR295) binding affinity for laminin-1 were tested in vitro. White polystyrene enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 96-well microplates, precoated with murine laminin-1 (New England Biolabs), were blocked overnight at 4 °C with blocking buffer (3.0% BSA, 0.1% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline). Wells were incubated with increasing concentrations of LamR220 or LamR295, which was nickel affinity-purified as described above for 1 h at 37 °C. Each well was washed three times with blocking buffer. Penta-His horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:500) (Qiagen) was incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and wells were washed three times with blocking buffer. Substrate solution was added and incubated for ∼15 min before reading, and fluorescent absorbance was detected at 490 nm on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (ELX800, Biotek Instruments, Inc.). Controls for buffer alone and nonspecific protein, BSA (New England Biolabs), were also tested. Experiments were performed in triplicate. A binding curve and Kd were generated for LamR220 and LamR295. The Kd was calculated using a one-site binding hyperbola and the equation Y = Bmax × X/(Kd + X). Each group was tested in triplicate, and binding affinity was determined by normalizing to background fluorescence. In Vitro Sindbis Virus Vector Inhibition3 × 106 BHK-55 cells were plated in a 12-well plate for 24 h in αMEM (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Sindbis virus vector that expressed a luciferin reporter upon replication (multiplicity of infection = 100) was incubated with control protein (BSA, New England Biolabs), LamR220, or alone and rotated at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed with Optimem (Invitrogen), and 300 μl of sample was added. Samples were incubated, rotating gently for 1 h at room temperature to allow Sindbis viral vector attachment. The supernatant was aspirated, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 1 ml of medium was added. The cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and medium was aspirated the next day. 200 μl of unsupplemented medium and 200 μl of luciferin substrate (SteadyGlo luciferase assay, Promega) were added. The cells were shaken vigorously for 15 min. The relative luciferase units, which correspond to infectivity of Sindbis virus vector, of each sample were read using a luminometer (Glomax 20/20, Promega). Experiments were performed in triplicate. A two-tailed Student's t test was performed (p < 0.05) to determine statistical significance. LamR Expression, Purification, Crystallization, and Structural DeterminationTo better understand the function of LamR and its interaction with binding partners, we sought to crystallize the human LamR precursor protein. To this end, several different-length constructs were overexpressed in E. coli, including residues 1–295 (full-length), residues 1–220, and residues 1–195. Of these, only the 220-residue version of LamR (abbreviated LamR220) could be purified in amounts suitable for crystallization trials. LamR220 binds laminin-1 in vitro (supplemental Fig. 1a) and inhibits Sindbis virus vector infection of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells (supplemental Fig. 1b). These data demonstrate that the first 220 residues of LamR are sufficient for interacting with key binding partners. Crystals of LamR220 were obtained at pH 6.0 and belong to tetragonal space group P43212 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure of LamR220 was determined by molecular replacement, using the crystal structure of the 30 S ribosomal protein S2p from A. fulgidus (PDB code 1VI6) as a search model (16Badger J.

Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of Human LamRConsistent with a sequence identity of 32% between LamR and A. fulgidus S2p (residues 15–183) (Fig. 1), the two proteins share a similar overall architecture, classified (Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP)) as an α/β protein with a flavodoxin-like fold (Fig. 2a). A central β sheet composed of five parallel β strands (β3-β7) is flanked by three α helices on one side (αB, αC, and αE) and a single α helix (αD) on the other side. An N-terminal α helix (αA) and two anti-parallel β strands (β1-β2) pack against the α/β core of the protein. Residues 1–8 and 206–220 of LamR220 are disordered in the structure. Structural Comparison of Human LamR and S2 Protein from Other SpeciesSuperimposition of the structures of LamR220 and A. fulgidus S2p yields a root-mean-square deviation in Cα positions of just 0.9 Å (174 atoms) and reveals two areas in which the structures are divergent (Fig. 2b): a segment between β4 and β5 (residues 111–118 in LamR) and a segment after the last α helix (αE) (residues 188–196 in LamR), in which LamR contains a five-residue insertion relative to A. fulgidis S2p. The segment between β4 and β5 contains an equal number of residues in the two proteins. In A. fulgidis S2p, the segment is stabilized in a folded-back conformation via a salt bridge between Arg-113 in this segment (Arg-117 in LamR) and Asp-93 (β4), the latter of which is not conserved in LamR (Thr-97). In the LamR220 structure, this segment instead projects away from the domain and packs against the same segment in a symmetry-related (two-fold) molecule (Fig. 2c). In this crystallographic dimer, Ala-114 packs into a tight pocket in the symmetry-related molecule formed by the β4-β5 segment and the end of αD, and Phe-116 is in van der Waals contact with Tyr-139 (αD) (Fig. 2c). Although Phe-116 is generally conserved from Saccharomyces cerevisiae through vertebrate species, Ala-114 is conserved only in vertebrates. The total surface area buried in this interface is a modest 832 Å2, and LamR220 runs as a monomer in solution, but in the context of a membrane attachment and a possible covalent dimerization linkage (9Landowski T.H. Dratz E.A. Starkey J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11276-11287Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), this crystallographic dimer could be functionally significant. Functional Domains of LamRThe structural differences noted between LamR220 and A. fulgidis S2p (Fig. 2b) could be important for ribosomal protein function or for the acquired function as the receptor for laminin. Analysis of the 3.0 Å resolution structure of the 30 S ribosomal subunit from Thermus thermophilus (PDB code 1J5E) (21Wimberly B.T. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Morgan-Warren R.J. Carter A.P. Vonrhein C. Hartsch T. Ramakrishnan V. Nature. 2000; 407: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar) indicates that the two major structural deviations between human LamR220 and A. fulgidis S2p (between β4 and β5 and after αE) would not appear to affect ribosomal function, since no RNA or protein contacts are present in these regions. This suggests that the structural differences in human LamR versus A. fulgidis S2p are important for laminin binding. Previously, peptide segments of LamR utilized in binding assays implicated a segment, residues 161–180, known as peptide G, as a binding epitope for laminin (22Castronovo V. Taraboletti G. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20440-20446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the LamR220 crystal structure, this stretch of residues comprises the linker between β7 and most of αE. The only portion of this sequence that is solvent-accessible are residues 165–169 in the β7-αE linker. It is conceivable that the C-terminal tail of LamR220 undergoes a conformational change, exposing residues within this segment. Alternatively, the use of peptide segments of LamR to map the laminin binding site may need to be re-evaluated. In addition, a short putative transmembrane segment, residues 86–102, was suggested (22Castronovo V. Taraboletti G. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20440-20446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This segment, encompassing β4 and most of αC, is an integral part of the protein fold and is unlikely to serve as a transmembrane helix. Role of LamR in DiseaseLamR has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including neoplastic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, urinary tract infections, encephalitis, and others. In cancer, the specific inhibition of LamR function at the cell surface of tumor cells, either by binding of EGCG, which most likely competes with endogenous laminin, or by infection with Sindbis virus vector, which is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, has been associated with anti-tumor effects (23Tanaka M.

Both EGCG and Sindbis virus vectors, through two different mechanisms, reduce the ability of LamR at the surface to interact with laminin. The structural characterization of LamR will contribute to an understanding of how LamR interacts with its binding partners and aid in the development of therapeutics that can block and/or mimic LamR interactions in the setting of cancer, neurological disorders, and viral infection.

https://openalex.org/W2023064390,"In the outer regions of Saturn's main rings, strong tidal forces balance gravitational accretion processes. Thus, unusual phenomena may be expected there. The Cassini spacecraft has recently revealed the strange “flying saucer” shape of two small satellites, Pan and Atlas, located in this region, showing prominent equatorial ridges. The accretion of ring particles onto the equatorial surfaces of already-formed bodies embedded in the rings may explain the formation of the ridges. This ridge formation process is in good agreement with detailed Cassini images showing differences between rough polar and smooth equatorial terrains. We propose that Pan and Atlas ridges are kilometers-thick “ring-particle piles” formed after the satellites themselves and after the flattening of the rings but before the complete depletion of ring material from their surroundings."

GBF1 (Golgi-specific brefeldin A resistance factor 1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the ADP-ribosylation factor family associated with the Golgi apparatus, was isolated as a phosphoprotein from the glucose-depleted cells by using the phospho-Akt-substrate antibody, which recognizes the substrate proteins of several protein kinases. The phosphorylation of GBF1 was induced by 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), which blocks glucose utilization and increases the intracellular AMP concentration, and by AICAR, an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator. This phosphorylation was observed in the cells expressing the constitutively active AMPK. The 2-DG-induced phosphorylation of GBF1 was suppressed by Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, and by the overexpression of the kinase-negative AMPK. Analysis using the deletion and point mutants identified Thr1337 as the 2-DG-induced phosphorylation site in GBF1, which is phosphorylated by AMPK in vitro. ATP depletion is known to provoke the Golgi apparatus disassembly. Immunofluorescent microscopic analysis with the Golgi markers indicated that GBF1 associates with the fragmented Golgi apparatus in the cells treated with 2-DG and AICAR. The expression of the kinase-negative AMPK and the GBF1 mutant replacing Thr1337 by Ala prevented the 2-DG-induced Golgi disassembly. These results indicate that GBF1 is a novel AMPK substrate and that the AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of GBF1 at Thr1337 has a critical role, presumably by attenuating the function of GBF1, in the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus induced under stress conditions that lower the intracellular ATP concentration.

A small GTPase, Rheb, locates in the upstream of mTOR as a positive regulator, and the tuberous sclerosis complex composed of TSC1 and TSC2 negatively regulates mTOR by functioning as a GTPase-activating protein toward Rheb. On the other hand, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a heterotrimeric serine/threonine protein kinase, is regarded to be a major intracellular energy sensor and contributes to the regulation of energy homeostasis in the eukaryotic cells (5Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. Campbell D.J. Chen Z.P. Murthy S. Walter M. Gupta A. Adams J.J. Katsis F. van Denderen B. Jennings I.G. Iseli T. Michell B.J. Witters L.A. Biochem. Soc.

AMPK is activated by the increase in AMP under the ATP-depleted conditions through the binding of AMP to the regulatory γ subunit and the phosphorylation of the catalytic α subunit at Thr172 by AMPK kinases, such as the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome gene product LKB1 and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase. In practice, the AMPK activity is elevated in the cells treated with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a non-metabolizable glucose analog, that increases the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio. Interestingly, AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 at Thr1227 and Ser1345 to enhance its ability, resulting in the suppression of the mTOR pathway (7Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2913) Google Scholar). It seems, therefore, that the signaling pathways through mTOR and AMPK are not independent, but these two nutrient-dependent signaling mechanisms are closely related each other. Moreover, these two protein kinases have been reported to take a part not only in the normal signal transduction mechanisms but also in the pathological states, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer (1Wullschleger S.

It is thus important to analyze the substrate proteins of these two protein kinases in the nutrient-signaling pathways for better understanding of the regulation of the cellular activities under normal and disease conditions.

Yoshino K. Hara K. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Mimura O. Yonezawa K. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The pEBG vectors of the GST-fused wild-type AMPK α1 (GST-AMPK (WT)) and kinase-negative form of AMPK α1 (GST-AMPK (K45R)) (20Dyck J.R. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B.E.

The DNA sequence of the constructs was verified by using ABI Prism 3100-Avant Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Antibodies–The following antibodies were purchased from the commercial sources: anti-FLAG and anti-α-tubulin antibodies from Sigma; anti-phospho-Akt substrate antibody (110B7), anti-phospho-p70 S6 kinase (T389) antibody (1A5), and anti-GST antibody (for immunofluorescent microscopy) from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (S79) antibody and anti-GST antibody (for immunoblot analysis) from Upstate Biotechnology; anti-p70 S6 kinase antibody and normal rabbit immunoglobulin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-β-actin antibody from Abcam; anti-GM130 antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories; anti-mannosidase II antibody from Covance; horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and Bio-Rad, respectively; Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and Alexa Fluor 546-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody from Invitrogen. The antibodies against GBF1 (G1844) and phosphorylated GBF1 at Thr1337 (pT1337) were produced by the antibody service of ImmunoBiological Laboratories against the peptides LATPRPTDPIPTSEVN (amino acids 1,844-1,859) and KIHRSA-pTDADV (amino acids 1,331-1,341, where pT indicates phospho-Thr), respectively. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Treatment–CHO-IR, HEK293, and NRK cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma), and α-MEM (Nacalai Tesque), respectively, containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a5%CO2 incubator. For nutritional starvation, CHO-IR cells were deprived of FBS for 16 h and were further cultured in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS; Invitrogen) for 90 min. Then the cells were incubated for 30 min with either D-PBS, DMEM, DMEM lacking glucose, or DMEM lacking amino acids. For the treatment with the reagents, the cells cultured in the presence of FBS were replaced in DMEM lacking glucose supplemented with 5.5 mm 2-DG (Nacalai Tesque) or 10 μm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (Sigma) and incubated for the indicated time. When AICAR (Sigma) was employed, the cells were incubated with the reagent at 2 mm in DMEM. Where indicated, the cells were preincubated with 20 μm Compound C (Merck) in DMEM before the treatment. The transfection with the expression vectors was carried out by the lipofection method using Lipofectamine Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the cells were cultured for 24 h and then employed for the experiments. Protein Purification–Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 0-4 °C essentially as described (21Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q.P. Kasuga M. Nishimoto I. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26457-26463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tri-HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 0.3% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin), and the lysate was incubated with each antibody and protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) for 2 h. As the substrates for the AMPK assay, immunoprecipitated FLAG-GBF1 and FLAG-GBF1 (T1337A) from transfected HEK293 cells were eluted by buffer B (60 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 120 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). As the enzymes for the AMPK assay, GST-AMPK (WT) and GST-AMPK (K45R) were expressed in HEK293 cells. After incubation with or without 2-DG for 15 min, the cells were lysed in buffer C (50 mm Tri-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm sodium diphosphate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation, the supernatants were subjected to GST pull-down using glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). The pulled down proteins were washed twice with buffer B and eluted by buffer B containing 20 mm glutathione. Mass Fingerprint–Mass fingerprinting analysis was carried out as described (4Oshiro N. Takahashi R. Yoshino K. Tanimura K. Nakashima A. Eguchi S. Miyamoto T. Hara K. Takehana K. Avruch J. Kikkawa U. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20329-20339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates by the PAS antibody from CHO-IR cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. The protein bands were cut out and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. The resulting peptides were analyzed by the liquid chromatography electrospray ionization MS/MS using a LCQ Advantage ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). Protein identification according to product ion mass lists was performed by the product ion mass fingerprinting using MASCOT “MS/MS ion search.” Immunoblot–The lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-P membrane (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) and subjected to immunoblot using each primary antibody. Where indicated, the anti-GBF1 pT1337 antibody preincubated with the antigen phosphopeptide for 16 h at 4 °C was employed. After incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, the chemiluminescence reaction was carried out. When the same sample was analyzed with different antibodies, the membrane was stripped and employed for the subsequent immunoblot analysis. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments. AMPK Assay–The procedure was carried out essentially as described (19Kimura N. Tokunaga C. Dalal S. Richardson C. Yoshino K. Hara K. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Mimura O. Yonezawa K. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Purified GBF1 proteins were incubated with either GST-AMPK (WT) or GST-AMPK (K45R) obtained from the 2-DG treated and control HEK293 cells in the AMPK assay mixture (60 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 0.2 mm AMP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a Hybond-P membrane, and analyzed using Bioimaging Analyzer BAS2500 (Fujix). Then the membrane was immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies and visualized as described above. The result shown is representative of three independent experiments. Immunofluorescence and Quantitative Analysis–The cells with or without transfection were grown on 35-mm glass bottom dishes and treated with 2-DG for 60 min. The cells were then fixed with methanol for 15 min at -20 °C, permeabilized with D-PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 25 °C, blocked in D-PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 25 °C, double-stained with primary antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C, and incubated with both Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 546-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibodies for 2 h at 25 °C. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Sigma). The dishes were washed three times with D-PBS after each step except for blocking, and image data were obtained with fluorescence microscope model BZ-8000 (Keyence). For the examination of microtubules, the cells were observed under fluorescence microscope model IX71 (Olympus). The quantitative analysis of the Golgi elements was performed by NIH Image software (22Puthenveedu M.A. Bachert C. Puri S. Lanni F. Linstedt A.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, a fixed threshold was applied to all images, and the number of objects was measured using the Analyze Particle function. Sequence Analysis–The amino acid sequence identity and similarity were analyzed by using the GENETYX program, version 8 (GENETYX). Identification of GBF1 as a Nutrient-regulated Phosphoprotein–The screening of the phosphoproteins in the CHO-IR cell lysates by immunoprecipitation using the PAS antibody isolated two distinct proteins designated as p500 and p200 from the cells cultured in the media containing and deprived of nutrients (i.e. amino acids and glucose, respectively), as visualized by silver staining after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, top). Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis using mass spectrometry identified p500 as plectin, a linker protein that can associate with the cytoskeletal filament networks and many membrane proteins (23Wiche G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2477-2486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and identified p200 as GBF1, which was originally identified as a Golgi apparatus-associated GEF for the ARF family containing a SEC7 domain for the GEF activity (24Claude A. Zhao B.P. Kuziemsky C.E. Dahan S. Berger S.J. Yan J.P. Armold A.D. Sullivan E.M. Melancon P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 71-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The immunoblot analysis confirmed that p200 is GBF1, employing the antibody raised against the C-terminal sequence of the protein (Fig. 1A, bottom), and consistently, the PAS antibody recognized GBF1 immunoprecipitated from the nutrient-depleted cells but not the protein recovered from the cells grown in the medium supplemented with nutrients (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation of GBF1 Downstream of AMP-activated Protein Kinase–CHO-IR cells were incubated under the different nutritional conditions, first cultured without nutrients and then in the presence or absence of amino acids and glucose, to clarify the signaling pathways in which these two proteins are phosphorylated. Evidently, the amino acid supplementation stimulated the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase, an efficient substrate of mTOR (Fig. 2A), and plectin was isolated by immunoprecipitation using the phosphorylation motif site-specific antibody from the cells cultured in the medium supplemented with the nutrients (Fig. 1A, top), suggesting that plectin is phosphorylated in the downstream of mTOR. On the other hand, the glucose removal provoked the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a typical substrate protein of AMPK, and the phosphorylation of GBF1 was induced by glucose depletion irrespective of the presence or absence of amino acids, which was attenuated by the addition of glucose (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that GBF1 is phosphorylated downstream of AMPK, which is activated by an increase in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio caused by metabolic stresses, such as deprivation of glucose, that interfere with ATP production (5Kemp B.E. Stapleton D. Campbell D.J. Chen Z.P. Murthy S. Walter M. Gupta A. Adams J.J. Katsis F. van Denderen B. Jennings I.G. Iseli T. Michell B.J. Witters L.A. Biochem. Soc.

As expected, the compounds that lower the intracellular ATP concentration, such as 2-DG, a nonmetabolizable glucose analog that blocks cellular glucose utilization (6Towler M.C. Hardie D.G. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar), and FCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupler, induced the phosphorylation of GBF1 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, AICAR, an AMPK activator (6Towler M.C. Hardie D.G. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar), caused the phosphorylation of GBF1, and the incubation of the cells with Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor (25Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar), completely prevented the 2-DG-induced phosphorylation of the protein. Therefore, the constitutively active and kinase-negative forms of AMPK were co-expressed with FLAG-GBF1 in HEK293 cells to examine the role of AMPK for the phosphorylation of GBF1 in the cells (Fig. 2C). The phosphorylation of FLAG-GBF1 was induced by 2-DG as the endogenous GBF1 and was observed in the cells expressing the constitutively active form of AMPK (GST-AMPK-(1-312)) even in the absence of 2-DG. The phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase was, however, not evident in the lysate obtained from the unstimulated cells transfected with GST-AMPK-(1-312), presumably because the transfection efficiencies of the active AMPK and FLAG-GBF1 are not high in these cells. Overexpression of the wild-type AMPK slightly enhanced the phosphorylation of FLAG-GBF1, whereas the introduction of the kinase-negative form (GST-AMPK (K45R)) attenuated the 2-DG-induced phosphorylation of the protein. GBF1 was thus concluded to be phosphorylated in the downstream of AMPK in the cells exposed to the metabolic stresses accompanying the decrease in intracellular ATP concentration. Identification of Thr1337 as an AMPK Phosphorylation Site in GBF1–Next, we identified the phosphorylation site of GBF1 reacted with the PAS antibody. The deletion mutants encoding the different regions of human GBF1 (Fig. 1B) were expressed in HEK293 cells, and the 2-DG-induced phosphorylation was examined (Fig. 3A). The phosphorylation was not detected in the fragment encoding the N-terminal portion (amino acids 1-621) but was detected in the mutant including the C-terminal portion (amino acids 295-1,859) as the wild-type protein (amino acids 1-1,859). Furthermore, the mutant encoding amino acids 1-1,243 was not phosphorylated, but that consisting of amino acids 1,244-1,859 was recognized by the PAS antibody. The consensus recognition motif for AMPK, φ-[β,X]-X-X-Ser/Thr-X-X-X-φ, where φ and β are hydrophobic and basic, respectively, and the residues in brackets are in any order (6Towler M.C. Hardie D.G. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar), is compatible with the Arg-X-X-Ser/Thr sequence, which is recognized by the PAS antibody, as mentioned above. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the site detected by the PAS antibody in GBF1 is phosphorylated by AMPK. The search for the consensus recognition motif for AMPK in amino acids 1,244-1,859 identified four putative recognition sites for AMPK, Ser1335, Thr1337, Ser1395, and Ser1659, that are conserved among human and rodent GBF1. Each of these Ser and Thr residues in the full-length GBF1 was then replaced by Ala, and these point mutants recovered from the transfected cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis using the PAS antibody (Fig. 3B). The 2-DG-induced phosphorylation was found in the S1335A, S1395A, and S1659A mutants but was not detected in the T1337A mutant. The antibody, pT1337, raised against a phosphopeptide corresponding to amino acids 1,331-1,341 of human GBF1, recognized GBF1 immunoprecipitated from CHO-IR and HEK293 cells treated with 2-DG, as in the case of the PAS antibody (Fig. 3D). The immunoreaction by pT1337 was vanished by adsorbing the antibody with the antigen phosphopeptide. These results indicate that Thr1337 is phosphorylated in the 2-DG-treated cells. The data base search showed that human Thr1337 in the consensus recognition motif for AMPK is conserved among the GBF1s of vertebrates, including Cricetu"

The Hinode X-ray Telescope collected images of the solar corona in different passbands, thus providing temperature diagnostics through energy ratios. By combining different filters to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, we observed a coronal active region in five filters, revealing a highly thermally structured corona: very fine structures in the core of the region and on a larger scale further away. We observed continuous thermal distribution along the coronal loops, as well as entangled structures, and variations of thermal structuring along the line of sight."

It is activated by cis → trans photoisomerization of the covalently bound chromophore 11-cis-retinal, which acts in the cis configuration as an inverse agonist. Light-induced formation of the full agonist all-trans-retinal in situ triggers conformational changes in the protein moiety. Partial agonists of rhodopsin include a retinal analog lacking the methyl group at C-9, termed 9-demethyl-retinal (9-dm-retinal). Rhodopsin reconstituted with this retinal (9-dm-rhodopsin) activates G protein poorly. Here we investigated the molecular nature of the partial agonism in 9-dm-rhodopsin using site-directed spin labeling. Earlier site-directed spin labeling studies of rhodopsin identified a rigid-body tilt of the cytoplasmic segment of helix transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) by ∼6Å as a central event in rhodopsin activation. Data presented here provide additional evidence for this mechanism. Only a small fraction of photoexcited 9-dm pigments reaches the TM6-tilted conformation. This fraction can be increased by increasing proton concentration by anticipation of the activating protonation step by the mutation E134Q in 9-dm-rhodopsin. These results on protein conformation are in complete accord with previous findings regarding the biological activity of the 9-dm pigments. When the proton concentration is further increased, a new state arises in 9-dm pigments that is linked to direct proton uptake at the retinal Schiff base. This state apparently has a conformation distinguishable from the active state. Rhodopsin is the visual pigment of rod cells and a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor.

Rhodopsin, the visual pigment and photoreceptor in the vertebrate rod cell, is the best-studied member of the large family of rhodopsin-like (class A) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 3The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorMImetarhodopsin IMIImetarhodopsin IITMtransmembrane helixRSBretinal Schiff baseDMdodecyl maltoside, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltosideSDSLsite-directed spin labeling9-dm9-demethylBTP1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane. The crystal structure of the rhodopsin ground state (Fig. 1) confirmed the proposed seven transmembrane helix structure (TM1–TM7) and revealed an eighth helix (helix 8) after TM7 lying parallel to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane (1Palczewski K.

The pigment consists of the apoprotein opsin and the chromophore 11-cis-retinal, which is covalently bound to Lys-296 in TM7 through a protonated retinal Schiff base (RSB; Fig. 1C). The inactive ground state of rhodopsin is stabilized by a salt bridge between the protonated RSB and its counterion Glu-113 as well as the interactions of 11-cis-retinal, which acts as an inverse agonist. Absorption of a photon results in isomerization of retinal into the all-trans configuration and triggers a series of subsequent conformational rearrangements in the protein (4Okada T. Ernst O.P. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). After milliseconds, an equilibrium of metarhodopsin (M) states is reached that is dependent on pH, temperature, and the lipid environment of rhodopsin. These metarhodopsin states are characterized by their absorption maxima at 478 nm (MI) and 380 nm (MII), respectively. The blue shift in absorption is a result of deprotonation of the RSB (5Hofmann K.P. Hoff A.J. Handbook of Biological Physics. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam2000: 91-142Google Scholar) and protonation of the counterion (6Jäger F. Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the MI/MII equilibrium arises from a proton uptake reaction in MII, which involves the conserved (D/E)RY region in TM3 (Glu-134/Arg-135/Tyr-136 in rhodopsin) near the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin rather than the Schiff base region. The two regions are thermodynamically coupled, so that proton transfer from the Schiff base and proton uptake appear as two simultaneous steps that mark one species, MII. Kinetic studies have identified two subspecies, MIIa and MIIb, that are separated by motion of TM6 and the proton uptake reaction (4Okada T. Ernst O.P. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Trends Biochem.

Here we will start from a two-state model of GPCR activation which assumes that GPCRs exist in equilibrium between inactive and G protein activating states (corresponding to intermediates MI and MII, respectively), with the latter being stabilized by agonists (9Samama P.

Sci. 1995; 16: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In such a model both the Schiff base region and the (D/E)RY region simultaneously contribute to stabilizing the inactive rhodopsin conformation and provide the constraints that are broken when the active state forms. Retinal in its all-trans configuration is a strong agonist since under physiological conditions the active MII state is formed almost completely at the expense of its inactive predecessor MI (11Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5054-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The all-trans configuration of a retinal analog lacking the C-9 methyl group, 9-demethyl-retinal (9-dm-retinal; Fig. 1C, right), was found to be less efficient in forming MII and was classified as a partial agonist (12Meyer C.K.

As with native rhodopsin, the equilibrium between the MI and MII states of the rhodopsin pigment reconstituted with 9-demethyl-retinal (9-dm-rhodopsin) was found to be sensitive to pH, temperature, and the host environment. The pH sensitivity was found to be linked to Glu-134 in the highly conserved (D/E)RY region of GPCRs (8Arnis S. Fahmy K. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol.

We have now employed site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) to investigate if and how this equilibrium appears in local protein structural changes. This method revealed that the major light-induced conformational change is in both solubilized and membrane-bound rhodopsin a ∼6 Å rigid-body motion of the cytoplasmic end of TM6 toward TM5 (indicated by the red arrow in Fig. 1A (17Farrens D.L.

SDSL requires introduction of a “sensor” nitroxide side chain, designated as R1 (Fig. 1B), into the cytoplasmic rhodopsin surface (21Hubbell W.L. McHaourab H.S. Altenbach C. Lietzow M.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 779-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 22Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The EPR spectra of the R1 sensor at position 227 (TM5, Fig. 1A) or 250 (TM6) are most sensitive to TM6 motion out of the helix bundle (18Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12470-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The EPR spectral changes for R1 at these positions arise from changes in nitroxide mobility and can be used as diagnostic tools to verify the effect of the 9-dm-retinal partial agonist on equilibrium between different receptor states. The salient result of the present study is that all-trans 9-dmretinal in light-activated rhodopsin reduces the population of displaced TM6 relative to the native all-trans retinal. Consistently, the activating mutant E134Q results in an increased population of displaced TM6 in the 9-dm pigment and restoration of activity. At low pH a new state is found that represents the RSB-protonated MII species (MIIPSB) identified by UV/visible and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy analysis (12Meyer C.K. Böhme M.

MIIPSB bears spectral similarities to other identified Meta products with protonated Schiff base (Meta-Ib (23Tachibanaki S. Imai H. Mizukami T. Okada T. Imamoto Y. Matsuda T. Fukada Y. Terakita A.

In MIIPSB, the protein apparently has a conformation similar to that in MII but with specific differences. Preparation and Spin Labeling of Rhodopsin–The recombinant mutant opsin genes were derivatives of the synthetic opsin gene cloned into an eukaryotic expression vector (26Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Oprian D.D. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2119-2122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) and were constructed using standard fragment replacement and subcloning techniques. All gene products contained the C140S and C316S mutation in addition to the V227C or V250C mutation to obtain single reactive cysteines used for derivatization with spin label (1-oxy-2,2,5,5 tetramethylpyrrolin-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate (Toronto Research Chemicals). Recombinant rhodopsin was expressed in COS-1 cells, reconstituted with 11-cis-retinal or 11-cis-9-dm-retinal, and purified as described (12Meyer C.K. Böhme M. Ockenfels A. Gärtner W. Hofmann K.P.

Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10859-10864Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Synthesis of 11-cis-9-dm-retinal was described previously (12Meyer C.K. Böhme M. Ockenfels A. Gärtner W. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19713-19718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The pigments were spin-labeled (Fig. 1B) during purification as described (30Resek J.F. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12025-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The spin-labeled pigments were eluted in 10 mm 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane (BTP), pH 6, 0.03% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM), and concentrated for EPR measurements by ultrafiltration (Amicon Centricon). Spin-labeled pigments containing 11-cis-retinal are designated by the sequence number followed by R1. Thus, V227R1 and V250R1 designate single reactive cysteine mutants (in a C140S/C316S background) containing the nitroxide side chain R1 at the position indicated replacing a Val side chain. Pigments reconstituted with 11-cis-9-demethyl-retinal are designated 9-dm-V227R1 and 9-dm-V250R1, respectively. E134Q is added to the designation if the pigment contains the E134Q mutation in addition. UV/visible Spectroscopy–Spectra were taken at 20 °C with a Varian Cary 50 UV/visible spectrometer with a resolution of 2 nm. Samples were illuminated for 15 s by using a 150-watt fiber optic light source equipped with a 480-nm cut-off (GG495 Schott, Mainz, Germany) and a heat protection filter. Buffers used were 50 mm BTP (pH 6.0–8.0) or acetate (pH 4.5–5.5), 0.03% DM. EPR Spectroscopy–EPR spectra were collected on a Bruker E-580 spectrometer under dim red light. All spectra were measured at X-band using a high sensitivity resonator with a nitrogen flow-cooled Dewar manufactured by Bruker. Samples were adjusted to the designated pH by adding 1/3 volume 250 mm BTP buffer (pH 5.0, 6.0, or 7.5) and filled into a flat Suprasil cell (20 μl) of ∼250-μm thickness, optimized for illumination of the sample. Spectra were collected over 100 gauss with a 4-gauss modulation (100 kHz) and 10-milliwatt incident microwave power; typically, 16 scans were signal averaged. After collection of a spectrum in the dark, a second spectrum was collected after illumination of the sample for 20 s with a 150-watt halogen light source fitted with a 515-nm cut-off and heat protection filter. Formation of the MII State in 9-dm Pigments Is Accompanied by Changes in Mobility of the 227R1 Sensor–Pigments containing the R1 spin label side chain at position 227 were generated by reconstitution of mutant opsin with 11-cis-retinal or 11-cis-9-demethyl-retinal (Fig. 1C) followed by spin labeling and purification in DM detergent solution. By this procedure the pigments V227R1 and 9-dm-V227R1 were obtained. UV/visible spectra of V227R1 yielded λmax values of 500 nm in the dark and 380 nm after illumination corresponding to the normal absorption maxima of rhodopsin and MII in DM detergent solution (Fig. 2A). 9-dm-V227R1 showed the same spectra as reported previously for WT-regenerated pigments with λmax values of 464 nm in the dark (9-dm-rhodopsin ground state) and 466 nm after illumination (12Meyer C.K.

Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8895-8908Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B, measured at pH 7.5 and 20 °C). Approximately two-thirds of the latter absorption is due to 9-dm-MI, and the remainder is caused by 9-dm-rhodopsin and 9-dm-isorhodopsin (containing 9-cis-9-dm-retinal) in the photoequilibrium (see supplemental Fig. S1). The amount of the 380-nm absorbing species is very low due to the weak agonism of 9-dm-retinal (12Meyer C.K. Böhme M. Ockenfels A. Gärtner W. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19713-19718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Vogel R. Fan G.B. Sheves M. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8895-8908Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To monitor structural changes, EPR spectra of these pigments were recorded under the same conditions (Fig. 2C). Detailed analysis of the V227R1 pigment containing 11-cis-retinal has been discussed previously (18Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12470-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 20Kusnetzow A.K. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5538-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The R1 sensor at position 227 reports a shift of the nitroxide population to a more immobile state in MII as revealed by increases and decreases in the intensity of components corresponding to immobilized (im) and mobile (m) states, respectively (Fig. 2C, left, enlarged view of the low field part of the spectrum). This is presumed to arise from increased tertiary interactions of R1 with TM6 as it moves outward by ∼6 Å (Fig. 1A (17Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 18Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12470-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar)). Thus, R1 at position 227 allows identification of the light-induced motion of the cytoplasmic part of TM6 out of the helix bundle. In the dark, 9-dm-V227R1 (blue line) shows an EPR spectrum identical to V227R1 (black line, Fig. 2C). After illumination, however, very little spectral change is observed for the 9-dm pigment (green line) in contrast to the V227R1 pigment (red line). This indicates little motion of TM6 upon isomerization of 9-dm-retinal, although the majority of the retinal is isomerized to all-trans-retinal (see thesupplemental data). We showed previously by UV/visible spectroscopy that the E134Q mutation could rescue MII formation in the 9-dm-E134Q pigment yielding the same amount of MII as the 11-cis-retinal-containing E134Q pigment (12Meyer C.K.

We repeated the UV/visible measurements with spin-labeled pigments E134Q/V227R1 and 9-dm-E134Q/V227R1 and obtained the same rescue effect (Fig. 2, D and E). At pH 7.5 and 20 °C, the extents to which 380-nm absorbing species form from 9-dm-E134Q/V227R1 or V227R1 are comparable with one another, indicating nearly quantitative retinal isomerization. Moreover, formation of MII in 9-dm-E134Q/V227R1 is also reflected in the EPR spectra (Fig. 2F). The corresponding EPR spectra of 9-dm-E134Q/V227R1 and E134Q/V227R1 in the dark and after illumination are very similar, indicating the same basic light-induced motion of TM6 in 9-dm-E134Q/V227R1. The Schiff Base Protonation State and the 227R1 Sensor Report pH Sensitivity of 9-dm Pigments–By UV/visible and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy on light-activated 9-dm-rhodopsin, it was previously observed that lowering pH increases the fraction of molecules with a deprotonated RSB and protonated counterion Glu-113 (12Meyer C.K. Böhme M. Ockenfels A. Gärtner W. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19713-19718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Vogel R. Fan G.B. Sheves M. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8895-8908Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Bartl F.J. Fritze O. Ritter E. Herrmann R. Kuksa V. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1640-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This is indicative for an increased fraction of MII and a decreased fraction of MI. Using UV/visible spectroscopy, we confirmed this observation for light-activated spin-labeled 9-dm-V227R1 yielding a decrease in the 466-nm absorbing species with decreasing pH (Fig. 3A, top left). However, it is known that this protonation change is superimposed by another proton titration process. In 9-dm pigments, further lowering the pH value results again in a protonated RSB, an effect that is best seen in the 9-dm-E134Q pigment (12Meyer C.K. Böhme M. Ockenfels A. Gärtner W. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19713-19718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Bartl F.J. Fritze O. Ritter E. Herrmann R. Kuksa V. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34259-34267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This is obvious in the pH dependence of the UV/visible spectra of the light-activated 9-dm-E134Q/V227R1 pigment, which shows a pKa value of 5.8 for this process (Fig. 3A, bottom left). It should be noted that up to 20% of the absorption around 470 nm is due to 9-dm-rhodopsin and 9-dm-isorhodopsin (see thesupplemental data). In the corresponding 11-cis-retinal-reconstituted pigments, an onset of the effect of a protonated RSB is seen at pH < 6 (Fig. 3B, top left). For comparison with structural changes involving TM6, EPR spectra of the pigments containing the 227R1 sensor were measured at pH 7.5, 6.0, and 5.0. No effect of pH was observed when the spectra were measured in the dark. In the spectra of illuminated 9-dm-V227R1 pigment, the fraction of the immobile nitroxide component increased slightly with decreasing pH (Fig. 3A, top right). However, the EPR spectral change at pH 5.0 is substantially smaller than the spectral change of the V227R1 pigment (Fig. 3B, top right), consistent with the UV/visible spectra that show less MII formation in the former case. This may be explained by the remaining 9-dm-rhodopsin and 9-dm-isorhodopsin in photoequilibrium (see thesupplemental data) and the spectral difference between MII and MIIPSB (see below). At low pH, RSB-protonated MIIPSB absorbing at 466 nm is formed that was identified earlier for unlabeled 9-dm-E134Q pigment by UV/visible and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (12Meyer C.K. Böhme M. Ockenfels A. Gärtner W. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19713-19718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Vogel R. Fan G.B. Sheves M. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8895-8908Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To examine the correlation between TM6 motion and MIIPSB formation, we investigated 9-dm-E134Q/V227R1 in the pH range 5.0–7.5. No pH dependence was observed for the dark state as in the corresponding E134Q/V227R1 pigment (not shown). In the illuminated state of 9-dm-E134Q/V227R1 at pH 7.5, the fraction of the immobile nitroxide component in the EPR spectrum (Fig. 3A, bottom right, blue line) was maximal and almost the same as for illuminated V227R1 and E134Q/V227R1 (Fig. 3B, right), indicating a fully tilted TM6 consistent with full MII formation (Fig. 2E). As a side effect at pH 5, 9-dm-E134Q/V227R1 yields in photoequilibrium ≈20% 9-dm-rhodopsin and 9-dm-isorhodopsin besides MII and MIIPSB (see thesupplemental data). Taking this into account, the EPR spectrum of MIIPSB, which is predominant in the spectrum at pH 5 (Fig. 3A, bottom right), is more similar to activated MII than the inactive dark state, but details of the line shape are different, particularly in the region corresponding to the more mobile state of the nitroxide. Although not large, this difference suggests that the conformation of the protein in MIIPSB is different from that of either the dark or active MII states. EPR Difference Spectra–To address the question of whether the partial changes in the mobile/immobile components in the EPR spectra are due to an equilibrium of two conformational states (i.e. two different environments of the R1 nitroxide sensor, as e.g. in MI and MII) or a partial motion of TM6, we calculated EPR difference spectra. Difference spectra of the illuminated minus the dark state at pH 6 are shown in Fig. 4 for V227R1 (red line), 9-dm-V227R1 (green line), and 9-dm-E134Q/V227R1 (blue line), all normalized to the same height. The basic shape of the difference spectra is similar for all pigments. This is also true for the low field region of the spectra, which best shows the changes in mobile (m) and immobile (im) components of the R1 nitroxide arising from light activation of the pigments. Because the differences are mainly in the amplitude and not shape, it is likely that the helix locations sampled in each case are similar. This would not be expected if the TM6 helix underwent partial motion in the 9-dm pigments where the nitroxide would experience different environments and, hence, different EPR spectra. The EPR difference spectra shown in Fig. 4 are, therefore, assumed to be the result of two nitroxide populations reflecting two positions of TM6, corroborating two classes of receptor states concerning TM6 motion. This implies that only in the MII state (but not in the MI state) TM6 is tilted outward, indicated by the low mobility of R1 (20Kusnetzow A.K. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5538-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The V250R1 Mutation Influences the MI/MII Equilibrium–We used a second sensor mutation, V250R1, at the cytop"
