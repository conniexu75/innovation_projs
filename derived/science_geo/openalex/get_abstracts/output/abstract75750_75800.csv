https://openalex.org/W2106654511,"When subjects judge whether a test symbol is contained in a short memorized sequence of symbols, their mean reaction-time increases linearly with the length of the sequence. The linearity and slope of the function imply the existence of an internal serial-comparison process whose average rate is between 25 and 30 symbols per second."
https://openalex.org/W2001634895,"The cell type responsible for inhibition by antigen of migration in vitro of peritoneal exudate cells obtained from tuberculin-hypersensitive guinea pigs was studied. Exudate populations were separated into component cell types, the lymphocyte and the macrophage. Peritoneal lymphocytes from sensitive donors were the immunologically active cells in this system, the macrophages, being merely indicator cells which migrate. Sensitized peritoneal lymphocyte populations, upon interaction with specific antigen in vitro, elaborated into the medium a soluble material capable of inhibiting migration of normal exudate cells."
https://openalex.org/W1976727612,"Our human intellect has resulted from an enormous leap in capacity above the level of monkeys and apes. Earlier, though, Old and New World monkeys' intelligence outdistanced that of other mammals, including the prosimian primates. This first great advance in intelligence probably was selected through interspecific competition on the large continents. However, even at this early stage, primate social life provided the evolutionary context of primate intelligence. Two arguments support this conclusion. One is ontogenetic: modern monkeys learn so much of their social behavior, and learn their behavior toward food and toward other species through social example. The second is phylogenetic: some prosimians, the social lemurs, have evolved the usual primate type of society and social learning without the capacity to manipulate objects as monkeys do. It thus seems likely that the rudiments of primate society preceded the growth of primate intelligence, made it possible, and determined its nature."
https://openalex.org/W2091210055,"Because oxygen and carbon dioxide are very soluble in certain silicone oils and fluorocarbon liquids, these liquids will support respiration of mammals. Mice and cats respiring silicone oil die shortly after return to air breathing, while those breathing fluorocarbon survive for weeks. The respiration of mice is optimally supported by these organic liquids at about 20 degrees C. In cats, arterial oxygenation is excellent, but there is some impairment of carbon dioxide elimination. All animals have suffered some pulmonary damage from breathing fluorocarbon liquids. Continued investigation of organic fluid respiration may lead to development of a safe method to support the respiration of man by liquids equilibrated with gases at atmospheric pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2094338312,"We have developed an improved method for the mixed leukocyte culture test. Control values, as determined by rates of incorporation of thymidine, are very low, allowing evaluation of low levels of stimulation in homologous cell mixtures. One-way stimulation is assayed by treating the cells of one individual with mitomycin C; treated cells cannot respond (incorporate thymidine) but can still stimulate homologous untreated cells to do so."
https://openalex.org/W2056655623,"The nucleotide sequence of a tyrosine transfer ribonucleic acid is described and compared to the known sequence of an alanine transfer RNA. It is possible to construct very similar base-paired models for the two molecules in spite of only limited similarities in sequences. The evidence indicates that the sequence containing guanosine, pseudouridine, and adenosine in the middle of the polynucleotide chain is the anticodon."
https://openalex.org/W1965120529,Precision scale models of sickle-cell hemoglobin molecules indicate that the genetic substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the 6th position in the two beta chains allows an intramolecular hydrophobic bond to form. This changes the conformation in such a way as to allow molecular stacking. Optical rotatory dispersion studies and the restilts of suLbjection of Hb S solution to temperature change and to propane are consistent with the presence of such a bond. Examination of sickled erythrocytes in a magnetic field and in polarized light indicates that the Hb S molecules are aligned iiz sitil. Filaments interpreted as hollow cables of six Hb S monofilaments have been demonstrated by electron microscopy.
https://openalex.org/W1977205648,"The rate of polymerization of hydrogen cyanide to aminomalononitrile and the tetramer, diaminomalonodinitrile, is quadratic in the total cyanide concentration. Since the reactions form part of a plausible prebiotic purine synthesis and since they compete with hydrolysis, concentration of cyanide may have been important. This may be achieved usefully by cooling to separate out ice."
https://openalex.org/W2006005082,"The transverse electrical impedance of thin lipid films separating two aqueous saline solutions containing a small concentration of antibodies or enzymes decreases markedly and reversibly after immunological and enzymatic reactions involving such protein molecules, which presumably are adsorbed to the lipid-water interface."
https://openalex.org/W1969640104,"Sleep deprivation, induced by injections of dextroamphetamine or by forced treadmill activity, resulted in a temporary increase in daily sleep time. However, increasing the period of sleep deprivation above 24 hours to 72 or 120 hours did not result in increased recovery sleep above that present in the 24-hour group."
https://openalex.org/W2002997708,"Subcutaneous or intravenous injections daily of purified bovine pituitary growth hormone into pregnant rats from the 7th till the 20th day of pregnancy (total dose 36 mg) resulted in offspring with unchanged body weight but with significant increases in brain weight, brain DNA content, cortical cell density, and ratio of neurons to glia."
https://openalex.org/W1988835962,A diallel analysis of mating speed as measured by the copulation frequency of male Drosophila melanogaster revealed strong directional dominance for high frequency involving a minimum of five genes. The trait as measured is highly correlated with sexual drive and fitness. Consequences for artificial selection and the nature of the heterosis displayed by the crosses are discussed. High copulation frequency of the male is probably the result of unidirectional natuiral selection.
https://openalex.org/W2017757929,"Galactose dehydrogenase, a soluble enzyme of the mammalian liver, catalyzes the conversion of galactose to galactonic acid. This reaction, together with the subsequent formation of 3-ketogalactonic acid which can be decarboxylated to yield D-xylulose, is a newly discovered pathway for the metabolism of galactose. This pathway may account for the oxidation of galactose observed in patients with galactosemia."
https://openalex.org/W1985411756,Heart rate of rats was recorded in the Estes-Skinner conditioned emotional response situation. Response to the conditioned stimulus was a decrease in rate. The change in heart rate was conditioned more slowly than suppression of bar-pressing; it was of shorter duration and was more variable than suppression.
https://openalex.org/W2025801281,"Sharp increases in the concentration of chromium in plasma were found in five subjects with normal glucose utilization after administration of glucose by mouth. This rise was not observed in two diabetics when glucose tolerance was impaired; however, it appeared when glucose tolerance was improved and when trace amounts of trivalent chromium were given as a dietary supple-ment. The source of chromium which became elevated was most likely an internal pool. Possibly there is a relation between chromium and insulin function."
https://openalex.org/W2027894071,"Slow potentials evoked by odor stimulation were recorded from individual glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Systematic analysis of responses to nine different, arbitrarily selected stimuli strongly suggests a certain amount of discrimination. This fact seems to reflect in the first synapse of the olfactory tract the type of discrimination that was recently demonstrated within olfactory neuroepithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2105249535,"Thyroidectomy markedly reduces the oxidative capacity of rat liver mitochondria. After the injection of triidothyronine about half of the lost capacity is recovered within 3 hours. This rapid recovery is not associated with any change in the amounts of electron transport components, although the activities of cytochromes b and c are significantly increased by the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W2084286228,"The muscle of Latimeria chalumnae contains 30 to 71 percent (dry weight) of lipid deposited extracellularly. Wax esters constituted 90 percent or more of the lipids from muscle and fat storage tissues. These esters, by gaschromatographic analysis, consisted of C(30) to C(40) homologs with one or two double bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2019353677,Tupaia offspring are maintained in a separate nest constructed by the male parent and are suckled by the female only once every 48 hours. The young are nevertheless able to maintain a constant external body temperature of 37°C.

https://openalex.org/W2091886092,Demonstration by a combined histochemical and electron-microscopic technique of the ultrastructure of and acid phosphatase within the juxtaglomerular granules in kidneys of normal man and rat and in those from members of both species with renal Hypertension indicate the identity of Juxtaglomerular granules as lysosomes.
https://openalex.org/W2084551132,"Tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. The rat pineal gland is richly innervated by sympathetic nerves from the superior cervical ganglia. The activity of tyrosine hydroxylase was measured in rat pineal gland at 4-hour intervals over a daily cycle of 12 hours of light (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) and 12 hours of darkness. The results indicate a circadian rhythm with the maximum activity, at 11 p.m. to 3 a.m., about triple the low values observed at 3 p.m. The pattern is similar in phase to that previously reported for melatonin and hydroxyindole-O-methyl transferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2096607197,"Visual receptive fields have been mapped with moving patterns in the cat's retinal ganglion cells. A small, general-purpose computer was used to collect a matrix of 2500 data points covering a 25°-by-25° region of space. The analysis of 40 units reveals the existence of many nonconcentric receptive fields and also the presence of line and edge detectors."
https://openalex.org/W2052673293,The marked viscosity of liquid cultures of the myxobacterium Chon-rococcus columnaris is caused by production of an extracellular polysaccharide. The polysaccharide is a high-molecular-weight homopolymer of D-galactosamine in which the galactosamine subunits are connected by (alpha)-(l-->4) glycosidic linkages. Half of the amino groups are acetylated.

https://openalex.org/W2085574486,The volume change occurring on polymerizing actin was measured by dilatometry. A large positive value of + 391 ml/mole was obtained for the volume change during the transformation of G- to F-actin. This large increase in volume could be interpreted as arising from the local change in the ordered water structure on the protein's surface at polymerizing sites.
https://openalex.org/W2052094564,"Blood samples for determination of plasma free fatty acids were obtained throughout the night by means of an indwelling catheter. The first sample was drawn at the onset of rapid eye movements and a second after 15 minutes of these movements. Subjects were then awakened and asked to relate their dreams; a third sample was drawn 15 to 25 minutes later. Anxiety scores derived from 20 dreams of nine subjects had significant positive correlations with changes in free fatty acids occurring during REM sleep. No statistically significant relation was found between anxiety and the changes in free fatty acids occurring from the time just before awakening to 15 to 25 minutes later. Presumably, anxiety in dreams triggers the release of catecholamines into the circulation, and these catecholamines mobilize proportional amounts of free fatty acids from body fat."
https://openalex.org/W2042857041,"The hemoglobin of the ""thin"" sibling species of Thyonella gemmata (phylum: Echinodermata; class: Holothuria) has three electrophoretically distinct polypeptide chains. In ""stout"" sibling species of T. gemmata there are only two chain types. These results account for the greater number of multiple hemoglobins in ""thins"" than in ""stouts,"" as well as for differences in the amounts of some of the multiple hemoglobins when comparisons are mnade of hemolyzates of erythrocytes from the water vascular systemn and from the main body cavity of the ""thin"" but not the ""stout"" sibling species."
https://openalex.org/W2048304457,"Dogs given opportunities to base their instrumental conditioned responses in differentiation learning on either the quality of the auditory conditioned stimulus (for example, metronome versus buzzer) or the direction of its source (in front or behind) choose different cues in different tasks. In S(1)--> R(1), S(2)-->R(2) (left leg-right leg) differentiation they exclusively use directional cues and are almost unable to learn this task when only quality cues are available. When confronted with Pavlovian S +--> R, S ---> no R (go-no go) differentiation, however, they generally learn on the basis of quality cues, although some animals also attend to the directional cues. Thus an animal's success or failure in a given differentiation procedure depends not only on its ability to discriminate the stimuli but also on the task with which it is confronted."
https://openalex.org/W2034278675,The metabolism of beta(1C)-globulin labeled with iodine-131 was studied in six normal individuals and in three individuals with glomerulonephritis who exhibited markedly reduced serum concentrations of this protein. Fractional of serum beta(1C)-globulin in glomerulonephritis appears to be chiefly secondary to decreased synthesis.
https://openalex.org/W2029620146,"Astrocytic changes in regions of long-term, cerebellar corticonuclear degeneration are characterized by large increases in cytoplasmic volume, as well as by formation of vacuoles and fibrils. Lipids are demonstrable in the vacuoles with oil red-O staining."
https://openalex.org/W2076593605,Late components of evoked potentials recorded during the occurrence and nonoccurrence of generalization are different. During generalization the evoked response waveshapes resembled those elicited by the conditioned stimulus during correct performance. The differences are statistically significant.
https://openalex.org/W2001064568,"Iodine-125-labeled ferritin molecules were detected by radioautography in the sinuses of the rat popliteal lymph node shortly after injection into the foot pad; they appeared to be taken up by macrophages and phagocytic reticular cells. Electron microscopic examination of the same tissue also revealed ferritin molecules within small lymphocytes as early as 5 minutes after injection. The antigen appeared to be taken up by the process of pinocytosis and was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. While the number of ferritin molecules observed in the lymphocyte was much less than that taken into the inacrophage, the observation is significant in understanding the role lymphocytes play during the early phase of antibody response."
https://openalex.org/W2039939376,Patients with homocystinuria excrete in their urine small amounts of an amino acid indistinguishable from authentic L-homolanthionine. This compound could be formed from homocysteine and homoserine by a condensation analogous to that normally leading to cystathionine. The only other known occurrence of homolanthionine in nature is in a methionine-requiring mutant strain of Escherichia coli.
https://openalex.org/W2078942769,"Channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque), were exposed to continuously renewed solutions of endrin in water. Analyses of the fish blood by gas chromatography revealed a well-defined threshold concentration of endrin in the blood, approximately 0.30 microgram per gram, that, if exceeded, results in death. Fish exposed to lethal concentrations of endrin in water for periods of time insufficient to cause death had blood-endrin concentrations markedly lower than those that died from exposture to the same water. There was little overlap in range of endrin concentration in blood between dead and living exposed fish."
https://openalex.org/W1998798373,The size of the second and third mandibular molar teeth of inbred mice is altered if the mice are fostered on a different strain. The dental change is opposite in direction to that of body weight. The prenatal and postnatal components of variance are correlated with the developmental histories of the two tooth types.
https://openalex.org/W2042571985,"In an earlier demonstration binocular shapes were produced from monocularly shapeless, random-dot stereo images. A reversal of this phenomenon is demonstrated. A stereo image is devised in which the monocularly apparent shapes of bilateral symmetry disappear when stereoscopically viewed. This phenomenon sharpens the implications of the earlier one."
https://openalex.org/W1975155995,Increased peroxidase activity and resistance to black rot was found in sweet potato roots incubated above infected roots in closed containers when compared with similar tissue incubated above uninfected roots.

https://openalex.org/W2085385080,"If RNA may contain a small proportion of adenine-guanine base pairs, these could interrupt the continuity of helical structure in a polynucleotide, in keeping with current theories of RNA structure, and could also account for the experimentally observed tendency for 6-amino bases to equal 6-keto bases and for purines to exceed pyrimidines."
https://openalex.org/W2035880794,"The mode of inheritance of open-field defecation was found to differ according to earlier treatment of the mice. Activity of hybrids, however, was closer to that of the less active parent for all conditions of pretreatment. These results suggest that adequate sampling not only of gene pools, but also of both pretest and test environments, is necessary before statements concerning effects of prior treatment, or mode of inheritance of specific behavior, are valid."

https://openalex.org/W2068800264,"Evidece at the enzymic level confirms the dual origin of the genetic material of somatic hybrids. Furthermore, the pattern of glucuronidase gene expression in somatic hybrids qualitatively resembles that in livers of animal heterozygous for this gene."
https://openalex.org/W1984901843,"Adenovirus type 5 was isolated from blood clots from 27 of 30 sporadic cases of infectious hepatitis. Only one isolation of virus, also adenovirus 5, was made from blood clots from 70 persons with no known contact with infectious hepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2032616328,"In cats whose aortic nerves were severed subsequent deafferentation of the carotid body chemoceptors (the carotid sinus baroceptors remaining intact) did not change arterial pressure during wakefulness or light sleep, but the falls in pressure during deep sleep were markedly exaggerated. Subsequent baroceptive denervation did not modify the hypotensive effect."
https://openalex.org/W2080019678,The normal sequence of molecular events which occurs during feather and skin differentiation in the chick embryo is interrupted by pituitary gland ablation. The characteristic pattern of development is reestablished in hypophysectomized embryos treated with pituitary extract and in hypophysectomized embryos in parabiotic union with their twins within a double-yolked egg. These results suggest that genetic expression in differentiating chick feather and skin after day 12 of incubation is regulated by hormones.
https://openalex.org/W1983474565,"A microperfusion chamnber, which provides controlled circulation of nutrient with chamber depths varying between 15 and 1500 microns and which permits the maintenance of transverse concentration gradients of nutrient constituents or gases, is described. The added advantage of facilitating controlled flow between adjacent chambers on a standard slide (38 x 76 mm) makes the chamber useful in the study of both plant and animal materials. Examples of such use are given."
https://openalex.org/W2011494327,"After hepatic injury induced by carbon tetrachloride, mitotically active hematopoietic cells of nonhepatic origin localize in the liver as judged by an increase in colony-forming nodules in the spleens of lethally irradiated recipient mice on intravenous injection of cells from these livers. The administration of warfarin suppresses the localization of colony-forming units in the regenerating liver by inhibiting the coagulation mechanism of the donor animals."
