https://openalex.org/W3096490487,"Gene therapy is now an effective approach to treat many forms of retinal degeneration. Delivery agents that are cell-specific, allow for multiple dosing regimens, and have low immunogenicity are needed to expand the utility of gene therapy for the retina. We generated eight novel lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) ranging in size from 50 nm to 150 nm by changing the PEG content from 5% to 0.5%, respectively. Subretinal injections of LNP-mRNA encoding luciferase revealed that 0.5% PEG content within nanoparticles elicits the highest expression. Similar injections of LNP delivered cre mRNA into Ai9 mice revealed cell-specific protein expression in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), confirmed by fundus photography and immunohistochemistry of whole globe cross-sections. To investigate mechanisms of LNP delivery to the eye, we injected mCherry mRNA using the subretinal approach in apoE-/- and Mertk-/- mice. RPE transfection was observed in both mouse models suggesting that LNP intracellular delivery is not solely dependent on apolipoprotein adsorption or phagocytosis. To investigate LNP penetration, particles were delivered to the vitreous chamber via an intravitreal injection. The 0.5% PEG particles mediated the highest luciferase activity and expression was observed in the Müller glia, the optic nerve head and the trabecular meshwork, but failed to reach the RPE. Overall, particles containing less PEG (~150 nm in size) mediated the highest expression in the eye. Thus far, these particles successfully transfect RPE, Müller cells, the optic nerve head and the trabecular meshwork based on route of administration which can expand the utility of LNP-mediated gene therapies for the eye."
https://openalex.org/W3043529077,"Physical distancing, as a measure to contain the spreading of Covid-19, is defining a ""new normal"". Unless belonging to a family, pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are: ""in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?"", ""Are there repeated offenders?"", and ""How are new crowd management measures performing?"". Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging. In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions. The versatility and simplicity of this approach, developed to analyze crowd management measures in public transport facilities, enable to tackle issues beyond physical distancing, for instance the privacy-respectful detection of groups and the analysis of their motion patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3094122417,"I construct a dynamic social-network model of the COVID-19 epidemic which embeds the SIR epidemiological model onto a graph of person-to-person interactions. The standard SIR framework assumes uniform mixing of infectious persons in the population. This abstracts from important elements of realism and locality: (i) people are more likely to interact with members of their social networks and (ii) health and economic policies can affect differentially the rate of viral transmission via a person’s social network vs. the population as a whole. The proposed network-augmented (NSIR) model allows the evaluation, via simulations, of (i) health and economic policies and outcomes for all or subset of the population: lockdown/distancing, herd immunity, testing, contact tracing; (ii) behavioral responses and/or imposing or lifting policies at specific times or conditional on observed states. I find that viral transmission over a network-connected population can proceed slower and reach lower peak than transmission via uniform mixing. Network connections introduce uncertainty and path dependence in the epidemic dynamics, with a significant role for bridge links and superspreaders. Testing and contact tracing are more effective in the network model. If lifted early, distancing policies mostly shift the infection peak into the future, with associated economic costs. Delayed or intermittent interventions or endogenous behavioral responses generate a multi-peaked infection curve, a form of ‘curve flattening’, but may have costlier economic consequences by prolonging the epidemic duration."
https://openalex.org/W3094664795,"In this study we modelled possible causes and consequences of student burnout and engagement on academic efficacy and dropout intention in university students. Further we asked, can student engagement protect against the effects of burnout? In total 4,061 university students from Portugal, Brazil, Mozambique, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Finland, Serbia, and Macao SAR, Taiwan participated in this study. With the data collected we analyzed the influence of Social Support, Coping Strategies, and school/course related variables on student engagement and burnout using structural equation modeling. We also analyzed the effect of student engagement, student burnout, and their interaction, on Academic Performance and Dropout Intention. We found that both student engagement and burnout are good predictors of subjective academic performance and dropout intention. However, student burnout suppresses the effect of student engagement on these variables. This result has strong implications for practitioners and administrators. To prevent student dropout, it is not enough to promote student engagement—additionally, and importantly, levels of student burnout must be kept low. Other variables such as social support and coping strategies are also relevant predictors of student engagement and burnout and should be considered when implementing preventive actions, self-help and guided intervention programs for college students."
https://openalex.org/W3095352804,"Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) is a commercially and culturally important species to the people that live along the northern Pacific Ocean coast. There are two main sockeye salmon ecotypes-the ocean-going (anadromous) ecotype and the fresh-water ecotype known as kokanee. The goal of this study was to better understand the population structure of sockeye salmon and identify possible genomic differences among populations and between the two ecotypes. In pursuit of this goal, we generated the first reference sockeye salmon genome assembly and an RNA-seq transcriptome data set to better annotate features of the assembly. Resequenced whole-genomes of 140 sockeye salmon and kokanee were analyzed to understand population structure and identify genomic differences between ecotypes. Three distinct geographic and genetic groups were identified from analyses of the resequencing data. Nucleotide variants in an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene cluster on chromosome 26 were found to differentiate the northwestern group from the southern and upper Columbia River groups. Several candidate genes were found to be associated with the kokanee ecotype. Many of these genes were related to ammonia tolerance or vision. Finally, the sex chromosomes of this species were better characterized, and an alternative sex-determination mechanism was identified in a subset of upper Columbia River kokanee."
https://openalex.org/W3096263008,"Objective This study was designed to determine risk perception and precautionary health behavior toward coronavirus disease (COVID-19) among health professionals working in selected public university hospitals of Ethiopia. Methods A web-based cross-sectional survey was used with health professionals working in selected public university hospitals of Ethiopia. A structured survey questionnaire consisted of socio-demographic, risk perception, and behavioral response items were used. The survey questions were designed on Google form. All academic and clinical staff invited to participate in the online survey, which was carried out from May 1–14, 2020. Data analysis was done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 24. Descriptive statistics computed and the result is presented by tables and figures. Results A total of 273 health professionals participated in this study. The mean (± SD) age of participants was 31.03 ± 5.11. Study participants’ overall mean score of perceived risk was 23.59 ± 4.75. The study participants’ mean score of perceived vulnerability (4.01 ± 1.17) was higher than the human immunodeficiency virus, common cold, malaria, and tuberculosis. Regarding precautionary health behavior, the lowest mean score is for wearing gloves 1.82 ± 1.15. Conclusion Participants mean score of perceived vulnerability of coronavirus disease was higher than some of the prevalent infectious disease in the area. Almost all participants applied recommended protective measures to the acceptable level, except for wearing mask and gloves. Therefore, there is a need to further intensification of more effective ways to support health professionals’ adherence to major precautionary measure is important."
https://openalex.org/W3094891738,"The salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis has been a substantial obstacle in Norwegian farming of Atlantic salmon for decades. With a limited selection of available medicines and frequent delousing treatments, resistance has emerged among salmon lice. Surveillance of salmon louse sensitivity has been in place since 2013, and consumption of medicines has been recorded since the early 80’s. The peak year for salmon lice treatments was 2015, when 5.7 times as many tonnes of salmonids were treated compared to harvested. In recent years, non-medicinal methods of delousing farmed fish have been introduced to the industry. By utilizing data on the annual consumption of medicines, annual frequency of medicinal and non-medicinal treatments, the aim of the current study was to describe the causative factors behind salmon lice sensitivity in the years 2000–2019, measured through toxicity tests–bioassays. The sensitivity data from 2000–2012 demonstrate the early emergence of resistance in salmon lice along the Norwegian coast. Reduced sensitivity towards azamethiphos, deltamethrin and emamectin benzoate was evident from 2009, 2009 and 2007, respectively. The annual variation in medicine consumption and frequency of medicinal treatments correlated well with the evolution in salmon louse sensitivity. The patterns are similar, with a relatively small response delay from the decline in the consumption of medicines in Norway (2016 and onward) to the decline in measured resistance among salmon louse (2017 and onward). 2017 was the first year in which non-medicinal treatments outnumbered medicinal delousing treatments as well as the peak year in numbers of cleanerfish deployed. This study highlights the significance of avoiding heavy reliance on a few substance groups to combat ectoparasites, this can be a potent catalyst for resistance evolution. Further, it demonstrates the importance of transparency in the global industry, which enables the industry to learn from poor choices in the past."
https://openalex.org/W3096840242,"The Asian bush mosquito, Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald, 1901), a potential vector of several pathogens, has recently established in North America and Central Europe. In 2013, it was found on the Slovenian-Croatian border, and during the following years, it emerged in more and more counties of northwestern Croatia. Surveillance of Ae. j. japonicus and other invasive mosquito species was subsequently extended both spatially and temporally in Croatia and neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Mosquito collections were conducted in 2017 and 2018, based on adult trapping through dry ice-baited CDC traps and BG-Lure-baited BG-Sentinel traps, larval sampling through dippers and nets, and ovitrapping. Aedes j. japonicus specimens from collected samples were subjected to population genetic analysis by comparing microsatellite signatures and nad4 DNA sequences between sampled locations and with data previously obtained from more western European distribution areas. Aedes j. japonicus immature stages were found at 19 sites in Croatia, two sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina and one site in Serbia. In Croatia, four new counties were found colonised, two in the east and two in the south of the previously known distribution area. A spread of 250 km could thus be documented within five years. The findings in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia represent the first records of Ae. j. japonicus in these countries. Genetic analysis suggests at least two introduction events into the surveyed area. Among the locations analysed, Orahovica can be considered a genetic border. The individuals collected west of this point were found to be similar to samples previously collected in the border regions of Southeast Germany/Austria and Austria/Slovenia, while the specimens from more eastern Croatian localities, together with those from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, were genetically different and could not be assigned to a probable origin. Thus, introduction from Central Europe, possibly by vehicular traffic, into the study area is likely, but other origins, transportation routes and modes of entry appear to contribute. Further dispersal of Ae. j. japonicus to other parts of southeastern Europe is anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W3094687032,"Background Rintatolimod is a selective TLR3 agonist, which has demonstrated clinical activity for ME/CFS in Phase II and Phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-site clinical trials. Methods and findings A hypothesis-based post-hoc analysis of the Intent to Treat (ITT) population diagnosed with ME/CFS from 12 independent clinical sites of a Phase III trial was performed to evaluate the effect of rintatolimod therapy based on disease duration. The clinical activity of rintatolimod was evaluated by exercise treadmill tolerance (ETT) using a modified Bruce protocol. The ITT population (n = 208) was divided into two subsets of symptom duration. Patients with symptom duration of 2–8 years were identified as the Target Subset (n = 75); the remainder (<2 year plus >8 year) were identified as the Non-Target Subset (n = 133). Placebo-adjusted percentage improvements in exercise duration and the vertical rise for the Target Subset (n = 75) were more than twice that of the ITT population. The Non-Target Subset (n = 133) failed to show any clinically significant ETT response to rintatolimod when compared to placebo. Within the Target Subset, 51.2% of rintatolimod-treated patients improved their exercise duration by ≥25% (p = 0.003) despite reduced statistical power from division of the original ITT population into two subsets. Conclusion/significance Analysis of ETT from a Phase III trial has identified within the ITT population, a subset of ME/CFS patients with ≥2 fold increased exercise response to rintatolimod. Substantial improvement in physical performance was seen for the majority (51.2%) of these severely debilitated patients who improved exercise duration by ≥25%. This magnitude of exercise improvement was associated with clinically significant enhancements in quality of life. The data indicate that ME/CFS patients have a relatively short disease duration window (<8 years) to expect a significant response to rintatolimod under the dosing conditions utilized in this Phase III clinical trial. These results may have direct relevance to the cognitive impairment and fatigue being experienced by patients clinically recovered from COVID-19 and free of detectable SARS-CoV-2. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00215800."
https://openalex.org/W3095171717,"Anthropogenic noise is an often-overlooked byproduct of urbanization and affects the soundscape in which birds communicate. Previous studies assessing the impact of traffic noise have focused on bird song, with many studies demonstrating the ability of birds to raise song frequency in the presence of low-frequency traffic noise to avoid masking. Less is known about the impact of traffic noise on avian alarm calls, which is surprising given the degree to which predator information within alarm calls may impact fitness. The objective of this study was to assess the impacts of traffic noise on the Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), a small non-migratory songbird with a well-studied and information-rich alarm call. We studied birds at eight locations in Stark County, Ohio, from 15 January to 7 March 2016, and used a taxidermic mount of an Eastern Screech-Owl to elicit alarm calls. In half of the trials, a pre-recorded traffic noise track was also broadcasted at 50 decibels. In noise trials, chickadee calls contained more introductory notes (P < 0.001), more total notes (P < 0.001), were of longer duration (P < 0.001), and had lower introductory and D-note peak frequencies (P = 0.032 and P = 0.041, respectively). No differences were noted in the number of D-notes per call between noise and control trials. Modifying alarm call duration and frequency, without changing the number of D-notes, may be a strategy that chickadees use to convey predator information and to coordinate a threat-appropriate mobbing response when it is not possible to change call type. Our results add to the small, but growing, literature documenting the effects of anthropogenic noise on avian alarm calls, demonstrate the flexibility and complexity of chickadee calls given in response to predators, and may partially explain why chickadees adapt well to urban areas."
https://openalex.org/W3096398273,"Detailed information on shark and ray fisheries in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India are limited, including information on the diversity and biological characteristics of these species. We carried out fish landing surveys in South Andamans from January 2017 to May 2018, a comprehensive and cost-effective way to fill this data gap. We sampled 5,742 individuals representing 57 shark and ray species landed from six types of fishing gears. Of the 36 species of sharks and 21 species of rays landed, six species of sharks (Loxodon macrorhinus, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Sphyrna lewini, C. albimarginatus, C. brevipinna, and Paragaleus randalli) comprised 83.35% of shark landings, while three species of rays (Pateobatis jenkinsii, Himantura leoparda and H. tutul) comprised 48.82% of ray landings, suggesting a species dominance in the catch or fishing region. We provide insights into the biology of species with extensions in maximum size for seven shark species. Additionally, we document an increase in the known ray diversity for the islands and for India with three previously unreported ray species. We found that amongst sharks, mature individuals of small-bodied species (63.48% males of total landings of species less than 1.5 m total length when mature) and immature individuals of larger species (84.79% males of total landings of species larger than 1.5 m total length when mature) were mostly landed; whereas for rays, mature individuals were predominantly landed (80.71% males of total landings) likely reflecting differences in habitat preferences along life-history stages across species and fishing gear. The largest size range in sharks was recorded in landings from pelagic longlines and gillnets. Further, the study emphasizes the overlap between critical habitats and fishing grounds, where immature sharks and gravid females were landed in large quantities which might be unsustainable in the long-term. Landings were female-biased in C. amblyrhynchos, S. lewini and P. jenkinsii, and male-biased in L. macrorhinus and H. leoparda, indicating either spatio-temporal or gear-specific sexual segregation in these species. Understanding seasonal and biological variability in the shark and ray landings over a longer study period across different fisheries will inform future conservation and fishery management measures for these species in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands."
https://openalex.org/W3097008715,"Aim This study explored adolescent experiences and coping strategies for unintended pregnancy in two informal settlements—Viwandani and Korogocho—in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods Forty-nine in-depth-interviews and eight focus group discussions were conducted with male and female adolescents aged 15–19 years from households in two informal settlements. Participants were purposively selected to include adolescents of varying socio-demographic characteristics, including the married and unmarried, and adolescents who had never/ever been pregnant. Data were transcribed, translated verbatim and analyzed thematically. Results Adolescents attributed unintended pregnancy to poverty, sexual violence and inconsistent contraceptive use. Lack of parental support and guidance, as well as household conflicts also exposed girls to early sexual debut and risky sexual behavior. Decisions about pregnancy management centered on carrying the pregnancy to term or terminating it. Deciding to terminate a pregnancy was not always straightforward and was motivated by concerns about stigma or shame, and school disruption. Participants reiterated that carrying an unintended pregnancy to term disrupts adolescents’ schooling, with few girls returning to school after childbirth. Upon deciding to carry a pregnancy to term, adolescents used several coping strategies such as relocating from usual residence, hiding until delivery and planning to put up the child for adoption upon delivery. Conclusions Early interventions to provide adolescents with comprehensive pregnancy prevention information and to address sexual violence and poverty can prevent unintended pregnancy in adolescents. Efforts to support adolescents to positively cope with unintended pregnancy and facilitate re-entry to school are also warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3097097427,"The two flagella of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are of the same size and structure but display functional differences, which are critical for flagellar steering movements. However, biochemical differences between the two flagella have not been identified. Here, we show that fluorescence protein-tagged carbonic anhydrase 6 (CAH6-mNG) preferentially localizes to the trans-flagellum, which is organized by the older of the two flagella-bearing basal bodies. The uneven distribution of CAH6-mNG is established early during flagellar assembly and restored after photobleaching, suggesting that it is based on preferred entry or retention of CAH6-mNG in the trans-flagellum. Since CAH6-mNG moves mostly by diffusion, a role of intraflagellar transport (IFT) in establishing its asymmetric distribution is unlikely. Interestingly, CAH6-mNG is present in both flagella of the non-phototactic bardet-biedl syndrome 1 (bbs1) mutant revealing that the BBSome is involved in establishing CAH6-mNG flagellar asymmetry. Using dikaryon rescue experiments, we show that the de novo assembly of CAH6-mNG in flagella is considerably faster than the removal of ectopic CAH6-mNG from bbs flagella. Thus, different rates of flagellar entry of CAH6-mNG rather than its export from flagella is the likely basis for its asymmetric distribution. The data identify a novel role for the C. reinhardtii BBSome in preventing the entry of CAH6-mNG specifically into the cis-flagellum."
https://openalex.org/W3097187984,"The behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 virus is certainly one of the most challenging in contemporary world. Although the mathematical modelling of the virus has made relevant contributions, the unpredictable behaviour of the virus is still not fully understood. To identify some aspects of the virus elusive behaviour, we focused on the temporal characteristics of its course. We have analysed the latency trends the virus has realized worldwide, the outbreak of the hot spots, and the decreasing trends of the pandemic. We found that the spatio-temporal pandemic dynamics shows a complex behaviour. As with physical systems, these changes in the pandemic’s course, which we have called transitional stages of contagion, highlight shared characteristics in many countries. The main results of this work is that the pandemic progression rhythms have been clearly identified for each country, providing the processes and the stages at which the virus develops, thus giving important information on the activation of containment and control measures."
https://openalex.org/W3094926110,"In 2014, in some parts of the water distribution system of the municipality of Pietrasanta (Tuscany, Italy), thallium (Tl) levels above the recommended limits were measured and some restrictions to water usage for drinking and food preparation were imposed. The study aimed to assess Tl exposure and possible health effects by means of a human biomonitoring survey. In the 2014-2016 time frame, 2154 urine and 254 hair samples were taken from different population groups and from a control group. The levels of Tl found in urine and hair were statistically higher in exposed groups than in controls and compared to the reference values for the general population. Concentrations in urine were significantly associated with the geographical origin of the sample, the consumption of drinking water and food grown in local gardens. A significant association was found between urine and hair. No positive associations were found between the Tl levels in hair or urine and several self-reported symptoms and health effects, except for sleep disturbance. The study indicates that the concentration of Tl in drinking water can be traced by urine analysis. Urine and hair have proven to be biological matrices that can be effectively used for the evaluation of Tl exposure. To date, the study represents the most extensive human biomonitoring campaign for the evaluation of the Tl exposure available at international level."
https://openalex.org/W3097311425,"This article employs a person-centred approach to test the relationship between personality traits and empirically defined political participant types. We argue that it is more appropriate to focus on types of participants to test the relationship between personality and political participation than on individual modes or latent dimensions of political participation. Our reasoning is that the person-centred approach allows us to learn more about how and why citizens combine different modes of participation from a tool kit of available political activities to achieve a goal as a function of their personality. We rely on data collected by the German Longitudinal Election Study 2017 (GLES, ZA6801). On the basis of a set of survey questions enquiring on political activities that people take part in, Latent Class Analysis allows us to identify three political participant types (inactives, voting specialists, and complete activists). The 10-item Big Five Inventory (BFI-10) measures respondents’ personality traits. Our findings suggest that conscientious people are more likely to affiliate with the voting specialists and extroverts with the more active participant types in Germany."
https://openalex.org/W3097974316,"One of the most common medical problems associated with pregnancy is hypertension. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), which has been attributable to abnormal placentation may have adverse effects on both mother and foetus if left unchecked. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of this condition and its effect on placental morphology as well as maternal and perinatal outcomes.This was a prospective case-control study, conducted at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Ghana between February 2018 and July 2018. The progression of pregnancy in normotensive and hypertensive pregnant women, and the eventual perinatal outcomes were closely followed. Statistical analysis was performed using IMB-SPSS version 23. Associations were considered significant at p values of ≤ 0.05.From a total of 214 deliveries recorded during the period of study, 84 (39.25%) were hypertensives. Forty four (52%) of the hypertensives had preeclampsia, 28 (33.3%) had gestational hypertension, 6 (7.1%) had eclampsia, 4 (4.8%) had chronic hypertension, and 2 (2.4%) had preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. The frequency of placental haematoma, placental infarction, and placental calcification in the normotensives were significantly (p = 0.001) lower than that of the hypertensives. The mean placental weight (p = 0.01), placental volume (p = 0.001), placental diameter (p = 0.03), and placental thickness (p = 0.001) of the normotensives were significantly higher than those of the hypertensives. The number of normotensives in whom labour was induced, who had their babies delivered by caesarean section, and who were admitted after they had given birth were significantly (p = 0.001) lower than that of hypertensives who underwent similar procedures. No stillbirths were recorded in the normotensives compared with four in the hypertensives. The number of babies delivered to the normotensives who were admitted to the NICU was significantly (p = 0.001) lower than those delivered by hypertensives.There was a high prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in the study site. Pregnant women who developed HDP are at a risk of developing placental abnormalities that adversely affected perinatal outcomes. These adverse effects can be curtailed by embarking on a vigorous health education drive."
https://openalex.org/W3094646227,"Temperature varies on a daily and seasonal scale and thermal fluctuations are predicted to become even more pronounced under future climate changes. Studies suggest that plastic responses are crucial for species' ability to cope with thermal stress including variability in temperature, but most often laboratory studies on thermal adaptation in plant and ectotherm organisms are performed at constant temperatures and few species included. Recent studies using fluctuating thermal regimes find that thermal performance is affected by both temperature mean and fluctuations, and that plastic responses likely will differ between species according to life strategy and selective past. Here we investigate how acclimation to fluctuating or constant temperature regimes, but with the same mean temperature, impact on heat stress tolerance across a plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) and two arthropod species (Orchesella cincta and Drosophila melanogaster) inhabiting widely different thermal microhabitats and with varying capability for behavioral stress avoidance. Moreover, we investigate the underlying metabolic responses of acclimation using NMR metabolomics. We find increased heat tolerance for D. melanogaster and A. thaliana exposed to fluctuating acclimation temperatures, but not for O. cincta. The response was most pronounced for A. thaliana, which also showed a stronger metabolome response to thermal fluctuations than both arthropods. Generally, sugars were more abundant across A. thaliana and D. melanogaster when exposed to fluctuating compared to constant temperature, whereas amino acids were less abundant. This pattern was not evident for O. cincta, and generally we do not find much evidence for similar metabolomics responses to fluctuating temperature acclimation across species. Differences between the investigated species' ecology and different ability to behaviorally thermoregulate may have shaped their physiological responses to thermal fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W3094854186,"This article reports the development and validation of an instrument, the Technology-Based Self-Regulated English Learning Strategies Scale (TSELSS), in terms of its multifaceted structure of self-directed use of technology in English learning among Chinese university EFL students. TSELSS was developed through a three-phase process, focusing on the domain of self-regulated English learning in technology-assisted conditions. The first phase involved the generation of an item pool, the second a pilot study (N = 164) aimed at identifying the factor structure of TSELSS using exploratory factor analysis, and the third an examination of the psychometric properties of the revised TSELSS using confirmatory factor analysis with another independent sample of students (N = 525). Furthermore, the concurrent validity of TSELSS was investigated through correlations with students’ English language self-efficacy and English learning outcomes. The final version of the scale is made up of five types of technology-based self-regulated English learning strategies: motivational regulation strategies, goal setting and learning evaluation, social strategies, technology-based English song and movie learning, and technology-based vocabulary learning. The TSELSS can be used as an evaluation tool to appraise EFL students’ technology-based self-regulated English learning experience, and as a research tool to investigate more associations between technology-based self-regulated strategic English learning and other contextual and learner individual factors."
https://openalex.org/W3096888722,"Epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation act as mediators in the interaction between genome and environment. Variation in the epigenome can both affect phenotype and be inherited, and epigenetics has been suggested to be an important factor in the evolutionary process. During domestication, dogs have evolved an unprecedented between-breed variation in morphology and behavior in an evolutionary short period. In the present study, we explore DNA methylation differences in brain, the most relevant tissue with respect to behavior, between wolf and dog breeds. We optimized a combined method of genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) for its application in canines. Genomic DNA from the frontal cortex of 38 dogs of 8 breeds and three wolves was used. GBS and GBS-MeDIP libraries were prepared and sequenced on Illuma HiSeq2500 platform. The reduced sample represented 1.18 ± 0.4% of the total dog genome (2,4 billion BP), while the GBS-MeDIP covered 11,250,788 ± 4,042,106 unique base pairs. We find substantial DNA methylation differences between wolf and dog and between the dog breeds. The methylation profiles of the different groups imply that epigenetic factors may have been important in the speciation from dog to wolf, but also in the divergence of different dog breeds. Specifically, we highlight methylation differences in genes related to behavior and morphology. We hypothesize that these differences are involved in the phenotypic variation found among dogs, whereas future studies will have to find the specific mechanisms. Our results not only add an intriguing new dimension to dog breeding but are also useful to further understanding of epigenetic involvement."
https://openalex.org/W3097089133,"Introduction The increasing trend of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among the young population is a significant public health problem. This study aimed to determine the level of knowledge on STIs among students in higher education institutions and its predicting factors, in Melaka. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted among 600 students from higher education institutions in Melaka aged between 18 to 30 years old. Multistage sampling of the institutions was performed. Valid and reliable self-administered questionnaire in the national language, Bahasa Malaysia, was used as to collect data on sociodemographic, personal background, knowledge on STIs and sources of information for STIs. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS software version 25. Results The response rate for this study was 88%. The mean knowledge score was 24.1 ±5.1 out of 38. HIV was the most known STIs while gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis and chlamydial infections were among the least known STIs. Oral intercourse was the least known sexual activity that could transmit STIs. Higher proportion of respondents had correct knowledge on control and preventive measures of STIs (between 78% and 95%) compared to correct knowledge on sign and symptoms of STIs (between 8.5% and 67.8%). More than 90% of the respondents were unaware that a person infected with STIs could be symptom free. Four variables were identified as the determinants of the knowledge on STIs, which were level of education, place of stay, history of sexual and reproductive health education and involvement in STIs awareness programs (F (4,445) = 11.405, p <0.001, R2 = 0.093). Conclusions The knowledge on STIs among students in higher education institutions was unsatisfactory. The existing sexual education programs can be strengthened by delivering more information on other STIs rather than focusing on HIV only. The future program should focus on students of diploma and/or skill certificate and staying off-campus."
https://openalex.org/W3094761199,"Background Routine immunization coverage has stagnated over the past decade and fallen short of WHO targets in Ethiopia. Community engagement strategies that reach beyond traditional health systems may reduce dropout and increase coverage. This evaluation assesses changes in immunization, postpartum family planning, and antenatal care coverage after implementation of an enhanced community engagement and defaulter tracing strategy, entitled “Fifth Child” project, across two districts in Benishangul-Gumuz Regional State (BGRS), Ethiopia. Methods and findings A formative evaluation was conducted to examine the contribution of the strategy on immunization, postpartum family planning and antenatal care utilization in Assosa and Bambasi districts of BGRS. The quantitative findings are presented here. Routine and project-specific data were analyzed to assess changes in uptake of childhood vaccinations, postpartum family planning and antenatal care. Between January 2013 and December 2016, pentavalent-3 coverage increased from 63% to 84% in Assosa, and from 78% to 93% in Bambasi. Similarly, measles vaccine coverage increased from 77% to 81% in Assosa, and from 59% to 86% in Bambasi. Approximately 54% of all eligible infants across both woredas defaulted on scheduled vaccinations at least once during the period. Among defaulting children, 84% were identified and subsequently caught up on the vaccinations missed. Secondary outcomes of postpartum family planning and antenatal care also increased in both woredas. Conclusion The “Fifth Child” project likely contributed to enhanced immunization performance and increased utilization of immunization and select perinatal health services in two woredas of BGRS. Further research is required in order to determine the impact of this community engagement strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3095006334,"The isotopic composition of baleen whales’ epidermis structural layers can give information about dietary change over time. This study investigated if epidermis layers integrated isotopic values that record physiological changes from gestation to lactation. Epidermis tissues (n = 43) were collected from free ranging lactating female gray whale and calves during the beginning of three breeding seasons. Modelling of δ13C and δ15N values show intra- and inter-individual differences based on epidermal layers, age class and year of sampling. The isotopic composition of mother-calf pairs is correlated, and the estimates of the maximum mother-to-calf isotopic difference was ~1.4‰ for δ13C and between 1 and 1.5‰ for δ15N values. Change in δ15N values among epidermal layers in calves was associated with the transition from fetus to consumption of maternal milk. It is here proposed when lactation influences calf epidermis, δ15N values decrease consistently from the outermost to the innermost layer. However, if a calf was born only few days before collection, epidermis integrates more variable δ15N patterns because gestation still affects the isotopic composition of the layers. The possibility of calculating mother-to-calf nitrogen isotope fractionation, and the regularity of changes between calf layer δ15N values, allowed results of an isotopic clock model to predict the age of each calf when sampled with its mother. This model has the potential to be a straightforward method to estimate the beginning of lactation, therefore calf birth date when direct observations are not feasible. The non-lethal remote collection of epidermis appears to be an effective tool for the study of the physiology of reproduction of baleen whales. The parallel study of the three epidermal structural layers highlighted the importance of considering the unique mother-calf pair physiological status at the time of sampling time when stable isotope results are interpreted."
https://openalex.org/W3046044621,"Kernel methods are powerful machine learning techniques which implement generic non-linear functions to solve complex tasks in a simple way. They Have a solid mathematical background and exhibit excellent performance in practice. However, kernel machines are still considered black-box models as the feature mapping is not directly accessible and difficult to interpret.The aim of this work is to show that it is indeed possible to interpret the functions learned by various kernel methods is intuitive despite their complexity. Specifically, we show that derivatives of these functions have a simple mathematical formulation, are easy to compute, and can be applied to many different problems. We note that model function derivatives in kernel machines is proportional to the kernel function derivative. We provide the explicit analytic form of the first and second derivatives of the most common kernel functions with regard to the inputs as well as generic formulas to compute higher order derivatives. We use them to analyze the most used supervised and unsupervised kernel learning methods: Gaussian Processes for regression, Support Vector Machines for classification, Kernel Entropy Component Analysis for density estimation, and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion for estimating the dependency between random variables. For all cases we expressed the derivative of the learned function as a linear combination of the kernel function derivative. Moreover we provide intuitive explanations through illustrative toy examples and show how to improve the interpretation of real applications in the context of spatiotemporal Earth system data cubes. This work reflects on the observation that function derivatives may play a crucial role in kernel methods analysis and understanding."

Inversions can be detected and characterized using principal component analysis (PCA) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To aid in developing such methods, we formed a new benchmark derived from three publicly-available insect data. We then used this benchmark to perform an extended validation of our software for inversion analysis (Asaph). Through that process, we identified and characterized several problematic test cases liable to misinterpretation that can help guide PCA-based inversion detection. Lastly, we re-analyzed the 2R chromosome arm of 150 An. gambiae and coluzzii samples and observed two inversions (2Rc and 2Rd) that were previously known but not annotated in these particular individuals. The resulting benchmark data set and methods will be useful for future inversion detection based solely on SNP data."
https://openalex.org/W3096877308,"Background A primary school musical (“The Mould that Changed the World”) was developed as a unique public engagement strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by engaging children in the story of the discovery of antibiotics, the risks of drug-resistant infections and the importance of prudent antibiotic use. Methods The musical intervention was implemented in two UK primary schools by music specialists through a series of workshops, associated learning resources and performances to relatives. Participating children (n = 182), aged 9 to 11 years, were given an online questionnaire in the classroom before rehearsals began and at two weeks post-performance with a six-month evaluation in one school. The impact of the musical was analysed using generalised linear models to control for confounding factors. For the qualitative evaluation, fifteen participating children were selected randomly from each school to take part in semi-structured focus groups (n = 5 per group) before rehearsals began and two weeks post-performance. Findings Knowledge gain was demonstrated with children being more likely to answer questions on key messages of the musical correctly at two weeks post- performance (response rate 88%, n = 161) compared with the pre-rehearsal questionnaire (response rate 99%, n = 180) (bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics OR 4.63, C.I. 2.46–9.31 p<0.0001, antibiotic resistant infections can be life threatening OR 3.26 C.I. 1.75–6.32 p = 0.0001, prudent use of antibiotics will slow the rise of antibiotic resistant infections OR 2.16, C.I. 1.39–3.38, p = 0.0006). Long term knowledge gain was demonstrated by a consistent level of correct answers on key messages between two weeks (response rate 95%, n = 89) and 6 months post musical (response rate 71%, n = 67). Following the musical children participating in the focus groups (n = 30) articulated a greater understanding of AMR and the risks of antibiotic overuse. They discussed motivation to minimise personal antibiotic use and influence attitudes to antibiotics in their family and friends. Interpretation This study demonstrates that musical theatre can improve both short and long-term knowledge. It demonstrates a hitherto infrequently reported change in attitude and motivation to change behaviour in children at an influential age for health beliefs. This unique public health tool has the potential for high impact particularly if rolled out within national education programmes for primary school aged children."
https://openalex.org/W3096899753,"Expression of virulence factors in non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica depends on a wide variety of general and specific transcriptional factors that act in response to multiple environmental signals. Expression of genes for cellular invasion located in the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) is tightly regulated by several transcriptional regulators arrayed in a cascade, while repression of this system is exerted mainly by H-NS. In SPI-1, H-NS represses the expression mainly by binding to the regulatory region of hilA and derepression is exercised mainly by HilD. However, the possible regulatory role of H-NS in genes downstream from HilD and HilA, such as those regulated by InvF, has not been fully explored. Here the role of H-NS on the expression of sopB, an InvF dependent gene encoded in SPI-5, was evaluated. Our data show that InvF is required for the expression of sopB even in the absence of H-NS. Furthermore, in agreement with previous results on other InvF-regulated genes, we found that the expression of sopB requires the InvF/SicA complex. Our results support that SicA is not required for DNA binding nor for increasing affinity of InvF to DNA in vitro. Moreover, by using a bacterial two-hybrid system we were able to identify interactions between SicA and InvF. Lastly, protein-protein interaction assays suggest that InvF functions as a monomer. Derived from these results we postulate that the InvF/SicA complex does not act on sopB as an anti-H-NS factor; instead, it seems to induce the expression of sopB by acting as a classical transcriptional regulator."
https://openalex.org/W3095194583,"Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health challenge and leading infectious killer worldwide. The need for continuous evaluation of TB treatment outcomes becomes more imperative in the midst of a global economic meltdown substantially impacting resource-limited-settings. Methods This study retrospectively reviewed 25-years of treatment outcomes in 3,384 patients who were managed for TB at a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. Confirmed TB cases were given directly observed therapy of a short-course treatment regimen and monitored for clinical response. Results Out of 1,146,560 patients screened, there were 24,330 (2.1%) presumptive and 3,384 (13.9%) confirmed TB cases. The patients’ mean age was 35.8 years (0.33–101 years). There were 1,902 (56.2%) male, 332(9.8%) pediatric, and 2,878 (85%) pulmonary TB cases. The annual mean measured treatment outcomes were as follows: adherence, 91.4(±5.8) %; successful outcome, 75.3(±8.8) % potentially unsatisfactory outcome, 14.8(±7.2) %; and mortality 10.0(±3.6) %. Female, extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB), newly diagnosed, and relapsed patients compliant with treatment had successful outcomes. Adulthood and HIV infection were mortality risk factors. Conclusion The mean annual successful treatment outcome is 75.3(±8.8) %. Female, pediatric, EPTB, new, and relapsed patients were predisposed to successful treatment outcomes. Lessons learned will guide future program modifications."
https://openalex.org/W3096011207,"Background Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people experience a greater burden of disease and die younger than non-Indigenous Australians, with Aboriginal people living in remote areas of the Northern Territory of Australia having the lowest life expectancy estimates. Despite a high burden of chronic disease among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, access to specialist health services remains low and models of care that increase engagement, may improve health outcomes. Methods We describe client and staff perspectives of a model of clinical genetics services provided by the MJD Foundation (MJDF) in geographically and culturally complex contexts within the Northern Territory of Australia. We seek to understand the MJDF model’s success in supporting Aboriginal families with the familial, neurodegenerative condition Machado-Joseph disease and how it could be applied in the provision of other specialist services. Thematic analysis was undertaken on semi-structured interviews with primary health care staff (n = 2), Non-Aboriginal MJDF Staff (n = 7) and Aboriginal MJDF Clients / Community workers (n = 13). Results Four key themes regarding the MJDF model of service delivery were identified with the service being; 1) client led 2) accepting of various understandings of genetic disease causation 3) focused on relationships, continuity and trust between the service provider and the clients, and 4) committed to incorporating an inclusive whole-of-family practice. The MJDF model takes a community-based, person-and family-centred approach to successfully deliver effective specialist genetic health services in remote community settings. We propose that these approaches have broad application in the future design and delivery of specialist health services particularly in culturally complex settings."
https://openalex.org/W3097481154,"The Cleveland Bay horse is one of the oldest equines in the United Kingdom, with pedigree data going back almost 300 years. The studbook is essentially closed and because of this, there are concerns about loss of genetic variation across generations. The breed is one of five equine breeds listed as “critical” (<300 registered adult breeding females) by the UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust in their annual Watchlist. Due to their critically endangered status, the current breadth of their genetic diversity is of concern, and assessment of this can lead to improved breed management strategies. Herein, both genealogical and molecular methods are combined in order to assess founder representation, lineage, and allelic diversity. Data from 15 microsatellite loci from a reference population of 402 individuals determined a loss of 91% and 48% of stallion and dam lines, respectively. Only 3 ancestors determine 50% of the genome in the living population, with 70% of maternal lineage being derived from 3 founder females, and all paternal lineages traced back to a single founder stallion. Methods and theory are described in detail in order to demonstrate the scope of this analysis for wider conservation strategies. We quantitatively demonstrate the critical nature of the genetic resources within the breed and offer a perspective on implementing this data in considered breed management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3096086126,"Studies of viral suppression on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) in Haiti are limited, particularly among PLHIV outside of the Ouest department, where the capital Port-au-Prince is located. This study described the prevalence and risk factors for delayed viral suppression among PLHIV in all geographic departments of Haiti between 2013 and 2017. Individuals who received viral load testing 3 to 12 months after ART initiation were included. Data on demographics and clinical care were obtained from the Haitian Active Longitudinal Tracking of HIV database. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to predict delayed viral suppression, defined as a viral load ≥1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL after at least 3 months on ART. Viral load test results were available for 3,368 PLHIV newly-initiated on ART. Prevalence of delayed viral suppression was 40%, which is slightly higher than previous estimates in Haiti. In the multivariable analysis, delayed viral suppression was significantly associated with younger age, receiving of care in the Ouest department, treatment with lamivudine (3TC), zidovudine (AZT), and nevirapine (NVP) combined ART regimen, and CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3. In conclusion, this study was the first to describe and compare differences in delayed viral suppression among PLHIV by geographic department in Haiti. We identified populations to whom public health interventions, such as more frequent viral load testing, drug resistance testing, and ART adherence counseling should be targeted."

The aim of this study was to establish the patterns of calcaneal facets for the talus, to calculate their total area, and to analyse the data with respect to gender. The study involved 59 calcanei which were photographed. The patterns of calcaneal facets noted in this study were compared with the patterns from the literature. ImageJ program was used to measure different parameters on calcanei. The pattern 1 was the most commonly found in the study sample (45.76%), then the pattern 2 (40.68%), and finally the pattern 3 (13.56%). That order of frequencies is the same in both sexes. The patterns 1 and 2 have a larger contact surface for the talus in comparison to the pattern 3. Male bones have a larger contact surface for the talus than female bones. The sum of the pattern 1 and pattern 3 frequencies was high. Knowing the frequency of different patterns of calcaneal facets for the talus in a certain population is important for orthopaedic surgeons when performing foot osteotomy."
https://openalex.org/W3095419870,"Background Medical decision-making relies partly on the probability of disease. Current recommendations for the management of common diseases are based increasingly on scores that use arbitrary probability thresholds. Objective To assess decision-making in pharyngitis and appendicitis using a set of clinical vignettes, and the extent to which management is congruent with the true probability of having the disease. Design We developed twenty-four clinical vignettes with clinical presentations corresponding to specific probabilities of having disease defined by McIsaac (pharyngitis) or Alvarado (appendicitis) scores. Each participant answered four randomly selected web-based vignettes. Participants General practitioners (GP) working in primary care structures in Switzerland and the USA. Main measures A comparison between the GP’s management decision according to the true probability of having the disease and to the GP’s estimated probability, investigating the GP’s ability to estimate probability of disease. Key results The mean age of the GPs was 48 years (SD 12) and 66% were men. The correlation between the GP’s clinical management decision based on the vignette and the recommendations was stronger for appendicitis than pharyngitis (kw = 0.74, 95% CI 0.70–0.78 vs. kw = 0.66, 95% CI 0.62–0.71). On the other hand, the association between the clinical management decision and the probability of disease estimated by GPs was more congruent with recommendations for pharyngitis than appendicitis (kw = 0.70, 95% CI 0.66–0.73 vs. 0.61, 95% CI 0.56–0.66). Only a minority of GPs correctly estimated the probability of disease (29% for appendicitis and 39% for pharyngitis). Conclusions Despite the fact that general practitioners often misestimate the probability of disease, their management decisions are usually in line with recommendations. This means that they use other approaches, perhaps more subjective, to make decisions, such as clinical judgment or reasoning that integrate factors other than just the risk of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3095793086,"Drug-drug interaction was suggested to have played a role in the recent death due to cardiac arrest of a patient taking pimozide, sertraline and aripiprazole antipsychotic/antidepressant combination therapy. Here, we investigated the possible involvement of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated interaction among these drugs, using in vitro methods. ATPase assay confirmed that pimozide is a P-gp substrate, and might act as a P-gp inhibitor at higher concentrations. The maximum transport rate (Jmax) and half-saturation concentration (Kt) for the carrier-mediated transport estimated by means of pimozide efflux assay using P-gp-overexpressing LLC-GA5-CoL150 cells were 84.9 ± 8.9 pmol/min/mg protein, and 10.6 ± 4.7 μM, respectively. These results indicate that pimozide is a good P-gp substrate, and it appears to have the potential to cause drug-drug interactions in the digestive tract at clinically relevant gastrointestinal concentrations. Moreover, sertraline or aripiprazole significantly decreased the efflux ratio of pimozide in LLC-GA5-CoL150 cells. Transport studies using Caco-2 cell monolayers were consistent with the results in LLC-GA5-CoL150 cells, and indicate that P-gp-mediated drug-drug interaction may occur in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, P-gp inhibition by sertraline and/or aripiprazole may increase the gastrointestinal permeability of co-administered pimozide, resulting in an increased blood concentration of pimozide, which is known to be associated with an increased risk of QT prolongation, a life-threatening side effect."
https://openalex.org/W3095294219,"With the advent of highly sensitive technologies such as tandem mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing, recombinant antibodies are now routinely analyzed for the presence of low-level sequence variants including amino acid misincorporations. During mAb cell culture process development, we found that proline was replaced with the non-canonical amino acid, hydroxyproline, in the protein sequence. We investigated the relationship between proline content in the cell culture media and proline sequence variants and found that the proline concentration was inversely correlated with the amount of sequence variants detected in the protein sequence. Hydroxyproline incorporation has been previously reported in recombinant proteins produced in mammalian expression systems as a post-translational modification. Given the dependency on proline levels, the mechanism was then investigated. To address the possibility of co-translational misincorporation of hydroxyproline, we used tandem mass spectrometry to measure incorporation of stable-isotope labelled hydroxyproline added to the feed of a production bioreactor. We discovered co-translational misincorporation of labelled hydroxyproline in the recombinant antibody. These findings are significant, since they underscore the need to track non-canonical amino acid incorporation as a co-translational event in CHO cells. Understanding the mechanism of hydroxyproline incorporation is crucial in developing an appropriate control strategy during biologics production."
https://openalex.org/W3096999871,"Background Diabetic polyneuropathy is associated with significant physical disability among older adults. However, their frequency and correlates are not well known in the older adults in Sub-Saharan-Africa. The objectives were to evaluate the hospital-based prevalence of diabetic polyneuropathy and identify its correlates in older adults. Methods Over a period of 5 months, a cross-sectional survey was carried out at Douala Laquintinie Hospital (DLH), a main reference hospital in Douala, the economic capital of Cameroon. Participants in our study group comprised all patients with type 2 diabetes, whatever the reason for their reporting to the hospital. Diabetic Polyneuropathy was defined according to a Diabetic Neuropathy Examination score > 3/16. Results A total of 159 older adults with diabetes were examined during this recruitment period, among whom 106 (66.7%) were women. The mean age was 68.3 ± 6.5 years. Diabetes median duration was 108 months. For all patients assessed using the Diabetic Neuropathy Examination score, polyneuropathy was reported in 31.4%; among them, polyneuropathy proved symptomatic in 78% of them. Correlates of polyneuropathy were glycated hemoglobin (p = 0.049), HIV infection (p = 0.031) and albuminuria (p< 0.001), even after adjustment for age, gender and duration of diabetes. Conclusion A third of older adults with diabetes who visited our hospital were diagnosed with prevalent diabetes-related polyneuropathy. It shows that early detection is required through routine screening and regular follow-up examinations in order to reduce the risk of disability and improve the quality of life in elderly diabetics."
https://openalex.org/W3096113398,"Thermal spray technology, which involves the Atmospheric Plasma Spraying (APS), encompasses a category of coating processes that supply surface properties to protect or improve the performance of a substrate or component. The coating produced by this technology is built by overlapped splats, whose morphology determines the coating properties. In the same way, the splats obtained in a separated distribution by interposing a perforated mask but using the same thermal spray parameters, has a relationship with the overlapped splats inside the coating. The samples with isolated splats have the advantage of being faster and cheaper to generate and analyse. This article analyses alumina plasma-sprayed splats on steel substrates by image processing techniques, which recognize individual splats and their corresponding morphology (doughnut and pancake) parameters. These parameters allow the user to efficiently classify the splats. After that classification, a quality control can be implemented by comparison between the original and checked sample of isolated splats and a new sample obtained during a small interruption in the normal operation. Additionally, these parameters obtained in an automated way can be used to evaluate the effect of different selections of spraying process parameters."

Methods The gene expression level of NFPA and normal tissues were compared to identify the DEGs (Differential expressed genes) based on gene expression profiles (GSE2175, GSE26966 and GSE51618). Enrichment functions, pathways and key genes were identified by carrying out GO (Gene Ontology), KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis and PPI (Protein-Protein Interation) network analysis. Moreover, experiments in vitro were conducted to verify the anti-NFPAs effects of STO-609. Results 169 over-expression genes and 182 low expression genes were identified among 3 datasets. Dopaminergic synapse and vibrio cholerae infection pathways have distinctly changed in NFPA tissues. The Ca2+/CaM pathway played important roles in NFPA. Four hub proteins encoded by genes CALM1, PRDM10, RIPK4 and MAD2L1 were recognized as hub proteins. In vitro, assays showed that STO-609 induced apoptosis of NFPA cells to inhibit the hypophysoma cellular viability, diffusion and migration. Conclusion Four hub proteins, encoded by gene CALM1, PRDM10, RIPK4 and MAD2L1, played important roles in NFPA development. The Ca2+/CaM signaling pathway had significant alternations during NFPA forming process, the STO-609, a selective CaM-KK inhibitor, inhibited NFPA cellular viability, proliferation and migration.

https://openalex.org/W3097038262,"Within the Anopheles gambiae complex, the sibling species An. coluzzii and An. gambiae are undergoing sympatric speciation. These species are characterized by rare hybrids in most of their geographical distribution. A strong assortative mating mediated by spatial swarm segregation has been shown whereas no intrinsic post-zygotic barriers have been found in laboratory conditions. To test the role of the hybridisation in reproductive isolation in natural populations transplant experiment are therefore needed to establish the significance of post-zygotic barriers. Previous studies indicated that predation is one of the major forces driving ecological divergence between An. gambiae and An. coluzzii. Here we extended these studies to their hybrids. Parental species and their F1 hybrids from reciprocal crosses were generated by the forced-mating technique as follows: female An. coluzzii × male An. coluzzii; female An. coluzzii × male An. gambiae; female An. gambiae × male An. coluzzii and female An. gambiae × Male An. gambiae. First instar larvae of each group from the crossing (here after An. coluzzii, Hybrid COL/GAM, Hybrid GAM/COL and An. gambiae, respectively) were transplanted in a field experiment with predation effect. Emergence success, development time of larvae and body size of the newly emerging adults were estimated as fitness components and then compared between parental species and F1 hybrids in absence and in presence of predators. Our findings confirm that An. coluzzii had higher fitness than An. gambiae in presence of predators versus in absence of predators. Moreover, the fitness of the F1 hybrid COL/GAM whose female parent was An. coluzzii matched that of An. coluzzii while that of the F1 reciprocal hybrid GAM/COL was similar to An. gambiae."
https://openalex.org/W3097109595,"Outdoor and early mosquito biters challenge the efficacy of bed-nets and indoor residual spraying on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Outdoor residual spraying is proposed for the control of exophilic mosquito species. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of outdoor residual spraying on the biting rate of malaria vectors in Kayin state, Myanmar. Outdoor residual spraying using lambda-cyhalothrin was carried out in two villages in December 2016 (beginning of the dry season) and two villages were used as a control. Malaria mosquitoes were captured at baseline and monthly for four months after the intervention using human-landing catch and cow-baited trap collection methods. The impact of outdoor residual spraying on human-biting rate was estimated with propensity score adjusted generalized linear mixed-effect regressions. At baseline, mean indoor and outdoor human-biting rate estimates ranged between 2.12 and 29.16 bites /person /night, and between 0.20 and 1.72 bites /person /night in the intervention and control villages respectively. Using model output, we estimated that human-biting rate was reduced by 91% (95%CI = 88–96, P <0.0001) immediately after outdoor residual spraying. Human-biting rate remained low in all sprayed villages for 3 months after the intervention. Malaria vector populations rose at month 4 in the intervention villages but not in the controls. This coincided with the expected end of insecticide mist residual effects, thereby suggesting that residual effects are important determinants of intervention outcome. We conclude that outdoor residual spraying with a capsule suspension of lambda-cyhalothrin rapidly reduced the biting rate malaria vectors in this area where pyrethroid resistance has been documented."

Although several privacy-preserving auction solutions for different application scenarios have been proposed over the past few decades, none of them can perform efficient average procurement bidding while ensuring strong privacy protection for the bids of suppliers. To address this problem, we propose PSPAB, a lightweight, secure average procurement bidding system based on cryptographic tools, to provide full privacy for bids. In addition, this system allows the procurement manager to identify the users in the case of double spending. We formally prove the security of PSPAB under a semi-honest adversary model. Experimental results validate the theoretical analysis and practical application of PSPAB in real-world scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W3097933544,"Objectives 
In the United States the percentage of Medicaid enrollees in some form of Medicaid managed care has increased more than seven-fold since 1990, e.g., up from 11% in 1991 to 82% in 2017. Yet little is known about whether and how this major change in Medicaid insurance affects how recipients use hospital emergency rooms. This study compares the performance of Medicaid health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid regarding the occurrence of potentially preventable emergency department (ED) use.


Methods 
Using data from the 2003–2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a nationally representative survey of the non-institutionalized US population, we estimated multivariable logistic regression models to examine the relationship between Medicaid HMO status and potentially preventable ED use. To accommodate the composition of the Medicaid population, we conducted separate repeated cross-sectional analyses for recipients insured through both Medicaid and Medicare (dual eligibles) and for those insured through Medicaid only (non-duals). We explicitly addressed the possibility of selection bias into HMOs in our models using propensity score weighting.


Results 
We found that the type of Medicaid held by a recipient, i.e., whether an HMO or FFS coverage, was unrelated to the probability that an ED visit was potentially preventable. This finding emerged both among dual eligibles and among non-duals, and it occurred irrespective of the adopted analytical strategy.


Conclusions 
Within the U.S. Medicaid program, Medicaid HMO and FFS enrollees are indistinguishable in terms of the occurrence of potentially preventable ED use. Policymakers should consider this finding when evaluating the pros and cons of adopting Medicaid managed care."

Assessing and forecasting the security status of HATCs in various situations related to tourist destinations is an important strategy of security management. Thus, this study constructed a system dynamic flow diagram for the security evaluation of HATCs. The relevant data were collected on perceptions of crowded tourists through questionnaires at Tianyou Peak during China's National Day (Golden Week Holiday). Additionally, efforts were made to conduct online surveys at Shanghai Disney Park and Shilin Night Market in Taipei, since crowding always occurs in these two areas. Empirical results based on Vensim software suggest that HATC status is the result of the coupling of various influencing factors and the result of the benign coupling of the three subsystems: multi-source pressure, state variation, and management response. HATC security presents a changing trend of increase-decrease-recovery. Differences exist in the changes of HATC security status in different spaces and at different time nodes. The findings also indicated that HATCs that appear in the daytime are more stable than HATCs that appear at special time nodes. This study highlighted that the security management of HATCs should focus on systematization, differentiation, and precision management."

When punishment is available, we find evidence that SR subjects contribute more than WR subjects, respond more to the availability of punishment than do WR subjects, and that the availability of punishment significantly increases the contributions of SR but not WR subjects. Yet SR subjects do not punish others more or less than WR subjects. Our main findings are robust when considering compliance and sample selection. However, some findings are not robust to an alternative but less objective sleep control measure that is based partly on participants’ self-identified optimal sleep levels."

Elderly patients (≥ 80 years of age) surviving an episode of critical illness suffer long-term morbidity and risk of mortality. Identifying high risk groups could assist in informing discussions with patients and families.
Aim
To determine factors associated with long-term survival following ICU admission.
Design
A cohort study of patients aged ≥ 80 years of age admitted to the ICU as an emergency.
Methods
Patients admitted from January 2010 to December 2018 were included in the study. Primary outcome was five year survival. Mortality was assessed using a multivariable flexible parametric survival analysis adjusted for demographics, and clinically relevant covariates.

Results
There were 828 patients. Mean age was 84 years (SD 3.2) and 419 (51%) were male. Patients were categorised into medical (423 (51%)) and surgical (405 (49%)) admissions. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for mortality were highest for serum lactate (>8 mmol/l aHR 2.56 (C.I. 1.79–3.67)), lowest systolic blood pressure ( 8 mmol/l respectively). Relative survival for medical patients was below that expected for the general population for the duration of the study.
Conclusion
Overall five-year survival was 27%. For medical and surgical patients it was 19% and 35% respectively. Survival at 30 days and one year was 61% and 46%. The presence of features of circulatory shock predicted poor short and long term survival."
