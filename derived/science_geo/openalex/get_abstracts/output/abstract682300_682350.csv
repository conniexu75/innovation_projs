https://openalex.org/W3205778292,"The COVID-19 pandemic raises concerns about the mental health of the world population. Protection measures to prevention the disease impacted education and undergraduate students were exposed to additional stressors.Analyze depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in undergraduates, their respective predictors and the association with satisfaction with life, psychological well-being and coping strategies.An online cross-sectional study was conducted from September 14 to October 19, 2020, involving undergraduate students enrolled in 33 courses from 5 public university campuses in the state of Parana, Brazil, using: questionnaire with sociodemographic, academic, health and pandemic effects variables; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21); Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS); Psychological Well-Being (PWB); BriefCOPE. The convenience sample was composed of 1,224 participants, with 18 years old or older, that completed all research instruments. Spearman correlation and logistic analysis (univariate and multivariate) were applied to the collected data.Most of the undergraduates presented symptoms of depression (60.5%), anxiety (52.5%) and stress (57.5%). Depression, anxiety and stress presented significant correlations in common: negative with satisfaction with life, all dimensions of psychological well-being, and 3 adaptive copings (active coping, planning, positive reframing); positive with 5 maladaptive copings (behavioral disengagement, denial, self-blame, self-distraction, substance use). In addition, there were 7 common predictors for symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress: female; age 18-24 years old; having a chronic disease; lower scores in 2 dimensions of psychological well-being (positive relations with others, self-acceptance); higher scores in 2 maladaptive copings (self-blame, substance use).The data indicate a high prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and suggest that higher scores of satisfaction with life, psychological well-being dimensions and adaptive copings may present protective effects in undergraduates during a pandemic crisis."
https://openalex.org/W3206502406,"Background Previous studies have shown that a high body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for severe COVID-19. The aim of the present study was to assess whether a high BMI affects the risk of death or prolonged length of stay (LOS) in patients with COVID-19 during intensive care in Sweden. Methods and findings In this observational, register-based study, we included patients with COVID-19 from the Swedish Intensive Care Registry admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in Sweden. Outcomes assessed were death during intensive care and ICU LOS ≥14 days. We used logistic regression models to evaluate the association (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI]) between BMI and the outcomes. Valid weight and height information could be retrieved in 1,649 patients (1,227 (74.4%) males) with COVID-19. We found a significant association between BMI and the risk of the composite outcome death or LOS ≥14 days in survivors (OR per standard deviation [SD] increase 1.30, 95%CI 1.16–1.44, adjusted for sex, age and comorbidities), and this association remained after further adjustment for severity of illness (simplified acute physiology score; SAPS3) at ICU admission (OR 1.30 per SD, 95%CI 1.17–1.45). Individuals with a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 had a doubled risk of the composite outcome. A high BMI was also associated with death during intensive care and a prolonged LOS in survivors assessed as separate outcomes. The main limitations were the restriction to the first wave of the pandemic, and the lack of information on socioeconomic status as well as smoking. Conclusions In this large cohort of Swedish ICU patients with COVID-19, a high BMI was associated with increasing risk of death and prolonged length of stay in the ICU. Based on our findings, we suggest that individuals with obesity should be more closely monitored when hospitalized for COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3205857559,"The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated physical distancing which is expected to continue in some form for the foreseeable future. Physical distancing policies have increased reliance on digital forms of social connection and there are widespread concerns about social isolation and mental health in this context. This qualitative study sought to understand how loneliness was experienced during physical distancing in the initial national UK COVID-19 lockdown. Eight individuals who reported feeling lonely during the initial lockdown were interviewed in May 2020. Interviews were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Four main themes were identified: (1) Loss of in-person interaction causing loneliness, (2) Constrained freedom, (3) Challenging emotions, and (4) Coping with loneliness. The loss of in-person interaction contributed to feelings of loneliness and digital interaction was viewed as an insufficient alternative. Social freedom could be constrained by distancing policies and by social contacts, contributing to strained personal relationships and feelings of frustration as part of loneliness. Fluctuations in mood and difficult emotions were experienced alongside loneliness, and distraction and seeking reconnection were commonly reported methods of coping, although they were less accessible. These findings indicate that physical distancing measures can impact loneliness due to the limitations they impose on in-person social contact and the perceived insufficiency of digital contact as a substitute."
https://openalex.org/W3206810096,"People often seek out information as a means of coping with challenging situations. Attuning to negative information can be adaptive because it alerts people to the risks in their environment, thereby preparing them for similar threats in the future. But is this behaviour adaptive during a pandemic when bad news is ubiquitous? We examine the emotional consequences of exposure to brief snippets of COVID-related news via a Twitter feed (Study 1), or a YouTube reaction video (Study 2). Compared to a no-information exposure group, consumption of just 2–4 minutes of COVID-related news led to immediate and significant reductions in positive affect (Studies 1 and 2) and optimism (Study 2). Exposure to COVID-related kind acts did not have the same negative consequences, suggesting that not all social media exposure is detrimental for well-being. We discuss strategies to counteract the negative emotional consequences of exposure to negative news on social media."

Using the monthly trade data of 68 countries exporting across 222 destinations between January 2019 and October 2020, our results are threefold. First, we find a greater negative impact of COVID-19 on bilateral trade for those countries that were members of regional trade agreements before the pandemic. Second, we find that the impact of COVID-19 is negative and significant when we consider indicators related to governmental actions. Finally, this negative effect is more intense when exporter and importer country share identical income levels. In the latter case, the highest negative impact is found for exports between high-income countries."
https://openalex.org/W3207432016,"Single-sided deafness (SSD) leads to difficulties with speech perception in noise, sound localisation, and sometimes tinnitus. Current treatments (Contralateral Routing of Sound hearing aids (CROS) and Bone Conduction Devices (BCD)) do not sufficiently overcome these problems. Cochlear implants (CIs) may help. Our aim was to evaluate these treatments in a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT). Adult SSD patients were randomised using a web-based randomisation tool into one of three groups: CI; trial period of 'first BCD, then CROS'; trial period of 'first CROS, then BCD'. After these trial periods, patients opted for BCD, CROS, or No treatment. The primary outcome was speech perception in noise (directed from the front (S0N0)). Secondary outcomes were speech perception in noise with speech directed to the poor ear and noise to the better ear (SpeNbe) and vice versa (SbeNpe), sound localisation, tinnitus burden, and disease-specific quality of life (QoL). We described results at baseline (unaided situation) and 3 and 6 months after device activation. 120 patients were randomised. Seven patients did not receive the allocated intervention. The number of patients per group after allocation was: CI (n = 28), BCD (n = 25), CROS (n = 34), and No treatment (n = 26). In S0N0, the CI group performed significantly better when compared to baseline, and when compared to the other groups. In SpeNbe, there was an advantage for all treatment groups compared to baseline. However, in SbeNpe, BCD and CROS groups performed worse compared to baseline, whereas the CI group improved. Only in the CI group sound localisation improved and tinnitus burden decreased. In general, all treatment groups improved on disease-specific QoL compared to baseline. This RCT demonstrates that cochlear implantation for SSD leads to improved speech perception in noise, sound localisation, tinnitus burden, and QoL after 3 and 6 months of follow-up. For most outcome measures, CI outperformed BCD and CROS. Trial registration: Netherlands Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl): NTR4580, CINGLE-trial."
https://openalex.org/W3207777049,"Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) quickly surged the whole world and affected people’s physical, mental, and social health thereby upsetting their quality of life. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the quality of life (QoL) of COVID-19 positive patients after recovery in Bangladesh. This was a study of adult (aged ≥18 years) COVID-19 individuals from eight divisions of Bangladesh diagnosed and confirmed by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) from June 2020 to November 2020. Given a response rate of 60% in a pilot study, a random list of 6400 COVID-19 patients was generated to recruit approximately 3200 patients from eight divisions of Bangladesh and finally a total of 3244 participants could be recruited for the current study. The validated Bangla version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to assess the QoL. Data were analyzed by STATA (Version 16.1) and R (Version 4.0.0). All the procedures were conducted following ethical approval and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The mean scores of QoL were highest for the physical domain (68.25±14.45) followed by social (65.10±15.78), psychological (63.28±15.48), and environmental domain (62.77±13.07). Psychological and physical domain scores among females were significantly lower than the males ( p&lt; 0.001). The overall quality of life was lower in persons having a chronic disease. Participants over 45 years of age were 52% less likely to enjoy good physical health than the participants aged below 26 years (AOR: 0.48, CI: 0.28–0.82). The quality of life of employed participants was found 1.8 times higher than the unemployed (AOR: 1.80, CI: 1.11–2.91). Those who were admitted to hospitals during infection had a low QoL score in physical, psychological, and socials domains. However, QoL improved in all aspect except the psychological domain for each day passed after the diagnosis. These findings call for a focus on the quality of life of the COVID-19 affected population, with special emphasis given to females, older adults, unemployed, and people with comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3206332274,"We aim to estimate the total factor productivity and analyze factors related to the Chinese government's health care expenditure in each of its provinces after its implementation of new health care reform in the period after 2009.We use the Malmquist DEA model to measure efficiency and apply the Tobit regression to explore factors that influence the efficiency of government health care expenditure. Data are taken from the China statistics yearbook (2004-2020).We find that the average TFP of China's 31 provincial health care expenditure was lower than 1 in the period 2009-2019. We note that the average TFP was much higher after new health care reform was implemented, and note this in the eastern, central and western regions. But per capita GDP, population density and new health care reform implementation are found to have a statistically significant impact on the technical efficiency of the provincial government's health care expenditure (P<0.05); meanwhile, region, education, urbanization and per capita provincial government health care expenditure are not found to have a statistically significant impact.Although the implementation of the new medical reform has improved the efficiency of the government's health expenditure, it is remains low in 31 provinces in China. In addition, the government should consider per capita GDP, population density and other factors when coordinating the allocation of health care input.This study systematically analyzes the efficiency and influencing factors of the Chinese government's health expenditure after it introduced new health care reforms. The results show that China's new medical reform will help to improve the government's health expenditure. The Chinese government can continue to adhere to the new medical reform policy, and should pay attention to demographic and economic factors when implementing the policy."
https://openalex.org/W3206141413,"The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors among the Korean population requires effective health surveillance and examination of the effects of preventative behaviors. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the relationships between the clustering of MetS and MVPA in a large sample of 36,987 Koreans ranging from 20 to 80 years of age. This study recruited a total of 36,987 adults (23,813 males and 13,174 females). All participants were assessed for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) using the Korean version short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The International Diabetes Federation and the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for blood pressure, hyperglycemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and high triglycerides (TG) defined MetS. Waist circumference (WC) was determined by Asian-Pacific region populations. According to the 150-minute MVPA, there were differences in MetS risk factors in young adult males, and only three factors (WC, HDL-C, and TG) were different males in ≥ 70 years old. In females, there was a difference in MetS risk factors in the elderly, and only three factors (WC, blood pressure, and TG) were different females in ≤ 29 years old. The males who did not met the recommended MVPA had a 1.16 to 3.14 -times increase in the MetS risk factors. The females who did not met the recommended MVPA had a 1.18 to 2.57 -times increase in the MetS risk factors. Our study provides evidence that Korean adults who do not engage in recommended MVPA levels increase the odds ratio for each of the MetS risk factors when compared to those who meet the recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W3205655307,"Paralympic Powerlifting is a sport in which the strength of the upper limbs is assessed through bench press performance in an adapted specific bench. It is therefore essential to optimize training methods to maximize this performance. The aim of the present study was to compare force production and muscle activation involved in partial vs. full range of motion (ROM) training in Paralympic Powerlifting. Twelve male athletes of elite national level in Paralympic Powerlifting participated in the study (28.60 ± 7.60 years of age, 71.80 ± 17.90 kg of body mass). The athletes performed five sets of 5RM (repetition maximum), either with 90% of 1RM in full ROM or with a load of 130% 1RM in partial ROM. All subjects underwent both exercise conditions in consecutive weeks. Order assignment in the first week was random and counterbalanced. Fatigue index (FI), Maximum Isometric Force (MIF), Time to MIF (Time) and rate of force development (RFD) were determined by a force sensor. Muscle thickness was obtained using ultrasound images. All measures were taken pre- and post-training. Additionally, electromyographic signal (EMG) was evaluated in the last set of each exercise condition. Post-exercise fatigue was higher with full ROM as well as loss of MIF. Full ROM also induced greater. EMG showed greater activation of the Clavicular portion and Sternal portion of pectoralis major muscle and lower in the anterior portion of deltoid muscle when full ROM was performed. Muscle thickness of the pectoralis major muscle increased post-exercise. We concluded that training with partial ROM enables higher workloads with lower loss of muscle function."
https://openalex.org/W3207118424,"Automatic facial recognition technology (AFR) is increasingly used in criminal justice systems around the world, yet to date there has not been an international survey of public attitudes toward its use. In Study 1, we ran focus groups in the UK, Australia and China (countries at different stages of adopting AFR) and in Study 2 we collected data from over 3,000 participants in the UK, Australia and the USA using a questionnaire investigating attitudes towards AFR use in criminal justice systems. Our results showed that although overall participants were aligned in their attitudes and reasoning behind them, there were some key differences across countries. People in the USA were more accepting of tracking citizens, more accepting of private companies' use of AFR, and less trusting of the police using AFR than people in the UK and Australia. Our results showed that support for the use of AFR depends greatly on what the technology is used for and who it is used by. We recommend vendors and users do more to explain AFR use, including details around accuracy and data protection. We also recommend that governments should set legal boundaries around the use of AFR in investigative and criminal justice settings."

Further, understanding the complete lifestyle behaviors profile can help healthcare providers in designing effective interventions and assessing overall health impact on risk of disease development. Thus, this study aims to assess the complete spectrum of lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep, distress, social support, dietary habits, and smoking) prevalence and its association with fear of COVID-19 in people living in Saudi Arabia.Self-administered survey consisted of seven sections was used to collect data on fear of COVID-19 using Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), physical activity and sedentary behavior using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), psychosocial distress using Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), social support using the MOS social support survey, and dietary habits using a short version of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The online survey was distributed via social media platforms during lockdown period of COVID-19 pandemic (May-June 2020). Each section consisted of validated questionnaire examining one of aforementioned lifestyle behaviors. Associations were analyzed using multiple linear regression.A total of 669 individuals attempted to complete the online survey, 554 participants completed at least 2 sections of the survey (82.8%), and 41.3% (n = 276) completed the whole online survey. The majority of the sample were female (83%), not smokers (86.5%), had sufficient sleep duration (7.5 hrs ± 2.1), and only indicated mild level of distress (21.4 ± 8.9); they also reported high level of sedentary behavior (7.7 hrs ± 4.5), poor sleep quality (5.4 ± 2.4), were not engaged in healthy eating habits, and moderate level of perceived social support (62.0% ± 27). Only physical activity results indicated that about half of the sample were engaged in moderate to vigorous level of physical activity (54.3%). Further, being female (β = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.45, 2.94) and married (β = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.3, 2.63) were associated with fear of COVID-19 level (β = 0.21; 95% IC: 0.05, 0.19) with a confidence interval level of 95%. In addition, distress was associated with fear.The trend of lifestyle behaviors measured during lockdown period changed from previously published rates. Future research needs to establish the short-term and long-term effect of lifestyle behaviors complete profile on physical and mental health."

In this study we have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of novel TrueNat molecular assay for detecting SARS CoV-2. TrueNat is a chip-based real time PCR test and works on portable, light weight, battery powered equipment and can be used in remote areas with poor infrastructure. In this study 1807 patients samples were collected for both TrueNat and RTPCR COVID-19 testing during study period. Of these 174 (9.7%) and 174 (15%) were positive by RTPCR and TrueNat respectively and taking results of RTPCR as gold standard TrueNat test showed a sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 69.5, 90.9% and 89.2% respectively. It can be concluded that TrueNat is a simple, easy to use, good rapid molecular diagnostic test for diagnosis of COVID-19 especially in resource limited settings and will prove to be a game changer of molecular diagnostics in future."
https://openalex.org/W3207433446,"As of April 5, 2021, as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, new federal rules in the U.S. mandate that providers offer patients access to their online clinical records.To solicit the view of an international panel of experts on the effects on mental health patients, including possible benefits and harms, of accessing their clinical notes.An online 3-round Delphi poll.Online.International experts identified as clinicians, chief medical information officers, patient advocates, and informaticians with extensive experience and/or research knowledge about patient access to mental health notes.An expert-generated consensus on the benefits and risks of sharing mental health notes with patients.A total of 70 of 92 (76%) experts from 6 countries responded to Round 1. A qualitative review of responses yielded 88 distinct items: 42 potential benefits, and 48 potential harms. A total of 56 of 70 (80%) experts responded to Round 2, and 52 of 56 (93%) responded to Round 3. Consensus was reached on 65 of 88 (74%) of survey items. There was consensus that offering online access to mental health notes could enhance patients' understanding about their diagnosis, care plan, and rationale for treatments, and that access could enhance patient recall and sense of empowerment. Experts also agreed that blocking mental health notes could lead to greater harms including increased feelings of stigmatization. However, panelists predicted there could be an increase in patients demanding changes to their clinical notes, and that mental health clinicians would be less detailed/accurate in documentation.This iterative process of survey responses and ratings yielded consensus that there would be multiple benefits and few harms to patients from accessing their mental health notes. Questions remain about the impact of open notes on professional autonomy, and further empirical work into this practice innovation is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3156387425,"Infliximab (IFX) therapy has considerably improved the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, some patients still do not respond adequately to IFX therapy, or the efficacy of the treatment diminishes over time. Although previous studies have reported a relationship between serum IFX levels and therapeutic efficacy, the potential applications of IFX therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in clinical practice remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential applications of IFX TDM by analyzing a Japanese cohort database. Data were collected retrospectively from the Kyoto University Rheumatoid Arthritis Management Alliance cohort between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2018. Serum IFX levels were measured using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer. Out of the 311 RA patients that used IFX, 41 were eligible for the analysis. Serum IFX levels were significantly higher in responders than in non-responders. An optimal cut-off value was determined to be 0.32 μg/mL based on a receiver operating characteristic curve. At the IFX measurement point, a better therapeutic response was observed in the high IFX group (n = 32) than in the low IFX group (n = 9). Conversely, at the maximum effect point, when DAS28-ESR was the lowest between IFX introduction and measurement points, there were no differences in responder proportions between the low and high IFX groups. IFX primary ineffectiveness could be avoided with appropriate dose escalation without blood concentration measurement in clinical practice. In conclusion, IFX TDM could facilitate the identification of secondary non-responders and in turn, proper IFX use."
https://openalex.org/W3205284425,"Axenically cultured Liberibacter crescens (Lcr) is a closely related surrogate for uncultured plant pathogenic species of the genus Liberibacter, including 'Candidatus L. asiaticus' (CLas) and 'Ca. L. solanacearum' (CLso). All Liberibacters encode a completely conserved gene repertoire for both flagella and Tad (Tight Adherence) pili and all are missing genes critical for nucleotide biosynthesis. Both flagellar swimming and Tad pilus-mediated twitching motility in Lcr were demonstrated for the first time. A role for Tad pili in the uptake of extracellular dsDNA for food in Liberibacters was suspected because both twitching and DNA uptake are impossible without repetitive pilus extension and retraction, and no genes encoding other pilus assemblages or mechanisms for DNA uptake were predicted to be even partially present in any of the 35 fully sequenced Liberibacter genomes. Insertional mutations of the Lcr Tad pilus genes cpaA, cpaB, cpaE, cpaF and tadC all displayed such severely reduced growth and viability that none could be complemented. A mutation affecting cpaF (motor ATPase) was further characterized and the strain displayed concomitant loss of twitching, viability and reduced periplasmic uptake of extracellular dsDNA. Mutations of comEC, encoding the inner membrane competence channel, had no effect on either motility or growth but completely abolished natural transformation in Lcr. The comEC mutation was restored by complementation using comEC from Lcr but not from CLas strain psy62 or CLso strain RS100, indicating that unlike Lcr, these pathogens were not naturally competent for transformation. This report provides the first evidence that the Liberibacter Tad pili are dynamic and essential for both motility and DNA uptake, thus extending their role beyond surface adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3206492238,"This study analysed the business sustainability of remanufacturing waste steel sheet from the shells of end-of-life vehicles into mesh steel sheet for manufacturing sheet-metal products. Hybrid statistical, fuzzy, and overall sustainability-index curve-fitting models were used to analyse the technical, economic, environmental, management, and social feasibility of remanufacturing, where the sales price, eco-cost savings, and CO2 emission reductions were used as typical statistical indicators. The remanufacturing process was optimised to allocate hardware for a plant recovering 480 m2/shift of waste sheet steel and producing 2851-5520 m2/shift of mesh sheet steel. Six scenarios were used to model the sustainability parameters to normalise the sustainability index values. The sustainability index of each parameter was calculated by multiplying its weight of importance by its weight of satisfaction. The highest sustainability index of 0.95 was calculated for the economic feasibility index, while the lowest sustainability index of 0.4 was calculated for the management feasibility. Remanufacturing of waste sheet steel into mesh sheet steel can be applied with an estimated overall sustainability index of 0.88."
https://openalex.org/W3205351608,"Cremation is a complex mortuary practice, involving a number of activities of the living towards the dead before, during, and after the destruction of the bodily soft tissues by fire. The limiting information concerning these behavioral patterns obtained from the pyre remains and/or cremation deposits prevents the reconstruction of the handling of the corpse during the burning process. This pioneering study tries to determine the initial positioning of the corpse in the pyre and assess whether the deceased was wearing closed leather shoes during cremation through isotopic (δ 13 C, δ 18 O) and infrared (ATR-FTIR) analyses of experimentally burnt pig remains, used as a proxy for humans. The results obtained show that both the position of feet on or within the pyre and the presence of footwears may moderately-to-highly influence the oxygen isotope ratios of bone apatite carbonates and the cyanamide content of calcined bone in certain situations. By forming a protective layer, shoes appear to temporarily delay the burning of the underlying pig tissues and to increase the heat-shielding effect of the soft tissues protecting the bone mineral fraction. In such case, bioapatite bone carbonates exchange oxygen with a relatively more 18 O-depleted atmosphere (due to the influence of lignin-derived oxygen rather than cellulose-derived oxygen), resulting in more pronounced decrease in the δ 18 O carb values during burning of the shoed feet vs. unshoed feet. The shift observed here was as high as 2.5‰. A concomitant isotopic effect of the initial location of the feet in the pyres was also observed, resulting in a top-to-bottom decrease difference in the δ 18 O carb values of shoed feet of about 1.4‰ between each deposition level tested. Finally, the presence of cyanamide (CN/P ≥ 0.02) seems to be indicative of closed footwear since the latter creates favorable conditions for its incorporation into bone apatite."
https://openalex.org/W3207497643,"Effective treatment of respiratory infections continues to be a major challenge. In high doses (≥160 ppm), inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) has been shown to act as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, including its efficacy in vitro for coronavirus family. However, the safety of prolonged in vivo implementation of high-dose iNO therapy has not been studied. Herein we aim to explore the feasibility and safety of delivering continuous high-dose iNO over an extended period of time using an in vivo animal model. Yorkshire pigs were randomized to one of the following two groups: group 1, standard ventilation; and group 2, standard ventilation + continuous iNO 160 ppm + methylene blue (MB) as intravenous bolus, whenever required, to maintain metHb &lt;6%. Both groups were ventilated continuously for 6 hours, then the animals were weaned from sedation, mechanical ventilation and followed for 3 days. During treatment, and on the third post-operative day, physiologic assessments were performed to monitor lung function and other significative markers were assessed for potential pulmonary or systemic injury. No significant change in lung function, or inflammatory markers were observed during the study period. Both gas exchange function, lung tissue cytokine analysis and histology were similar between treated and control animals. During treatment, levels of metHb were maintained &lt;6% by administration of MB, and NO 2 remained &lt;5 ppm. Additionally, considering extrapulmonary effects, no significant changes were observed in biochemistry markers. Our findings showed that high-dose iNO delivered continuously over 6 hours with adjuvant MB is clinically feasible and safe. These findings support the development of investigations of continuous high-dose iNO treatment of respiratory tract infections, including SARS-CoV-2."

However, no algorithm for Crohn's disease (CD) has yet been validated. In this study we aim to develop an algorithm for identifying CD using the claims data of the insurance system.A single-center retrospective study to develop a CD extraction algorithm from insurance claims data was conducted. Patients visiting the Kitasato University Kitasato Institute Hospital between January 2015-February 2019 were enrolled, and data were extracted according to inclusion criteria combining the Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) diagnosis codes with or without prescription or surgical codes. Hundred cases that met each inclusion criterion were randomly sampled and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated according to the diagnosis in the medical chart. Of all cases, 20% were reviewed in duplicate, and the inter-observer agreement (Kappa) was also calculated.From the 82,898 enrolled, 255 cases were extracted by diagnosis code alone, 197 by the combination of diagnosis and prescription codes, and 197 by the combination of diagnosis codes and prescription or surgical codes. The PPV for confirmed CD cases was 83% by diagnosis codes alone, but improved to 97% by combining with prescription codes. The inter-observer agreement was 0.9903.Single ICD-code alone was insufficient to define CD; however, the algorithm that combined diagnosis codes with prescription codes indicated a sufficiently high PPV and will enable outcome-based research on CD using the Japanese claims database."
https://openalex.org/W3207163980,"Point process generalized linear models (GLMs) provide a powerful tool for characterizing the coding properties of neural populations. Spline basis functions are often used in point process GLMs, when the relationship between the spiking and driving signals are nonlinear, but common choices for the structure of these spline bases often lead to loss of statistical power and numerical instability when the signals that influence spiking are bounded above or below. In particular, history dependent spike train models often suffer these issues at times immediately following a previous spike. This can make inferences related to refractoriness and bursting activity more challenging. Here, we propose a modified set of spline basis functions that assumes a flat derivative at the endpoints and show that this limits the uncertainty and numerical issues associated with cardinal splines. We illustrate the application of this modified basis to the problem of simultaneously estimating the place field and history dependent properties of a set of neurons from the CA1 region of rat hippocampus, and compare it with the other commonly used basis functions. We have made code available in MATLAB to implement spike train regression using these modified basis functions."

We estimated the changes in cigarette price, cigarette use, and non-cigarette use following the implementation of Proposition 56 in California in 2017.Seven waves of Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) 2011-2019 data were used to obtain state-level aggregate self-reported outcomes, including cigarette price per pack, current and daily cigarette use, cigarette consumption per day, and current and daily use of non-cigarette tobacco products (hookah, pipe, cigar, and smokeless tobacco). A modified version of a synthetic control method was used to create a ""synthetic"" California that best resembled pre-policy sociodemographic characteristics and outcome trends in California while correcting time-invariant pre-policy differences. Various sensitivity analyses were also conducted.The implementation of Proposition 56 was associated with an increase in self-reported cigarette price per pack in California ($1.844, 95%CI: $0.153, $3.534; p = 0.032). No evidence suggested that Proposition 56 was associated with the changes in the prevalence of current or daily cigarette use, cigarette consumption per day, or the prevalence of current or daily use of non-cigarette tobacco products.Most of the cigarette tax increase following Proposition 56 in California was passed on to consumers. There is a lack of evidence that the implementation of Proposition 56 was associated with the changes in the use of cigarettes and other tobacco products such as hookah, pipe, cigar, and smokeless tobacco."

The example covers 31 nations in the Asia-Pacific district during the time frame 2000 to 2018. The spatial connection in the model was affirmed by symptomatic testing, and the spatial Durbin model was picked as the last model. Results show that Gross domestic product per capita, receptiveness to business sectors, unfamiliar direct venture, energy force, and urbanization critically affect CO2 emanations. In correlation, just wind and sunlight-based energy have added to a generous abatement in ozone harming substance emanations in nations over the long run. In contrast, hydropower, bioenergy, and geothermal energy discoveries have been irrelevant. A cross-sectional examination worldview delineated that nations with more elevated sunlight-based energy yield have higher CO2 outflows, while nations with lower levels have lower CO2 emanations. The presence of spatial impacts in the model gave off an impression of the negative consequences for homegrown CO2 outflows of Gross domestic product per capita and exchange transparency of adjoining nations. Furthermore, energy power and higher creation of sustainable power in adjoining nations will prompt lower homegrown CO2 outflows."
https://openalex.org/W3207820135,"Russeting compromises appearance and downgrades the market value of many fruitcrops, including of the mango cv. 'Apple'. The objective was to identify the mechanistic basis of 'Apple' mango's high susceptibility to russeting. We focused on fruit growth, cuticle deposition, stress/strain relaxation analysis and the mechanical properties of the cuticle. The non-susceptible mango cv. 'Tommy Atkins' served for comparison. Compared with 'Tommy Atkins', fruit of 'Apple' had a lower mass, a smaller surface area and a lower growth rate. There were little differences between the epidermal and hypodermal cells of 'Apple' and 'Tommy Atkins' including cell size, cell orientation and cell number. Lenticel density decreased during development, being lower in 'Apple' than in 'Tommy Atkins'. The mean lenticel area increased during development but was consistently greater in 'Apple' than in 'Tommy Atkins'. The deposition rate of the cuticular membrane was initially rapid but later slowed till it matched the area expansion rate, thereafter mass per unit area was effectively constant. The cuticle of 'Apple' is thinner than that of 'Tommy Atkins'. Cumulative strain increased sigmoidally with fruit growth. Strains released stepwise on excision and isolation (εexc+iso), and on wax extraction (εextr) were higher in 'Apple' than in 'Tommy Atkins'. Membrane stiffness increased during development being consistently lower in 'Apple' than in 'Tommy Atkins'. Membrane fracture force (Fmax) was low and constant in developing 'Apple' but increased in 'Tommy Atkin'. Membrane strain at fracture (εmax) decreased linearly during development but was lower in 'Apple' than in 'Tommy Atkins'. Frequency of membrane failure associated with lenticels increased during development and was consistently higher in 'Apple' than in 'Tommy Atkins'. The lower rate of cuticular deposition, the higher strain releases on excision, isolation and wax extraction and the weaker cuticle account for the high russet susceptibility of 'Apple' mango."

This study aims to contribute to the knowledge of the diversity of Russula species classified in subsection Roseinae based on specimens recently collected in tropical montane rainforests in western Panama. A five gene multilocus phylogeny based on the nuclear markers ITS nrDNA, MCM7, RPB1, RPB2 and TEF-1α was constructed to identify the systematic position of 22 collections from Panama. Four new species, Russula cornicolor, Russula cynorhodon, Russula oreomunneae and Russula zephyrovelutipes are formally described and illustrated. None of the four species are sister species and they are more closely related to North American or Asian species. Two of the newly described species were associated with the ectomycorrhizal tree species Oreomunnea mexicana, while the other two species were associated with Quercus species. All four species are so far only known from mountains in western Panama."
https://openalex.org/W3206279779,"Communication of science through online media has become a primary means of disseminating and connecting science with a public audience. However, online media can come in many forms and stories of scientific discovery can be told by many individuals. We tested whether the relationship of a spokesperson to the science story being told (i.e., the narrative perspective) influences how people react and respond to online science media. We created five video stimuli that fell into three treatments: a scientist presenting their own research (male or female), a third-party summarizing research (male or female), and an infographic-like video with no on-screen presenter. Each of these videos presented the same fabricated science story about the discovery of a new ant species (Formicidae). We used Qualtrics to administer and obtain survey responses from 515 participants (~100 per video). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the videos and after viewing the stimulus answered questions assessing their perceptions of the video (trustworthiness and enjoyment), the spokesperson (trustworthiness and competence), scientists in general (competence and warmth), and attitudes towards the research topic and funding. Participants were also asked to recall what they had seen and heard. We determined that when participants watched a video in which a scientist presented their own research, participants perceived the spokesperson as having more expertise than a third-party presenter, and as more trustworthy and having more expertise than the no-spokesperson stimuli. Viewing a scientist presenting their own work also humanized the research, with participants more often including a person in their answer to the recall question. Overall, manipulating the narrative perspective of the source of a single online video communication effort is effective at impacting immediate objective outcomes related to spokesperson perceptions, but whether those objectives can positively influence long-term goals requires more investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3206502360,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of serious illness and death in children, indicating the need to monitor prevalent strains, particularly in the vulnerable pediatric population. Nasal carriage of S. aureus is important as carriers have an increased risk of serious illness due to systemic invasion by this pathogen and can transmit the infection. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of azithromycin in reducing the prevalence of nasopharyngeal carrying of pneumococci, which are often implicated in respiratory infections in children. However, very few studies of the impact of azithromycin on staphylococci have been undertaken. During a clinical trial under taken in 2016, nasal swabs were collected from 778 children aged 3 to 59 months including 385 children who were swabbed before administration of azithromycin or placebo and 393 after administration of azithromycin or placebo. Azithromycin was given in a dose of 100 mg for three days, together with the antimalarials sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine, on four occasions at monthly intervals during the malaria transmission season. These samples were cultured for S. aureus as well as for the pneumococcus. The S. aureus isolates were tested for their susceptibility to azithromycin (15 g), penicillin (10 IU), and cefoxitine (30 g) (Oxoid Ltd). S. aureus was isolated from 13.77% (53/385) swabs before administration of azithromycin and from 20.10% (79/393) six months after administration (PR = 1.46 [1.06; 2.01], p = 0.020). Azithromycin resistance found in isolates of S. aureus did not differ significantly before and after intervention (26.42% [14/53] vs 16.46% [13/79], (PR = 0.62 [0.32; 1.23], p = 0.172). Penicillin resistance was very pronounced, 88.68% and 96.20% in pre-intervention and in post-intervention isolates respectively, but very little Methicillin Resistance (MRSA) was detected (2 cases before and 2 cases after intervention). Monitoring antibiotic resistance in S. aureus and other bacteria is especially important in Burkina Faso due to unregulated consumption of antibiotics putting children and others at risk."
https://openalex.org/W3207154300,"We described, for the first time, a case of predation of a non-arthropod species by a dung beetle species. Canthon chalybaeus Blanchard, 1843 kills healthy individuals of the terrestrial snail Bulimulus apodemetes (D'Orbigny, 1835) showing an evident pattern of physical aggressiveness in the attacks using the dentate clypeus and the anterior tibiae. The description of this predatory behaviour was complemented with the analysis of the chemical secretions of the pygidial glands of C. chalybaeus, highlighting those main chemical compounds that, due to their potential toxicity, could contribute to death of the snail. We observed a high frequency of predatory interactions reinforcing the idea that predation in dung beetles is not accidental and although it is opportunistic it involves a series of behavioural sophistications that suggest an evolutionary pattern within Deltochilini that should not only be better studied from a behavioural point of view but also phylogenetically."
https://openalex.org/W3207789152,"We investigated the associations between hearing aids (HA) and the maintenance of cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults with moderate hearing loss. A total of 407 participants aged 60 years or older with moderate hearing loss were recruited from the National Institute for Longevity Sciences, Longitudinal Study for Aging (NILS-LSA). Moderate hearing loss was defined as a pure-tone average of 40-69 dB at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz of the better ear, according to the definition proposed by the Japan Audiological Society. Cognitive function was evaluated using the four subtests of the Japanese version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Short Forms (WAIS-R-SF): Information, Similarities, Picture completion, and Digit Symbol Substitution (DSST). A longitudinal analysis of 1192 observations with a mean follow-up period of 4.5 ± 3.9 years was performed. The HA use rate at any time during the follow-up period was 31.4%, and HA users were significantly younger (t-test, p = 0.001), had worse hearing (p < .0001) and higher education (p = 0.001), participated more frequently in the survey (p < .0001), and were less depressed (χ2 test, p = 0.003) than the older adults not using HA. General linear mixed models consisted of the fixed effects of HA use, follow-up time, and an HA use × time interaction term adjusted for age and pure-tone average thresholds at baseline, sex, education, and other possible confounders. HA use showed significant main effects on the scores for Picture completion and DSST after adjustment; scores were better in the HA use group than in the no HA use group. The HA use × time interaction was significant for the Information score (p = 0.040). The model-predicted 12-year slope with centralizing age indicated that the no HA use group showed greater decline over time on Information scores than did HA use group. The slopes did not differ between HA users and non-users for the Similarities, Picture completion and DSST. In conclusion, HA use may have a protective effect on the decline in general knowledge in older adults with moderate hearing loss."
https://openalex.org/W3205064638,"It is widely recognized that individuals' health and educational attainments, commonly referred to as their human capital, are important determinants for their labour market participation (LMP). What is less recognised is the influence of individuals' latent resilience traits on their ability to sustain LMP after experiencing an adversity such as a health shock.We investigate the extent to which resilience is independently associated with LMP and moderates the effect of health shocks on LMP.We analysed data from two consecutive waves of a Norwegian prospective cohort study. We followed 3,840 adults who, at baseline, were healthy and worked full time. Binary logistic regression models were applied to explain their employment status eight years later, controlling for age, sex, educational attainment, health status at baseline, as well as the occurrences of three types of health shocks (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, psychological problems). Individuals' resilience, measured by the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), entered as an independent variable and as an interaction with the indicators of health shocks. In separate models, we explore the role of two further indicators of resilience; locus of control, and health optimism.As expected, health shocks reduce the probability to keep on working full-time. While both the RSA and the two related indicators all suggest that resilience increases the probability to keep on working, we did not find evidence that resilience moderates the association between health shocks and LMP.Higher levels of resilience is associated with full-time work as individuals age."
https://openalex.org/W3206307609,"Mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP) is a membrane-associated heterotetramer that catalyzes three of the four reactions needed to chain-shorten long-chain fatty acids inside the mitochondria. TFP is known to be heavily modified by acetyllysine and succinyllysine post-translational modifications (PTMs), many of which are targeted for reversal by the mitochondrial sirtuin deacylases SIRT3 and SIRT5. However, the functional significance of these PTMs is not clear, with some reports showing TFP gain-of-function and some showing loss-of-function upon increased acylation. Here, we mapped the known SIRT3/SIRT5-targeted lysine residues onto the recently solved TFP crystal structure which revealed that many of the target sites are involved in substrate channeling within the TFPα subunit. To test the effects of acylation on substate channeling through TFPα, we enzymatically synthesized the physiological long-chain substrate (2E)-hexadecenoyl-CoA. Assaying TFP in SIRT3 and SIRT5 knockout mouse liver and heart mitochondria with (2E)-hexadecenoyl-CoA revealed no change in enzyme activity. Finally, we investigated the effects of lysine acylation on TFP membrane binding in vitro. Acylation did not alter recombinant TFP binding to cardiolipin-containing liposomes. However, the presence of liposomes strongly abrogated the acylation reaction between succinyl-CoA and TFP lysine residues. Thus, TFP in the membrane-bound state may be protected against lysine acylation."
https://openalex.org/W3206326490,"Scuttle flies (Diptera: Phoridae) are mega-diverse and often synanthropic insects that play superb roles in various ecosystems. Identification of this group of insects is challenging due to their small size, morphological identification difficulties, niche diversity, and lack of taxonomic keys. To pave the way, an in-depth investigation was directed toward the scuttle flies in Iran using morphological and molecular data. A dichotomous key was also developed to identify the genus and species of the phorids reported in the country. The faunistic findings revealed the presence of about 22,000 (13,903 male and 8,097 female) phorid materials organized into 11 genera. Megaselia species (n = 13768), made up about 99% of the specimens studied. Moreover, 71 morphologically defined species belonging to nine genera were molecularly characterized using COI, 28S rRNA, and Arginine kinase datasets. Excluding four Megaselia Rondani, 1856 species, our results specified that morphologically delimited species were in agreement with the molecular analyses inferred from the COI/28S rRNA and COI/Arginine kinase sequences with genetic distances and phylogenetic trees. According to the results of the present study and previously published data, the Phoridae recorded for Iran are a total of 97 species that are ordered in 13 genera and three subfamilies, including Chonocephalinae, Metopininae and Phorinae. By comparing the known world phorid genera, a new monotypic genus of scuttle flies, Mahabadphora aesthesphora gen. nov., sp. nov., was identified based on its morphological and molecular characteristics and included in an updated key. Our results could comprehensively determine the taxonomic status of scuttle flies in Iran, scrutinize their phylogenetic structures and facilitate their identification."
https://openalex.org/W3206559807,"The steady, world-wide increase in myopia prevalence in children over the past decades has raised concerns. As an early intervention for axial-length-related myopia, correcting lenses have been developed (such as Defocus Incorporated Multiple Segment (DIMS) lenses), which have been shown to be effective in slowing myopia progression. Beyond this direct effect, however, it is not known whether such lenses also affect other aspects important to the wearer, such as eye fatigue, and how such effects may differ across age, as these lenses so far are typically only tested with adolescents. In the present work, we therefore investigated perceived fatigue levels according to lens type (normal vs DIMS) and age (adolescents vs adults) in a demanding visual search task (""Finding Wally"") at two difficulty levels (easy vs difficult). Whereas age and difficulty did not result in significant differences in eye fatigue, we found a clear reduction of fatigue levels in both age groups when wearing the correcting lenses. Hence, the additional accommodation of these lens types may result in less strain in a task requiring sustained eye movements at near viewing distances."
https://openalex.org/W3207322855,"Despite increasing concern regarding broad-scale declines in insects, there are few published long-term, systematic butterfly surveys in North America, and fewer still that have incorporated the influence of changing climate and landscape variables. In this study, we analyzed 20 years of citizen science data at seven consistently monitored protected areas in Illinois, U.S.A. We used mixed models and PERMANOVA to evaluate trends in butterfly abundance, richness, and composition while also evaluating the effects of temperature and land use. Overall butterfly richness, but not abundance, increased in warmer years. Surprisingly, richness also was positively related to percent impervious surface (at the 2 km radius scale), highlighting the conservation value of protected areas in urban landscapes (or alternately, the potential negative aspects of agriculture). Precipitation had a significant and variable influence through time on overall butterfly abundance and abundance of resident species, larval host plant specialists, and univoltine species. Importantly, models incorporating the influence of changing temperature, precipitation, and impervious surface indicated a significant overall decline in both butterfly abundance and species richness, with an estimated abundance decrease of 3.8%/year and richness decrease of 1.6%/year (52.5% and 27.1% cumulatively from 1999 to 2018). Abundance and richness declines were also noted across all investigated functional groups except non-resident (migratory) species. Butterfly community composition changed through time, but we did not find evidence of systematic biotic homogenization, perhaps because declines were occurring in nearly all functional groups. Finally, at the site-level, declines in either richness or abundance occurred at five of seven locations, with only the two largest locations (&gt;300 Ha) not exhibiting declines. Our results mirror those of other long-term butterfly studies predominantly in Europe and North America that have found associations of butterflies with climate variables and general declines in butterfly richness and abundance."
https://openalex.org/W3207591473,"We previously reported that there were no differences between the lung-protective actions of pressure-controlled inverse ratio ventilation and volume control ventilation based on the changes in serum cytokine levels. Dead space represents a ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and can enable us to understand the heterogeneity and elapsed time changes in ventilation-perfusion mismatch.This study was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The inspiratory to expiratory ratio was adjusted individually by observing the expiratory flow-time wave in the pressure-controlled inverse ratio ventilation group (n = 14) and was set to 1:2 in the volume-control ventilation group (n = 13). Using volumetric capnography, the physiological dead space was divided into three dead space components: airway, alveolar, and shunt dead space. The influence of pressure-controlled inverse ratio ventilation and time factor on the changes in each dead space component rate was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon's signed rank test.The physiological dead space and shunt dead space rate were decreased in the pressure-controlled inverse ratio ventilation group compared with those in the volume control ventilation group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively), and both dead space rates increased with time in both groups. The airway dead space rate increased with time, but the difference between the groups was not significant. There were no significant changes in the alveolar dead space rate.Pressure-controlled inverse ratio ventilation reduced the physiological dead space rate, suggesting an improvement in the total ventilation/perfusion mismatch due to improved inflation of the alveoli affected by heterogeneous expansion disorder without hyperinflation of the normal alveoli. However, the shunt dead space rate increased with time, suggesting that atelectasis developed with time in both groups."
https://openalex.org/W3207819716,"Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland in the breast and is typically due to bacterial infection. In malaria-endemic areas, mastitis with accompanying fever can be challenging to differentiate from malaria. At the same time, it is unclear whether malaria infection is directly involved in the development of mastitis. In the present study, whether mastitis develops during infection with malaria parasites was investigated using a rodent malaria model with Plasmodium berghei (P. berghei; Pb) ANKA. The course of parasitemia in postpartum mice infected with Pb ANKA was similar to the course in infected virgin mice. However, infected postpartum mice died earlier than did infected virgin mice. In addition, the weight of pups from mice infected with Pb ANKA was significantly reduced compared with pups from uninfected mice. The macroscopic and histological analyses showed apparent changes, such as destruction of the alveolus wall and extensive presence of leukocytes, in mammary gland tissue in mice infected during the postpartum period. The findings suggest that women during the postpartum period are more vulnerable to complications when infected with malaria parasites, particularly women who do not acquire protective immunity against malaria parasites. Based on the proteomic analysis, IFN-γ signaling pathway-related proteins in mammary gland tissue of the infected postpartum mice were increased. Our results indicate that inflammation induced by IFN-γ, a proinflammatory cytokine, may contribute to negative histological changes in mammary gland tissue of postpartum mice infected with Pb ANKA. In IFN-γ receptor 1-deficient (IFNGR1-KO) mice, the histological changes in mammary gland tissue of the infected postpartum wild-type mice were improved to almost normal mammary gland structure. Furthermore, weight loss in pups delivered by infected IFNGR1-KO postpartum mice was not observed. Taken together, these findings indicate that inflammation induced by IFN-γ is associated with development of mastitis in postpartum mice infected with Pb ANKA. The present study results may increase our understanding of how disease aggravation occurs during postpartum malaria."
https://openalex.org/W3205801212,"Abnormal calcium absorption and iron overload from iron hyperabsorption can contribute to osteoporosis as found in several diseases, including hemochromatosis and thalassemia. Previous studies in thalassemic mice showed the positive effects of the iron uptake suppressor, hepcidin, on calcium transport. However, whether this effect could be replicated in other conditions is not known. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of hepcidin on iron and calcium uptake ability under physiological, iron uptake stimulation and calcium uptake suppression. To investigate the potential mechanism, effects of hepcidin on the expression of iron and calcium transporter and transport-associated protein in Caco-2 cells were also determined. Our results showed that intestinal cell iron uptake was significantly increased by ascorbic acid together with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), but this phenomenon was suppressed by hepcidin. Interestingly, hepcidin significantly increased calcium uptake under physiological condition but not under iron uptake stimulation. While hepcidin significantly suppressed the expression of iron transporter, it had no effect on calcium transporter expression. This indicated that hepcidin-induced intestinal cell calcium uptake did not occur through the stimulation of calcium transporter expression. On the other hand, 1,25(OH)2D3 effectively induced intestinal cell calcium uptake, but it did not affect intestinal cell iron uptake or iron transporter expression. The 1,25(OH)2D3-induced intestinal cell calcium uptake was abolished by 12 mM CaCl2; however, hepcidin could not rescue intestinal cell calcium uptake suppression by CaCl2. Taken together, our results showed that hepcidin could effectively and concurrently induce intestinal cell calcium uptake while reducing intestinal cell iron uptake under physiological and iron uptake stimulation conditions, suggesting its therapeutic potential for inactive calcium absorption, particularly in thalassemic patients or patients who did not adequately respond to 1,25(OH)2D3."

Moreover, income distribution in the city has become more unequal, thereby threatening social cohesion. Such situations led us to investigate the states and correlation of social cohesion and QOL in Bandung. In 2018, we conducted a questionnaire survey of social cohesion and QOL using 13 and 18 question items, respectively. We employed the Rasch model analysis to analyze the logit measures of 752 responses. The results revealed that the population of Bandung has high social cohesion and decent QOL. Our findings suggest that in Bandung QOL is significantly correlated with social cohesion, therefore strategies that seek to enhance social cohesion may be beneficial to improve the QOL."
https://openalex.org/W3206515040,"In a recent paper, we presented new evidence and provided new insights on the status of Cantabrian brown bear subpopulations, relevant for this species conservation. Namely, we revealed the likely phylogeographic relation between eastern Cantabrian subpopulation and the historical Pyrenean population. We have also detected an asymmetric flow of alleles and individuals from the eastern to the western subpopulation, including seven first-generation male migrants. Based on our results and on those of previous studies, we called the attention to the fact that Eastern Cantabrian brown bears might be taking advantage of increased connectivity to avoid higher human pressure and direct persecution in the areas occupied by the eastern Cantabrian subpopulation. In reply, Blanco et al (2020) [11] have criticized our ecological interpretation of the data presented in our paper. Namely, Blanco and co-authors criticize: (1) the use of the exodus concept in the title and discussion of the paper; (2) the apparent contradiction with source-sink theory; (3) the apparent overlooking of historical demographic data on Cantabrian brown bear and the use of the expression of population decline when referring to eastern subpopulation. Rather than contradicting the long and growing body of knowledge on the two brown bear subpopulations, the results presented in our paper allow a new perspective on the causes of the distinct pace of population growth of the two brown bear subpopulations in the last decades. Here, we reply to the criticisms by: clarifying our ecological interpretation of the results; refocusing the discussion on how the new genetic data suggest that currently, the flow of individuals and alleles is stronger westward, and how it may be linked to direct persecution and killing of brown bears. We provide detailed data on brown bear mortality in the Cantabrian Mountains and show that neither migration, gene flow, population increase nor mortality are balanced among the two subpopulations."

The goal of this study was to determine the national prevalence and nutritional quality of free food acquired separately in two settings: 1) by children at school; and 2) by employees at work; both stratified by participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).Using National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey data (2012; n = 4,826 U.S. households containing 5,382 employed adults and 3,338 school-aged children), we used survey-weighted proportions to describe free food acquisition and linear regression to compare the 2010 Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) for free/non-free food acquisition events (i.e., meals) by SNAP status. Analyses were conducted in 2019-2020.SNAP households had more free acquisition events (29.6%) compared to non-SNAP households (<185% federal poverty level (FPL) = 22.3%; ≥185%FPL = 21.0%, p's<0.001). For SNAP-participant children, free acquisition events at school had a higher mean HEI-2010 compared to non-free acquisition events at school (50.3 vs. 43.8, p = 0.033) and free acquisition events by SNAP-non-participant children ≥185%FPL at school (50.3 vs. 38.0, p = 0.001). Free and non-free acquisition events at work had relatively low HEI-2010s, with no differences by SNAP status.Over one fifth of all food acquisition events were free, but free food acquisitions at school and work were relatively unhealthy. For children participating in SNAP, free food acquired at school had higher nutritional quality. Improving the dietary quality of free foods could improve the health of families, especially those participating in SNAP."
https://openalex.org/W3206991258,"The present article examines the impact of intellectual property (IP) utilization and concentration on economic growth in Mexico. The findings presented center on the use of different forms of IP by researchers in the National System of Researchers (SNI in Spanish) of Mexico. We focus especially on the externalities associated with the use of IP by researchers, as well as on understanding how knowledge about, and utilization of IP relates to economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). The results of our analyses indicate that in the context of the Mexican SNI, the utilization of certain forms of IP, specifically patents and industrial designs, had a positive impact on economic growth, while the use of utility models was negatively linked to drivers of growth. Policies based on these results could seek to foster awareness and utilization of particular forms of IP by SNI researchers, which in turn could result in greater economic growth in Mexico."
https://openalex.org/W3207122563,"Gene expression data has the characteristics of high dimensionality and a small sample size and contains a large number of redundant genes unrelated to a disease. The direct application of machine learning to classify this type of data will not only incur a great time cost but will also sometimes fail to improved classification performance. To counter this problem, this paper proposes a dimension-reduction algorithm based on weighted kernel principal component analysis (WKPCA), constructs kernel function weights according to kernel matrix eigenvalues, and combines multiple kernel functions to reduce the feature dimensions. To further improve the dimensional reduction efficiency of WKPCA, t-class kernel functions are constructed, and corresponding theoretical proofs are given. Moreover, the cumulative optimal performance rate is constructed to measure the overall performance of WKPCA combined with machine learning algorithms. Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbour, random forest, iterative random forest and support vector machine approaches are used in classifiers to analyse 6 real gene expression dataset. Compared with the all-variable model, linear principal component dimension reduction and single kernel function dimension reduction, the results show that the classification performance of the 5 machine learning methods mentioned above can be improved effectively by WKPCA dimension reduction."
https://openalex.org/W3207610178,"Healthcare purchasers such as health insurers and governmental bodies are expected to strategically manage chronic care chains. In doing so, purchasers can contribute to the goal of improving task division and collaboration between chronic care providers as has been recommended by numerous studies. However, healthcare purchasing research indicates that, in most countries, purchasers still struggle to fulfil a proactive, strategic approach. Consequently, a typical pattern occurs in which care improvement initiatives are instigated, but not transformed into regular care. By acknowledging that healthcare purchasers are embedded in a care chain of stakeholders who have different, sometimes conflicting, interests and, by taking an institutional logics lens, we seek to explain why achieving strategic purchasing and sustainable improvement is so elusive.We present a longitudinal case study in which we follow a health insurer and care providers aiming to improve the care of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in a region of the Netherlands. Taking a theoretical lens of institutional logics, our aim was to answer 'how stakeholder pressures influence a purchaser's use of institutional logics when pursuing the right care at the right place'. The insurer by default predominantly expressed a bookkeeper's logic, reflecting a focus on controlling short-term care costs by managing individual providers. Over time, a contrasting orchestrator's logic emerged in an attempt to achieve chain-wide improvement, striving for better health outcomes and lower long-term costs. We established five types of stakeholder pressure to explain the shift in logic adoption: relationship pressures, cost pressures, medical demands, public health demands and uncertainty. Linking the changes in logic over time with stakeholder pressures showed that, firstly, the different pressures interact in influencing the purchaser. Secondly, we saw that the lack of intra-organisational alignment affects how the purchaser deals with the different stakeholder pressures.By highlighting the purchaser's difficult position in the care chain and the consequences of their own internal responses, we now better understand why the intended orchestrator's logic and thereby a strategic approach to purchasing chronic care proves unsustainable within the Dutch healthcare system of managed competition."
https://openalex.org/W3207952882,"Variable, and typically inadequate, delivery of skills training following manual wheelchair (MWC) provision has a detrimental impact on user mobility and participation. Traditional in-person delivery of training by rehabilitation therapists has diminished due to cost, travel time, and most recently social distancing restrictions due to COVID-19. Effective alternative training approaches include eHealth home training applications and interactive peer-led training using experienced and proficient MWC users. An innovative TEAM Wheels program integrates app-based self-training and teleconference peer-led training using a computer tablet platform.This protocol outlines implementation and evaluation of the TEAM Wheels training program in a randomized control trial using a wait-list control group.The study will be implemented in a community setting in three Canadian cities.Individuals ≥ 18 years of age within one year of transitioning to use of a MWC.Using a computer tablet, participants engage in three peer-led teleconference training sessions and 75-150 minutes of weekly practice using a video-based training application over 4 weeks. Peer trainers individualize the participants' training plans and monitor their tablet-based training activity online. Control group participants also receive the intervention following a 1-month wait-list period and data collection.Outcomes assessing participation; skill capacity and performance; self-efficacy; mobility; and quality of life will be measured at baseline and post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up for the treatment group.We anticipate that TEAM Wheels will be successfully carried out at all sites and participants will demonstrate statistically significant improvement in the outcome measures compared with the control group."
https://openalex.org/W3162671580,"Almond breeding programs aimed at selecting cultivars adapted to intensive orchards have recently focused on the optimization of tree architecture. This multifactorial trait is defined by numerous components controlled by processes such as hormonal responses, gravitropism and light perception. Gravitropism sensing is crucial to control the branch angle and therefore, the tree habit. A gene family, denominated IGT family after a shared conserved domain, has been described as involved in the regulation of branch angle in several species, including rice and Arabidopsis, and even in fruit trees like peach. Here we identified six members of this family in almond: LAZY1, LAZY2, TAC1, DRO1, DRO2, IGT-like. After analyzing their protein sequences in forty-one almond cultivars and wild species, little variability was found, pointing a high degree of conservation in this family. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to analyze the diversity of IGT family proteins in members of the same tree species. Gene expression was analyzed in fourteen cultivars of agronomical interest comprising diverse tree habit phenotypes. Only LAZY1, LAZY2 and TAC1 were expressed in almond shoot tips during the growing season. No relation could be established between the expression profile of these genes and the variability observed in the tree habit. However, some insight has been gained in how LAZY1 and LAZY2 are regulated, identifying the IPA1 almond homologues and other transcription factors involved in hormonal responses as regulators of their expression. Besides, we have found various polymorphisms that could not be discarded as involved in a potential polygenic origin of regulation of architectural phenotypes. Therefore, we have established that neither the expression nor the genetic polymorphism of IGT family genes are correlated to diversity of tree habit in currently commercialized almond cultivars, with other gene families contributing to the variability of these traits."
https://openalex.org/W3205433702,"To investigate the durability of the first integrase inhibitor-based regimen in a HIV geriatric multicentric prospective cohort and to explore the reasons of regimen discontinuation.This is an analysis conducted on the Geriatric Patients Living with HIV/AIDS (GEPPO) cohort, an Italian prospective observational multicentre cohort of people living with HIV with 65 years of age or more.The analysis was performed using R (version 4.0.2). The tests performed were two sided assuming a 5% significance level (Kruskal-Wallis test, Chi-squared test, log-rank test and a Cox Proportional Hazard model). The proportion of participants discontinuing the three regimens was displayed using cumulative curves.Among 1531 patients enrolled between 2017 and 2019 in the GEPPO cohort, we included 822 participants in this analysis. At baseline, median age was 69.8, the immunovirological profile good, multimorbidity was present in 42.3% of participants, while 27.4% were on polypharmacy. Overall, 483, 243 and 96 participants received DTG, RAL and EVG/c respectively as first InSTI. At the end of the follow up 6.4%, 21.1% and 22.9% participants discontinued DTG, RAL and EVG/c respectively. Using a log-rank test, EVG showed a significantly lower durability than DTG (p<0.001) or RAL (p 0.05) or both, DTG and RAL (p<0.001). Among participants who discontinued their regimen we found 0 virological failure and 56.7% simplification/deprescription.The three integrase inhibitors considered showed a good durability and no virological failures in geriatric patients such as those enrolled in the GEPPO cohort when used in a two or three drug regimen."
https://openalex.org/W3205986708,"To promote the coordinated development between renewable energy and the distribution network, a capacity allocation model of battery energy storage systems (BESS) is proposed to achieve the coordinated optimization for active and reactive power flow, which can reduce the voltage deviation and improve the absorptive capacity for renewable energy. In addition, BESS with four-quadrant operation characteristics, on-load tap changer, and capacitor banks are treated as flexible devices to improve the adaptability for renewable energy fluctuations. In view of the uncertainties of renewable energy caused by the inaccuracy of historical sample data, a set of extreme scenarios with the characteristics of temporal and spatial correlation are considered to obtain a robust BESS configuration decision. The big-M approach and the second-order conic relaxation technique are utilized to convert the BESS capacity allocation model into a mixed-integer linear programming problem. Finally, the IEEE 33-node distribution system is taken as an example to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W3206286458,"Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic medicine, which is often used as a treatment for parasites or as a prophylaxis. While studies have looked at the long-term effects of Ivermectin on helminths, studies have not considered the long-term impacts of this treatment on host health or disease susceptibility. Here, we tracked the effects of early life Ivermectin treatment in Cuban tree frogs ( Osteopilus septentrionalis ) on growth rates, mortality, metabolically expensive organ size, and susceptibility to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) infection. One year after exposure, there was no effect of Ivermectin exposure on frog mass ( X 2 1 = 0.904, p = 0.34), but when tracked through the exponential growth phase (~2.5 years) the Ivermectin exposed individuals had lower growth rates and were ultimately smaller ( X 2 1 = 7.78, p = 0.005; X 2 1 = 5.36, p = 0.02, respectively). These results indicate that early life exposure is likely to have unintended impacts on organismal growth and potentially reproductive fitness. Additionally, we exposed frogs to Bd, a pathogenic fungus that has decimated amphibian populations globally, and found early life exposure to Ivermectin decreased disease susceptibility (disease load: X 2 1 = 17.57, p = 0.0002) and prevalence (control: 55%; Ivermectin: 22%) over 2 years after exposure. More research is needed to understand the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon. Given that Ivermectin exposure altered disease susceptibility, proper controls should be implemented when utilizing this drug as an antiparasitic treatment in research studies."
https://openalex.org/W3206780032,"Influenza A virus (IAV) predisposes individuals to often more severe secondary bacterial infections with Streptococcus pneumonia (S. pneumoniae). The outcomes of these infections may be made worse with the increase in antimicrobial resistance and a lack of new treatments to combat this. Th17 responses are crucial in clearing S. pneumoniae from the lung. We previously demonstrated that early IAV infection of human monocytes significantly reduced levels of S. pneumoniae-driven cytokines involved in the Th17 response. Here, we have further identified that IAV targets specific TLRs (TLR2, TLR4, TLR9) involved in sensing S. pneumoniae infection resulting, in a reduction in TLR agonist-induced IL-23 and TGF-β. The effect of IAV is more profound on the TLR2 and TLR9 pathways. We have established that IAV-mediated inhibition of TLR9-induction is related to a downregulation of RORC, a Th17 specific transcription factor. Other studies using mouse models demonstrated that TLR5 agonism improved the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of IAV/S. pneumoniae co-infections. Therefore, we investigated if TLR5 agonism could restore inhibited Th17 responses in human monocytes. Levels of pneumococcus-driven cytokines, which had previously been inhibited by IAV were not reduced in the presence of the TLR5 mono-agonist, suggesting that such treatment may overcome IAV inhibition of Th17 responses. The importance of our research is in demonstrating the IAV directly targets S. pneumoniae-associated TLR pathways. Additionally, the IAV-inhibition of Th17 responses can be restored by TLR5 agonism, which indicates that there may be a different Th17 signalling pathway which is not affected by IAV infection."

We investigated the relationship between demographic characteristics and COVID-19 positivity, and comorbidities and severe COVID-19 illness (use of mechanical ventilation and length of stay) within a racial/ethnic minority population. Patients tested for COVID-19 between March 2020 and January 2021 (N = 14171) were 49.9% (n = 7072) female; 50.1% (n = 7104) non-Hispanic Black; 33.2% (n = 4698) Hispanic; and 23.6% (n = 3348) aged 65+. Overall COVID-19 positivity was 16.1% (n = 2286). Compared to females, males were 1.1 times more likely to test positive (p = 0.014). Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic persons were 1.4 (p = 0.003) and 2.4 (p<0.001) times more likely, respectively, to test positive. Compared to persons ages 18-24, the odds of testing positive were statistically significantly higher for every age group except 25-34, and those aged 65+ were 2.8 times more likely to test positive (p<0.001). Adjusted for race, sex, and age, COVID-positive patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were 1.9 times more likely to require a ventilator compared to those without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.001). Length of stay was not statistically significantly associated with any of the comorbidity variables. Our findings emphasize the importance of documenting COVID-19 disparities in marginalized populations."
