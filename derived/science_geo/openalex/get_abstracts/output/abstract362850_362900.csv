https://openalex.org/W2045028169,"Paradoxical sleep (PS) is a state characterized by cortical activation, rapid eye movements and muscle atonia. Fifty years after its discovery, the neuronal network responsible for the genesis of PS has been only partially identified. We recently proposed that GABAergic neurons would have a pivotal role in that network. To localize these GABAergic neurons, we combined immunohistochemical detection of Fos with non-radioactive in situ hybridization of GAD67 mRNA (GABA synthesis enzyme) in control rats, rats deprived of PS for 72 h and rats allowed to recover after such deprivation. Here we show that GABAergic neurons gating PS (PS-off neurons) are principally located in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) and the dorsal part of the deep mesencephalic reticular nucleus immediately ventral to it (dDpMe). Furthermore, iontophoretic application of muscimol for 20 min in this area in head-restrained rats induced a strong and significant increase in PS quantities compared to saline. In addition, we found a large number of GABAergic PS-on neurons in the vlPAG/dDPMe region and the medullary reticular nuclei known to generate muscle atonia during PS. Finally, we showed that PS-on neurons triggering PS localized in the SLD are not GABAergic. Altogether, our results indicate that multiple populations of PS-on GABAergic neurons are distributed in the brainstem while only one population of PS-off GABAergic neurons localized in the vlPAG/dDpMe region exist. From these results, we propose a revised model for PS control in which GABAergic PS-on and PS-off neurons localized in the vlPAG/dDPMe region play leading roles."
https://openalex.org/W2165709201,"The precise mechanism by which mutant huntingtin elicits its toxicity remains unknown. However, synaptic alterations and increased susceptibility to neuronal death are known contributors to Huntington's disease (HD) symptomatology. While decreased metabolism has long been associated with HD, recent findings have surprisingly demonstrated reduced neuronal apoptosis in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila models of HD by drugs that diminish ATP production. Interestingly, extracellular ATP has been recently reported to elicit neuronal death through stimulation of P2X7 receptors. These are ATP-gated cation channels known to modulate neurotransmitter release from neuronal presynaptic terminals and to regulate cytokine production and release from microglia. We hypothesized that alteration in P2X7-mediated calcium permeability may contribute to HD synaptic dysfunction and increased neuronal apoptosis. Using mouse and cellular models of HD, we demonstrate increased P2X7-receptor level and altered P2X7-mediated calcium permeability in somata and terminals of HD neurons. Furthermore, cultured neurons expressing mutant huntingtin showed increased susceptibility to apoptosis triggered by P2X7-receptor stimulation. Finally, in vivo administration of the P2X7-antagonist Brilliant Blue-G (BBG) to HD mice prevented neuronal apoptosis and attenuated body weight loss and motor-coordination deficits. These in vivo data strongly suggest that altered P2X7-receptor level and function contribute to HD pathogenesis and highlight the therapeutic potential of P2X7 receptor antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W1974302220,"NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CYPOR) catalyzes the transfer of electrons to all known microsomal cytochromes P450. A CYPOR variant, with a 4-amino acid deletion in the hinge connecting the FMN domain to the rest of the protein, has been crystallized in three remarkably extended conformations. The variant donates an electron to cytochrome P450 at the same rate as the wild-type, when provided with sufficient electrons. Nevertheless, it is defective in its ability to transfer electrons intramolecularly from FAD to FMN. The three extended CYPOR structures demonstrate that, by pivoting on the C terminus of the hinge, the FMN domain of the enzyme undergoes a structural rearrangement that separates it from FAD and exposes the FMN, allowing it to interact with its redox partners. A similar movement most likely occurs in the wild-type enzyme in the course of transferring electrons from FAD to its physiological partner, cytochrome P450. A model of the complex between an open conformation of CYPOR and cytochrome P450 is presented that satisfies mutagenesis constraints. Neither lengthening the linker nor mutating its sequence influenced the activity of CYPOR. It is likely that the analogous linker in other members of the diflavin family functions in a similar manner.

In humans, the cytochromes P450 (cyt P450) are one of the most important families of proteins involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of a vast number of endogenous compounds and the detoxification and biodegradation of most foreign compounds. CYPOR also donates electrons to heme oxygenase (3.Schacter B.A. Nelson E.B. Marver H.S. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3601-3607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cytochrome b5 (4.Enoch H.G. Strittmatter P. J. Biol.

The FAD receives a hydride anion from the obligate two electron donor NADPH and passes the electrons one at a time to FMN. The FMN then donates electrons to the redox partners of CYPOR, again one electron at a time. Cyt P450 accepts electrons at two different steps in its complex reaction cycle. Ferric cyt P450 is reduced to the ferrous protein, and oxyferrous cyt P450 receives the second of the two electrons to form the peroxo (Fe+3OO)2- cyt P450 intermediate (6.Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

Although the one-electron reduced form is an air-stable, neutral blue semiquinone (FMNox/sq, -110 mV), it is the FMN hydroquinone (FMNsq/hq, -270 mV), not the semiquinone, that donates an electron to its redox partners (8.Oprian D.D.

CYPOR is the prototype of the mammalian diflavin-containing enzyme family, which includes nitric-oxide synthase (12.Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar), methionine synthase reductase (13.Leclerc D. Wilson A. Dumas R. Gafuik C. Song D. Watkins D. Heng H.H. Rommens J.M.

CYPOR is also a target for anticancer therapy, because it reductively activates anticancer prodrugs (16.Rooseboom M. Commandeur J.N. Vermeulen N.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2004; 56: 53-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). CYPOR consists of an N-terminal single α-helical transmembrane anchor (∼6 kDa) responsible for its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum and the soluble cytosolic portion (∼66 kDa) capable of reducing cytochrome c. Crystal structures of the soluble form of the wild-type and several mutant CYPORs are available (17.Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Siler-Masters B.S. Kim J.J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 944: 8411-8416Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 18.Hubbard P.A. Shen A.L. Paschke R. Kasper C.B. Kim J.J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29163-29170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The first ∼170 amino acids of the soluble domain are highly homologous to flavodoxin and bind FMN (FMN domain), whereas the C-terminal portion of the soluble protein consists of a FAD- and NADPH-binding domain with sequence and structural similarity to ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase (FAD domain). A connecting domain, possessing a unique sequence and structure, joins the FMN and FAD domains and is partly responsible for the relative orientation of the FMN and FAD domains. In the crystal structure, a convex anionic surface surrounds FMN. In the wild-type crystal structure, the two flavin isoalloxazine rings are in van der Waals contact, poised for efficient interflavin electron transfer (17.Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Siler-Masters B.S. Kim J.J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 944: 8411-8416Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Based on the juxtaposition of the two flavins, an extrinsic electron transfer rate of ∼1010 s-1 is predicted (19.Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X.X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). However, the experimentally observed electron transfer rate between the two flavins is 30–55 s-1 (20.Bhattacharyya A.K. Lipka J.J. Waskell L. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21.Gutierrez A. Paine M. Wolf C.R. Scrutton N.S. Roberts G.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4626-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This modest rate and slowing of electron transfer in a viscous solvent (75% glycerol) suggest that interflavin electron transfer is likely conformationally gated. Moreover, the “closed” crystal structure, in which the flavins are in contact, is difficult to reconcile with mutagenesis studies that indicate the acidic amino acid residues on the surface near FMN are involved in interacting with cyt P450 (22.Shen A.L. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27475-27480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The first structural insight into how cyt P450 might interact with the FMN domain of CYPOR was provided by the crystal structure of a complex between the heme and FMN-containing domains of cyt P450 BM3 (23.Sevrioukova I.F. Li H. Zhang H. Peterson J.A. Poulos T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In this complex, the methyl groups of FMN are oriented toward the heme on the proximal surface of cyt P450 BM3. Considered together, these three observations, the slow interflavin electron transfer, the mutagenesis data, and the structure of the complex between the heme and FMN domains of cyt P450 BM3, suggest that CYPOR will undergo a large conformational rearrangement in the course of shuttling electrons from NADPH to cyt P450. In addition, crystal structures of various CYPOR variants indicate that the FMN domain is highly mobile with respect to the rest of the molecule (18.Hubbard P.A. Shen A.L. Paschke R. Kasper C.B. Kim J.J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29163-29170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Consideration of how the reductase would undergo a reorientation to interact with its redox partners led us to hypothesize the existence of a structural element in the reductase that would regulate the conformational changes and the relative dynamic motion of the domains. Our attention focused on the hinge region between the FMN and the connecting domain, because it is often disordered and highly flexible in the crystal structure (supplemental Fig. S1). The length and sequence of the hinge have been altered by site-directed mutagenesis, and the effects of the mutations on the catalytic properties of each mutant have been determined. The results demonstrate that lengthening the linker or altering its sequence do not modify the properties of CYPOR. In contrast, deletion of four amino acids markedly disrupts electron transfer from FAD to FMN, whereas the ability of the FMN domain to donate electrons to cyt P450 remains intact. The hinge deletion variant has been crystallized in three “open” conformations capable of interacting with cyt P450. Determination of CYPOR Activity Using Cytochrome c and Ferricyanide—The ability of CYPOR hinge mutants to reduce cytochrome c and ferricyanide was measured in 270 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.7, at 30 °C as described previously (24.Shen A.L. Porter T.D. Wilson T.E. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7584-7589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Details of the assay are provided in the supplemental materials. To ensure that the loss of cytochrome c activity observed with the two (ΔT236, G237) (ΔTG) and four (ΔT236, G237, E238, E239) (ΔTGEE) amino acid deletion mutants was not due to a dissociation of flavins from the CYPOR, the reduction of cytochrome c assays was also measured in the presence of 240 nm free FMN and FAD. The added flavins did not significantly increase the activity of the CYPOR. The concentration of free FMN and FAD was determined using their extinction coefficients (ϵFMN445 nm = 12.5 mm-1cm-1; ϵFAD450 nm = 11.3 mm-1 cm-1) (11.Kurzban G.P. Strobel H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7824-7830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kcat and Km for cytochrome c and NADPH were determined by following the kinetics of cytochrome c reduction at varying concentrations of cytochrome c (65, 28, 18.5, 9.2, and 1.9 μm) and NADPH (60, 30, 15, 9, 3, and 1.2 μm). The kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the initial rate versus concentration of the substrate using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Reduction of ferricyanide by CYPOR was measured by following the bleaching of the absorbance at 420 nm. Typically, 10 nm CYPOR was preincubated with 500 μm oxidized ferricyanide for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of NADPH to a final concentration of 100 μm. The concentration of the reduced ferricyanide was calculated using an extinction coefficient at 420 nm of 1.02 mm-1 cm-1 (11.Kurzban G.P. Strobel H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7824-7830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of Benzphetamine Metabolism by Cyt P450 2B4—Cyt P450 2B4 was expressed and purified as described previously (25.Saribas A.S. Gruenke L. Waskell L. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (details in supplemental materials). The metabolism of benzphetamine at 30 °C under steady-state conditions was determined by measuring formaldehyde formation using Nash's reagent as previously described (26.Bridges A.G.L. Chang Y.T. Vaksar I.A. Loew G. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17036-17049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Kinetics of the Reduction of CYPOR by NADPH—The experiments were performed at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions using a High-Tech SF61DX2 stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-controlled circulating water bath, housed in an anaerobic Belle Technology glove box (Hi-Tech, Salisbury, England) as previously described (8.Oprian D.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8935-8944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional experimental details are included in the supplemental materials. Determination of the Rate of Reduction of Ferric Cyt P450 2B4 by CYPOR in the Presence and Absence of Benzphetamine—The rate of reduction of ferric cyt P450 2B4 in the presence of CO by wild-type, ΔTG, and ΔTGEE CYPOR was determined as previously described (27.Oprian D.D. Vatsis K.P. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8895-8902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Details are in the supplemental materials. Determination of the Kinetics of Product Formation by Oxyferrous Cyt P450 2B4 in the Presence of Two-electron Reduced Wild-type and Variant CYPOR—The rate of oxidation of cyclohexane and benzphetamine by cyt P450 2B4 in the presence of the two-electron reduced CYPOR was performed at 30 and 15 °C, respectively, using a QFM-400 chemical quench flow apparatus (BioLogic, France) as described (28.Zhang H. Im S.-C. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29766-29776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, a protein complex between oxidized reductase and ferric cyt P450 was preformed in the presence of dilauroyl l-3-phosphatidyl choline at a molar ratio of 1:1:60 (CYPOR:cyt P450:dilauroyl l-3-phosphatidyl choline). The substrate (cyclohexane or benzphetamine) was added to the protein mixture at a final concentration of 1 mm. Then the preformed cyt P450·CYPOR complex was stoichiometrically reduced with dithionite under anaerobic conditions to the ferrous state for cyt P450 and to the two-electron reduced state for CYPOR. The solution containing the reduced, preformed cyt P450·CYPOR complex was loaded into syringe 1 of the chemical quenched-flow apparatus and rapidly mixed with aerobic buffer ([O2] ≈ 0.32 mm) containing 1 mm of substrate from syringe 2. The reaction was quenched with 1 m NaOH at different times. The samples were collected, and the product in each sample was quantified as described (28.Zhang H. Im S.-C. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29766-29776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cyclohexanol was measured by a gas-chromatography mass spectrometry assay (Agilent Technologies HP6890/MSO5893). Norbenzphetamine was quantified using a high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer assay (ThermoFinnigan TSQ). Crystallization and Data Collection—The Δ56 form of the ΔTGEE mutant (hereafter referred to as the soluble form), in which the first 56 residues of the N terminus, including the membrane anchor of ΔTGEE, were deleted, was constructed and expressed in a manner similar to that of the full-length ΔTGEE protein (details in supplemental materials). The purification procedure (details in supplemental materials) was also similar except that 0.1% Triton X-100 rather than 0.3% Triton X-100 was used, and an affinity column (2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose) was included at the final step. Prior to crystallization setup, 2× and 20× molar excesses of FMN and NADP+, respectively, were added to the protein sample followed by two cycles of concentration/dilution to remove excess cofactors. The protein solution was concentrated to 15 mg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Crystals were grown using the hanging drop method by mixing 1.8 μl of the protein solution and 2 μl of reservoir solution (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NH4SCN, and 15% polyethylene glycol 5000 monomethylester). Small thin plate-shaped crystals appeared within a week. Crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution (reservoir buffer plus 10% glycerol) for ∼5 s and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. A 3.4-Å data set was collected at the SBC 19ID beamline, Advanced Photon Source. Data processing was done with the program HKL2000 (29.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 109.1Å, b = 93.1Å, and c = 125.7 Å and β = 100.0° and contained three molecules of the ΔTGEE mutant per asymmetric unit. Structure Determination—Molecular replacement methods were employed for phase determination. Not surprisingly, no reasonable solutions were obtained using either the program, MOLREP in CCP4 (CCP4, Programs for protein crystallography (30.Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar)) or Phaser (31.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kuntstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14567) Google Scholar), when the wild-type rat CYPOR structure (PDB ID, 1AMO) was used as the search model. However, when separate domains of CYPOR, i.e. the FAD domain and the FMN domain, were used as search models, Phaser successfully located three FAD domains and two FMN domains sequentially with the rotation function Z score/translation function Z scores/log likelihood gain of 18.5/15.4/367, 15.7/37.6/1294, 12.7/42.9/2392, 7.8/40.4/3211, and 2.6/15.1/4688, respectively, with an R value of 40.9%. Because all the cofactors were excluded from the search models, the strong electron densities for FAD and FMN at expected positions confirmed the correctness of the solution. The third FMN domain could not be located at this stage, although there was a large enough empty space for an FMN domain in the crystal packing. When four cofactors (three FAD and one FMN) were added to the model, then the linker region between the two flavin domains of the second molecule was clearly visible in the |Fo| - |Fc| difference Fourier map (Fig. 2). In addition, the adenosine pyrophosphate portion of NADP+ in all three FAD domains could be identified. Further refinements were carried out using the program CNS (32.Brunger A.T. Nat. Protocols. 2007; 2: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar) and manual model adjustments with COOT (33.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar), yielding R-factors of 33.3% and 25.1% for R-free and R-crystal, respectively. During the refinement, tight non-crystallographic symmetry restraints for the three FAD domains and two FMN domains were used until the last cycle of refinement, which gave final R-factors of 27.3% and 21.4% for R-free and R-crystal, respectively. At this stage, all three FAD domains are well defined. However, only one FMN domain is clearly defined and the B-factors of the β-sheets and loop areas of the second FMN domain were extremely high (∼200 Å2). Therefore, all but 78 residues, mostly corresponding to α helices, were excluded from the subsequent refinement. At this stage, some patches of densities in the |Fo| - |Fc| map were visible extending from the third hinge that could be assigned to the α helices F and B of the third FMN domain, and thus the third FMN domain could be modeled. However, this FMN domain was not included in the refinement. The final R-factors were 27.9% for R-free and 21.9% for R-crystal.

The nine residues of cyt P450 2B4 have been shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be involved in the interaction with CYPOR (26.Bridges A.G.L. Chang Y.T. Vaksar I.A. Loew G. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17036-17049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In using ZDOCK, again, Glu-208 of Mol A and Arg-133 and Lys-433 of cyt P450 were included as required residues in the contact area. Among the top 10 solutions obtained from each method, the only common solution (fifth in both methods) was selected. No further refinement of the docked structure was attempted. Rationale for Mutations in the 12-Amino Acid Hinge Joining the FMN Domain to the Remainder of the Protein—To determine whether the flexible random-coil hinge joining the FMN to the connecting domain of CYPOR functioned in orienting the FMN and FAD domains of the protein for electron transfer from FAD via FMN to the acceptor protein cyt P450, the hinge was mutated. To identify the boundaries of the hinge a multiple sequence alignment of the 45 known CYPOR sequences and a structural alignment of two CYPOR structures (rat and yeast) were performed (17.Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Siler-Masters B.S. Kim J.J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 944: 8411-8416Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 18.Hubbard P.A. Shen A.L. Paschke R.

The alignments indicated the length of the linker was conserved and that it spanned 12 residues from Gly-232 to Arg-243 in the rat protein. Although the sequence identity between rat and yeast reductase is only 25%, the structures were highly conserved (r.m.s.d. for backbone atoms, 1.4 Å) (36.Lamb D.C. Kim Y. Yermalitskaya L.V.

Rat neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) reductase has an analogous, 24-amino acid flexible hinge, which influences the electron flow through the NOS reductase to an acceptor molecule (37.Haque M.M.

To investigate whether the length of the CYPOR hinge altered electron flow through the reductase and/or modulated the ability to reduce its electron transfer partner, cyt P450, the length of the hinge was increased by two and four alanine residues and shortened by two and four amino acids, using protein engineering techniques. The hinge also contains two charged residues (Glu-238 and Glu-239), which form salt bridges with the guanidinium side chain of Arg-104 in the FMN domain. To test the influence of these salt bridges on the stability of the closed conformation, Glu-238 and Glu-239 were mutated to alanine. In addition, a mutant with four amino acid changes in the middle of the hinge (Thr-236 → Ala, Gly-237 → Ala, Glu-238 → Ala, and Glu-239 → Ala) was constructed to determine if these particular amino acids and the sequence were required for normal function. Activity of the Mutant Reductases with Cyt P450 2B4, Cytochrome c, and Ferricyanide—The ability of the CYPOR variants to support catalysis by the physiological redox partner, full-length cyt P450 2B4, was measured by quantitating the N-demethylation of benzphetamine to formaldehyde (Table 2). The 2- and 4-residue substitution mutants (E238A/E239A and T236A/G237A/E238A/E239A) and the 2- and 4-alanine addition mutants exhibited normal or slightly increased activity. The 2-amino acid deletion mutant, ΔTG 236–237 (hereafter, simply referred to as ΔTG), supported a wild-type rate of catalysis, whereas the activity of the 4-amino acid deletion ΔTGEE 236–239 (hereafter referred to as ΔTGEE) was undetectable.TABLE 2Activity of the wild-type and CYPOR mutants with redox partners The activity of reductases with their redox partners cytochrome c, ferricyanide, and cyt P450 2B4 was determined at 30 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity of CYPOR with cyt P450 2B4 is reported in units of nmol of formaldehyde produced/s/nmol of CYPOR.Reductase mutantscyt P450Fe3+ cyt cFe(CN)63-nmol/s/nmol CYPORnmol reduced/s/nmol CYPORWild type0.67 ± 0.0770.6 ± 5.1135 ± 6.4ΔTG-(236–237)0.77 ± 0.08311 ± 0.64170 ± 9ΔTGEE-(236–239)NDaND, not detected0.33 ± 0.026136 ± 3.9E238A/E239A0.95 ± 0.178 ± 6.4141 ± 6.4T236A/G237A/E238A/E239A0.83 ± 0.0877 ± 6.4167 ± 10G237/+AA/E2380.83 ± 0.1109 ± 4137 ± 5G237/+AAAA/E2380.82 ± 0.07106 ± 2.6160 ± 6.5a ND, not detected Open table in a new tab Cytochrome c is not a physiological redox partner for CYPOR. Nevertheless, it is often used to assess the reductase activity because of the simplicity and rapidity of the assay (24.Shen A.L. Porter T.D. Wilson T.E. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7584-7589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, there is evidence that the binding site for cyt P450 and cytochrome c, both basic proteins, on the acidic FMN domain of the reductase is either identical or overlapping (40.Tamburini P.P.

Honeybees, Apis mellifera, by virtue of their other impressive cognitive feats, are a prime candidate for investigations of this nature. We therefore used the well-established delayed match-to-sample paradigm, to test the limits of honeybees' ability to match two visual patterns solely on the basis of the shared number of elements in the two patterns. Using a y-maze, we found that bees can not only differentiate between patterns containing two and three elements, but can also use this prior knowledge to differentiate three from four, without any additional training. However, bees trained on the two versus three task could not distinguish between higher numbers, such as four versus five, four versus six, or five versus six. Control experiments confirmed that the bees were not using cues such as the colour of the exact configuration of the visual elements, the combined area or edge length of the elements, or illusory contours formed by the elements. To our knowledge, this is the first report of number-based visual generalisation by an invertebrate."

Here we demonstrate that β-arrestin-2 mediates anti-apoptotic cytoprotective signaling stimulated by a typical 7-transmembrane receptor the angiotensin ATII 1A receptor, expressed endogenously in rat vascular smooth muscle cells or by transfection in HEK-293 cells. Receptor stimulation leads to concerted activation of two pathways, ERK/p90RSK and PI3K/AKT, which converge to phosphorylate and inactivate the pro-apoptotic protein BAD. Anti-apoptotic effects as well as pathway activities can be stimulated by an angiotensin analog (SII), which has been previously shown to activate β-arrestin but not G protein-dependent signaling, and are abrogated by β-arrestin-2 small interfering RNA. These findings establish a key role for β-arrestin-2 in mediating cellular cytoprotective functions by a 7-transmembrane receptor and define the biochemical pathways involved. β-Arrestins, originally discovered as terminators of G protein-coupled receptor signaling, have more recently been appreciated to also function as signal transducers in their own right, although the consequences for cellular physiology have not been well understood.

Their binding to the receptor sterically inhibits receptor coupling to G protein leading to inactivation of effectors such as second messenger generating enzymes (1Hall R.A. Premont R.T.

Besides this classical function, recently accumulating evidence has revealed novel functions of β-arrestins as signal transducers in various signaling pathways (2DeWire S.M. Ahn S. Lefkowitz R.J.

Among other processes, β-arrestins have been suggested to play a role in regulation of cell death, but this area has been controversial and largely devoid of mechanistic insight. There have been reports implicating β-arrestins in both pro- and anti-apoptotic responses as well as in non-apoptotic cell death (3Shi Y. Feng Y. Kang J. Liu C. Li Z. Li D. Cao W. Qiu J. Guo Z. Bi E.

For example, it has been shown that stimulation of a number of 7TMRs including the N-formyl peptide receptor induces apoptosis in β-arrestin 1/2 double knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and that reintroduction of either β-arrestin-1 or -2 completely prevents this apoptosis (5Revankar C.M.

Conversely, β-arrestins also have been reported to mediate cell death. β-Arrestin-2, particularly a dephosphorylated form, has been shown to facilitate inhibition of NF-κB activation in response to UV, leading to promotion of UV-induced cell death (8Luan B.

In the case of AT1AR-mediated ERK activation in receptor-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, for example, the G protein-dependent activation is rapid, quite transient (peak at 2-5 min), and leads to nuclear translocation of the activated ERK. In contrast, β-arrestin-2-dependent ERK activation is slower, quite persistent, and entirely confined to the cytoplasm, particularly to endosomal vesicles (22Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Such differences in ERK activation strongly imply that there must be subsets of ERK targets and physiological outcomes differentially regulated through β-arrestin versus G protein-dependent mechanisms. In the case of AKT activation, stimulation of 7TM protease-activated receptors with thrombin has been shown to activate AKT in a β-arrestin-1-dependent manner (27Goel R. Phillips-Mason P.J.

Eight to 90% confluent early passage (<5) VSMCs were transfected with siRNA using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the modified manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 60 μl of the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent was added to 300 μl of the medium-199 and 20 μg of siRNA was added to 400 μl of the medium. Both solutions were allowed to stand 5-10 min at room temperature and mixed by inversion. Following a 15-20-min incubation at room temperature, the entire transfection mixture was added to VSMCs in a 100-mm dish containing 5 ml of the fresh, serum-free medium. After cells were incubated for overnight at 37 °C, an additional 5 ml of the medium with 20% fetal bovine serum and 2% penicillin/streptomycin were added to the dish. Following an additional incubation for 24 h, cells were divided into 6-well plates or 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) for further procedures. For DNA transfection into VSMCs in either 35-mm glass bottom dishes or 6-well plates, the Lipofectamine LTX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) was used with the PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. HEK-293 cells, stably expressing AT1A receptors (∼600 fmol/mg of proteins), were established after transfection with a zeocin-resistant AT1A receptor expression plasmid using FuGENE 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stable clones were selected in the presence of zeocin (300 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained and transfected with siRNAs using GeneSilencer (Genlantis, San Diego, CA) as described (22Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).Cleaved Caspase-3 and DNA Fragmentation Assays-VSMCs were serum-starved for ∼24 h and then stimulated with 100 nm AngII or 10 μm SII at 37 °C for 5 min prior to treatment with either 80 μm H2O2 or 50 μm etoposide. After a further incubation overnight, cell lysates were prepared. Pro- and cleaved caspase-3 were visualized, and the amounts of cleaved caspase-3 were quantified as described for immunoblotting in this section. The amounts of fragmented DNA were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Immunostaining-VSMCs on 35-mm glass bottom dishes were fixed with 5% formaldehyde diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fixed cells were permeabilized by incubation with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, cells were incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c (BD Pharmingen, 1:100) antibody at room temperature for 2 h, and repeatedly washed with PBS. Next, incubation of the Bodipy fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, 1:100) was done for 1 h at room temperature followed by repeated washes with PBS. For subsequent staining of the hemaglutinin epitope-tagged BAD, cells were incubated with a polyclonal hemaglutinin probe (Y11) antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:200) at room temperature overnight. The Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, 1:250) was then added for 1 h. Confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope using single line (488 nm) or multitrack sequential excitation (488 and 568 nm) and emission (515-540 nm, Bodipy fluorescein; 585-615 nm, Texas Red) filter sets.Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation-In most cases, cellular extracts from VSMCs or HEK-293 cells on 6-well plates were prepared as described previously (22Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). For caspase-3 immunoblotting, VSMC lysates were prepared using the RIPA lysis buffer. Equal amounts (∼10 μg) of cellular extracts/lysates were used for immunoblotting performed as described previously (22Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, lysates form HEK-293 cells in 100-mm dishes were prepared using the glycerol/Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (33Ahn S. Wei H. Garrison T.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7807-7811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of cell lysates (300-500 μg of total protein in 1 ml of the buffer) were incubated with 1-2 μg of either rabbit polyclonal 14-3-3 β (C-20) or mouse monoclonal BAD (C-7) antibody and protein A- or G-agarose beads, respectively, overnight at 4 °C. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Each band in immunoblots was quantified by densitometry using the GeneTools program (SynGene).Statistical Analysis-Statistical significance in bar graphs was determined by using a one-way analysis of variance (PRISM software) to correct for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test) or t test for single comparisons between AngII or SII-stimulated versus non-stimulated in a certain condition, unless otherwise indicated in each figure. Statistical significance in each time point of kinetic graphs was determined by using a two-way analysis of variance (Bonferroni’s post-test) between β-arrestin-2 siRNA-transfected and control cells. p value (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001) of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSβ-Arrestin-2 Is Essential for the Anti-apoptotic Effects of AngII on Primary Cultured Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells-It has been previously reported that the octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (AngII) promotes anti-apoptotic effects in VSMCs through AngII type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) (34Mallat Z. Tedgui A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 947-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 35Pollman M.J. Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Gibbons G.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 748-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We and others have previously found that β-arrestin-2 is the isoform that mediates AT1AR-activated ERK signaling (33Ahn S. Wei H. Garrison T.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7807-7811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 36Lee M.H. El-Shewy H.M. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2088-2097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which is potentially an anti-apoptotic pathway. We have also found that β-arrestin-1 functionally opposes this signaling (33Ahn S. Wei H. Garrison T.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7807-7811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Consequently, we used VSMCs to explore the role of β-arrestin-2 in regulating apoptosis. We first monitored the effects of AngII stimulation on the activation of caspase-3 (cleavage of procaspase-3) induced by apoptotic challenges in VSMCs transfected with either control or β-arrestin-2 siRNAs. We used 100 nm AngII to obtain maximal responses in this assay. It has been previously reported that AngII-stimulated ERK activation reaches maximal levels with this concentration in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing AT1AR (33Ahn S. Wei H. Garrison T.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7807-7811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Apoptotic stimulation by either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Fig. 1A) or etoposide (Fig. 1B) dramatically increases the level of cleaved caspase-3 in control VSMCs. The levels of cleaved caspase-3 induced by such apoptotic stimuli were reduced to ∼50% by AngII pretreatment (Fig. 1, C and D). Next, we examined the effects of siRNA-mediated β-arrestin-2 knock-down on AngII-promoted protection from caspase-3 cleavage. Depletion of β-arrestin-2 not only leads to increases (up to ∼150%) in the induction of cleaved caspase-3 levels by treatment with hydrogen peroxide or etoposide, but also eliminates AngII-mediated decreases in these levels (Fig. 1, C and D). On the other hand, knocking-down β-arrestin-1 leads to decreases in apoptotic reagent-induced caspase-3 cleavage even in the absence of stimulation with AngII, which is similar in extent to the protection observed in AngII-treated control cells. Stimulation with AngII results in no significant further protection in cells knocked down for β-arrestin-1 (data not shown). These results suggest an essential role of β-arrestin-2 in AngII-stimulated protection from caspase-dependent apoptotic processes.Because the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is one of the key upstream events for the coordinated activation of caspases (34Mallat Z. Tedgui A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 947-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 37Fabregat I. Roncero C. Fernandez M. Liver Int. 2007; 27: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we next examined effects of AngII stimulation on the hydrogen peroxide-induced redistribution of cytochrome c in control or β-arrestin-2 siRNA-transfected VSMCs. In the absence of an apoptotic challenge, cytochrome c is well distributed within cytoplasmic, mitochondrial networks in control cells (Fig. 1E, upper left panel). Treatment with hydrogen peroxide leads to the rearrangement of cytochrome c into a cytoplasmic dotted pattern in cells (Fig. 1E, upper middle panel). Hydrogen peroxide-induced redistribution of cytochrome c is largely reversed by prior stimulation with AngII (Fig. 1E, upper right panel). These staining patterns of cytochrome c are, in all cases, superimposed with that of the Mito-Tracker, a mitochondrial marker (supplemental Fig. S1), confirming that the changes in the staining patterns of cytochrome c shown in Fig. 1E indeed represent mitochondrial remodeling. Mitochondrial rearrangement and fragmentation have been observed in apoptotic cells, especially when apoptosis has been induced by pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins (38Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar, 39Sun M.G. Williams J. Munoz-Pinedo C. Perkins G.A. Brown J.M. Ellisman M.H. Green D.R. Frey T.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Depletion of β-arrestin-2 has no effect on mitochondrial network organization (Fig. 1E, lower left panel), and does not alter the pattern of fragmentation observed after hydrogen peroxide treatment (Fig. 1E, lower middle panel). However, unlike control siRNA-transfected cells, pre-stimulation with AngII fails to reverse the hydrogen peroxide-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in β-arrestin-2 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1E, lower right panel). These results further support an important role for β-arrestin-2 in mediating AngII-stimulated anti-apoptotic activity.To further validate these findings, we measured DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of cell death, in VSMCs transfected with either control or β-arrestin-2 siRNAs. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1F) or etoposide (Fig. 1G) causes a 4-6-fold increase in DNA fragmentation. In control siRNA-transfected cells, pre-stimulation with AngII reduces (by ∼40%) the extent of DNA fragmentation induced by both reagents (Fig. 1, F and G). On the contrary, we did not observe decreases in DNA fragmentation after prestimulation with AngII in β-arrestin-2 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1, F and G), mirroring the situation observed with caspase-3 activation. In the case of β-arrestin-1 knock-down, effects on DNA fragmentation also mirror the effects observed with caspase-3 cleavage (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that β-arrestin-2 is crucial for AngII-stimulated protection of VSMCs from apoptotic cell death.To establish whether the β-arrestin-2-dependent AT1R-mediated inhibition of apoptotic processes can be accomplished in the absence of G protein activation, we stimulated VSMCs with an AngII analog, [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]AngII (SII). This mutant form of AngII was previously shown not to activate G proteins (21Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 768-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, H and I, stimulation of the cells with SII leads to significant decreases (35-45%) in the levels of cleaved caspase-3 upon hydrogen peroxide or etoposide treatment. The extent of DNA fragmentation induced by these reagents is also reduced to a similar extent upon prestimulation with SII (Fig. 1J). The extent of SII-stimulated decreases (30-45%) in both assays is similar to those evoked by AngII stimulation (40-50%). This result demonstrates that activation of the AT1 receptor elicits cytoprotective effects mainly through G protein-independent signaling.β-Arrestin-2 Mediates Activation of ERK-RSK and AKT Signaling Pathways, Leading to Phosphorylation of BAD in AngII-stimulated VSMCs-Recently a growing list of biochemical pathways has been shown to be stimulated via 7TMRs through β-arrestin-dependent mechanisms (2DeWire S.M.

RNR in S phase mammalian cells comprises a weak cytosolic complex of the catalytic R1 protein containing redox active cysteine residues and the R2 protein harboring the tyrosine free radical. Each enzyme turnover generates a disulfide in the active site of R1, which is reduced by C-terminally located shuttle dithiols leaving a disulfide to be reduced. Electrons for reduction come ultimately from NADPH via thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin (Trx) or glutathione reductase, glutathione, and glutaredoxin (Grx), but the mechanism has not been clarified for mammalian RNR. Using recombinant mouse RNR, we found that Trx1 and Grx1 had similar catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). With 4 mm GSH, Grx1 showed a higher affinity (apparent Km value, 0.18 μm) compared with Trx1 which displayed a higher apparent kcat, suggesting its major role in S phase DNA replication. Surprisingly, Grx activity was strongly dependent on GSH concentrations (apparent Km value, 3 mm) and a Grx2 C40S mutant was active despite only one cysteine residue in the active site. This demonstrates a GSH-mixed disulfide mechanism for glutaredoxin catalysis in contrast to the dithiol mechanism for thioredoxin. This may be an advantage with the low levels of RNR for DNA repair or in tumor cells with high RNR and no or low Trx expression.

Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), plays a critical role in the high fidelity DNA replication and repair. The class Ia enzyme, present in all eukaryotes (from yeast to mammals), some bacteria, and some viruses, is composed of two subunits: R1 and R2 (2Kolberg M. Strand K.R. Graff P. Andersson K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The R2 protein (β) is a homodimer (2 × 45 kDa), and each polypeptide harbors a tyrosyl free radical that is generated and stabilized by an iron center (1Nordlund P. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 681-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 2Kolberg M. Strand K.R. Graff P. Andersson K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The R1 protein (α) contains the substrate-binding site, the active site including three cysteine residues, two redox active shuttle cysteines, and allosteric sites. The allosteric sites control substrate specificity and enzyme activity via binding of nucleotide triphosphates (3Reichard P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the absence of nucleotide effectors, the mammalian R1 is a 90-kDa monomer. Binding of effectors to the specificity site induces the formation of R1 dimers that interact with the R2 dimer, forming an active α2β2 complex. However, the R1 hexamer induced by ATP/dATP (4Kashlan O.B. Scott C.P. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 462-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) is suggested to form the major complex of RNR with the R2 dimer (5Rofougaran R. Vodnala M. Hofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27705-27711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In enzyme turnover, a disulfide is formed in the active site, from the catalytically active SH group of the cysteines; consequently the 2′-OH of the ribonucleoside, is replaced with a hydrogen atom (6Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). As shown in Escherichia coli RNR, which is the best characterized class I enzyme, the narrow active site cleft in R1 excludes direct reduction of the active site disulfide by external dithiol-dependent redoxins, but the mobile tail of R1 transfers reducing equivalents from C-terminally located cysteine residues (shuttle) to the active site by a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction (7Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The resulting C-terminal disulfide has to be reduced by an external thiol-dependent reductase system (8Sjoberg B.M. Sahlin M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both thioredoxin (Trx) (9Laurent T.C. Moore E.C. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3436-3444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glutaredoxin (Grx) (10Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) were discovered as dithiol electron donors of E. coli ribonucleotide reductase and are today well known multifunctional thiol-dependent redoxins in cells with catalytically active cysteine thiols in a CXXC active site (11Lillig C.H.

Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 25-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The oxidized Trx is reduced by NADPH via the flavoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), which is a selenoenzyme in mammalian cells. In contrast, the disulfide in oxidized Grx is reduced by two molecules of the monothiol GSH. The resulted GSSG in turn is reduced by NADPH and glutathione reductase (11Lillig C.H. Berndt C.

Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 25-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In E. coli the class Ia enzyme, NrdAB, which is essential for aerobic growth, requires the dithiol form of at least one of Grx1, Trx1, or Trx2 to be viable (13Gallardo-Madueno R. Leal J.F. Dorado G.

In E. coli, a balanced supply of deoxyribonucleotides is obtained by a regulatory mechanism that up-regulates the level of RNR in response to the lack of any of its two main hydrogen donors, Trx1 or GSH plus Grx1 (13Gallardo-Madueno R.

It is not known whether the electron donor system is rate-limiting for mammalian RNR activity. However, the requirements for DNA replication consuming large amounts of dNTPs during S phase and house-keeping DNA repair and mitochondrial DNA synthesis in postmitotic cells may be widely different; because the enzyme concentration and composition differs during cell cycle, and only the R1 subunit is the same (19Pontarin G.

Here we have used recombinant RNR to evaluate the kinetics of the electron donors. Our results show marked differences in mechanisms for mammalian RNR compared with the well known E. coli enzyme. Considering the amount of R1 in the assays and using R2 subunit, our system represents the S phase RNR. These data are also of general interest for understanding tumor cell growth.

Human recombinant R1 was kindly provided by Prof. Pär Nordlund from the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics (Karolinska Institute). Expression and Purification of Mouse R1 Subunit-The E. coli strain expressing R1 was kindly provided by Dr. Lars Thelander (Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden), and purification was carried out essentially as described by Davis et al. (34Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallee P. Graslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of R1 expression with 50 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was done at an A600 of 1 at a temperature of 15 °C in 20 liters of fermenter. The bacterial pellet (30 g) was dissolved in 90 ml of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 25 mm KCl) and lysed with 0.1% lysozyme. After shock freezing the bacteria in liquid nitrogen, the cell debris were pelleted. Solid ammonium sulfate to obtain 50% final saturation was added to the supernatant, and the pellet obtained after centrifugation was dissolved in 10 ml of buffer A. After desalting the solution on a Sephadex G-25 column (100 ml) with buffer A, the sample was applied to a 20-ml dATP-Sepharose column (34Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallee P. Graslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 60 ml of high salt buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 500 mm KCl) followed by 30 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. The R1 protein was eluted with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and 50 mm ATP. Protein was concentrated with Centriprep YM-30 (Amicon), and the buffer was changed to 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, l00 mm KCl on a Sephadex G-25 column. The purity of R1 was finally analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Expression and Purification of Mouse R2 Subunit-The E. coli strain expressing R2 was a kind gift from Dr. Lars Thelander, and the R2 protein was expressed and purified as described before (35Mann G.J. Graslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). After homogenizing 30 g of frozen bacteria in 90 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA), 2% streptomycin sulfate, and 0.1% lysozyme were added to the extract; the bacterial suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed once, and cell debris and nucleic acids were pelleted. Solid ammonium sulfate to 40% saturation was then added to the supernatant fraction, and the precipitate was collected. After dissolving the pellet in 6 ml of buffer B, the sample was desalted on a G-25 column. The solution was then subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a 30-ml DEAE-cellulose column (DE 52) (35Mann G.J. Graslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thereafter the protein was precipitated using 70% solid ammonium sulfate and dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by G-25 chromatography. Reactivation of the R2 was done by regenerating of the iron center and tyrosyl radical as described by Thelander and co-workers (35Mann G.J. Graslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Determination of Ribonucleotide Reductase Activity-RNR was reconstituted by mixing recombinant R1 and R2 proteins. Activity was assayed following the conversion of [3H]CDP into [3H]dCDP. The reaction was initiated by adding reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 200 μm FeCl3, and 0.5 mm [3H]CDP (∼20,000 cpm/nmol) in a final volume of 50 μl. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m HClO4 and hydrolysis to dCMP. The amount of [3H]dCMP radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting after ion exchange chromatography on Dowex-50 columns (36Engstrom Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Akerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As reductant, the indicated concentrations of DTT or human Trx1 and 0.1 μm TrxR plus 1 mm NADPH were used in separate experiments. When the Grx system was used together with RNR, the samples contained 0.1 μm GR, 1 mm NADPH, and varying amounts of GSH generally 4 mm. To avoid oxidation of GSH to GSSG, each time a new tube of frozen stock of GSH titrated to pH 7.0 was used. The activity was calculated as nmol of dCDP produced per time of incubation. Modifications to the protocol are indicated in individual table and figure legends. Insulin Disulfide Bond Reduction Activity of Thioredoxin1-Two assays were utilized to study the reduction of Trx1 with GSH. First, in a final volume of 150 μl, 10 μm Trx1 was mixed with 0.16 mm insulin, 0.5 mm NADPH, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Two samples with 4 and 10 mm GSH were monitored at A340 after adding 0.1 μm GR. A molar extinction coefficient of 6200 m–1 cm–1 was used in calculations (37Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Insulin precipitation assay was also used by recording the increase in turbidity at A650. Different concentrations of Trx1 were checked in the same buffer using 10 mm GSH. The mixture without Trx1 and GSH was set as a blank, and the basic level of NADPH consumption with adding GR was measured in the sample without Trx1. Expression and Purification of Mouse Glutaredoxin1-Oligonucleotide primers containing NdeI and BamHI restriction sites were designed to amplify the open reading frame of mouse Grx1 with polymerase chain reaction. The DNA fragment was cloned into the NdeI-BamHI sites of the pGEM-T vector (Promega). The construct was verified by DNA sequence determination. The insert was subcloned into the same restriction sites of the pET-15b vector (Novagen) to express the polyhistidine tag at the N terminus. Expression and purification was done as previously described (24Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J. Enoksson M. Jacobsson G. Ljung J. Johansson M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26269-26275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The reductase activity was checked using a hydroxyethyl disulfide assay (24Lundberg M. Johansson C.

Cell Cultures and Preparation of Cell Extracts-HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were trypsinized, spun down, and resuspended in the same volume of packed cell volume of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2 with freshly added protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was passed through five cycles of freeze-thaw; debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was heated to 75 °C in a boiling water bath. Precipitated proteins were spun down, and the supernatant was assayed. The protein concentration was quantified with Bio-Rad protein assay. Cell extracts were added to a series of tubes containing constant amount of recombinant R1 and R2. The samples were supplemented with TrxR and NADPH to couple the Trx; or GSH, NADPH, and GR to couple Grx in the extract. To compensate the oxidative environment produced by cell lysis, the amount of NADPH was raised to 3 mm. DTT served as a control. Characterization of the Mammalian RNR-We expressed and purified the recombinant mouse R1 and R2 proteins to apparent homogeneity reconstituting the tyrosyl radical in R2 (34Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallee P. Graslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mann G.J. Graslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). By mixing R1 and R2 proteins in the presence of Mg2+ ions, active RNR was formed, and CDP was reduced to dCDP in a linear reaction with DTT as electron donor during 45-min incubations (Fig. 1A). As known from previous experiments, R1 and R2 formed a weak complex, and only at high concentrations (75–150 μg/ml) of R1, activity was recorded. Increasing R1 with a fixed amount of R2 resulted in a marked cooperative-like increase in activity; this behavior was identical for all three electron donors (Fig. 1B). The specific activity for several different preparations was typically 60 and 250 nmol/min/mg for R1 and R2, respectively, measured in the presence of an excess of the other subunit, which are values similar to previously reported mammalian recombinant preparations (34Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallee P. Graslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mann G.J. Graslund A. Ochiai E. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Note that R1 has the lowest specific activity and is the apparent rate-limiting subunit consistent with its content of the shuttle disulfide and catalytic center. The weak complex of the two subunits forming active RNR makes it difficult to determine kinetic parameters and also true kcat values. As shown in Fig. 2B with a low amount of R2, which is not enough to saturate R1, the shape of the activity curve is not sigmoidal because R1 disulfides were reduced by the electron donor irrespective of whether it was free or bound to R2. However, in contrast the curve for constant R2 (Fig. 2A) is sigmoidal because R1 is the limiting subunit in the weak complex. Effect of DTT on RNR-To investigate the optimal amount of DTT for RNR activity, experiments were carried out with R1 quite similar to concentrations calculated from S phase fibroblasts of 48 μg/ml (20Hakansson P. Hofer A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7834-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The highest activity was obtained with 4–10 mm DTT (Km = 2 mm). Inhibition by higher concentrations of DTT was observed (Fig. 3A). No increase in activity was obtained by R1 prereduced with DTT. Trx1 and Grx1 as Hydrogen Donors for S Phase RNR-Enzyme activity was measured with varying concentrations of human Trx1 (0.7–6 μm) using excess TrxR and NADPH or different amounts of Grx1 (0.1–2 μm) in combination with 4 mm GSH, NADPH, and excess GR (Fig. 3, B and C). Typical apparent Km values of 1.9 and 0.18 μm were obtained for Trx1 and Grx1, respectively. With the higher concentrations of R1, the Trx activity curve showed a tendency to sigmoidal behavior probably reflecting rate-limiting reduction by low Trx. In contrast Grx activity showed no such tendency, but remarkably the apparent Vmax and corresponding kcat was much lower for Grx than for Trx. However, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was similar or 2 × 105 m–1 s–1. Because the reaction of Grx with RNR may be species specific like for E. coli RNR (29Luthman M. Eriksson S. Holmgren A. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2158-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), mouse Grx1 was expressed to determine whether that would be more active with the homologous RNR. Because there was no difference between the reaction rates with human and mouse Grx1 (data not shown), we used the human Grx1 in further experiments. Preincubation of R1 with DTT did not change the activity with either the Trx or Grx systems. This finding was in contrast to results with the E. coli RNR enzyme, which has to be freshly prereduced with DTT before assay for a Grx system to show activity (39Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3672-3678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also tested preincubation of R1 plus R2 with excess DTT followed by a Sephadex G-25 desalting step before assays. This treatment resulted in no difference in enzyme activity; nor did higher ATP (5 mm) as an allosteric effector (4Kashlan O.B. Scott C.P. Lear J.D. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 462-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All of several R1 and R2 preparations showed the low kcat with the Grx system. The same relative activity of Trx and Grx was also detected with a human R1 preparation (Table 1).TABLE 1Characterization of human R1 in reduction with Trx1 and Grx1R1Enzyme activityaEnzyme activity of 100 μg/ml human R1 with 10 mm DTT was 3.1 nmol.Trx systemGrx systemnmol of dCDP formed80 μg/ml1.180.12160 μg/ml3.400.24a Enzyme activity of 100 μg/ml human R1 with 10 mm DTT was 3.1 nmol. Open table in a new tab Combination of Trx with the Grx System for RNR Activity-To investigate whether the Trx system may activate RNR by reducing any critical disulfide bond to enable the Grx system to express higher turnover, both systems were added to the reaction mixture; no positive effect was observed, and the activity with combination of both systems was equal to the sum of their individual activities (Fig. 4). Because Trx strengthens the R1-R2 complex of E. coli RNR (40Kasrayan A. Birgander P.L. Pappalardo L. Regnstrom K. Westman M. Slaby A. Gordon E. Sjoberg B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31050-31057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we wondered whether Trx could stimulate Grx activity by making more active enzyme; therefore just Trx was added to the Grx system in an RNR assay. The data showed higher activity in the sample, which contained Grx system plus Trx (without TrxR) compared with the Grx system alone (Fig. 4). However, with insulin reduction assays, we showed that human Trx1 could catalyze the reduction of insulin disulfide bonds with high GSH and NADPH plus GR (Fig. 5). This is a consequence of a lower redox potential of human Trx (–230 mV) (41Watson W.H. Pohl J. Montfort W.R. Stuchlik O. Reed M.S. Powis G. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33408-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) compared with E. coli Trx (–270 mV) (42Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, Trx did not increase Grx activity in RNR reduction per se, but it acted directly as a dithiol by reduction with high GSH and GR. This result may explain how mammalian cells can survive without TrxR activity. Grx2 and Its Monothiol Mutant Protein Are as Active as Grx1-Mammalian Grx2 (24Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J.

https://openalex.org/W2070391037,"Cre/LoxP recombination is the gold standard for conditional gene regulation in mice in vivo. However, promoters driving the expression of Cre recombinase are often active in a wide range of cell types and therefore unsuited to target more specific subsets of cells. To overcome this limitation, we designed inactive “split-Cre” fragments that regain Cre activity when overlapping co-expression is controlled by two different promoters. Using transgenic mice and virus-mediated expression of split-Cre, we show that efficient reporter gene activation is achieved in vivo. In the brain of transgenic mice, we genetically defined a subgroup of glial progenitor cells in which the Plp1- and the Gfap-promoter are simultaneously active, giving rise to both astrocytes and NG2-positive glia. Similarly, a subset of interneurons was labelled after viral transfection using Gad67- and Cck1 promoters to express split-Cre. Thus, split-Cre mediated genomic recombination constitutes a powerful spatial and temporal coincidence detector for in vivo targeting."
https://openalex.org/W2025295270,"The ability of mucus to function as a protective barrier at mucosal surfaces rests on its viscous and elastic properties, which are not well understood at length scales relevant to pathogens and ultrafine environmental particles. Here we report that fresh, undiluted human cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) transitions from an impermeable elastic barrier to non-adhesive objects sized 1 microm and larger to a highly permeable viscoelastic liquid to non-adhesive objects smaller than 500 nm in diameter. Addition of a nonionic detergent, present in vaginal gels, lubricants and condoms, caused CVM to behave as an impermeable elastic barrier to 200 and 500 nm particles, suggesting that the dissociation of hydrophobically-bundled mucin fibers created a finer elastic mucin mesh. Surprisingly, the macroscopic viscoelasticity, which is critical to proper mucus function, was unchanged. These findings provide important insight into the nanoscale structural and barrier properties of mucus, and how the penetration of foreign particles across mucus might be inhibited."
https://openalex.org/W2071414239,"Transient receptor potential channels are a family of cation channels involved in diverse cellular functions. Most of these channels are expressed in the nervous system and play a key role in sensory physiology. TRPM8 (transient receptor potential melastatine 8), a member of this family, is activated by cold, cooling substances such menthol and icilin and voltage. Although TRPM8 is a thermosensitive channel highly expressed in cold sensory neurons, the mechanisms underlying its temperature sensitivity are still poorly understood. Here we show that, in sensory neurons, TRPM8 channel is localized in cholesterol-rich specialized membrane domains known as lipid rafts. We also show that, in heterologous expression systems, lipid raft segregation of TRPM8 is favored by glycosylation at the Asn(934) residue of the polypeptide. In electrophysiological and imaging experiments, using cold and menthol as agonists, we also demonstrate that lipid raft association modulates TRPM8 channel activity. We found that menthol- and cold-mediated responses of TRPM8 are potentiated when the lipid raft association of the channel is prevented. In addition, lipid raft disruption shifts the threshold for TRPM8 activation to a warmer temperature. In view of these data, we suggest a role for lipid rafts in the activity and temperature sensitivity of TRPM8. We propose a model wherein different lipid membrane environments affect the cold sensing properties of TRPM8, modulating the response of cold thermoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2047869666,"The mitochondria are the major intracellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are generated during cellular respiration. The role of peroxiredoxin (Prx) III, a 2-Cys Prx family member, in the scavenging of mitochondrial H(2)O(2) has recently been emphasized. While eliminating H(2)O(2), Prx can become overoxidized and inactivated by modifying the active cysteine into cysteine sulfinic acid (Cys-SO(2)H). When 2-Cys Prxs are inactivated in vitro, sulfiredoxin (Srx) reduces the cysteine sulfinic acid to cysteines. However, whereas Srx is localized in the cytoplasm, Prx III is present exclusively in the mitochondria. Although Srx reduces sulfinic Prx III in vitro, it remains unclear whether the reduction of Prx III in cells is actually mediated by Srx. Our gain- and loss-of-function experiments show that Srx is responsible for reducing not only sulfinic cytosolic Prxs (I and II) but also sulfinic mitochondrial Prx III. We further demonstrate that Srx translocates from the cytosol to mitochondria in response to oxidative stress. Overexpression of mitochondrion-targeted Srx promotes the regeneration of sulfinic Prx III and results in cellular resistance to apoptosis, with enhanced elimination of mitochondrial H(2)O(2) and decreased rates of mitochondrial membrane potential collapse. These results indicate that Srx plays a crucial role in the reactivation of sulfinic mitochondrial Prx III and that its mitochondrial translocation is critical in maintaining the balance between mitochondrial H(2)O(2) production and elimination."
https://openalex.org/W2014539578,"Protected areas are the first, and often only, line of defense in efforts to conserve biodiversity. They might be detrimental or beneficial to rural communities depending on how they alter economic opportunities and access to natural resources. As such, protected areas may attract or repel human settlement. Disproportionate increases in population growth near protected area boundaries may threaten their ability to conserve biodiversity.Using decadal population datasets, we analyze population growth across 45 countries and 304 protected areas. We find no evidence for population growth near protected areas to be greater than growth of rural areas in the same country. Furthermore, we argue that what growth does occur near protected areas likely results from a general expansion of nearby population centers.Our results contradict those from a recent study by Wittemyer et al., who claim overwhelming evidence for increased human population growth near protected areas. To understand the disagreement, we re-analyzed the protected areas in Wittemyer et al.'s paper. Their results are simply artifacts of mixing two incompatible datasets. Protected areas may experience unusual population pressures near their edges; indeed, individual case studies provide examples. There is no evidence, however, of a general pattern of disproportionate population growth near protected areas."

A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family members have often been found to be the responsible “sheddases,” ADAM17/tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme being its best characterized member. In this work, we show that ShhNp (lipidated and membrane-tethered Sonic hedgehog) is released from Bosc23 cells by metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding, resulting in a soluble and biologically active morphogen. ShhNp shedding is increased by ADAM17 coexpression and cholesterol depletion of cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin and is reduced by metalloprotease inhibitors as well as ADAM17 RNA interference. We also show that the amount of shed ShhNp is modulated by extracellular heparan sulfate (HS) and that ShhNp shedding depends on specific HS sulfations. Based on those data, we suggest new roles for metalloproteases, including but not restricted to ADAM17, and for HS-proteoglycans in Hedgehog signaling.

Establishing the molecular mechanisms that generate the Hh gradient is essential for our understanding of how the Hh signal elicits multiple responses in a temporally and spatially specific manner. The Hh spreading mechanism is especially intriguing, because all Hhs are released from the producing cells despite being synthesized as dually lipidated molecules, whereas lipid-modified peptides normally appear firmly tethered to membranes. Both in vertebrates and in Drosophila melanogaster, the Hhs are synthesized as precursor proteins consisting of the N-terminal signaling domain and a C-terminal cholesterol transferase domain. The precursor first undergoes internal cleavage between residues Gly198 and Cys199 (of murine Sonic hedgehog (Shh)) linked to the addition of a cholesteryl moiety to Gly198 of the N-terminal cleavage product (1Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). This reaction is catalyzed by the C-terminal cholesterol transferase domain through a nucleophilic substitution resembling intein-mediated protein splicing. Inteins, also called protein introns, are parts of protein sequences that are post-translationally excised, their flanking regions (exteins) being spliced together to yield an additional protein product in a self-catalyzed manner. The second lipid adduct that modifies the Hh proteins is palmitic acid, which attaches to the N-terminal cysteine residue exposed after signal peptide cleavage (2Pepinsky R.B. Zeng C. Wen D. Rayhorn P. Baker D.P. Williams K.P. Bixler S.A. Ambrose C.M. Garber E.A. Miatkowski K. Taylor F.R. Wang E.A. Galdes A. J. Biol.

The molecular mechanisms through which the lipid-modified HhNp morphogen is able to diffuse long distances are currently under intense debate, and its ability to do so has been linked to oligomer formation or co-transport with lipoprotein particles (3Panakova D. Sprong H. Marois E. Thiele C. Eaton S. Nature. 2005; 435: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 4Zeng X. Goetz J.A. Suber L.M. Scott Jr., W.J. Schreiner C.M. Robbins D.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). HhNp gradient formation also depends on the presence of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Heparan sulfate (HS) is produced by most cell types in vertebrates and invertebrates. HS biosynthesis (as well as synthesis of heparin, a highly sulfated form of HS) occurs in the Golgi compartment on proteoglycan core proteins (5Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Enzymes called the exostosins (Exts) synthesize the (GlcA1,4GlcNAc1,4)n carbohydrate backbone, which is subsequently modified by N-deacetylase/sulfotransferases, O-sulfotransferases, and a GlcA-C5 epimerase. Many growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, and morphogens bind to HS, and the HSPGs are thought to act as co-receptors for these ligands. Expression of the Drosophila Ext family of proteins, encoded by the genes tout velu (ttv), brother of tout velu, and sister of tout velu, is required for the diffusion of lipid-modified fly HhNp (6Bellaiche Y.

The glypican (a type of HSPG attached to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor) proteins Dally and Dally-like were also found to be required for fly HhNp signaling (11Han C. Belenkaya T.Y. Wang B. Lin X. Development. 2004; 131: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These data indicate that HSPGs are important for Hh function via an unknown molecular mechanism. In this work, we investigated the idea that proteolytic ShhNp “ectodomain shedding” may underlie ShhNp release. A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family members have been found to be the responsible “sheddases” for the release of membrane-associated tumor necrosis factor-α, tumor necrosis factor receptor, l-selectin, transforming growth factor-α, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, collagen XVII, CD23, epidermal growth factor, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, and Notch, among others (summarized in Refs. 12Tellier E.

Neurobiol. 2006; 79: 73-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In most cases, ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins changes their fate, location, and mode of action and thus their biological activity. However, a substrate will only be released if, at a given time point, it is co-localized with the ADAM sheddase. Release of a number of ADAM substrates like the amyloid precursor protein, CD30, interleukin-6 receptor, l-selectin, and collagen XVII was increased by cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) (14Kojro E.

Consistent with this, lipid rafts have been described as locations of ectodomain shedding mediated by ADAM17 and ADAM19 (12Tellier E. Canault M. Rebsomen L. Bonardo B. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Peiretti F. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3969-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Wakatsuki S. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and ShhNp as well as glypican HSPGs are known to localize to lipid rafts (20Rietveld A. Neutz S. Simons K. Eaton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12049-12054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the nature of these microdomains, including their size, composition, organization, and even their very existence remains highly controversial, those reports still suggested a possible link between ShhNp release, HSPGs, and ADAM-regulated ectodomain shedding. Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Shh-Shh constructs were generated from murine cDNA (NM 009170) by PCR. Secreted, lipidated ShhNp (nucleotides 1-1314, corresponding to amino acids 1-438) was generated in Bosc23 cells (a human 293T derivative, an embryonic kidney cell line routinely used for the expression of lipidated ShhNp (4Zeng X. Goetz J.A. Suber L.M. Scott Jr., W.J. Schreiner C.M. Robbins D.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar)), and secreted, unlipidated ShhN (nucleotides 1-594, corresponding to amino acid 1-198 of murine Shh) was generated in mouse melanoma B16-F1 cells and in Escherichia coli to yield high amounts of protein required for some biochemical tests. PCR products were ligated into pGEM (Promega), sequenced, and subsequently released and religated into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) for the expression of secreted, lipidated 19-kDa ShhNp in Bosc23 cells; into pcDNA3.1/myc-HisC (Invitrogen) for the expression of secreted, C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged 28-kDa ShhNHis6 (the large size due to the presence of a c-Myc and intervening cloning sequence) in B16-F1 cells; into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) for expression of N-terminally glutathione S-transferase-tagged 50-kDa GST-ShhN in E. coli; and into pWIZ-SEAP (Gene Therapy Systems) for the expression of secreted, N-terminally alkaline phosphatase-tagged 80-kDa sAP-ShhN in B16-F1 cells. To generate the soluble alkaline phosphatase-Shh fusion proteins, the N-terminal sequence of Shh (amino acids 25-198, Shh-N) was produced by PCR (sense primer, 5′-agatatcaatgtgggcccggcagggggtttg-3′; antisense primer, 5′-atctagaagccgccggatttggccgcc-3′) and ligated into pWIZ after limited HpaI and subsequent XbaI restriction of the vector and EcoRV and XbaI restriction of the PCR product, resulting in replacement of the alkaline phosphatase (AP) stop codon with the codon for ShhN C25. The biological activity of all recombinant proteins was confirmed by Shh-dependent alkaline phosphatase induction in C3H10T1/2 cells using the method described below. Human ADAM17 cDNA was obtained from the German Resource Center for Genome Research (RZPD) and cloned into pcDNA3.1/myc-HisC. ADAM17 was expressed in a hexahistidine-tagged form in B16-F1 for heparin affinity chromatography and in a nontagged, full-length form in Bosc23 cells for gain-of-function studies. To generate catalytically inactive ADAM17, the active site residue Glu406 was changed into an alanine (21Maskos K. Fernandez-Catalan C. Huber R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Ellestad G.A. Reddy P. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Castner B.J. Davis R. Clarke H.R. Petersen M. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. March C.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3408-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Cell Culture-CHO-K1 cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen), and Bosc23 and B16-F1 cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen), all supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding secreted ShhN, ShhNp, or sAP-ShhN using PolyFect (Qiagen). Cells were grown for 36 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in DMEM or serum-free DMEM for various time periods in the presence or absence of stimulators or inhibitors of shedding, followed by ultracentrifugation at 210,000 × g for 60 min to remove cell debris, including membrane-tethered ShhNp. The supernatant was then trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. Where indicated, OPTI-MEM was used for serum-free protein expression. Chondrocytes were isolated from the cranial third of 17-day-old chick embryo sterna and cultured in agarose suspension cultures under serum-free conditions in the presence of 100 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor I. N-Isobutyl-N-(4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl)-glycyl hydroxamic acid (NNGH) (Biomol) was used at 15 μm concentration; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3; >95% pure) (R&D Systems), methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and chondroitin sulfate B (Sigma) were used at 100 nm, 300 μg/ml, and 100 μg/ml respectively. 100 μg/ml dextran sulfate sodium salt (Roth), chondroitin sulfate sodium salt (Sigma), and heparin sodium salt (Serva) were also used. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was used at 200 ng/ml. Where appropriate, vehicle was used as a control (DMSO or ethanol). Protein Purification and Analysis-Proteins were resolved by 15% reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Monoclonal anti-tetrahistidine antibody (Qiagen) and anti-ShhN (polyclonal goat IgG; R&D Systems) were used for primary detection. Immunodetection of ADAM17 was conducted using monoclonal anti-human tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme/ADAM17 ectodomain antibody (R&D Systems). Visualization was performed after incubation with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (detecting anti-ShhN) and goat anti-mouse IgG (detecting anti-His4 and anti-ADAM17) followed by chemiluminescent detection (Pierce). In some cases, results from multiple experiments were pooled and signal quantification was conducted using ImageJ (available on the World Wide Web). Data were plotted as released versus cell bound ShhNp relative to the highest value obtained, which was set to 100%. Radiolabeling was conducted as described in Ref. 4Zeng X. Goetz J.A. Suber L.M. Scott Jr., W.J. Schreiner C.M. Robbins D.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar. Briefly, 0.1 mCi of [1α,2α-3H]cholesterol or 1 mCi of [9,19-3H]palmitic acid was added to Shh-transfected Bosc23 cells cultured in 35-mm dishes for 40 h or to insulin-like growth factor I-stimulated chondrocytes grown for 13 days in high density suspension culture under serum-free conditions for the last 6 days. For [3H]cholesterol detection, media were harvested and subjected to ultracentrifugation and trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and cells were directly lysed in SDS-sample buffer. [3H]Palmitic acid-labeled cells and media were additionally subjected to heparin-Sepharose pull-down to improve the signal/noise ratio. After SDS-PAGE, gels were dried and autoradiographed or immunoblotted. For N-terminal sequencing of processed ShhN, recombinant GST-ShhN was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (Äkta protein purifier; Amersham Biosciences) using glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B columns (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Eluted fractions were added to B16-F1-conditioned, serum-free medium, incubated overnight at 37 °C, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred by semidry blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by using 10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol (pH 11), washed, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. A 19-kDa protein band was excised, and microsequencing was performed using a Procise protein sequencer connected to an online phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer (PerkinElmer Biosystems). Gel filtration analysis was performed by fast protein liquid chromatography (Äkta Protein Purifier (Amersham Biosciences)) using a Superdex200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Eluted fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. To determine heparin binding properties of ShhN and ADAM17, the supernatant of ShhN- and ADAM17-transfected B16/F1 cells was subjected to heparin affinity chromatography (Äkta protein purifier) using heparin-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Proteins were applied to the columns in the absence of salt, and bound material was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 m in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0). Fractions were precipitated, and eluted proteins were detected immunohistochemically. ADAM-RNA Interference (RNAi) Using shRNAs-RNAi was used to specifically knock down ADAM17 (AAI46659) expression in Bosc23 cells. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were expressed from short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) using the MISSION™ shRNA (Sigma) plasmids TRCN0000052168 to TRCN0000052172. Cells were co-transfected with plasmid encoding ShhNp cDNA and shRNA plasmids or empty control plasmid, and transfected cells were enriched by the addition of 5 μg/ml puromycin for 30 h before starting the assay. In addition, to confirm findings obtained by shRNAi, ADAM17 was knocked down in ShhNp-expressing Bosc23 cells by using 5 nmol of On-Target plus anti-human ADAM17 pooled siRNA (Dharmacon) using the siGENOME nontargeting siRNA pool as a control. In all experiments, the amount of ShhNp released into the medium was quantified using ImageJ. Data were plotted as released versus cell-bound ShhNp relative to the value obtained with the empty vector control, which was set to 100%. Statistical analysis was performed in Excel using Student's t test (two-tailed, unpaired). All values shown throughout are ±S.D. To assess the effectiveness of ADAM knockdown, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of ADAM17 and glypican 1 (Glp1) expression in Bosc23 cells transfected with pooled siRNAs specifically interfering with ADAM17 mRNA was conducted. PCR products were quantified using ImageJ, and their relative intensities were calculated. Semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed a 60% reduction in ADAM17 mRNA levels in Bosc23 cells cotransfected with five pooled shRNAs specific for the protease. As a control, glypican 1 mRNA levels were not affected by ADAM17-specific mRNA knockdown. Analysis of mRNA Expression-RT-PCR analysis of ADAM expression in Bosc23 cells and chondrocytes was conducted following RNA isolation using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated using the First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions and subsequently used as a PCR template. Preparation and Analysis of Tissue HS-Tissues or cultured cells were digested overnight with 2 mg/ml Pronase in 320 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) at 40 °C, diluted 1:3 in water, and applied to 2.5-ml DEAE-Sephacel columns. For disaccharide analysis, proteins attached to the glycosaminoglycans were β-eliminated at 4 °C (0.5 m NaOH, 1 MNaBH4) overnight, neutralized with acetic acid, and applied to a PD-10 (Sephadex G25) column (Amersham Biosciences). Glycosaminoglycans were lyophilized, purified on DEAE, as described above, applied to a PD-10 column, and lyophilized. The samples were then digested using heparin lyases I, II, and III (IBEX), and the resulting disaccharides were separated from undigested chondroitin sulfate using a 3-kDa spin column (Centricon), followed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis using Carbopac PA1 columns (Dionex), using disaccharide mixtures as standards. Differentiation of C3H10T1/2 Osteoblast Precursor Cells-40 h post-transfection, ShhNp- and mock-transfected BOSC23 cells were stimulated for 30 min with 300 μg/ml methyl-β-cyclodextrin in serum-free DMEM. After MβCD stimulation, the supernatant was discarded, and fresh DMEM without MβCD was added for 2 h and subsequently used for C3H10T1/2 cell differentiation to avoid nonspecific effects in the assays. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were first immunoblotted to check for protein release before being used in the subsequent assays. Conditioned media were sterile filtered, mixed with DMEM containing 2× fetal calf serum and antibiotics, and applied to C3H10T1/2 cells in 15-mm plates. To some samples, 2.5 μm cyclopamine, a specific inhibitor of Shh signaling, and ShhN-neutralizing antibody 5E1 (22Ericson J. Morton S. Kawakami A. Roelink H. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) were added. Cells were lysed 5 days after induction (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), and AP activity was measured at 405 nm after the addition of 120 mm p-nitrophenol phosphate (Sigma) in 0.1 m glycine buffer, pH 10.4. Background differentiation in the absence of exogenous Shh was subtracted. Assays were performed in triplicate. Stimulation and Inhibition of ShhNp Release from Producing Cells-To evaluate Shh release from producing cells, we expressed recombinant murine full-length Shh cDNA, resulting in autoprocessed ShhNp, and constructs encoding Shh amino acids 1-198, resulting in ShhN (Fig. 1, A-D). Gel filtration analysis of media following 2 days of protein expression showed that ShhN as well as C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged ShhNHis6 were monomeric in solution, confirming that both forms were produced in the nonlipidated form (Fig. 1E). In contrast, ShhNp formed large multimers, consistent with previous reports that suggested that ShhNp is produced in a dually lipidated form (23Feng J. White B. Tyurina O.V. Guner B. Larson T. Lee H.Y. Karlstrom R.O. Kohtz J.D. Development. 2004; 131: 4357-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We next analyzed cell-associated and -released morphogens by immunoblot analysis. 40 h after Bosc23 cells were transfected with full-length Shh cDNA or constructs encoding ShhN, normal medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM. After 2 h, serum-free DMEM was harvested and ultracentrifuged in this and all further experiments to rule out the possibility that the soluble morphogen was only bound to membranous remnants. The supernatant was then trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and cells were directly lysed in SDS sample buffer. As previously reported (4Zeng X. Goetz J.A. Suber L.M. Scott Jr., W.J. Schreiner C.M. Robbins D.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), we found that ShhN was efficiently secreted into the medium (Fig. 2A), whereas most of the processed, lipid-modified form remained cell-associated (Fig. 2B). However, treatment of ShhNp-expressing cells with 0.3 mg/ml MβCD, a cyclic oligosaccharide that extracts and depletes cholesterol from living cells, strongly increased the amount of soluble ShhNp (Fig. 2C). MβCD-mediated ShhNp release was concentration-dependent and time-dependent (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2MβCD induces ShhNp release from Bosc23 cells. 40 h after Bosc23 cells were transfected with Shh cDNA or mock-transfected, cells were washed, and serum-free DMEM was added. After 2 h, the medium was harvested and subjected to ultracentrifugation and trichloroacetic acid precipitation, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. A, unlipidated ShhN is efficiently secreted into the medium (m), whereas no signal is detected in mock (empty vector control)-transfected cell lysate (cl) and medium, confirming α-ShhN antibody specificity. B, lipidated ShhNp is not released into the medium. Again, no signal is detected in mock-transfected cells and medium. C, 40 h after Bosc23 cells were transfected with full-length Shh cDNA, cells were washed, and serum-free DMEM with or without 300 μg/ml MβCD was added. After 2 h, the medium was harvested and subjected to ultracentrifugation and trichloroacetic acid precipitation, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using α-ShhN antibodies. MβCD induced the release of soluble 19-kDa ShhNp into the medium (top). Cellular ShhNp expression levels are shown in the bottom. nt, Shh-transfected, DMEM only; mock, empty vector control. D, MβCD-induced ShhNp release is concentration- and time-dependent. ShhNp-expressing Bosc23 cells were treated with increasing MβCD concentrations ranging from 1 to 900 μg/ml DMEM (left), or ShhNp release over time was monitored following stimulation with 300 μg/ml MβCD (right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate biological activity of MβCD-released ShhNp, we took advantage of a sensitive cell-based bioassay for Shh, the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 osteoblast precursor cells (24Nakamura T. Aikawa T. Iwamoto-Enomoto M. Iwamoto M. Higuchi Y. Pacifici M. Kinto N. Yamaguchi A. Noji S. Kurisu K. Matsuya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, ShhNp-conditioned media induced C3H10T1/2 differentiation into AP-producing osteoblasts, demonstrating biological activity of the MβCD-released morphogen. In contrast, media obtained from transfected cells without MβCD treatment did not show biological activity (left bar). To verify that this activity was due to ShhNp, we used the teratogen cyclopamine (25Cooper M.K. Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1603-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) and the ShhN-neutralizing antibody 5E1 (22Ericson J. Morton S. Kawakami A. Roelink H. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) as specific Hh inhibitors during C3H10T1/2 differentiation. As expected, the biological activity of ShhNp conditioned medium was completely inhibited by cyclopamine cotreatment (p ≤ 0.001, n = 4) and strongly inhibited by 5E1 cotreatment (p ≤ 0.001, n = 4). Ultracentrifugation of media prior to trichloroacetic acid precipitation was always carried out to derive soluble forms of ShhNp and no unreleased forms bound to membranous remnants or detached cells. Additionally, to demonstrate that soluble ShhNp was not simply MβCD-extracted from the producing cell, we compared the molecular sizes of cell-bound and released ShhNp. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed increased electrophoretic mobility of MβCD-released ShhNp if compared with the cell-tethered morphogen (Fig. 4A), suggesting proteolytic processing underlying ShhNp release. Because a ShhN zinc-coordinating site structurally analogous to the active site of zinc hydrolases, such as thermolysin and carboxypeptidase A, had been described (26Hall T.M. Porter J.A. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that ShhNp autocleavage may have underlay the observed processing of terminal peptides and release of the morphogen. To test this idea, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid Glu177 predicted to be essential for enzymatic activity (26Hall T.M. Porter J.A. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27Day E.S. Wen D. Garber E.A. Hong J. Avedissian L.S. Rayhorn P. Shen W. Zeng C. Bailey V.R. Reilly J.O. Roden J.A. Moore C.B.

However, this did not affect ShhNpE177A release into the medium (Fig. 4B), ruling out autoproteolysis as the underlying release mechanism. We thus tested the ability of extracellular metalloproteases to mediate ShhNp release into the medium. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed levels of soluble ShhNp (Fig. 4C, top) and corresponding ShhNp expression (Fig. 4C, bottom) in the presence of two metalloprotease inhibitors. In MβCD-treated Bosc23 cells, ShhNp release was indeed reduced by 15 μm NNGH, a specific inhibitor directed against metalloproteases, and was almost completely abolished by 100 nm TIMP-3, which is effective against the metalloproteases ADAM10, ADAM17, and ADAM28, among other metalloproteases.

https://openalex.org/W2023174704,"Background MAGEL2 is one of several genes typically inactivated in the developmental obesity disorder Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). The physiological consequences of loss of MAGEL2, but without the concurrent loss of other PWS genes, are not well understood. Gene-targeted mutation of Magel2 in mice disrupts circadian rhythm and metabolism causing reduced total activity, reduced weight gain before weaning, and increased adiposity after weaning. Principal Findings We now show that loss of Magel2 in mice causes reduced fertility in both males and females through extended breeding intervals and early reproductive decline and termination. Female Magel2-null mice display extended and irregular estrous cycles, while males show decreased testosterone levels, and reduced olfactory preference for female odors. Conclusions Our results suggest that loss of MAGEL2 contributes to the reproductive deficits seen in people with PWS, and further highlights the role of normal circadian rhythm in the maintenance of fertility."
https://openalex.org/W1992891836,"Sodium channels are fundamental signaling molecules in excitable cells, and are molecular targets for local anesthetic agents and intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). Two regions of NaV1.5 have been identified previously as [Ca2+]i-sensitive modulators of channel inactivation. These include a C-terminal IQ motif that binds calmodulin (CaM) in different modes depending on Ca2+ levels, and an immediately adjacent C-terminal EF-hand domain that directly binds Ca2+. Here we show that a mutation of the IQ domain (A1924T; Brugada Syndrome) that reduces CaM binding stabilizes NaV1.5 inactivation, similarly and more extensively than even reducing [Ca2+]i. Because the DIII-DIV linker is an essential structure in NaV1.5 inactivation, we evaluated this domain for a potential CaM binding interaction. We identified a novel CaM binding site within the linker, validated its interaction with CaM by NMR spectroscopy, and revealed its micromolar affinity by isothermal titration calorimetry. Mutation of three consecutive hydrophobic residues (Phe1520-Ile1521-Phe1522) to alanines in this CaM-binding domain recapitulated the electrophysiology phenotype observed with mutation of the C-terminal IQ domain: NaV1.5 inactivation was stabilized; moreover, mutations of either CaM-binding domain abolish the well described stabilization of inactivation by lidocaine. The direct physical interaction of CaM with the C-terminal IQ domain and the DIII-DIV linker, combined with the similarity in phenotypes when CaM-binding sites in either domain are mutated, suggests these cytoplasmic structures could be functionally coupled through the action of CaM. These findings have bearing upon Na+ channel function in genetically altered channels and under pathophysiologic conditions where [Ca2+]i impacts cardiac conduction. Sodium channels are fundamental signaling molecules in excitable cells, and are molecular targets for local anesthetic agents and intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). Two regions of NaV1.5 have been identified previously as [Ca2+]i-sensitive modulators of channel inactivation. These include a C-terminal IQ motif that binds calmodulin (CaM) in different modes depending on Ca2+ levels, and an immediately adjacent C-terminal EF-hand domain that directly binds Ca2+. Here we show that a mutation of the IQ domain (A1924T; Brugada Syndrome) that reduces CaM binding stabilizes NaV1.5 inactivation, similarly and more extensively than even reducing [Ca2+]i. Because the DIII-DIV linker is an essential structure in NaV1.5 inactivation, we evaluated this domain for a potential CaM binding interaction. We identified a novel CaM binding site within the linker, validated its interaction with CaM by NMR spectroscopy, and revealed its micromolar affinity by isothermal titration calorimetry. Mutation of three consecutive hydrophobic residues (Phe1520-Ile1521-Phe1522) to alanines in this CaM-binding domain recapitulated the electrophysiology phenotype observed with mutation of the C-terminal IQ domain: NaV1.5 inactivation was stabilized; moreover, mutations of either CaM-binding domain abolish the well described stabilization of inactivation by lidocaine.

These findings have bearing upon Na+ channel function in genetically altered channels and under pathophysiologic conditions where [Ca2+]i impacts cardiac conduction. Voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channels underlie the rapid upstroke and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells and are therefore important targets for drug therapy in disorders of the nervous system as well as muscle. The cardiac Na+ channel (NaV1.5, SCN5A) is the primary molecular species generating cardiac rhythm and has been implicated in various forms of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (1Viswanathan P.C. Balser J.R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, the effects of mutations within two CaM-binding domains, one in the NaV1.5 C terminus, and one in the DIII-DIV linker (see schematic, Fig. 3B) were studied in low or high [Ca2+] by comparing steady-state availability of mutants to wild-type (WT) 2The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; LA, local anesthetics; CaM, calmodulin; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; t-BHP, t-butyl hydroperoxide; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. NaV1.5. The availability of both variants is greatly influenced by [Ca2+]i, and involves channel structures that are important in channel inactivation. Inactivation, a highly voltage-dependent conformational change elicited by depolarization, truncates the duration of channel opening and terminates Na+ conduction. Site-directed mutagenesis of cloned Na+ channel isoforms has shown that the cytoplasmic linker between homologous domains III and IV (DIII-DIV linker, see Fig. 3B) is a crucial component of the channel inactivation machinery (2Stuhmer W.

Non-conservative mutation of DIII-DIV linker amino acid residues disrupts inactivation; however, this disruption is partly repaired by addition of local anesthetics (LA) (4Balser J.R. Nuss H.B. Orias D.W. Johns D.C. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. Lawrence J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2874-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The action of LA molecules on NaV1.5 hinges critically upon transitions among distinct conformational states (2Stuhmer W. Conti F. Suzuki H. Wang X.D. Noda M. Yahagi N. Kubo H. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 3West J.W. Patton D.E. Scheuer T. Wang Y. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

LA compounds “stabilize” Na+ channel inactivation through an allosteric effector mechanism, i.e. they shift the conformational state equilibrium from rested to inactivated states (4Balser J.R.

Finally, a number of mutations in the Na+ channel C terminus also modulate both inactivation and LA action, suggesting the C terminus functionally interacts with the DIII-DIV linker during inactivation (5Mantegazza M.

The Brugada syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, has been attributed to alterations in Na+ channel function arising from mutations in NaV1.5 (7Brugada P. Brugada J. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1992; 20: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2693) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of recombinant Na+ channels that carry these mutations, particularly those in the C terminus (8Tan H.L. Kupershmidt S. Zhang R. Stepanovic S. Roden D.M. Wilde A.A. Anderson M.E.

Intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) fluctuates as a function of excitation-contraction coupling, and when cells are subjected to ischemia or traumatic injury (11Opie L.H. Clusin W.T. Annu. Rev. Med. 1990; 41: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). NaV1.5 exhibits sensitivity to [Ca2+]i in a complex manner through the dual action of an “IQ-type” calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain in the C terminus (8Tan H.L. Kupershmidt S. Zhang R. Stepanovic S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 45004-45012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This domain exhibits multiple CaM binding modes, which are influenced by [Ca2+]i (14Shah V.N. Wingo T.L. Weiss K.L. Williams C.K. Balser J.R. Chazin W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3592-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), as well as an interaction with a C-terminal EF-hand domain that directly binds the IQ domain (15Wingo T.L. Shah V.N. Anderson M.E. Lybrand T.P. Chazin W.J. Balser J.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In conditions where [Ca2+]i is elevated, interaction between the EF-hand and the IQ domain “destabilizes” channel inactivation, i.e. reduces the likelihood channels will occupy the inactivated state at the resting membrane potential (14Shah V.N. Wingo T.L. Weiss K.L. Williams C.K. Balser J.R. Chazin W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3592-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Hence, the effects of increasing [Ca2+]i on Na+ channel inactivation are opposite to those of LA drugs. Using varying [Ca2+]i and LA as molecular probes, we show here that CaM binding to specific domains within the C terminus and DIII-DIV linker both influence inactivation of NaV1.5. Patch-clamp studies revealed that the effects of lowering [Ca2+]i can be reproduced by site-directed mutagenesis in the C-terminal IQ domain. We also used NMR to show a direct interaction between CaM and the DIII-DIV linker, and sequence analysis and isothermal calorimetry revealed an embedded high affinity CaM-binding domain in the linker region. Mutation within this site, like the IQ domain, recapitulated the effects of lowering [Ca2+]i and abolished the stabilization of inactivation by LA in patch clamp experiments, suggesting the C-terminal and DIII-DIV linker CaM-binding domains may be functionally coupled. These results provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms that modulate inactivation through Ca2+-regulated CaM binding to the NaV1.5 C terminus and DIII-DIV linker. CaM interaction with the inactivation mechanism of NaV1.5 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for conditions caused by sodium channel dysfunction in the heart and brain. Plasmid Construction, Cell Culture, and Transfection-Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on SCN5A cDNA subcloned into GFP-IRES vector for the bicistronic expression of the channel protein and green fluorescent protein, as described previously (16Tan H.L. Bink-Boelkens M.T. Bezzina C.R. Viswanathan P.C. Beaufort-Krol G.C. van Tintelen P.J. van den Berg M.P. Wilde A.A. Balser J.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Mutation sites and the whole gene sequence were verified by resequencing. Cultured cells (tsA201) were transiently transfected with 1.5 μg of either wild type or mutant (A1924T) cDNA. Green fluorescent cells were selected for electrophysiological analysis 24 h later. The cells were maintained in tissue culture dishes using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Electrophysiology-INa was recorded at 22 °C and analyzed as described (16Tan H.L. Bink-Boelkens M.T. Bezzina C.R. Viswanathan P.C. Beaufort-Krol G.C. van Tintelen P.J. van den Berg M.P. Wilde A.A. Balser J.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The voltage-clamp protocols used are shown in Fig. 1. A Boltzmann function (I = 1/[1 + exp(Vt - V½)/δ)]) was fitted to the availability curves to determine the membrane potential eliciting half-maximal inactivation (V½), where δ is the slope factor. The pipette solution used to approximate zero [Ca2+]i contained (in mm): 10 sodium fluoride, 100 caesium fluoride, 20 CsCl, 20 BAPTA, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.35 with CsOH. For high [Ca2+]i (1 μm free Ca2+), 1 mm BAPTA was used with 0.9 mm Ca2+. The extracellular (bath) recording solution contained (in mm): 145 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 1.8 CaCl2, adjusted to pH 7.35 with CsOH. To avoid the time-dependent shift of the INa availability curve commonly observed during patch clamp experiments, voltage-dependent inactivation was assessed within 2 min after rupture of the membrane. Due to this experimental set-up, we did not attempt to compare conditions with and without lidocaine in the same cell, and instead utilized cell-to-cell comparisons. Patch clamp measurements are presented as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons were made using Student’s t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Protein Production and Purification-The DIII-DIV linker (Asp1471-Asp1523) was expressed from pET15b constructs in BL21(DE3) strain cells at 37 °C in LB media. After centrifugation, cells pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (lysis buffer). The cells were lysed by sonication and concentrated. Filtered cell lysate was loaded onto a Ni2+-affinity column equilibrated with lysis buffer, washed, and the protein was eluted with a gradient of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 300 mm imidazole. The protein was cleaved from the His tag using thrombin, then purified over a second Ni2+ column. A final purification step involved ion exchange chromatography, with the protein eluted in a gradient from lysis buffer into 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 m NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. CaM was subcloned into the in-house pBG100 vector, which expresses the native protein of interest. CaM was expressed in BL21(DE3) host cells at 37 °C in LB media or M9 media supplemented with 15NH4Cl for 15N labeling. The protein was purified over a phenyl-Sepharose column (17Vogel H.J. Lindhal L. Thulin E. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 241-246Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CaM concentration was determined by A276, using an extinction coefficient of ∈ = 3,006 m-1 cm-1. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance-15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra were recorded at 37 °C on a 500 MHz Bruker AVANCE spectrometer equipped with a cryoProbe. CaM and the DIII-DIV linker were dialyzed against 5 mm MES, 10 mm BisTris (pH 6.5), 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm NaN3. NMR titrations were performed in a solution of 200 μm 15N-CaM, adding increasing amounts of DIII-DIV linker to final concentrations of 50, 100, 200, and 400 μm. Chemical shifts deposited for CaM in the BioMagResBank (code 6541) (18Kainosho M. Torizawa T. Iwashita Y. Terauchi T. Mei O.A. Guntert P. Nature. 2006; 440: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) were used for resonance assignments. Spectra were processed using NMRPipe (19Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and analyzed with Sparky (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco, CA). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry-ITC measurements were carried out with a VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA). Titration experiments were performed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm CaCl2. Protein and peptide were dialyzed against this buffer. DIII-DIV or peptide fragments at 42-62 μm in the calorimetric cell was titrated by a series of injections of CaM (649-795 μm). The binding isotherms, ΔH versus molar ratio, were analyzed with a single-site binding model using MicroCal Origin software. The association constant, ka was directly obtained from the fit to the data points and converted to the dissociation constant Kd (Kd = 1/ka). Peptide Synthesis-Peptides were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys. Peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by mass spectrometry to confirm purity and molecular weight. C-terminal Ca2+-sensing Domains Mediate Responses to [Ca2+]1, CaM, and LA in an Interdependent Fashion-Whole cell Na+ current (INa) was recorded in voltage-clamped tsA201 (HEK) cells transiently transfected with WT NaV1.5 cDNA. Voltage-dependent inactivation was assessed by plotting INa during an activating pulse to -20 mV (Fig. 1A) as a function of the preceding membrane potential. The voltage-dependent availability curves reflect the fraction of channels available to open and thus the proportion of channels not inactivated at each membrane potential. A right shift in the curve indicates a larger number of channels available to open at any given voltage, whereas a left shift indicates the opposite. Brief clamp pulses of 50 ms were utilized to exclude slowly developing inactivation processes that involve extracellular domains (20Ong B.H. Tomaselli G.F. Balser J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A demonstrates that the likelihood of voltage-dependent inactivation of NaV1.5 is reduced at any given voltage by increasing [Ca2+]i, as such, the availability of channels to open is enhanced (14Shah V.N. Wingo T.L. Weiss K.L. Williams C.K. Balser J.R. Chazin W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3592-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Wingo T.L. Shah V.N. Anderson M.E. Lybrand T.P. Chazin W.J. Balser J.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Hence, in elevated (1 μm free) [Ca2+]i, INa is increased when elicited from a voltage near the cardiac cell resting potential (compare -80 mV small traces, Fig. 1B). At this [Ca2+]i, lidocaine had an opposing effect, left-shifting the voltage-dependent inactivation curve of NaV1.5. This classic effect of the LA reduces NaV1.5 channel availability and INa at voltages near the cell resting potential (Fig. 1B), consistent with a stabilizing effect on inactivation (21Kambouris N.G.

Table 1 provides statistical comparisons of the voltage at which channels studied in various conditions are 50% inactivated (V½).TABLE 1Effects of [Ca2+]i and lidocaine on the V½ of steady-state inactivation for NaV 1.5WTA1924TFIF/AAA1 μm Ca2+−71.3 ± 0.9 mV−74.7 ± 1.9 mV−73.7 ± 1.0 mV1 μm Ca2+ + lidocaine−79.6 ± 1.7 mVap < 0.05 versus same condition without lidocaine.−75.4 ± 1.4 mVbp = NS versus same condition without lidocaine.−74.1 ± 0.6 mVbp = NS versus same condition without lidocaine.20 mm BAPTA−79.6 ± 1.0 mVcp < 0.05 versus same condition as in 1 μm Ca2+.−87.4 ± 1.2 mVcp < 0.05 versus same condition as in 1 μm Ca2+.,dp < 0.05 versus WT + 20 mm BAPTA.−85.9 ± 0.9 mVcp < 0.05 versus same condition as in 1 μm Ca2+.,dp < 0.05 versus WT + 20 mm BAPTA.20 mm BAPTA + lidocaine−83.0 ± 0.8 mVap < 0.05 versus same condition without lidocaine.,cp < 0.05 versus same condition as in 1 μm Ca2+.−85.5 ± 1.5 mVbp = NS versus same condition without lidocaine.,cp < 0.05 versus same condition as in 1 μm Ca2+.a p < 0.05 versus same condition without lidocaine.b p = NS versus same condition without lidocaine.c p < 0.05 versus same condition as in 1 μm Ca2+.d p < 0.05 versus WT + 20 mm BAPTA. Open table in a new tab Remarkably, when [Ca2+]i was clamped to low-nanomolar concentrations using 20 mm BAPTA, we found that the lidocaine-induced left-shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation was greatly reduced (Fig. 1A), suggesting that sensitivity of NaV1.5 inactivation to LA and Ca2+-CaM are interdependent (compare open symbols to filled triangles, Fig. 1A). Neither changing [Ca2+]i nor exposure to lidocaine altered the rate of NaV1.5 inactivation (Fig. 1B; time constants for INa decay provided in legend). Furthermore, use-dependent lidocaine action linked to kinetically slower inactivation processes (20Ong B.H. Tomaselli G.F. Balser J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Fukuda K. Davies S.S. Nakajima T. Ong B.H. Kupershmidt S. Fessel J. Amarnath V. Anderson M.E. Boyden P.A. Viswanathan P.C. Roberts L.J. Balser J.R. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1262-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was not altered by changing [Ca2+]i (10 Hz pulse train, Fig. 1C), suggesting the effects of [Ca2+]i are specific for the voltage dependence of the fast, primary inactivation process. Stabilization of fast inactivation through lidocaine action largely involves cytoplasmic structures such as the C terminus and interdomain linkers, and is manifest as an equilibrium shift with more channels inactivating from closed, rested states (6Viswanathan P.C. Bezzina C.R. George Jr., A.L. Roden D.M. Wilde A.A. Balser J.R. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, the development of use-dependent block (Fig. 1C) has a distinctive pharmacology and structural relationships involving the amino acid residues lining the outer pore (20Ong B.H. Tomaselli G.F. Balser J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Na+ channel variant A1924T, isolated from a Brugada syndrome patient exhibiting the attendant diagnostic changes in the surface electrocardiogram, resides in the C-terminal IQ domain of NaV1.5 and reduces the CaM affinity of the IQ motif 10-fold (14Shah V.N. Wingo T.L. Weiss K.L. Williams C.K. Balser J.R. Chazin W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3592-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To probe whether the effect of changing [Ca2+]i is mediated through CaM binding to NaV1.5, we examined A1924T in varying Ca2+ and lidocaine conditions. As shown in Fig. 2A and Table 1, in low [Ca2+]i the V½ of inactivation for WT shifts to the left (compare open and filled circles). The V½ of inactivation for the A1924T mutant also shifts to the left in response to lowering [Ca2+]i (compare filled and open triangles), indicating that Ca2+ responsiveness of the EF-hand motif is intact. However, the A1924T mutant experiences a left-shift that goes beyond what is observed for WT (compare open circles and triangles; see also Table 1). This “super-shift” suggests that in WT channels, and in low [Ca2+]i, CaM binding plays an important role in limiting the development of inactivation. In high [Ca2+]i the mutant and WT channels have nearly identical voltage-dependent inactivation profiles, and the kinetics of the mutant channel are also not changed (see Fig. 2B, insets). Moreover, the voltage dependence of A1924T inactivation was no longer sensitive to lidocaine, even at high [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2, B and D, and Table 1). As summarized in Fig. 2D, the voltage dependence of A1924T inactivation was remarkably insensitive to lidocaine (concentrations up to 2 mm were tested). In contrast, the dose dependence of use-dependent block of A1924T was indistinguishable from WT (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that CaM binding to the IQ domain in low Ca2+ is key to controlling fast inactivation. Given that [Ca2+]i regulates CaM binding to the IQ domain (14Shah V.N. Wingo T.L. Weiss K.L. Williams C.K. Balser J.R. Chazin W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3592-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we conclude that the functional effects of CaM binding to the C-terminal IQ domain are influenced by [Ca2+]i, and involve inactivation structures that are also responsive to LA. Although these results suggest that CaM binding influences LA action on inactivation, a potential alternative explanation is that A1924T modifies LA affinity for the rested (closed) state. We measured the effects of lidocaine on INa under conditions where inactivation would be negligible, by holding the membrane at -120 mV. At this potential, inhibition by lidocaine should solely be a function of resting state affinity. Under these conditions, lidocaine block of WT and A1924T were identical (percent inhibition of peak current measured at -20 mV using 300 μm lidocaine was 41 ± 2 and 38 ± 7%, n = 5, p = NS, respectively), indicating that the rested state affinity was not altered in the mutant. A CaM-binding Domain in the DIII-DIV Linker Has Corresponding Effects on Inactivation Gating-Although the C-terminal region is involved in regulation of inactivation by CaM, the DIII-DIV linker is the primary structure responsible for Na+ channel fast inactivation. In addition, the DIII-DIV linker has recently been implicated as a site for CaM interaction (13Kim J. Ghosh S. Liu H. Tateyama M. Kass R.S. Pitt G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45004-45012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 14Shah V.N. Wingo T.L. Weiss K.L. Williams C.K. Balser J.R. Chazin W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 2004; 123: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been proposed that CaM is required to stabilize the interaction of the C terminus with the DIII-DIV linker (13Kim J. Ghosh S. Liu H. Tateyama M. Kass R.S. Pitt G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45004-45012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a direct role for CaM in modulating the action of the DIII-DIV linker in the inactivation of NaV1.5. To test for direct physical interaction, NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis was performed using 15N-enriched CaM. Fig. 4A shows an overlay of 15N-1H HSQC spectra acquired for ∼200 μm Ca2+-loaded CaM with concentrations up to ∼400 μm DIII-DIV linker added to the solution. The highlighted region of the spectrum shown in the figure was selected to show perturbed resonances in the well resolved downfield region of the spectrum. The observation of a change in an NMR signal over the course of the titration is an extremely sensitive reporter on inter-molecular interactions and structural perturbations. Hence, these data demonstrate the existence of a direct physical interaction between CaM and the DIII-DIV linker. There are almost no differences in the NMR spectrum with ∼200 and ∼400 μm DIII-DIV linker added, which indicates that the titration is complete at a 1:1 ratio. Note that only a subset of the NMR signals is affected throughout the course of titration, which indicates a specific binding event is being monitored. To quantify the affinity of Ca2+-loaded CaM for the DIII-DIV linker, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to measure heat evolution over the course of a titration (Fig. 4B). Fitting of the data to the standard binding equation provided a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.6 μm and a stoichiometry of 1. To search for the CaM binding site in the DIII-DIV linker, the sequence of NaV1.5 was analyzed using the Calmodulin Target Data base (25Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). A CaM-binding domain was predicted at the C-terminal end of the DIII-DIV linker just as it re-enters the membrane (Fig. 3A, shaded gray). To validate this prediction, a corresponding 21-residue peptide was synthesized and its affinity for Ca2+-bound CaM was measured using ITC (Fig. 4C). Fitting of this data to a standard single site binding equation provides a Kd of 8.2 μm. To further localize the determinants of this interaction, specific mutations were introduced into the CaM-binding domain within the DIII-DIV linker. Interaction between CaM and its binding partners is often mediated by hydrophobic interactions (25Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Of particular note in the DIII-DIV CaM-binding domain are three consecutive hydrophobic residues (Phe1520-Ile1521-Phe1522) (Fig. 3, underlined residues). Mutations of these residues to alanines (FIF/AAA) were found to decrease the affinity of the CaM-binding domain peptide ∼10-fold; an ITC experiment performed under identical conditions to that used for the wild-type peptide gave a Kd of 66 μm (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that the FIF motif plays a significant role in mediating the interaction between CaM and the DIII-DIV linker of NaV1.5. To test the functional importance of the CaM-binding domain within the DIII-DIV linker, the FIF/AAA mutations were engineered into NaV1.5 and the behavior of the WT and mutant constructs were compared. As shown in Fig. 2A and Table 1, in elevated [Ca2+]i the voltage-dependent inactivation of the FIF/AAA channel was indistinguishable from WT or A1924T. Furthermore, like WT or A1924T, FIF/AAA displays the typical left-shift in the inactivation curve when [Ca2+]i is lowered (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Importantly, as we observed for A1924"
https://openalex.org/W2052473333,"Focal adhesions (FAs) are specialized membrane-associated multi-protein complexes that link the cell to the extracellular matrix and play crucial roles in cell-matrix sensing. Considerable information is available on the complex molecular composition of these sites, yet the regulation of FA dynamics is largely unknown. Based on a combination of FRAP studies in live cells, with in silico simulations and mathematical modeling, we show that the FA plaque proteins paxillin and vinculin exist in four dynamic states: an immobile FA-bound fraction, an FA-associated fraction undergoing exchange, a juxtamembrane fraction experiencing attenuated diffusion, and a fast-diffusing cytoplasmic pool. The juxtamembrane region surrounding FAs displays a gradient of FA plaque proteins with respect to both concentration and dynamics. Based on these findings, we propose a new model for the regulation of FA dynamics in which this juxtamembrane domain acts as an intermediary layer, enabling an efficient regulation of FA formation and reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W2024030576,"While neural systems are known to respond to chemical and electrical stimulation, the effect of mechanics on these highly sensitive cells is still not well understood. The ability to examine the effects of mechanics on these cells is limited by existing approaches, although their overall response is intimately tied to cell-matrix interactions. Here, we offer a novel method, which we used to investigate stretch-activated mechanotransduction on nerve terminals of sensory neurons through an elastomeric interface.To apply mechanical force on neurites, we cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons on an elastic substrate, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), coated with extracellular matrices (ECM). We then implemented a controlled indentation scheme using a glass pipette to mechanically stimulate individual neurites that were adjacent to the pipette. We used whole-cell patch clamping to record the stretch-activated action potentials on the soma of the single neurites to determine the mechanotransduction-based response. When we imposed specific mechanical force through the ECM, we noted a significant neuronal action potential response. Furthermore, because the mechanotransduction cascade is known to be directly affected by the cytoskeleton, we investigated the cell structure and its effects. When we disrupted microtubules and actin filaments with nocodozale or cytochalasin-D, respectively, the mechanically induced action potential was abrogated. In contrast, when using blockers of channels such as TRP, ASIC, and stretch-activated channels while mechanically stimulating the cells, we observed almost no change in action potential signalling when compared with mechanical activation of unmodified cells.These results suggest that sensory nerve terminals have a specific mechanosensitive response that is related to cell architecture."
https://openalex.org/W1990297025,"Background The horns and frill of Triceratops and other ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) are interpreted variously as display structures or as weapons against conspecifics and predators. Lesions (in the form of periosteal reactive bone, healing fractures, and alleged punctures) on Triceratops skulls have been used as anecdotal support of intraspecific combat similar to that in modern horned and antlered animals. If ceratopsids with different cranial morphologies used their horns in such combat, this should be reflected in the rates of lesion occurrence across the skull. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a G-test of independence to compare incidence rates of lesions in Triceratops (which possesses two large brow horns and a smaller nasal horn) and the related ceratopsid Centrosaurus (with a large nasal horn and small brow horns), for the nasal, jugal, squamosal, and parietal bones of the skull. The two taxa differ significantly in the occurrence of lesions on the squamosal bone of the frill (P = 0.002), but not in other cranial bones (P>0.20). Conclusions/Significance This pattern is consistent with Triceratops using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure for this taxon. Lower pathology rates in Centrosaurus may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation in this genus, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head."
https://openalex.org/W2125397676,"Background Accurate inference of genetic discontinuities between populations is an essential component of intraspecific biodiversity and evolution studies, as well as associative genetics. The most widely-used methods to infer population structure are model-based, Bayesian MCMC procedures that minimize Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibrium within subpopulations. These methods are useful, but suffer from large computational requirements and a dependence on modeling assumptions that may not be met in real data sets. Here we describe the development of a new approach, PCO-MC, which couples principal coordinate analysis to a clustering procedure for the inference of population structure from multilocus genotype data. Methodology/Principal Findings PCO-MC uses data from all principal coordinate axes simultaneously to calculate a multidimensional “density landscape”, from which the number of subpopulations, and the membership within subpopulations, is determined using a valley-seeking algorithm. Using extensive simulations, we show that this approach outperforms a Bayesian MCMC procedure when many loci (e.g. 100) are sampled, but that the Bayesian procedure is marginally superior with few loci (e.g. 10). When presented with sufficient data, PCO-MC accurately delineated subpopulations with population Fst values as low as 0.03 (G'st>0.2), whereas the limit of resolution of the Bayesian approach was Fst = 0.05 (G'st>0.35). Conclusions/Significance We draw a distinction between population structure inference for describing biodiversity as opposed to Type I error control in associative genetics. We suggest that discrete assignments, like those produced by PCO-MC, are appropriate for circumscribing units of biodiversity whereas expression of population structure as a continuous variable is more useful for case-control correction in structured association studies."
https://openalex.org/W1966912773,"The Whi5 transcriptional repressor is a negative regulator of G1 cell cycle progression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is functionally equivalent to the Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein in mammals. In early G1, Whi5 binds to and inhibits SBF (Swi4/Swi6) transcriptional complexes. At Start, Cln:Cdc28 kinases phosphorylate and inactivate Whi5, causing its dissociation from SBF promoters and nuclear export, allowing activation of SBF transcription and entry into late G1. In an analysis of Whi5 phosphorylation, we found that 10 of the 12 putative CDK phosphorylation sites on Whi5 were occupied in vivo in asynchronously growing cells. In addition, we identified 6 non-CDK Whi5 phosphorylation sites. Whi5 CDK and non-CDK phosphorylation mutants were functional and able to rescue the small cell size of whi5Δ cells. However, the Whi5 CDK mutant with all 12 putative CDK sites changed to alanine causes a dramatic cell cycle phenotype when expressed with a Swi6 CDK phosphorylation mutant. Mutational analysis of Whi5 determined that only four C-terminal CDK sites were necessary and sufficient for Whi5 inactivation when Swi6 CDK sites were also mutated. Although these four Whi5 CDK sites do not wholly determine Whi5 nuclear export, they do impact regulation of cell size. Taken together, these observations begin to dissect the regulatory role of specific phosphorylation sites on Whi5."
https://openalex.org/W2047911996,"Background The conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into the infectious form (PrPSc) is the key event in prion induced neurodegenerations. This process is believed to involve a multi-step conformational transition from an α-helical (PrPC) form to a β-sheet-rich (PrPSc) state. In addition to the conformational difference, PrPSc exhibits as covalent signature the sulfoxidation of M213. To investigate whether such modification may play a role in the misfolding process we have studied the impact of methionine oxidation on the dynamics and energetics of the HuPrP(125–229) α-fold. Methodology/Principal Findings Using molecular dynamics simulation, essential dynamics, correlated motions and signal propagation analysis, we have found that substitution of the sulfur atom of M213 by a sulfoxide group impacts on the stability of the native state increasing the flexibility of regions preceding the site of the modification and perturbing the network of stabilizing interactions. Together, these changes favor the population of alternative states which maybe essential in the productive pathway of the pathogenic conversion. These changes are also observed when the sulfoxidation is placed at M206 and at both, M206 and M213. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that the sulfoxidation of Helix-3 methionines might be the switch for triggering the initial α-fold destabilization required for the productive pathogenic conversion."
https://openalex.org/W1969977397,"Ubiquitination occurs at synapses, yet its role remains unclear. Previous studies demonstrated that the RPM-1 ubiquitin ligase organizes presynaptic boutons at neuromuscular junctions in C. elegans motorneurons. Here we find that RPM-1 has a novel postsynaptic role in interneurons, where it regulates the trafficking of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor GLR-1 from synapses into endosomes. Mutations in rpm-1 cause the aberrant accumulation of GLR-1 in neurites. Moreover, rpm-1 mutations enhance the endosomal accumulation of GLR-1 observed in mutants for lin-10, a Mint2 ortholog that promotes GLR-1 recycling from Syntaxin-13 containing endosomes. As in motorneurons, RPM-1 negatively regulates the pmk-3/p38 MAPK pathway in interneurons by repressing the protein levels of the MAPKKK DLK-1. This regulation of PMK-3 signaling is critical for RPM-1 function with respect to GLR-1 trafficking, as pmk-3 mutations suppress both lin-10 and rpm-1 mutations. Positive or negative changes in endocytosis mimic the effects of rpm-1 or pmk-3 mutations, respectively, on GLR-1 trafficking. Specifically, RAB-5(GDP), an inactive mutant of RAB-5 that reduces endocytosis, mimics the effect of pmk-3 mutations when introduced into wild-type animals, and occludes the effect of pmk-3 mutations when introduced into pmk-3 mutants. By contrast, RAB-5(GTP), which increases endocytosis, suppresses the effect of pmk-3 mutations, mimics the effect of rpm-1 mutations, and occludes the effect of rpm-1 mutations. Our findings indicate a novel specialized role for RPM-1 and PMK-3/p38 MAPK in regulating the endosomal trafficking of AMPARs at central synapses."

Interestingly, although there are several kinases (AMPK, PKA, CKI, and glycogen synthase kinase 3) that inhibit glycogen synthesis through the phosphorylation of GS, there is only one known phosphatase (type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1)) that dephosphorylates both GS (leading to its activation) and glycogen phosphorylase (leading to its inactivation), which results in glycogen accumulation (1Roach P.J.

The regulation of the activity of the holoenzyme formed by the PP1 catalytic subunit and one of these glycogen targeting subunits is different in each case. The glycogenic activity of GM is down-regulated by its PKA-dependent phosphorylation; PKA phosphorylates GM at a site in its PP1 binding motif, which leads to its dissociation from PP1. The glycogenic activity of the GL-PP1c holoenzyme is down-regulated by an allosteric mechanism involving phosphorylase-a (8Newgard C.B. Brady M.J. O’Doherty R.M. Saltiel A.R.

Laforin and malin are two key proteins related to Lafora disease (LD, OMIM 254780), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of glycogen-like intracellular inclusions named Lafora bodies. Although the role of these two proteins in cellular physiology is still poorly understood, several reports indicate that both the enzymatic activity of each protein and the physical interaction between them are critical parameters for the pathogenesis of LD. The fact that one of the histological determinants that characterize LD is the accumulation of glycogen-like intracellular inclusions suggests a direct involvement of the laforin-malin complex in the regulation of glycogen biosynthesis (14Ganesh S. Puri R. Singh S. Mittal S. Dubey D. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 51: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Contrary to mammalian cells, yeast glycogen synthesis is stimulated by nutrient limitation. However, the activity of yeast glycogen synthase (Gsy2) is similarly regulated by phosphorylation. The dephosphorylation and activation of Gsy2 is carried out mainly by the PP1 holoenzyme composed by Gac1 (glycogen-targeting subunit) and the phosphatase catalytic subunit Glc7 (15Francois J. Parrou J.L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). It has been described that the Snf1 kinase (yeast orthologue of mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), see below) activates the Gac1/Glc7 protein phosphatase complex, thus facilitating the activation of Gsy2 under conditions of Snf1 activation (15Francois J. Parrou J.L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 16Hardy T.A. Huang D. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27907-27913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AMPK is a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a sensor of cellular energy status. Once activated, it switches on catabolic pathways and switches off many ATP-consuming processes (anabolic pathways) (see Refs. 17Hardie D.G. Sakamoto K. Physiology (Bethesda). 2006; 21: 48-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar and 18Hardie D.G. Nat. Rev. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref Scopus (1784) Google Scholar for reviews). AMPK is a heterotrimer of three different subunits, α, β, and γ, each of which has different isoforms (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2, and γ3). AMPKα is the catalytic subunit of the AMPK complex, AMPKγ is involved in AMP binding, and AMPKβ functions as a scaffold to assemble α and γ subunits and also determines the subcellular localization and substrate specificity of the complex (17Hardie D.G. Sakamoto K. Physiology (Bethesda). 2006; 21: 48-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 18Hardie D.G. Nat. Rev. 2007; 8: 774-785Crossref Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Because the yeast Snf1 orthologue of AMPK is involved in the regulation of the yeast PP1 holoenzyme involved in glycogen synthesis (Gac1/Glc7; see above), in this work we studied whether AMPK could regulate similar PP1 holoenzymes in mammalian cells. We found that AMPK interacted physically with the R5/PTG glycogen-targeting subunit and made it a better substrate for its laforin/malin-dependent degradation, resulting in a decrease of its glycogenic activity.

Site-directed Mutagenesis-Site-directed mutagenesis of R5/PTG constructs was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and the following primers: (a) Ser-8 → Ala: forward, 5′-ATGAGGCTTTGCTTGGCACATGCACCACCTGTGAAGAGTTTCCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CAGGAAACTCTTCACAGGTGGTGCATGTGCCAAGCAAAGCCTCAT-3′; (b) Ser-268 → Ala: forward, 5′-GTTAGAGTCAACAATCTTTGGCGCTCCGAGGCTGGCTAGTGGGCTCTTC-3′; reverse, 5′-GAAGAGCCCACTAGCCAGCCTCGGAGCGCCAAAGATTGTTGACTCTAAC-3′; (c) Ser-8 → Asp: forward, 5′-ATGAGGCTTTGCTTGGCACATGATCCACCTGTGAAGAGTTTCCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CAGGAAACTCTTCACAGGTGGATCATGTGCCAAGCAAAGCCTCAT-3′; and (d) Ser-268 → Asp: forward, 5′-GTTAGAGTCAACAATCTTTGGCGATCCGAGGCTGGCTAGTGGGCTCTTC-3′; reverse, 5′-GAAGAGCCCACTAGCCAGCCTCGGATCGCCAAAGATTGTTGACTCTAAC-3′. Mutations and construct fidelity were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Laforin Small Interference RNA Silencing-The mammalian expression vector, pSUPER.neo.GFP (Oligoengine) was used for expression of laforin-specific small interference RNA in human Hek293 cells. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 872–891 of human EPM2A cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_005670) were annealed and subcloned into pSUPER.neo.GFP vector, resulting in plasmid pSUPER-laf. Yeast Two-hybrid Analyses-The yeast CTY10.5d strain was co-transformed with combinations of pACT2-GM, pACT2-GL, and pACT2-R5/PTG and different pBTM-AMPKα2, pBTM-AMPKβ2, and pBTM-AMPKγ1 plasmids. To analyze the effect of phosphorylation of R5/PTG on its protein-protein interactions, plasmid pACT2-R5/PTG (wild type or S8A and S268A mutants) were co-transformed with pBTM-PP1α, pBTM-AMPKα2, pBTM-AMPKβ2, or pEG202-Laforin. Transformants were grown in selective SC medium, and β-galactosidase activity was assayed in permeabilized cells and expressed in Miller Units as in a previous study (23Ludin K. Jiang R. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6245-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis-Human embryonic kidney cells (Hek293) transfected with plasmids pCMV-HA-R5/PTG and pCMV-Myc-AMPKα2 or with the corresponding empty plasmids were used for co-immunoprecipitation studies carried out as in a previous study (22Solaz-Fuster M.C. Gimeno-Alcaniz J.V. Casado M. Sanz P. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the case of co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, crude extracts from mouse skeletal muscle (C57B6 mice) were prepared by homogenizing the samples with a tissue homogenizer in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm Na2P2O7, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm NaVO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and then clarified by centrifugation at 5000 rpm, 5 min, at 4 °C. 1.5 mg of total protein from the soluble fraction was used for immunoprecipitation using specific anti-R5/PTG antibody or pre-immune serum and protein A/G-plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-AMPKα antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Two-dimensional Electrophoresis-CHO cells were transfected with the corresponding plasmids and 24 h after transfection, extracts were made in urea lysis buffer (9.7 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mm dithiothreitol). HA-R5/PTG was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis using an IPGphor (Amersham Biosciences Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) instrument. For the first dimension (IEF), 50 μg of total protein (in 100 μl of 9.7 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5% IPG buffer) were loaded on a 7 cm IPG strip (pH range 6–11) using the following focusing conditions: 500 V for 30 min, 1000 V for 30 min and 5000 V for 80 min. Electrophoretic separation (second dimension) was performed in a SDS-PAGE. λ-Phosphatase Treatment-CHO cell crude extracts (50 μg) in λ-phosphatase buffer containing 2 mm MnCl2 were treated at 30 °C for 30 min with 50 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs). The reactions were stopped by adding two volumes of urea lysis buffer. Expression of Recombinant MBP-R5/PTG in E. coli-Escherichia coli transformants harboring MBP-R5/PTG fusion were grown in 500 ml of LB/ampicillin. Transformants were grown at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached a value of ∼0.3. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was then added to a concentration of 0.1 mm, and cultures were maintained overnight at 25 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the fusion protein was purified by passing the extracts through a 1-ml bed volume of amylose-Sepharose columns (Sigma). MBP fusion proteins were eluted from the column with 50 mm maltose in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 15% glycerol. Samples were stored at –80 °C. AMPK in Vitro Phosphorylation Assay-50 ng of purified MBP-R5/PTG fusion protein were phosphorylated with 50 milliunits AMPK (Upstate), in a final volume of 20 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 300 μm AMP, and 100 μm of a mixture of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and cold ATP, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Upstate). The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and stopped by boiling the mixtures in sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 250 ng of MBP fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. R5/PTG Purification and Mass Spectrometry-CHO cells were transfected with plasmid pCMV-HA-8×His-R5/PTG using Lipofectamine 2000. Cell lysates from 20 plates (100-mm-diameter plates) were used for purification of poly-His-tagged R5/PTG. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.6 m sucrose, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na2P2O7, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). Cell extracts were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in Buffer A (8 m urea, 250 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and then used for purification using a fast protein liquid chromatography AKTA system and a His-Trap column (Amersham Biosciences). Additionally, poly-His-tagged R5/PTG was purified from CHO cells infected with an adenovirus expressing a mutated form of AMPKγ1 subunit (R70Q) that renders a constitutively active AMPK complex. Purified samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. The band corresponding to HA-8×His-R5/PTG was excised and digested in situ with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS and HPLC-MS/MS. Proteomic analysis was performed at the Prince Felipe Research Centre (CIPF-Valencia, a node of the Spanish ProteoRed network). MALDI-TOF/MS and HPLC-MS/MS data were analyzed with the bioinformatics database system Mascot (Matrix Sciences, London), and Paragon (ProteinPilot™). These data confirmed the identity of the purified protein. Ion fragmentation analysis assigned Ser-8 and Ser-268 as the phosphorylated residues within the R5/PTG sequence. Comparative analysis of HPLC-MS/MS data using Decyder MS software showed that Ser-8 and Ser-268 were quantitatively more phosphorylated when purified in the presence of a constitutively active AMPK. Glycogen Determination-Glycogen determination in transfected Hek293 cells was carried out as in a previous study (24Chan T.M. Exton J.H. Analyt. Biochem. 1976; 71: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Statistical Data Analysis-Data are expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical significance of differences between the groups was evaluated by a paired Student’s t test with two-tailed distribution. The significance has been considered at p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), and p < 0.001 (***), as indicated in each case. R5/PTG Interacts Physically with and Is an in Vitro Target of AMPK-To study the possible functional relationship between AMPK and the glycogen targeting subunits of PP1, we analyzed, in a yeast two-hybrid system, the interaction between the different AMPK subunits and the PP1 glycogen targeting subunits GM (PPP1R3), GL (PPP1R4), and R5/PTG (PPP1R5) (1Roach P.J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 8Newgard C.B. Brady M.J. O’Doherty R.M. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the assays, we used the catalytic AMPKα2 subunit, the scaffolding AMPKβ2 subunit, and the regulatory AMPKγ1 subunit, because they are abundant in glycogenic tissues, such as liver and skeletal muscle (25Thornton C. Snowden M.A. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12443-12450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 26Winder W.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, we only detected a robust two-hybrid interaction between both the α2 catalytic and β2 regulatory subunits of the AMPK complex and the R5/PTG glycogen-targeting subunit. AMPKβ2 could also interact with GL, although to a lesser extent. To confirm the interaction between AMPK subunits and R5/PTG, we expressed an Myc-tagged AMPKα2 subunit and an HA-tagged R5/PTG protein in mammalian HEK293 cells. Fig. 1B shows that when Myc-AMPKα2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies, HA-R5/PTG was also recovered in the immunoprecipitates, suggesting a physical interaction between AMPKα2 and R5/PTG. These results were confirmed in mouse skeletal muscle crude extracts, where we found that endogenous AMPKα co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous R5/PTG when anti-R5/PTG antibodies were used in the assay (Fig. 1C). Next, we studied whether as a consequence of the interaction between AMPK and R5/PTG, this latter protein was phosphorylated by the kinase. With this aim, we purified from bacteria a protein fusion of R5/PTG containing the maltose-binding protein (MBP) at its N terminus (MBP-R5/PTG). This protein was used in in vitro AMPK phosphorylation assays that demonstrated that AMPK was able to phosphorylate the MBP-R5/PTG fusion protein and that the presence of AMP (which activates AMPK) in the assay improved this phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Control experiments with MBP alone showed no efficient phosphorylation by AMPK. AMPK Modifies the in Vivo Phosphorylation Status of R5/PTG-It has been described that R5/PTG is a phosphoprotein whose basal level of phosphorylation does not change in response to insulin (which stimulates the Akt/PKB pathway), forskolin (that activates the PKA pathway), 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (which stimulates the PKC pathway), or epidermal growth factor (27Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We confirmed that R5/PTG is a phosphoprotein by two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western blotting of cell extracts from CHO cells transfected with plasmid pCMV-HA-R5/PTG. As shown in Fig. 2A, HA-R5/PTG fusion protein produced two major spots. The spot migrating faster toward the positive pole disappeared upon treatment of the sample with λ-phosphatase, indicating that this spot corresponded to phosphorylated forms of HA-R5/PTG (Fig. 2A, see arrow). Interestingly, if the cells were treated with AICAR (an AMPK activator (29Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar)), we obtained a different pattern of spots in the two-dimensional electrophoresis/Western blot. The faster migrating band disappeared, but a new band of lower isoelectric focusing mobility appeared close to the unphosphorylated form (Fig. 2A, right panel). Treatment of this sample with λ-phosphatase eliminated this intermediate form, suggesting that it was also phosphorylated (not shown). A similar pattern of the spots obtained upon AICAR treatment was observed if CHO cells were co-transfected with pCMV-HA-R5/PTG and a combination of plasmids that reconstituted a constitutively active form of the AMPK complex (CA-AMPK: pcDNA3-AMPKα2 T172D, pcDNA3-AMPKβ2, and pcDNA3-AMPKγ1) (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that the in vivo phosphorylation status of R5/PTG varied as a result of AMPK activation. We next searched for putative AMPK phosphorylation consensus sites in the human R5/PTG protein sequence. We found that the sequences LKPLKS35CLNI, DSKGLS69LTAI, and AIHVFS77DLPE closely fit with the consensus AMPK site, Hyd-(Basic,X)-X-X-Ser/Thr-X-X-X-Hyd, where Hyd can be Leu, Met, Ile, Phe, or Val, and Basic: Arg, Lys, or His (30Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). We mutagenized the corresponding Ser residues to Ala, but the mutated proteins produced the same pattern of in vivo phosphorylation (assessed by two-dimensional electrophoresis/western) as wild type (data not shown), indicating that none of these residues were true AMPK phosphorylation sites. Then, we decided to identify the phosphorylation sites of R5/PTG by mass spectrometry. With this aim, we constructed a plasmid expressing R5/PTG with an N-terminal 8×His tag. This protein fusion was purified from CHO cells by Ni2+-affinity chromatography, and phosphorylated residues were identified by mass spectrometry (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this way, in cells growing under standard growth conditions, we identified Ser-8 and Ser-268 as the major phosphorylated residues (Fig. 3A). These two residues, located at the N- and C-terminal part of the protein, respectively, are conserved in higher eukaryotes, from fish to human (Fig. 3B). We repeated the same determination in cells growing under conditions of AMPK activation by expressing a constitutively active form of the AMPKγ1 (R70Q) subunit. In this case, we di"

This study investigated glutathione-dependent mechanisms in the model organism Aspergillus nidulans. A recombinant dimeric protein of A. nidulans glutathione reductase (GR) contained FAD and reduced oxidized glutathione (GSSG) using NADPH as an electron donor. A deletion strain of the GR gene (glrA) accumulated less intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH), indicating that the fungal GR contributes to GSSG reduction in vivo. Growth of the deletion strain of glrA was temperature-sensitive, and this phenotype was suppressed by adding GSH to the medium. The strain subsequently accumulated more intracellular superoxide, and cell-free respiration activity was partly defective. Growth of the strain decreased in the presence of oxidants, which induced glrA expression 1.5-6-fold. These results indicated that the fungal glutathione system functions as an antioxidant mechanism in A. nidulans. Our findings further revealed an initial proteomic differential display on GR-depleted and wild type strains. Up-regulation of thioredoxin reductase, peroxiredoxins, catalases, and cytochrome c peroxidase in the glrA-deletion strain revealed interplay between the glutathione system and both the thioredoxin system and hydrogen peroxide defense mechanisms. We also identified a hypothetical, up-regulated protein in the GR-depleted strains as glutathione S-transferase, which is unique among Ascomycetes fungi.

Glutathione (γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine, GSH) is a ubiquitous tripeptide of which the thiol/thiolate group of its cysteine residue is reversibly oxidized to generate oxidized glutathione (GSSG). It is the most abundant intracellular redox-active sulfhydryl compound, and it acts as a major cellular redox buffer. Maintenance of the cellular redox state is the most important role of glutathione because reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; GR, glutathione reductase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TR, thioredoxin reductase; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescence protein; r-, recombinant. 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; GR, glutathione reductase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TR, thioredoxin reductase; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescence protein; r-, recombinant. due to their powerful oxidant reactivity, cause oxidative damage to nucleotides, proteins, and lipids if they are not properly removed from cells. Glutathione functions as an electron donor for glutathione peroxidase that reduces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to water and contributes to ROS degradation (1Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5897) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxins have glutathione-dependent disulfide reductase activity and reduce protein disulfide generated by oxidation of protein sulfhydryl groups by ROS, and thus, this mechanism is important for repairing oxidative damage to proteins as well as for regulating the redox state of the proteins (glutathione-glutaredoxin system) (2Cannel-Harel O. Storz G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 439-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 3Trotter E.W. Grant C.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 185-188Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of the thioredoxin and glutathione-glutaredoxin systems are similar. Thioredoxins are small (12-13 kDa) protein disulfide reductases like glutaredoxins (4Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), with a redox-active dithiol group, and they serve as electron donors for thioredoxin peroxidase (peroxiredoxin) that degrades H2O2. After oxidation, glutathione and thioredoxin are re-reduced by glutathione reductase (GR) and thioredoxin reductase (TR), respectively. Glutathione reductase is a FAD-containing protein that reduces GSSG to GSH using NADPH as an electron donor. It constitutes a family of proteins with sulfide dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, trypanothione reductase, and TR, all of which catalyze NAD(P)H:disulfide oxidoreductase (6Dym O. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1712-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The absence of the GR gene (pgr1+) causes a low respiration rate, inactivates oxidation-labile enzymes containing FeS, and arrests growth at the G1 phase in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and, thus, is essential for its survival (7Lee J. Dawes I.W. Roe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23042-23049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although GLR1, the sole GR gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is not required for normal growth, it is required for growth in the presence of oxidative stress (8Muller E.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). By contrast, GR is dispensable for the normal growth and maintenance of cellular GSH in Escherichia coli (9Teggle C.K. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 448-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These imply that the contribution of GR to cell growth differs according to species. Meanwhile, a recent report has shown that when the genes for the thioredoxins TRX1 and TRX2 are deleted, S. cerevisiae remains viable but not when the genes for both glutaredoxins (GRX1 and GRX2) are also deleted (3Trotter E.W. Grant C.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 185-188Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The triple mutant (trx1, trx2, glr1) is also non-viable, indicating overlapping functions of thioredoxins and glutaredoxins for reducing protein disulfides (3Trotter E.W. Grant C.M. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 185-188Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This seems to be true for S. pombe, in which multicopies of the thioredoxin gene (trx2+) suppress the growth deficiency of GR mutants (10Song J. Cha J. Roe J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 11: 1857-1865Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Taken together, the difference in the species requirement for GR is presumed to be caused by the extent of activity of compensation mechanisms such as the thioredoxin system. However, current comparative analyses of GR-deficient mutants from various organisms are too limited to thoroughly address this issue. Another role of GSH is mediated by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which comprise a group of ubiquitous small cytosolic proteins containing a redox-active sulfhydryl group. The GSTs are involved in cellular detoxification by catalyzing the conjugation of GSH with xenobiotics and endogenous products of oxidative stress (11Hayes J.D. Flanagan J.U. Jowsey I.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 51-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar). Fungal GSH conjugates are excreted to vacuoles and detoxified (12Klein M. Mamnun Y.M. Eggmann T. Schüller C. Wolfger H. Martinoia E.E. Kuchler K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Protein glutathionylation is another function of GSH through which protein function is regulated, although reports about this type of modification in fungi are sparse (13Beer S.M. Taylor E.R. Brown S.E. Dahm C.C. Costa N.J. Runswick M.J. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47939-47951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In addition, some GSTs oxidize GSH to GSSG and acts as glutathione peroxidase and disulfide reductase (glutaredoxin) (14Herrero E. Ros J. Belli G. Cabiscol E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 1217-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The family of GSTs is very large according to their primary sequences. Early studies of GSTs from higher eukaryotes classified them as α, μ, π, κ, ω, ζ, σ, and membraneassociated proteins involved in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism (MAPEG) types. McGoldrick et al. (15McGoldrick S. O'Sullivan S.M. Sheehan D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 242: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) recently investigated the phylogenetic relationships of fungal GSTs and found that most of them did not fit the above categories and, rather, clustered into distinct groups designated clusters 1 and 2, EF1Bγ, Ure2p, and MAK16. Properties of some fungal GSTs that did not fit these clusters are currently under investigation (16Cha C. Kim S. Kim Y. Stingley R. Cerniglia C.E. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 589-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tamaki H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2958-2962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Burns C. Geraghty R. Neville C. Murphy A.

However, fungal GSTs are so divergent that further studies are required to comprehensively understand their structures and antioxidant functions. Aspergillus nidulans is a filamentous fungus in Ascomycota that has been used as a model organism for studying cellular events such as development, secondary metabolism, and gene expression. Thön et al. (21Thön M. Al-Abdallah Q. Hortschansky P. Brankhage A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27259-27269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) recently studied the physiological functions of thioredoxin system of this fungus and found that a deletion of one of the two thioredoxin genes (trxA) resulted in slow growth and the inability to form sexual and asexual reproductive organs. They also found that adding GSH to culture medium complemented these defects and that a combination of recombinant TrxA and TR reduced GSSG in vitro (21Thön M. Al-Abdallah Q. Hortschansky P. Brankhage A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27259-27269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These results indicated that A. nidulans produces a functional thioredoxin system that interacts with the glutathione system in redox regulation like S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. Here, we investigated the glutathione system of A. nidulans using a deletion strain of the fungal GR, which was viable and depleted of most cellular reduced GSH. We further applied a proteomic approach to identify cellular proteins of which amounts were increased by GR and GSH depletion. We found that such proteins included those in the fungal thioredoxin system and catalases and peroxidases, implying functional relevance of these proteins in glutathione and thioredoxin systems and in H2O2 degradation. We also identified and characterized a novel GST exhibiting both GST and glutathione peroxidase activities. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this GST (designated GstB) constitutes a unique family of GSTs that is conserved among some filamentous fungi. Strains, Culture, and Media-A. nidulans strains A26 (biA1) and A89 (biA1; argB2) were obtained from the Fungal Genetic Stock Center (University of Kansas Medical Center). Conidia (108) were transferred to 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of MMDN (1% glucose, 10 mm NaNO3, 10 mm KH2PO4, 7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 ml liter-1 Hutner's trace metals (22Barratt R.W. Johnson G.B. Ogata W.N. Genetics. 1965; 52: 233-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 h at 120 rpm (preculture). Resultant mycelia (1 g wet weight) were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 0.85% NaCl, and then inoculated into 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of MMDN. Flasks were sealed with cotton plugs and rotated at 120 rpm for 6 h at 30 °C. Biotin (0.2 μgl-1) was added to all media. Arginine (0.2 mg l-1) was added to culture the strain under arginine auxotrophy. E. coli was cultured in Luria broth (LB) (1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl). 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends-Complementary DNA was synthesized using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end system, Version 2.0 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was prepared from strain A26 cultured in MMDN medium for 24 h as above. The gene-specific primers for 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were GSP1 (5′-TTAGGATGTGCGGCGCAGTGTA-3′) and GSP2 (5′-GCACGAGGTCAATTCCTTCGTT-3′), and the products were cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega, Madison, WI). Production of GlrA-Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) Fusion Protein in A. nidulans-The plasmid pGRgfp1 and pGRgfp1-M86A were constructed using the MultiSite Gateway Three-Fragment Vector Construction kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gene promoters of gpdA encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Pgpd) and of the argB gene were amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTATAGAAAAGTTGCGTTGACCTAGCTGATTCTG-3′ and 5′-GGGGACTGCTTTTTTGTACAAACTTGTGTGATGTCTGCTCAAGCG-3′ and primers 5′-GGGACAGCTTTCTTGTACAAAGTGGGAACGCATGCAATAATTGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTATAATAAAGTTGGTCGACCTACAGCCATTG-3′ (attB recombination sites are underlined) and cloned into pDONRP4-P1R and pDONRP2R-P3, respectively. Fragments of DNA encoding enhanced GFP, and glrA were amplified using the primers G1 (GGAAGAGCTTGTTACTTTGCGTATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGA) and G2 (GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG) and A1 (GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTATGCTCTCTCGCTCCTCGCTT) and A2 (TCCTCGCCCTTGCTCACCATACGCAAAGTAACAAGCTCTTCC), respectively. The resulting DNA fragments were fused by a second PCR using the primers A1 and G2 and cloned into pDONR221. These three plasmids and pDESTR4-R3 were used to generate the plasmid pGRgfp1 containing PgpdA::glrA::gfp fusion and argB. The glrA::gfp fusion was replaced by that mutated at the Met86 codon to an Ala codon to construct pGRgfp1-M86A as described above. The mutated DNA fragment was generated by PCR using pGRgfp1 as a template and the primers A1 and 5′-CACCGGCGGCGCGTTGCTCGAG-3′ and G2 and 5′-CTCGAGCAACGCGCCGCCGGTG-3′ and fused by the second PCR using primers A1 and G2. Both pGRgfp1 and pGRgfp1-M86A were introduced into A. nidulans A89. Fluorescence Microscopy-Conidia of the transformants harboring pGRgfp1 and pGRgfp1-M86A were incubated on glass coverslips in MMDN medium at 37 °C for 10 h followed by MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Invitrogen) for 10 min and then analyzed using the fluorescence microscope DMLB (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) with a BP 450-490 filter for fluorescence excitation of GFP and a BP 515-560 filter for excitation of MitoTracker Red. Production of Recombinant Proteins-Plasmid pETglrA was constructed to produce truncated recombinant glutathione reductase with an amino-terminal Met86 as follows. We prepared glrA cDNA by PCR using the cDNA of A. nidulans (see below) and the respective 5′- and 3′-PCR oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GCCATATGCCGCCGGTGGAGACAAA-3′ and 5′-CCTAGCGGCCGCACGCAAAGTAACAAGCTCTTCC-3′ (restriction sites are underlined). The PCR products were purified, digested by NdeI and NotI, then ligated to the plasmid vector pET21a (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes. Plasmids for producing recombinant thioredoxin (rTrxA) and the gene product of AN6024.3 were constructed essentially as described above. The respective cDNAs were amplified using the primers 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGGGTGCCTCTGAACACGT-3 and 5′-CCCAAGCTTAGCAAGCAGAGCCTTGATAC-3′ (for trxA) and 5′-CCCATATGTCCCAGCCAGTCTACCA-3′, and 5′-CCCTCGAGCTTATGCTCCGCAATATACTC-3′ (for AN6024.3). We used pET22b and pET21a to construct respective plasmids to generate pETtrxA and pETgstB. Standard DNA manipulation techniques proceeded according to Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Vol. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmids pETtrxA and pETgstB were introduced into E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS (Novagen) and cultured in LB containing 50 μgml-1 ampicillin sodium salt for 12 h, and then a portion (3 ml) was agitated on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm in 200 ml of LB containing 50 μgml-1 ampicillin sodium salt in 500-ml flasks at 30 °C. After the optical density reached 1.0, we added 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactoside (final concentration) to the medium and further incubated the flask for 12 h at 120 rpm at 30 °C. The E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 50 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), and disrupted by sonication. The sonicate was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 15 min to remove cellular debris and unbroken cells, and then the resulting cell-free extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain supernatant (soluble) fractions. These fractions were passed through columns containing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (inner diameter, 0.5 × 2 cm, Qiagen) equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). The columns were washed with 10 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm imidazole, and proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. All manipulations proceeded at temperatures below 4 °C. Gene Disruption of A. nidulans glrA-A 720-bp DNA fragment encoding 5′-region of glrA fused with appropriate restriction sites was amplified using the primers 5′-CCGCGGCCGCACATTCCTTCGTCAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCTTCTGGTTATACTGAAATTG-3′ (restriction sites are underlined). After restriction digestion with the enzymes NotI and BamHI, the ends were ligated with pBSarg1 that was spliced beforehand with the same restriction enzymes. The 3′-region of glrA was amplified using the primers 5′-GGCTGCAGGTGTGTTGCTATTCATCC-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGAGTGGTTACACCGAAC-3′, cut with PstI and XhoI, and inserted into the same restriction sites of the resulting plasmid to generate pDGLR1. The plasmid pBSarg1 was generated by inserting a 1.8-kilobase BamHI-SphI fragment containing the argB of A. nidulans into SmaI-digested pBluescript KS+ and transformed into A. nidulans. Total fungal DNAs prepared as described by Takasaki et al. (24Takasaki K. Shoun H. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Nakamura A. Hoshino T. Takaya N. J. Biol.

Cellular debris was sedimented by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min, and then the supernatant was further separated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was further separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain cell-free extracts. Glutathione reductase was assayed in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1 μm FAD, 0.1 mm NADPH, and 1 mm GSSG. The reaction was initiated by adding rGlrA or cell-free extract, and then the absorbance at 340 nm was followed at 25 °C using a Beckman DU-7500 spectrophotometer. Apparent Km values were determined by fitting each dataset to the equation v/e = kcat [A]/(KA + [A]). Thioredoxin reductase was assayed in a mixture comprising crude extract, 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm NADPH, 0.17 mm recombinant human insulin solubilized by the method of Holmgren et al. (4Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 10 μm recombinant TrxA. The reaction was started by adding recombinant TrxA, and the decrease in NADPH at absorbance 340 nm was measured. Catalase and cytochrome c peroxidase were assayed as described (25Beers R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Goodhew C.F. Wilson I.B.H. Hunter D.J.B. Pettigrew G.W. Biochem.

Glutathione S-transferase was assayed in a buffer (100 mm Tris HCl (pH 6.5), 1 mm GSH, 1 mm each GSH accepter) by measuring the increase in absorption at 340 nm (for 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene as accepters) and at 270 nm (for ethacrynic acid). The molecular coefficients of the GSH-conjugants were set at 9.6-, 8.5-, and 5.0-mm-1 cm-1 (27Habic W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione peroxidase activity was measured in a buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 1 mm GSH, 1 mm cumene hydroperoxide, 1 unit of GR (Oriental Yeast Co., Tokyo), 0.2 mm NADPH), and the reaction was started by adding 15 μg of rGstB. The amount of generated GSSG was measured as a change in absorbance at 340 nm caused by the GR-dependent oxidation of NADPH coupled to GSSG reduction. All reactions proceeded at 25 °C. Aconitase (28Kennedy M.C. Emptageg M.H. Dreyerll J.L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sulfite reductase (29Siegel L.M. Davis P.S.

Chem. 1951; 189: 665-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) activities were assayed as described. The protein concentration was determined using Protein Assay kits (Bio-Rad). Glutathione Determination-Conidia (108) were transferred to 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of MMDN and precultured at 30 °C to the logarithmic growth phase (20 h for A26 and 28 h for DGR1) at 120 rpm. The resultant mycelia were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 0.85% NaCl, and then 0.2 g (wet weight) was transferred to 30-ml test tubes containing 10 ml of MMDN. After incubating at 120 rpm for 6 h at 30 °C, the mycelia were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, vigorously mixed with ice-cold 5% 5-sulfosalicylic acid, and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were neutralized with triethanolamine on ice, and then the GSH and GSSG concentrations were determined as described (32Anderson M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2380) Google Scholar). Analytical Methods-Absorption spectra were measured using a DU7500 spectrophotometer, and FAD was identified and quantified as described by Faeder and Siegel (33Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) using ϵ at 450 nm = 11.5 mm-1 cm-1 after denaturation to rGlrA by heating at 75 °C for 15 min. To measure superoxide anions, fungal mycelia (0.1 g wet weight) were incubated in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm nitro blue tetrazolium at 30 °C for 10 min, collected by filtration, and homogenized using liquid N2. Homogenates were suspended with dimethyl sulfoxide and centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and then the absorption of the resulting supernatants at 540 nm was measured. Hydrogen peroxide was determined as follows. Mycelia (0.5 g wet weight) were homogenized with 5 ml of 0.2 m perchloric acid. After 15 min of centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was neutralized to pH 7.5 with 4 m KOH and immediately used to spectrophotometrically determine H2O2 at 590 nm using a peroxidase-based assay (34Oracz K.

The reaction mixture contained 12 mm 3-dimethylaminobenzoic acid in 0.375 m phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 1.3 mm 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolidone hydrazone, and 0.25 units of horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Nucleotide sequences were determined using an automated DNA sequencer (CEQ2000, Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dry cell weights were determined as described (24Takasaki K. Shoun H. Yamaguchi M. Takeo K. Nakamura A. Hoshino T. Takaya N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12414-12420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Quantitative PCR-Total RNA was extracted from strain A26 cells cultured in MMDN medium or in that containing 0.1-10 mm menadione, diamide, and hydrogen peroxide at 30 °C for 20 h using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized by incubating total RNA (10 μg) in 10 μl of reaction buffer comprising oligo(dT) 20 (Toyobo Co., Ltd, Japan), 5× reverse transcriptase buffer, and reverse transcriptase Moloney murine leukemia virus (200 units) (Takara Bio, Inc.) at 42 °C for 90 min. First-strand cDNA (330 ng) synthesized in this reaction was amplified by quantitative PCR using iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and MiniOpticon™ Version 3.1 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression of glrA was normalized against that of actin-encoding actA. Data were calculated as relative expression. The primer sequences were 5′-GAGAAGGCGAAGAACCCAAC-3′ and 5′-CCAACACCGAGACCCAGAA-3′ for glrA and 5′-GAAGTCCTACGAACTGCCTGATG-3′ and 5′-AAGAACGCTGGGCTGGAA-3′ for actA. Proteome Analysis-Samples for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were prepared from A. nidulans A26 and DGR1 as described (35Shimizu M. Fujii T. Masuo S. Fujita K. Takaya N. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Proteins (200 μg) were isoelectrically focused, loaded onto precast 11.0% homogeneous polyacrylamide (slab) gels (PAGE) (20 × 20 cm), and stained with SYPRO Ruby (Bio-Rad) as described (35Shimizu M. Fujii T. Masuo S. Fujita K. Takaya N. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Spots were detected using a ChemiDoc XRS (Bio-Rad). Gel images were loaded into the Proteomeweaver software (Version 4.0, Bio-Rad), and processing, spot detection, quantitation, gel matching, and warping proceeded according to the manufacturer's instructions. The volumes of spots were normalized by dividing the volume of each spot by the sum of the total spot volume. All proteomic differential display experiments were independently repeated three times. Mean values of the normalized volumes from the three experiments determined the expression level of each protein and were used for statistical tests (Student's t test). We established the level of significance at p < 0.05. Proteins were excised from the slab, digested with trypsin gold (Promega), and used for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis as described (35Shimizu M. Fujii T. Masuo S. Fujita K. Takaya N. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Proteins were identified by peptide mass finger analysis using the MASCOT (Matrix Science Ltd.) search engines of the entire NCBI protein data base, and a protein sequence library was constructed in-house with the most recent annotation of the A. nidulans genome (Version 3, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). The maximum deviation permitted for matching the peptide mass values was set at 100 ppm. Scores of >71 were considered significant (p < 0.005). Glutathione Reductase Gene (glrA) from A. nidulans-Using the BLAST program, we discovered a hypothetical gene (gene ID, AN0932.3) in the gene set of the A. nidulans FGSC A4 genome (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA) that encoded a similar protein to the GR from S. cerevisiae. The gene encoded a protein comprising 558 amino acid residues with a predicted sequence that was similar to those of GR from E. coli gorA (50% identical), S. cerevisiae GLR1 (YPL091W) (47%), S. pombe pgr1+ (48%), and humans (GSHR_HUMAN) (43%). In the amino-terminal region, we found a motif typical of the Rossmannfold superfamily (100GXGXXG, numbers started from translational initiation site, supplemental Fig. 1) followed by a highly conserved amino acid sequence among the GRs involving the catalytic Cys residue (132CVNVGC) (6Dym O.

https://openalex.org/W2049301444,"Background In the first optic neuropil (lamina) of the fly's visual system, monopolar cells L1 and L2 and glia show circadian rhythms in morphological plasticity. They change their size and shape during the day and night. The most pronounced changes have been detected in circadian size of the L2 axons. Looking for a functional significance of the circadian plasticity observed in axons, we examined the morphological plasticity of the L2 dendrites. They extend from axons and harbor postsynaptic sites of tetrad synaptic contacts from the photoreceptor terminals. Methodology/Principal Findings The plasticity of L2 dendrites was evaluated by measuring an outline of the L2 dendritic trees. These were from confocal images of cross sections of L2 cells labeled with GFP. They were in wild-type and clock mutant flies held under different light conditions and sacrified at different time points. We found that the L2 dendrites are longest at the beginning of the day in both males and females. This rhythm observed under a day/night regime (LD) was maintained in constant darkness (DD) but not in continuous light (LL). This rhythm was not present in the arrhythmic per01 mutant in LD or in DD. In the clock photoreceptor cryb mutant the rhythm was maintained but its pattern was different than that observed in wild-type flies. Conclusions/Significance The results obtained showed that the L2 dendrites exhibit circadian structural plasticity. Their morphology is controlled by the per gene-dependent circadian clock. The L2 dendrites are longest at the beginning of the day when the daytime tetrad presynaptic sites are most numerous and L2 axons are swollen. The presence of the rhythm, but with a different pattern in cryb mutants in LD and DD indicates a new role of cry in the visual system. The new role is in maintaining the circadian pattern of changes of the L2 dendrite length and shape."
https://openalex.org/W2138331322,"Activation transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) is phosphorylated by various protein kinases, such as JNK/p38/ERK, calmodulin kinase IV, protein kinase A, and protein kinase C (PKC), in response to a variety of stimuli. However, the role of the phosphorylation of ATF-2 by PKC in vivo in the transcriptional control of genes that include the activation protein-1 (AP-1)/cyclic AMP-response element remains to be defined. Using antibodies against the phosphorylated serine residue (Ser(P)) at position 121 of ATF-2, we have demonstrated that PKC phosphorylates ATF-2 at Ser-121 and that phosphorylation of Ser-121 (to yield ATF-2pS121) becomes detectable at the late stage of the response of HeLa cells to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and is maintained for more than 2 h. By contrast, phosphorylation of ATF-2 at threonine residues 69 and 71 (Thr-69/71, to yield ATF-2pT69/71) and at Ser-340 and Ser-367 (to yield ATF-2pS340 and ATF-2pS367) is detectable as an immediate early response. Unlike levels of ATF-2pT69/71 and ATF-2pS340, the level of ATF-2pS121 increases in the nuclei of HeLa cells in response to TPA. A serine-to-alanine mutation at position 121 of ATF-2 represses the c-Jun-dependent transcription of AP-1/cyclic AMP-response element reporter genes and also the p300-mediated activation of a Gal4-reporter gene in response to TPA. Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Ser-121 plays a key role in the c-Jun-mediated activation of transcription that occurs in response to TPA.

Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Ser-121 plays a key role in the c-Jun-mediated activation of transcription that occurs in response to TPA. The phosphorylation of transcription factors is critical for the expression of genes that are involved in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells, and such phosphorylation can be induced by many types of stimuli, such as growth factors, stressors, and viral infection (1van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 2Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylated transcription factors are not only involved in a variety of biological reactions in molecular association with other nuclear factors and cofactors, they are also involved in the degradation and oligomerization of proteins for transmission of signals to the nucleus (1van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 2Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat.

These members of the ATF-2 family have been identified to date, namely ATF-2, ATF-7 (ATFa), and CREBPa (3Vlahopoulos S.A. Logotheti S. Mikas D. Giarike A. Gorgoulis V. Zoumpourlis V. BioEssays. 2008; 30: 314-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). ATF-2 regulates gene expression via the binding of ATF-2, as a homodimer, to the recognition sequences of the cAMP-response element (CRE) or via formation of a heterodimer with AP-1 (activation protein-1) that binds to CRE sequences. Thus, ATF-2 can interact with other members of the ATF family and with members of the AP-1 family (4Eferl R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). The heterodimerization of ATF-2 with c-Jun is critical for the nuclear localization of c-Jun-ATF-2 heterodimers and the transcriptional activity of this complex (5Liu H. Deng X. Shyu Y.J. Li J.J.

Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4334) Google Scholar). It has been also proposed that activation of ATF-2 by p38/JNK might play a role in apoptosis (15Gupta M. Gupta S.K. Balliet A.G. Hollander M.C. Fornace A.J. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A recent study of “knock-in” mice showed that phosphorylation of both Thr-69 and Thr-71 of ATF-2 by p38 kinase is required for the initiation of anti-apoptotic activity in embryonic liver and heart in conjunction with ATF-7 (16Breitwieser W.

Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Both insulin and serum can activate ATF-2 via a two-step mechanism that involves two distinct Ras effector pathways as follows: the phosphorylation (p-) of Thr-71 via the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, and the subsequent phosphorylation of Thr-69 via the Ras-RalGDS-Ral-Src-p38 pathway (17Ouwens D.M. de Ruiter N.D. van der Zon G.C.

Phosphorylation of Thr-69 and Thr-71 stabilizes ATF-2 and modulates AP-1/CRE-dependent transcription (18Fuchs S.Y. Tappin I. Ronai Z. J. Biol.

Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). Thus, ATF-2 is responsive to a variety of external and internal stimuli, which range from mitogenic signals that are mediated via ERK to stress signals that are mediated via p38 (11Gupta S.

Moreover, a TPA-induced protein kinase, which is distinct from stress-activated protein kinases, phosphorylates c-Jun but not ATF-2 in HeLa cells (12van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 23Radler-Pohl A. Sachsenmaier C. Gebel S. Auer H.P. Bruder J.T. Rapp U. Angel P. Rahmsdorf H.J.

However, phosphorylated amino acid residues in ATF-2 and the protein kinase responsible for the TPA-mediated phosphorylation of ATF-2 remain to be identified.We reported previously that ATF-2 associates with p300 to regulate the differentiation-responsive element-dependent transcription of the c-jun gene during the retinoic acid-induced (RA-induced) differentiation of F9 cells (24Kawasaki H.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the kinase-mediated activation of transcription of the c-jun gene and the molecular signaling associated with activation of RA signals via PKC remain to be clarified.We report here that the phosphorylation of the serine residue at position 121 of ATF-2, catalyzed by at least PKCα, is one aspect of the response to TPA, and this phosphorylation is involved in the regulated transcription of genes that include an AP-1-like or CRE-like sequence.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Antibodies-A series of human ATF-2 expression vectors derived from pcDNA3-FLAG (Invitrogen), pET15b (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare), and pFR-Luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were obtained from the RIKEN DNA Bank (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan).

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for human ATF-2 (N-96), for phosphorylated human ATF-2 (Thr(P)-69/71), for human PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII, for human β-actin, and horseradish peroxidase-IgG-F(ab)2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated human ATF-2 (Thr(P)-71) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against ATF-2pS490/498 and FITC-IgG-F(ab′)2 were obtained from Colorado Bioscience (Aurora, CO) and BioSource International Inc. (Camarillo, CA), respectively. TRITC-IgG and FITC-IgG second antibodies and antibodies against FLAG (M2) were purchased from Sigma.Preparation of Antibodies against Phosphorylated Serine Residues at Positions 121, 340, and 367 of ATF-2-Antibodies against phosphorylated peptides that included, respectively, a phosphorylated amino acid residue at positions 121, 340, and 367 of ATF-2 were raised in rabbits, which were immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated phosphopeptides (NH2-TPIIRpSKIEEC-COOH (TB0608; 116–125), NH2-QTQSTpSGRRRC-COOH (TB0609; 335–344), and NH2-NRAAApSRC-COOH (TB0610; 362–368)). The antibodies were affinity-purified on columns prepared with the respective immobilized phosphopeptides according to the protocol from the manufacturer (MBL, Inc., Ina, Nagano, Japan).Cell Culture-Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 100 units of penicillin plus streptomycin and glutamine (Invitrogen) at 100 μg per ml each (25Jin C. Li H. Murata T. Sun K. Horikoshi M. Chiu R. Yokoyama K.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4815-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved in DMEM plus 0.5% FBS for 12–16 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air before stimulation. Then cells were treated with TPA (Sigma) at 60–200 nm for 6 h at 37 °C. Induction of the differentiation of F9 cells by RA was performed as described elsewhere (25Jin C. Li H. Murata T. Sun K. Horikoshi M. Chiu R. Yokoyama K.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4815-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Primary mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEF) derived from mice with null alleles for ATF-2 and ATF-7 or for ATF-2 only were generated from E11.5 and E12.5 embryos that were derived from crosses of heterozygous animals as follows: ATF-2+/-/ATF-7+/- × ATF-2+/-/ATF-7+/- (16Breitwieser W. Lyons S. Flenniken A.M. Ashton G. Bruder G. Willington M. Lacaud G. Kouskoff V. Jones N. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Western Blotting-HeLa cells or HeLa-S cells were serum-starved, incubated with TPA (60–200 nm) for 6 h and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4) that contained a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). After incubation for 30 min on ice and centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, supernatants were saved and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4–12% polyacrylamide) and Western blotting with the appropriate phosphorylation-specific antibodies (see above). In some experiments, cells were washed three times for 3 min each at 4 °C with CSK (cytoskeleton) buffer, which contained 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and then lysed in RIPA buffer as described above. For peptide blocking, antibodies against ATF-2pS121 (1:100) were preincubated with or without 200 μg/ml Ser(P)-121 phosphorylated peptide (TB0608-1; MBL) or 200 μg/ml Ser-121 nonphosphorylated peptide (TB0608-2; MBL). The antibodies against ATF-2pS340 (1:100) were incubated with or without 200 μg/ml Ser(P)-340 phosphorylated peptide (TB0609-1; MBL) or 200 μg/ml Ser-340 nonphosphorylated peptide (TB0609-2; MBL). The antibodies against ATF-2pS367 (1:100) were incubated with or without 200 μg/ml Ser(P)-367 phosphorylated peptide (TB0610-1; MBL) or 200 μg/ml Ser-367 nonphosphorylated peptide (TB0610-2; MBL), for 60 min at room temperature. Phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate) were included during blotting procedures.Transfection and Assays of Luciferase Activity-From 2 to 5 × 104 HeLa cells, F9 cells, and MEF, respectively, were subcultured in 500 μl of DMEM plus 10% FBS in individual wells of 24-well plates (Greiner-Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and in collagen-coated or gelatin-coated wells of 24-well plates (IWAKI, Tokyo, Japan). The indicated amount of pcDNA-FLAG-ATF2WT or of one of its mutated derivatives and 0.4 μg of AP-1-luc or 0.2 μg of CRE-luc and pBSK-II(-) (to give a total final amount of DNA of 1 μg) were used for transfections with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Six hours after transfection, fresh DMEM plus 0.5% FBS was added, and incubation was continued for another 16 h. Cells were then exposed to 60 nm TPA for 6 h and assayed for luciferase activity with a Renilla (for CRE-luc) or a firefly (for AP-1-luc) luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). Inhibitors Gö6976 (10 μm), SB202190 (20 μm), and SB202474 (20 μm), as indicated, were added to the culture medium 5 h before the treatment with RA or TPA. In mammalian two-hybrid assays, the luciferase reporter (pFR-Luc; 400 ng) was introduced into F9 cells, HeLa cells, or MEF with the pGal4-ATF-2 expression vector (100 or 200 ng) and the internal control pRL-CMV (100 ng), as well as pBSK-II(-) (to give a total final amount of DNA of 1 μg) by the Lipofectamine™ method (see above). Luminescence was measured immediately with a luminometer (AROVO™ Light, model 1420; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Luciferase activity was normalized by reference to the protein concentration of the sample, as determined with a protein assay system from Bio-Rad with bovine serum albumin as the standard. At least three cell-culture wells were subjected to each treatment. All experiments were performed as least three times.Immunofluorescence-HeLa cells were cultured in Iscove’s modified DMEM (Invitrogen) plus 5% FBS. For stimulation of phosphorylation at Ser-121 of ATF-2, cells were treated with 200 nm TPA for 30 min. PKC-mediated phosphorylation of serine was blocked by treatment with 10 μm Gö6976 (PKC inhibitor; Calbiochem) for 30 min prior to the treatment with TPA. Confocal and Nomarski differential interference contrast images were obtained with a confocal laser scanning microscope with a 40× 1.00 NA oil immersion objective (Fluoview FV500; Olympus, Tokyo; see Ref. 26Kasahara K.

Cells were treated in situ with 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 3 min prior to fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min (27Nakayama Y. Kawana A. Igarashi A. Yamaguchi N. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2252-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and they were permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.1% saponin and 3% bovine serum albumin at room temperature (28Yamaguchi N. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12170-12176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cells were stained with primary antibody for 1 h, washed with PBS plus 0.1% saponin, and then stained with FITC- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. For DNA staining, cells were treated with 200 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min and 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) for 30 min. Stained cells were mounted with ProLong™ antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For peptide blocking, antibodies against ATF-2pS121 (1:100) were preincubated with or without 200 μg/ml Ser(P)-121 phosphorylated peptide (TB0608-1; MBL) or 200 μg/ml Ser-121 nonphosphorylated peptide (TB0608-2; MBL). The antibodies against ATF-2pS340 (1:100) were preincubated with or without 200 μg/ml Ser(P)-340 phosphorylated peptide (TB0609-1; MBL), 200 μg/ml Ser-340 nonphosphorylated peptide (TB0609-2; MBL) or 200 μg/ml Ser(P)-121 phosphorylated peptide (TB0608-1; MBL) for 30 min at room temperature. Phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate) were included during in situ extraction and peptide blocking. One planar (xy) section slice (thickness, 1.0 μm) was examined in each replicate of each experiment. To ensure that there was no bleed through from the fluorescein signal into the red channel, fluorescein and/or PI and rhodamine were excited independently at 488 and 543 nm, respectively (29Tada J. Omine M. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. Blood. 1999; 93: 3723-3735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mean fluorescence intensity of phosphorylated ATF-2 in nuclei was measured with Fluoview version 4.3 software (Olympus).Statistical Analysis-Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t test for experiments with two groups and by an analysis of variance followed by Fisher’s protected least significant difference test for experiments with more than two groups. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to represent statistical significance.For phosphorylation of His6-ATF-2WT, His6-ATF-2S121A, and synthetic peptides by in vitro PKC; gene silencing with siRNA and real time reverse transcription-PCR; and assays of kinase activity in vitro, immunokinase assays and phosphatase treatment, see the supplemental material.RESULTSPKC Is Involved in AP-1/CRE-dependent Transcription during the Retinoic Acid-induced Differentiation of F9 Cells-We reported previously that phosphorylation of ATF-2 by PKC is critical for DRE-dependent transcription during the differentiation of F9 cells in response to RA or adenovirus E1A (24Kawasaki H. Song J. Eckner R. Ugai H. Chiu R. Taira K. Shi Y. Jones N. Yokoyama K.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Talmage and co-workers (30Khuri F.R. Cho Y. Talmage D.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 595-602PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cho Y. Klein M.G. Talmage D.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 147-154PubMed Google Scholar) showed that PKCα and PKCβ exhibit different patterns of induced expression and that each plays a distinct role during such RA-induced differentiation. Moreover, RA triggers the transition of expression from PKCβ to PKCα in differentiated F9 cells. However, protein kinase Cα is not sufficient for induction of the full differentiation of F9 cells but is involved in pathways that lead to the expression of differentiation-associated genes (32Kindregen H.C. Rosenbaum S.E. Ohno S. Niles R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27756-27777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the roles of PKC in AP-1/CRE-dependent transcription during the response to RA, we used siRNAs to suppress the expression of genes for PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII. As shown in Fig. 1A, the expression of a CRE reporter gene was decreased 6- and 5-fold by siRNA specific for PKCα and by siRNA specific for PKCβI, respectively, during the response of F9 cells to RA. However, expression of the reporter gene was unaffected by siRNA directed against PKCβII and by the negative control siRNA (random siRNA). We observed a similar response by the RA-inducible AP-1 reporter gene with siRNAs against PKCα and against PKCβI but not against PKCβII (Fig. 1B). Each siRNA reduced the expression of the respective endogenous PKC, but the control siRNA did not (Fig. 1C). Thus, at least the signal cascade of PKCα and PKCβI appeared to be involved in the AP-1/CRE-related response of F9 cells that are exposed to RA. To investigate in further detail the effect of each siRNA on the RA-induced differentiation of F9 cells, as described above, we treated cells with 1 μm RA to induce differentiation and then monitored morphological changes. Compared with morphological changes in cells that had been pretreated with control siRNA (negative control), morphological changes in cells that had been pretreated with siRNAs against PKCα and against PKCβI were significantly delayed or absent. By contrast, changes in cells pretreated with siRNA against PKCβII were unaffected (Fig. 1D).We next compared, by real time reverse transcription-PCR, the levels of expression of RA-inducible genes and of genes whose expression is a marker of differentiation and nondifferentiation after the exposure of cells to 1 μm RA. The levels of the induced expression of genes for laminin B1 and collagen type 4α1, two markers of endodermal differentiation, were 85–90% lower in cells that had been pretreated with siRNAs against PKCα and against PKCβI than in control cells 72 h after treatment with RA (Fig. 1E). These results indicated that the “knockdown” of PKCα and PKCβI inhibited the RA-induced differentiation of F9 cells.We also studied the effects of the PKC inhibitor Gö6976 and the p38 inhibitor SB202190 on the transcription of AP-1/CRE reporter genes in F9 cells. Fig. 1F shows that pretreatment with an inhibitor for 2 h prior to the exposure of cells to RA resulted in 50–70% lower transcription of the respective reporter genes, as compared with transcription in the presence of the control reagent (SB202474). These results indicated that pathways involving PKC and p38 might both be involved in the transcription of AP-1/CRE reporter genes during the differentiation of F9 cells in response to RA.Phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Amino Acid Residue 121-To examine the phosphorylation of ATF-2 by PKC in vitro, we used recombinant ATF-2 and corresponding peptides that included the possible sites of phosphorylation in ATF-2. Sakurai et al. (33Sakurai A. Maekawa T. Sudo T. Ishii S. Kishimoto A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) reported that serine residues at positions 340 and 367 are critical for PKCβ-induced phosphorylation in vitro. By contrast, we showed previously that the serine residue at position 121 is crucial for PKCα-induced phosphorylation and p300-dependent transcription (24Kawasaki H. Song J. Eckner R. Ugai H. Chiu R. Taira K. Shi Y. Jones N. Yokoyama K.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the exact roles of these residues in ATF-2 remain unknown. We first examined the relative levels of phosphorylation by PKC of the recombinant wild-type His-ATF-2 protein (His6-ATF-2WT) and a serine-to-alanine mutant at residue 121 (His6-ATF-2S121A). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the extent of phosphorylation by rat PKC of His6-ATF-2S121A was 30–50% lower than that of His6-ATF-2WT. We also observed a similar relative reduction in phosphorylation of His6-ATF-2S121A by human P"
https://openalex.org/W2049309679,"The Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) beta signalling family includes morphogens, such as Nodal and Activin, with important functions in vertebrate development. The concentration of the morphogen is critical for fate decisions in the responding cells. Smad2 and Smad3 are effectors of the Nodal/Activin branch of TGFbeta signalling: they are activated by receptors, enter the nucleus and directly transcribe target genes. However, there have been no studies correlating levels of Smad2/3 activation with expression patterns of endogenous target genes in a developmental context over time. We used mouse Embryonic Stem (ES) cells to create a system whereby levels of activated Smad2/3 can be manipulated by an inducible constitutively active receptor (Alk4*) and an inhibitor (SB-431542) that blocks specifically Smad2/3 activation. The transcriptional responses were analysed by microarrays at different time points during activation and repression. We identified several genes that follow faithfully and reproducibly the Smad2/3 activation profile. Twenty-seven of these were novel and expressed in the early embryo downstream of Smad2/3 signalling. As they responded to Smad2/3 activation in the absence of protein synthesis, they were considered direct. These immediate responsive genes included negative intracellular feedback factors, like SnoN and I-Smad7, which inhibit the transcriptional activity of Smad2/3. However, their activation did not lead to subsequent repression of target genes over time, suggesting that this type of feedback is inefficient in ES cells or it is counteracted by mechanisms such as ubiquitin-mediated degradation by Arkadia. Here we present an ES cell system along with a database containing the expression profile of thousands of genes downstream of Smad2/3 activation patterns, in the presence or absence of protein synthesis. Furthermore, we identify primary target genes that follow proportionately and with high sensitivity changes in Smad2/3 levels over 15-30 hours. The above system and resource provide tools to study morphogen function in development."
https://openalex.org/W1971192261,"Background The pulmonary phenotype in cystic fibrosis (CF) is variable; thus, environmental and genetic factors likely contribute to clinical heterogeneity. We hypothesized that genetically determined ABO histo-blood group antigen (ABH) differences in glycosylation may lead to differences in microbial binding by airway mucus, and thus predispose to early lung infection and more severe lung disease in a subset of patients with CF. Methods and Principal Findings Clinical information and DNA was collected on >800 patients with the ΔF508/ΔF508 genotype. Patients in the most severe and mildest quartiles for lung phenotype were enrolled. Blood samples underwent lymphocyte transformation and DNA extraction using standard methods. PCR and sequencing were performed using standard techniques to identify the 9 SNPs required to determine ABO blood type, and to identify the four SNPs that account for 90–95% of Lewis status in Caucasians. Allele identification of the one nonsynonymous SNP in FUT2 that accounts for >95% of the incidence of nonsecretor phenotype in Caucasians was completed using an ABI Taqman assay. The overall prevalence of ABO types, and of FUT2 (secretor) and FUT 3 (Lewis) alleles was consistent with that found in the Caucasian population. There was no difference in distribution of ABH type in the severe versus mild patients, or the age of onset of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the severe or mild groups. Multivariate analyses of other clinical phenotypes, including gender, asthma, and meconium ileus demonstrated no differences between groups based on ABH type. Conclusions and Significance Polymorphisms in the genes encoding ABO blood type, secretor or Lewis genotypes were not shown to associate with severity of CF lung disease, or age of onset of P. aeruginosa infection, nor was there any association with other clinical phenotypes in a group of 808 patients homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2014143096,"Crystal structures of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor suggest that its activation is associated with extensive conformational changes in both the extracellular and intracellular domains. However, evidence of these structural dynamics in intact cells has been lacking. Here we use luciferase complementation imaging to follow EGF-induced conformational changes in its receptor in real time in live cells. When the luciferase fragments are fused to the C terminus of an EGF receptor lacking the cytoplasmic domain, EGF stimulates a rapid increase in luciferase activity, consistent with ligand-induced receptor dimerization. However, when the luciferase fragments are fused to the C terminus of the full-length receptor, EGF induces a rapid but transient decrease in luciferase activity. The decrease requires tyrosine kinase activity, whereas the subsequent recovery requires MAP kinase activity. Our data demonstrate the utility of the luciferase system for in vivo imaging changes in EGF receptor dimerization and conformation.

The epidermal growth factor (EGF) 3The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. receptor is a classical receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation in response to growth factor stimulation (1Yarden Y.

The EGF receptor consists of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single-pass α-helical transmembrane region, an intracellular domain that contains the tyrosine kinase activity (5Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Downward J. Mayes E.L.V. Whittle N. Waterfield M.D. Seeburg P.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9752-9759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, upon binding EGF, the receptor undergoes ligand-induced dimerization (6Yarden Y. Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1443-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This promotes activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity and leads to autophosphorylation of the receptor on its C-terminal tail. Binding of SH2 and PTB domain-containing proteins to these phosphotyrosines results in the activation of downstream signaling pathways such as MAP kinase and Akt (1Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev.

X-ray crystallography studies have provided a wealth of information on the structure of the EGF receptor. These studies suggest that receptor activation is linked to significant conformational changes in both the intracellular and extracellular domains of the receptor. The extracellular domain of the receptor is comprised of four subdomains, I through IV. Subdomains I and III are homologous and known to be involved in ligand binding (8Ferguson K.M. Berger M.B. Mendrola J.M. Cho H.S. Leahy D.J. Lemmon M.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Subdomains II and IV are homologous high-cysteine regions. The crystal structure of the extracellular domain of the unliganded EGF receptor shows it in a tethered conformation in which an arm from subdomain II interacts with an arm from subdomain IV to hold the receptor in the closed configuration (8Ferguson K.M. Berger M.B. Mendrola J.M. Cho H.S. Leahy D.J. Lemmon M.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Structures of the ligand-bound EGF receptor extracellular domain suggest that upon ligand binding, the tether between subdomains II and IV is released allowing the receptor to adopt an open, extended conformation. In this conformation, the receptor forms a back-to-back dimer with another ligand-occupied EGF receptor monomer (9Ogiso H. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Fukai S. Yamanaka M. Kim J.-H. Saito K. Sakamoto A.

Activation of the tyrosine kinase also appears to be associated with conformational changes. Zhang et al. (11Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar) showed that following dimerization of the extracellular domain, the kinase domain of the EGF receptor forms an asymmetric dimer in which the N-lobe of one kinase contacts the C-lobe of a second kinase. In this configuration, the first monomer becomes activated and phosphorylates the C-terminal tail of the second monomer. Presumably, a further conformational change leads to a shift in the position of the two kinase domains allowing activation of the second kinase domain. In addition to the changes that occur in the extracellular and kinase domains upon receptor activation, studies on the isolated soluble intracellular domain of the EGF receptor indicate that the C-terminal tail of the EGF receptor undergoes a conformational change following phosphorylation (12Lee N.Y. Koland J.G. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2793-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Cadena D.L. Chan C.L. Gill G.N. J. Biol.

The data suggest that in the absence of phosphorylation, the C-terminal tail lies close to the kinase domain. However, upon phosphorylation, the C-terminal tail appears to move away from the kinase domain, adopting a more extended conformation. These findings are consistent with the different positions of the short segment of the C-terminal tail observed in the crystal structure of Wood et al. (15Wood E.R. Truesdale A.T. McDonald O.B. Yuan D. Hassell A. Dickerson S.H. Ellis B. Pennisi C. Horne E. Lackey K. Alligood K.J. Rusnak D.W. Gilmer T.M. Shewchuk L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Although evidence from crystal structures and purified systems suggests that the EGF receptor undergoes several conformational changes during the process of activation, these changes have not been observed in intact cells. Thus, the relevance of these findings to the physiological situation is not clear. In this study, we utilized luciferase fragment complementation imaging (17Luker K.E. Smith M.C. Luker G.D. Gammon S.T. Piwnica-Worms H. Piwnica-Worms D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12288-12293Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) to image EGF receptor dimerization and ligand-induced conformational changes in real time in live cells. In the context of an EGF receptor lacking the entire cytoplasmic domain, luciferase fragment complementation accurately reports on the kinetics of EGF receptor dimerization. When used with the full-length EGF receptor, the system reveals sequential conformational changes in the EGF receptor that are dependent on receptor autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of the receptor by MAP kinase. Our data demonstrate the utility of the luciferase system for in vivo imaging of EGF receptor dimerization and suggest that phosphorylation of the receptor by MAP kinase determines the final conformation adopted by the activated EGF receptor.

Cell Lines-CHO-K1 Tet-On cells (Clontech) were cotransfected with pTK-Hyg (Clontech) and EGFR-NLuc (pBI-Tet MCSI) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable clones were isolated by selection in 400 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). A double-stable cell line was established by transfecting EGFR-CLuc (pcDNA6/V5-HisB) into EGFR-NLuc cells using Lipofectamine 2000 and selecting in 10 μg/ml blasticidin-S (Invitrogen). Double-stable lines were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1000 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 100 μg/ml G418, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and 2 μg/ml blasticidin-S. ΔC-EGFR-NLuc (pBI-Tet MCSI) and c′973-EGFR-NLuc (pBI-Tet MCSI) were stably expressed as described above for EGFR-NLuc. Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1000 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 200 μg/ml G418, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin. ΔC-EGFR-CLuc (pcDNA6/V5-His B) and c′973-EGFR-CLuc (pcDNA6/V5-His B) were transiently transfected into the appropriate parental cell line 24 h prior to luciferase complementation imaging using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The K721A-EGFR-NLuc/K721A-EGFR-CLuc and T669A-EGFR-NLuc/T669A-EGFR-CLuc constructs were transiently transfected into CHO-K1 Tet-On cells 24 h prior to luciferase complementation imaging using Lipofectamine 2000. To assess the transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with Renilla luciferase (pRLuc-N1, Packard Bioscience). Kinase Activation and Western Blotting-EGFR-NLuc/CLuc cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes. Cells were serum-starved in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA for 3 h. Culture medium was removed and cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 17 mm deoxycholate, and 2.7 mm EDTA) containing 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein (BCA assay, Pierce) were loaded onto a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) or nitrocellulose (Osmonics, Inc.). Western blots were blocked for 1 h in TBST, 10% nonfat milk. The blots were incubated in primary antibody for 1 h, washed in TBST, 0.1% BSA, incubated in secondary antibody for 45 min and washed three times in TBST, 0.1% BSA. Western blots were detected using the ECL reagent from GE Healthcare. 125I-EGF Binding-Murine EGF was radioiodinated and ligand binding assays were performed as described previously (20Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Luciferase Complementation Imaging-Cells were plated 48 h prior to use at 5 × 103 cells per well in DMEM containing doxycycline in a black-walled 96-well plate. On the day of the assay, cells were serum-starved for 3 h and then incubated for 20 min in 175 μl of DMEM without phenol red, containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 25 mm Hepes, and 0.6 mg/ml d-luciferin at 37 °C. To establish a baseline, cell radiance (photons/s/cm2/steradian) was measured using a cooled CCD camera and imaging system at 37 °C (IVIS 50; Caliper) (30 s exposure; binning, 8; no filter; f-stop, 1; field of view, 12 cm). EGF was added in a volume of 25 μl in the same media (DMEM, 1 mg/ml BSA, 25 mm Hepes, 0.6 mg/ml d-luciferin). Radiance was measured sequentially as described above. For the ΔC-EGFR, c′973-EGFR, K721A-EGFR, and T669A-EGFR experiments involving transient transfection, the transfection efficiency was assessed by monitoring Renilla luciferase expression. Media was replaced on cells with DMEM (no phenol red) containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 25 mm Hepes, and 400 nm coelenterazine. Radiance was immediately measured as described above except the filter was set to <510. Data Analysis-Data were collected in quadruplicate for each condition. A flat-field correction was done to correct for differences in the baseline photon flux. Light production expressed as photon flux (photons/s) was determined from regions of interest defined over wells using LIVINGIMAGE (Xenogen) and IGOR (Wavemetrics) software. Changes in photon flux were calculated by subtracting values from untreated cells from those of EGF-treated cells. Standard errors were determined using the formula for the calculation of the unpooled standard error. EGF Induces a Rapid Increase in Luciferase Complementation in ΔC-EGFR-NLuc/CLuc Cells-The firefly luciferase complementation system utilizes two fragments of luciferase termed NLuc and CLuc. These fragments are inactive by themselves but are capable of reconstituting an active luciferase if the fragments are brought into close proximity (17Luker K.E. Smith M.C. Luker G.D. Gammon S.T. Piwnica-Worms H. Piwnica-Worms D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12288-12293Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 21Villalobos V. Naik S. Piwnica-Worms D. Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2007; 9: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Initially, the luciferase fragments were independently fused to the C terminus of an EGF receptor lacking the entire cytoplasmic domain yielding the ΔC-EGFR-NLuc and ΔC-EGFR-CLuc cDNA constructs. CHO-K1 Tet-On cells were transfected with ΔC-EGFR-NLuc and a line that stably expressed ΔC-EGFR-NLuc in a doxycycline-inducible manner was selected. Twenty four hours prior to use, these cells were transiently transfected with ΔC-EGFR-CLuc. These cells are referred to as ΔC-EGFR-NLuc/CLuc CHO cells. For imaging experiments, cells were first incubated with luciferin for 20 min at 37 °C to allow equilibration of the intracellular and extracellular pools of this substrate. This preincubation assures a stable baseline during the subsequent 20-min observation period. Luciferase activity was measured by monitoring the photon flux from ΔC-EGFR-NLuc/CLuc co-expressing CHO cells. Readings were taken approximately every 30 s, providing a continuous readout of luciferase activity through bioluminescence imaging of live cells. Luciferase activity was detectable in cells co-expressing ΔC-EGFR-NLuc and ΔC-EGFR-CLuc even in the absence of added EGF (Fig. 1A, open circles). This suggests the presence of receptor-receptor interactions in the basal state. The addition of 10 nm EGF led to a rapid increase in light production that plateaued between 10 and 15 min (Fig. 1A, closed squares). Both the rate and extent of ligand-induced dimer formation were dependent on the concentration of EGF (Fig. 1B). This increase in luciferase complementation following EGF stimulation is consistent with the canonical model of EGF-induced dimerization of its receptor (6Yarden Y. Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1443-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Importantly, the rate of dimer formation detected by luciferase fragment complementation was similar to the rate of 125I-EGF binding observed in these cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that this imaging technique accurately reflects the kinetics of ligand-induced dimerization of the EGF receptor. EGF Elicits a Rapid but Transient Decrease in Luciferase Activity in Full-length EGFR-NLuc/CLuc Cells-To assess the contribution of the cytoplasmic domain of the EGF receptor to receptor-receptor interactions, the NLuc and CLuc fragments were independently fused to the C terminus of the full-length EGF receptor. To ensure that equal levels of the two chimeric receptors were expressed, a double-stable CHO-K1 Tet-On cell line was established that will be referred to as the EGFR-NLuc/CLuc cell line. In this cell line, EGFR-CLuc was constitutively expressed, whereas EGFR-NLuc was expressed from a doxycycline-inducible plasmid. This allowed adjustment of EGFR-NLuc expression levels to match those of EGFR-CLuc. As shown in Fig. 2A, Scatchard analysis of 125I-EGF binding to the uninduced EGFR-NLuc/CLuc cells indicated that EGFR-CLuc was expressed at a level of ∼100,000 receptors per cell. When the cells were treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline, binding experiments demonstrated the presence of ∼200,000 EGF receptors per cell. These data suggest that under these conditions, EGFR-NLuc and EGFR-CLuc are expressed at roughly equivalent levels of ∼100,000 receptors/cell. As can be seen from Fig. 2A, both Scatchard plots were curvilinear, demonstrating that these receptor fusion proteins retain this characteristic feature of EGF binding to the wild type receptor (20Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The effect of the luciferase fragments on the kinase activity of the EGF receptor was determined independently in CHO cells that expressed only the EGFR-NLuc or the EGFR-CLuc receptors. The data in Fig. 2B show that EGF stimulated the autophosphorylation of both EGFR-NLuc and EGFR-CLuc, indicating that both receptors retain kinase function. EGFR-NLuc showed two distinct bands, both of which were phosphorylated and both of which reacted with anti-luciferase antibodies (not shown). This suggests that the lower molecular weight form is not the result of proteolytic removal of the luciferase fragment. It is possible that differences in glycosylation may be responsible for the different forms. Both NLuc- and CLuc-EGF receptors mediated the activation of MAP kinase (Fig. 2B). Thus, addition of the luciferase fragments did not substantially alter the biochemical behavior of the EGF receptor. When EGFR-NLuc/CLuc cells were incubated with luciferin, light production was observed in the absence of EGF (Fig. 3A). However, in contrast to the results obtained with the truncated ΔC-EGF receptor, addition of EGF to EGFR-NLuc/CLuc cells resulted in a rapid, but transient, decrease in luciferase activity (Fig. 3, B–G). The decrease was observed at the earliest time point following EGF addition and reached a nadir 2 to 4 min after EGF stimulation. Subsequently, light production recovered to essentially the same level as that observed prior to EGF addition. The magnitude of the decrease in luciferase activity was dependent on the dose of EGF, exhibiting an EC50 of ∼0.6 nm EGF. This value is similar to that observed for the stimulation of EGF receptor autophosphorylation (∼1 nm). Because EGF induces a variety of changes in ion transport and metabolic pathways, it was possible that the decrease in light production observed after the addition of EGF was due to changes in pH or some other metabolite within the cells. To examine this possibility, HeLa cells that express ∼100,000 endogenous EGF receptors/cell were transfected with FRB-NLuc and its binding partner CLuc-FKBP (17Luker K.E. Smith M.C. Luker G.D. Gammon S.T. Piwnica-Worms H. Piwnica-Worms D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12288-12293Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Treatment of these cells with rapamycin induces interaction of FRB and FKBP leading to enhanced luciferase activity. In this system, addition of EGF failed to alter the level of complementation stimulated by rapamycin (Fig. 3H). This suggests that the EGF-induced decrease in luciferase activity observed in the EGFR-NLuc/CLuc cells is not due to a nonspecific effect on luciferase fragment complementation arising from metabolic changes stimulated by the growth factor. The Decrease in Luciferase Activity Is Dependent on EGF Receptor Kinase Activity-Fig. 4 compares the time course of EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation with that of the EGF-induced decrease in luciferase activity in EGFR-NLuc/CLuc cells. As can be seen from the figure, maximal autophosphorylation occurred within 30 s after the addition of EGF. By contrast, the decrease in luciferase activity required 2 to 4 min to reach its nadir. Thus, receptor activation precedes the agonist-induced decrease in luciferase activity. This suggests that the decrease in luciferase activity might be a consequence of receptor tyrosine kinase activation. To assess the involvement of receptor kinase activity in the decreased luciferase complementation, EGFR-NLuc/CLuc cells were incubated with 5 μm erlotinib to inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Treatment with erlotinib induced a ∼3-fold increase in basal luciferase activity indicating that it enhanced the interaction between EGF receptors under resting conditions (Fig. 5A). This increase was specific for the EGF receptor, because treatment of HeLa cells expressing FRB-NLuc and CLuc-FKBP with erlotinib did not alter basal light production (not shown). As expected, stimulation with EGF led to a transient decrease in luciferase activity in control cells (Fig. 5B). However, this effect was largely eliminated in cells pretreated with erlotinib. Similar results were obtained with AG1478 (not shown). Because the effect of erlotinib on basal luciferase complementation complicated the interpretation of its effect on the EGF-stimulated decrease in luciferase activity, the requirement for EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity was further examined using the K721A-EGF receptor. The K721A mutation abolishes the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor (22Honegger A.M. Szapary D. Schmidt A. Lyall R. Van Obberghen E. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4568-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The NLuc and CLuc fragments were fused to the C terminus of the K721A-EGF receptor and were transiently transfected into CHO cells. As was seen for the wild type EGF receptor, erlotinib enhanced basal luciferase activity in this kinase-dead EGF receptor mutant (Fig. 5C). However, in contrast to the situation with wild type receptor, addition of EGF to the K721A-EGF receptor led to an increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 5D), similar to that seen in the ΔC-EGF receptor (Fig. 1). Erlotinib enhanced the EGF-stimulated increase in luciferase activity in the K721A-EGF receptor system suggesting that the effect of this tyrosine kinase inhibitor is independent of the effects elicited by EGF. These data confirm the involvement of receptor tyrosine kinase activity in the ligand-induced decrease in luciferase complementation. The observed decrease in luciferase activity is consistent with the hypothesis that EGF induces a conformational change in the receptor that leads to separation of the luciferase fragments. To determine whether the EGF-stimulated decrease in luciferase complementation was due to movement of the C-terminal tails of the receptors or involved changes in the relative positions of the kinase domains, the luciferase fragments were fused to an EGF receptor truncated at residue 973 just beyond the kinase domain. The constructs were expressed in CHO cells. Luciferase activity was detectable in these cells in the absence of EGF (Fig. 6A). As was seen with the wild type receptor, treatment of the c′973-EGFR-NLuc/CLuc cells with EGF led to a decrease in luciferase activity (Fig. 6B). Although there was some recovery of luciferase activity over time, it was slower and less extensive than that seen for the wild type receptor. These data suggest that, at a minimum, the EGF-induced decrease in luciferase activity involves movement of the kinase domains relative to each other. MAP Kinase Activity Is Required for the Recovery of Luciferase Complementation-The recovery of luciferase activity after treatment of EGFR-NLuc/CLuc cells with EGF occurred over a time course that was similar to that of the activation o"
https://openalex.org/W2044427756,"Background Understanding the evolutionary origins of a phenotype requires understanding the relationship between ontogenetic and phylogenetic processes. Human infants have been shown to undergo a process of perceptual narrowing during their first year of life, whereby their intersensory ability to match the faces and voices of another species declines as they get older. We investigated the evolutionary origins of this behavioral phenotype by examining whether or not this developmental process occurs in non-human primates as well. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested the ability of infant vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), ranging in age from 23 to 65 weeks, to match the faces and voices of another non-human primate species (the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta). Even though the vervets had no prior exposure to rhesus monkey faces and vocalizations, our findings show that infant vervets can, in fact, recognize the correspondence between rhesus monkey faces and voices (but indicate that they do so by looking at the non-matching face for a greater proportion of overall looking time), and can do so well beyond the age of perceptual narrowing in human infants. Our results further suggest that the pattern of matching by vervet monkeys is influenced by the emotional saliency of the Face+Voice combination. That is, although they looked at the non-matching screen for Face+Voice combinations, they switched to looking at the matching screen when the Voice was replaced with a complex tone of equal duration. Furthermore, an analysis of pupillary responses revealed that their pupils showed greater dilation when looking at the matching natural face/voice combination versus the face/tone combination. Conclusions/Significance Because the infant vervets in the current study exhibited cross-species intersensory matching far later in development than do human infants, our findings suggest either that intersensory perceptual narrowing does not occur in Old World monkeys or that it occurs later in development. We argue that these findings reflect the faster rate of neural development in monkeys relative to humans and the resulting differential interaction of this factor with the effects of early experience."
https://openalex.org/W2049144996,"Nucleosome assembly proteins (NAPs) are histone chaperones that are essential for the transfer and incorporation of histones into nucleosomes. NAPs participate in assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes and in chromatin structure organization. Human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains two nucleosome assembly proteins termed PfNapL and PfNapS. To gain structural insights into the mechanism of NAPs, we have determined and analyzed the crystal structure of PfNapL at 2.3 A resolution. PfNapL, an ortholog of eukaryotic NAPs, is dimeric in nature and adopts a characteristic fold seen previously for yeast NAP-1 and Vps75 and for human SET/TAF-1b (beta)/INHAT. The PfNapL monomer is comprised of domain I, containing a dimerization alpha-helix, and a domain II, composed of alpha-helices and a beta-subdomain. Structural comparisons reveal that the ""accessory domain,"" which is inserted between the domain I and domain II in yeast NAP-1 and other eukaryotic NAPs, is surprisingly absent in PfNapL. Expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged PfNapL confirmed its exclusive localization to the parasite cytoplasm. Attempts to disrupt the PfNapL gene were not successful, indicating its essential role for the malaria parasite. A detailed analysis of PfNapL structure suggests unique histone binding properties. The crucial structural differences observed between parasite and yeast NAPs shed light on possible new modes of histone recognition by nucleosome assembly proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2060194996,"The membrane-embedded rotor in the F(0) sector of proton-translocating ATP synthases is formed from hairpin-like c-subunits that are protonated and deprotonated during energization of ATP synthesis. This study focuses on two c-subunit motifs that are unique to synthases of extremely alkaliphilic Bacillus species. One motif is the AXAXAXA sequence found in the N-terminal helix-1 instead of the GXGXGXG of non-alkaliphiles. Quadruple A-->G chromosomal mutants of alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 retain 50% of the wild-type hydrolytic activity (ATPase) but <18% of the ATP synthase capacity at high pH. Consistent with a structural impact of the four alanine replacements, the mutant ATPase activity showed enhanced inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, which blocks the helix-2 carboxylate. Single, double, or triple A-->G mutants exhibited more modest defects, as monitored by malate growth. The key carboxylate is in the second motif, which is P(51)XXE(54)XXP in extreme alkaliphiles instead of the (A/G)XX(E/D)XXP found elsewhere. Mutation of Pro(51) to alanine had been shown to severely reduce malate growth and ATP synthesis at high pH. Here, two Pro(51) to glycine mutants of different severities retained ATP synthase capacity but exhibited growth deficits and proton leakiness. A Glu(54) to Asp(54) change increased proton leakiness and reduced malate growth 79-90%. The Pro(51) and the Glu(54) mutants were both more dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive than wild type. The results highlight the requirement for c-subunit adaptations to achieve alkaliphile ATP synthesis with minimal cytoplasmic proton loss and suggest partial suppression of some mutations by changes outside the atp operon."
https://openalex.org/W2071755701,"Background The Phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase is a key regulator in various cancer-associated signal transduction pathways. Genetic alterations of its catalytic subunit alpha, PIK3CA, have been identified in ovarian cancer. Our in vivo data suggests that PIK3CA activation is one of the early genetic events in ovarian cancer. However, its role in malignant transformation of ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) is largely unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Using the Müllerian inhibiting substance type II receptor (MISIIR) promoter, we generated transgenic mice that expressed activated PIK3CA in the Müllerian epithelium. Overexpression of PIK3CA in OSE induced remarkable hyperplasia, but was not able to malignantly transform OSE in vivo. The consistent result was also observed in primary cultured OSEs. Although enforced expression of PIK3CA could not induce OSE anchorage-independent growth, it significantly increased anchorage-independent growth of OSE transformed by mutant K-ras. Conclusions/Significance While PIK3CA activation may not be able to initiate OSE transformation, we conclude that activation of PIK3CA may be an important molecular event contributing to the maintenance of OSE transformation initiated by oncogenes such as K-ras."
https://openalex.org/W2088968402,"53BP1 (p53-binding protein 1) is a conserved nuclear protein that is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage and rapidly recruited to the site of DNA double strand breaks, demonstrating its role in the early events to DNA damage and repair of damaged DNA. In this study, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with 53BP1. Identification and characterization of 53BP1 protein interactions may help to further elucidate the function and regulation of 53BP1. We identified protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), a serine/threonine phosphatase that has been implicated in multiple cellular function, as a 53BP1-binding protein. This interaction further confirmed that 53BP1 interacts with PP5 in PP5-overexpressing U2OS cells, after radiomimetic agent neocarzinostatin (NCS) treatment. 53BP1 dephosphorylation at Ser-25 and Ser-1778 was accelerated in PP5-overexpressing U2OS cells following NCS treatment, and its dephosphorylation was correlated with reduced phospho-53BP1 foci formation. In contrast, the overexpression of PP5 had no effect on NCS-activated BRCA1-Ser-1524 phosphorylation. Additionally, PP5 down-regulation inhibited the dephosphorylation of 53BP1 on Ser-1778 and the disappearance of phospho-53BP1 foci following NCS treatment. Moreover, non-homologous end-joining activity was reduced in PP5-overexpressing U2OS cells.

Sequencing of PP5 and its yeast homolog PPT revealed the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat domains within their structures. Although many proteins use tetratricopeptide repeat domains as protein-protein interaction motifs, PP5 and PPT are the only phosphatases known to contain these structures. Through its tetratricopeptide repeat domain, PP5 interacts with a number of proteins and has been reported to be involved in regulating various biological processes such as glucocorticoid receptor activity (2Chen M.S.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Additionally, PP5 appears to play a role in cell cycle progression in several ways. Cells treated with PP5 antisense RNA exhibit p53 hyperphosphorylation and a subsequent G1 growth arrest (5Chinkers M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 28-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PP5 also binds CDC16 and CDC27, which are members of the anaphase-promoting complex, a complex required for anaphase initiation and the exit from mitosis (5Chinkers M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 28-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that PP5 plays an important role in DNA damage repair and cell cycle arrest by attenuating the activities of two closely related checkpoint kinases, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-related kinase (ATR). Around the same time, another report showed that PP5 interacts with and dephosphorylates DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit on at least two functional sites (6Wechsler T. Chen B.P. Harper R. Morotomi-Yano K. Huang B.C. Meek K. Cleaver J.E. Chen D.J. Wabl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). More recent work utilizing cells from PP5-deficient mice has confirmed that PP5 participates in the ATM-mediated G2/M DNA damage checkpoint pathway (7Yong W. Bao S. Chen H. Li D. Sanchez E.R. Shou W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14690-14694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The integrity of the information encoded in DNA is essential for cell survival. Endogenous and exogenous DNA-damaging agents are constantly challenging the stability of DNA. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are particularly dangerous for cells because they may lead to genomic instability, cancer development, or cell death (8Pfeiffer P. Goedecke W. Obe G. Mutagenesis. 2000; 15: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 9Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar, 10Bartkova J.

Generally, DSBs are repaired by two major pathways, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR utilizes DNA molecules with a significant length of sequence homology to prime DNA synthesis, allowing for accurate repair. In contrast, NHEJ rejoins DNA ends with little or no sequence homology, potentially leading to inaccurate joining. In higher animal cells, NHEJ is believed to play a predominant role in DSB repair. In addition to the repair of spontaneous DSBs, NHEJ is also used to repair programmed DSBs that arise during the rearrangement of immunoglobulin loci via V(D)J and class-switch recombination. The failure to repair these programmed DSBs results in a lack of immunoglobulin production, whereas the inappropriate repair of these DSBs has been linked to the establishment of lymphomas (11Lieber M.R. Yu K. Raghavan S.C. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1234-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). 53BP1 was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with the tumor suppressor p53 (12Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). 53BP1 contains two tightly packed tudor domains, which bind the methylated Lys-79 of histone H3 (13Huyen Y. Zgheib O. Ditullio Jr., R.A. Gorgoulis V.G. Zacharatos P. Petty T.J. Sheston E.A. Mellert H.S. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D.

Cell. 2006; 127: 1361-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), and tandem repeat of BRCA C terminus (BRCT) domains. BRCT domains are thought to be protein-protein interaction domains and are found in many DNA damage response (DDR) proteins (15Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 16Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 266-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), 53BP1 is rapidly redistributed to sites of DSBs where it is hyperphosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner (17Schultz L.B. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Halazonetis T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 18Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The N terminus of 53BP1 possesses several (S/T)Q motifs, which are preferentially phosphorylated by members of the PIKK family (19Jowsey P. Morrice N.A. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Toth R. Rouse J. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that 53BP1 is required for the accumulation of p53, the G2/M checkpoint arrest, the intra-S-phase checkpoint in response to IR, and the IR-stimulated phosphorylation of at least a subset of ATM substrates (20Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1435-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 21DiTullio Jr., R.A. Mochan T.A. Venere M. Bartkova J. Sehested M. Bartek J.

Despite these observations, the exact molecular functions of 53BP1 that mediate its biological roles are not understood. It is generally assumed that whatever the molecular role of 53BP1 is, it is specific to DSBs. Although the phosphorylation of 53BP1 has been studied in detail, little is known about its corresponding dephosphorylation. One reason for this is that little information is available regarding the putative protein phosphatases responsible for the dephosphorylation of 53BP1. In this study, we found that PP5 participates in the dephosphorylation of 53BP1 in response to the radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin (NCS). To investigate the role of PP5 in DDR, we established PP5 over- and underexpressing cell lines. Using these two cell types, we found that the phosphorylation of 53BP1 at Ser-25 and Ser-1778 were removed by PP5 after DNA damage, and that the 53BP1 foci also rapidly disappeared in PP5-overexpressing cells corresponding to their phosphorylation levels. Furthermore, our data show that NHEJ activity was significantly reduced in both the PP5 over- and underexpressing cells. Cells Lines and Drug Treatment-The following cell lines were used in this study: U2OS, U2OS-PO (transfected with full-length human PP5), and U2OS-PS (transfected with an siPP5 construct). U2OS cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. The U2OS-PO and -PS cells were grown in the same media as the U2OS cells except for the addition of 800 μg/ml neomycin. To induce DNA damage, exponentially growing cells were treated with 200 ng/ml NCS (Sigma) and harvested at different times after treatment. Stable Cell Lines-Full-length human PP5 cDNA was directly cloned into pcDNA 3.1 TOPO using the PP5-specific primers 5′-ATGGCGATGGCGGAGGGCGA-3′ and 5′-GAATTCCATTCCTAGCTGCAGCAG-3′. A synthetic siRNA duplex for PP5 (5′-AACAUAUUCGAGCUCAACGGU-3′) was purchased from Bioneer and cloned into pSilencer™ neo (Ambion) (26Ali A. Zhang J. Bao S. Liu I. Otterness D. Dean N.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were transfected into U2OS cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were then cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After 24 h, G418 (Sigma) was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 800 μg/ml. After 4 weeks of culture, during which the G418-containing medium was changed every 3 days, the G418-resistant colonies were isolated and confirmed by Western blotting. Antibodies and Immunoblotting-Harvested NCS-treated cells were lysed with M-PER (Pierce) containing proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science) and separated by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and the membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). The membrane was then incubated with primary antibodies against phospho-53BP1 (S1778) (Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-53BP1 (Ser-25) (Novus), 53BP1 (BD Biosciences and Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ATM (Oncogene), ATR (Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-BRCA1 (Thr-68) (Cell Signaling Technology), BRCA1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PP5 (BD Biosciences), and α-tubulin (NeoMarkers). After primary antibody incubation, the membranes were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies and visualized by chemiluminescence (Intron, Seoul, Korea). Immunoprecipitation-At 3 h post-NCS treatment, the harvested cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and the extracts were incubated with anti-53BP1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were then added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were then gently washed three times with PBS, and the precipitated complexes were resuspended in 2× loading buffer. After boiling, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted. Immunofluorescence Analysis-Standard immunofluorescence procedures were followed according to Nakamura et al. (27Nakamura A. Sedelnikova O.A. Redon C. Pilch D.R. Sinogeeva N.I. Shroff R. Lichten M. Bonner W.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells grown on cover slides were briefly rinsed with PBS and then fixed with freshly prepared 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. The slides were then either directly processed or exposed to 70% ethanol prior to storage at 4 °C. After being washed with PBS, the cover slides were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal γ-H2AX (Ser-139) (1:200; Upstate Biotechnology) or rabbit polyclonal 53BP1 (Ser-1778) (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology). Secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes) were added at 1:200 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The slides were mounted with a mounting solution containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired using a Nikon ELIPSE 80i microscope. NHEJ Assay-To document the role of 53BP1 phosphorylation in NHEJ, we used the plasmid pEGFP-Peml-Ad2 (28Seluanov A. Mittelman D. Pereira-Smith O.M. Wilson J.H. Gorbunova V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7624-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Briefly, the NHEJ reporter plasmid was digested with HindIII overnight and purified using a Qiagen gel extraction kit. All plasmids were transfected into U2OS, U2OS-PO, and U2OS-PS cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In a typical reaction, 5 × 105 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the predigested NHEJ reporter substrate along with 0.5 μg of pDsRed2-N1 (Clontech) as a transfection control. Green fluorescent protein and DsRed expression was monitored by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U). After transfection, the cells were incubated for 48 h, harvested, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, pH 7.4 (Invitrogen), and then analyzed by FACS. PP5 Binds with 53BP1 after DNA Damage-To search for factors that interact with 53BP1, yeast two-hybrid screening of a human prostate cDNA library was performed using the BRCT domain of human 53BP1 as bait. One of the positive clones isolated from 2 × 106 transformants turned out to be PP5. We confirmed the human PP5 could also interact with human 53BP1 by performing the yeast two-hybrid assay with a human PP5 cDNA. To investigate the functional relationship between 53BP1 and PP5, we established U2OS cell lines stably expressing the PP5 (U2OS-PO) (Fig. 1A). PP5 has been reported to dephosphorylate DNA-PK in response to ionizing radiation (6Wechsler T. Chen B.P. Harper R. Morotomi-Yano K. Huang B.C. Meek K. Cleaver J.E. Chen D.J. Wabl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Based on this, identification of PP5 as a 53BP1-associating protein made us postulate that PP5 might function as a phosphatase protein for 53BP1 dephosphorylation following ionizing radiation. Thus, we first examined whether the association between 53BP1 and PP5 was affected by radiomimetic agent NCS treatment. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the specific interaction between overexpressed His-PP5 and endogenous 53BP1 increased significantly 3 h after treatment with 200 ng/ml NCS (Fig. 1B). Because 53BP1 was bound to PP5 after DNA damage, it could be critical for 53BP1 dephosphorylation as cells repair their damaged DNA. We could not detect any changes in PP5 expression after NCS treatment in U2OS-PO cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the increased association between 53BP1 and PP5 was not attributed to NCS-mediated induction of PP5 expression. Overexpression of PP5 Specifically Induced the Earlier Dephosphorylation of 53BP1-The appearance of the 53BP1-PP5 complex after NCS treatment raised the possibility that phosphatase activity of PP5 may regulate 53BP1 phosphorylation after NCS-induced DNA damage. To explore this possibility (hypothesis), we analyzed 53BP1 phosphorylation in U2OS and U2OS-PO cells. There are only two commercially available antibodies to detect the phosphorylated form of 53BP1 at Ser-25/Ser-29 and Ser-1778. The phosphorylation of 53BP1 at Ser-25/Ser-29 has been well characterized by numerous groups (29Ward I.M. Minn K. Jorda K.G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19579-19582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 30Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Celeste A. Ward I. Romanienko P.J. Morales J.C. Naka K. Xia Z.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar); however, the role of phosphorylation at Ser-1778 on the BRCT domain of 53BP1 is unknown. Thus, we first assessed the effect of NCS on 53BP1 phosphorylation at Ser-1778. We observed that exposing U2OS cells to 200 ng/ml NCS for 3 h resulted in a significant increase in the amount of phosphorylated 53BP1 at Ser-1778 (Fig. 2A). Because ATM and ATR proteins participate in the phosphorylation of 53BP1, we examined 53BP1 phosphorylation at Ser-1778 in U2OS cells deficient in ATM or ATR by transient transfection of their specific siRNAs. Transfection of either ATM siRNA and ATR siRNA reduced the expression level of the targeted ATM and ATR by ∼57 and ∼63%, respectively, compared with control siRNA-transfected cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the phosphorylation of 53BP1 at Ser-1778 after NCS treatment was mediated at least in part by ATM (Fig. 2A). Further kinetic analysis revealed that the increase of Ser-25 and Ser-1778 phosphorylation was clearly detected as early as 1 h after NCS treatment (Fig. 2B, left panel). However, the phosphorylation patterns between Ser-25 and Ser-1778 of 53BP1 are significantly different. NCS-induced Ser-25 phosphorylation remained constant for 24 h, whereas NCS-induced Ser-1778 phosphorylation reached peak levels at 1 h and decreased progressively in a time course manner, becoming significantly diminished at 24 h. This result suggests that there may be different roles for the different phosphorylation sites of 53BP1. In response to ionizing radiation, ATM phosphorylates 53BP1 on Ser-25 and Ser-29 (29Ward I.M. Minn K. Jorda K.G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19579-19582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 30Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Celeste A. Ward I.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). However, mutation of these sites does not affect the function of 53BP1 in the DNA damage response (29Ward I.M. Minn K. Jorda K.G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19579-19582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and the mutant 53BP1 protein, in which Ser-25 and Ser-29 are mutated to alanine residues, is still hyperphosphorylated after DNA damage (19Jowsey P. Morrice N.A. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Toth R. Rouse J. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, 53BP1 is phosphorylated on multiple residues in response to different typed of DNA damage (31Chowdhury D. Xu X. Zhong X. Ahmed F. Zhong J. Liao J. Dykxhoorn D.M. Weinstock D.M. Pfeifer G.P. Lieberman J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 33-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 32Lee H. Kwak H. Cho I.T. Park S.H. Lee C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 378: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, although the phosphorylation of 53BP1 at Ser-25 and Ser-29 in response to DNA damage has been linked to its activation, several novel phosphorylation sites of 53BP1 such as Ser-1788 may be important for 53BP1 function. To investigate whether 53BP1 is a target for the PP5 phosphatase in vivo, the U2OS and U2OS-PO cells were treated with 200 ng/ml NCS for different times and then analyzed for 53BP1 phosphorylation at Ser-25 and Ser-1788. As shown in Fig. 2B, overexpression of PP5 was reduced significantly in the phosphorylation of 53BP1 at Ser-25 and Ser-1788 after NCS treatment, as compared with those of U2OS cells. The phosphorylation of Ser-25 and Ser-1778 of 53BP1 peaked at 1 h and then decreased over time, becoming significantly diminished by 12 h in U2OS-PO cells. To evaluate that the PP5-induced dephosphorylation of 53BP1 at Ser-25 and Ser-1778 was not because of a nonspecific phosphorylation, we analyzed the Ser-1524-phosphorylated BRCA1, which contains the same BRCT domain as 53BP1 and is also a known DDR protein. We did not observe a substantial difference in the phosphorylation of BRCA1 at Ser-1524 in U2OS versus U2OS-PO cells, suggesting that the dephosphorylation of 53BP1 at Ser-25 and Ser-1778 appears to occur via a specific interaction mediated by PP5. Therefore, we conclude that PP5 is the phosphatase responsible for removing the phosphate group from Ser-25 and Ser-1778 of 53BP1 after DNA double strand breaks. Rapid Dephosphorylation at Ser-1778 Also Influences Phospho-53BP1 Focus Formation-In response to IR, 53BP1 rapidly colocalizes with γ-H2AX. H2AX, a variant of histone H2A, becomes phosphorylated and forms foci at sites of double strand breakage after DNA damage. The number, appearance, and disappearance of the foci were nearly identical between 53BP1 and γ-H2AX (33Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar, 34Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). Although the phosphorylation activity has been studied in detail, little is known about the corresponding dephosphorylation and detachment from DNA DSBs. Generally, it is thought that either the phosphorylated protein must be degraded or the phosphate group must be removed. Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between focus formation and the dephosphorylation of 53BP1 by immunofluorescence using U2OS and U2OS-PO cells (Fig. 3). The patterns of pS1778–53BP1 and γ-H2AX focus formation were evaluated from 0 to 24 h after NCS-induced DNA damage. As shown in Fig. 3, the DNA focus pattern of pS1778–53BP1 differed between the U2OS and U2OS-PO cells. In the U2OS cells at 1 h, the DNA foci of pS1778–53BP1 were numerous, small, and fused; by 24 h, the foci had grown and decreased in number. This pattern of focus formation corresponded to our Western blotting results for pS1778–53BP1 (Fig. 2). In the U2OS-PO cells, the pattern of the pS1778–53BP1 foci was similar to that in the U2OS cells during the first 3 h, and the pS1778–53BP1 foci were well matched with those of γ-H2AX, even though there were fewer pS1778–53BP1 foci in the U2OS-PO cells than in the U2OS cells (Fig. 3). After 3 h, however, the number of pS1778–53BP1 foci in the U2OS-PO cells was greatly decreased, and the pS1778–53BP1 foci did not match with those of γ-H2AX. This indicates that the detachment of DDR proteins from DNA breakage sites is the result of dephosphorylation. Generally, after DNA injury, members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase kinase family, including ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs, phosphorylate many DDR proteins, which are subsequently recruited to participate in the repair process at sites of DNA breakage (35Ward I. Chen J. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2004; 63: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Kobayashi J. Iwabuchi K. Miyagawa K. Sonoda E. Suzuki K. Takata M. Tauchi H. J. Radiat. Res. 2008; 49: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of 53BP1, which is mediated by ATM and ATR after DNA damage, has been studied using mass spectrometry (19Jowsey P. Morrice N.A. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Toth R. Rouse J. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The tandem tudor domains of 53BP1 are required for the recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DNA DSBs. The BRCT domain is not required for 53BP1 phosphorylation (14Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G. Cell. 2006; 127: 1361-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) or DNA DSB repair (37Ward I. Kim J.E. Minn K. Chini C.C. Mer G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38472-38477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although 53BP1 is regarded as an important protein in the DDR pathway (20Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1435-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 38Mochan T.A. Venere M. DiTullio Jr., R.A. Halazonetis T.D. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), its exact function is not clearly understood. In U2OS-PO cells after NCS-induced DNA damage, the number and size of the γ-H2AX foci were almost identical to those seen in the U2OS cells (Fig. 3). To confirm the specificity of PP5 for 53BP1, we analyzed the formation of pS1524-BRCA1 and pS1981-ATM foci after DNA damage; as for γ-H2AX, there were no differences in the patterns of the foci between the cells (data not shown). These data confirm that the interaction between PP5 and phosphorylated 53BP1 is specific. Decreased PP5 Expression Delays the Dephosphorylation of 53BP1-To confirm the involvement of PP5 in 53BP1 dephosphorylation in response to DNA damage, PP5 expression was knocked down by stable transfection with siRNA for 53BP1 as reported previously (26Ali A. Zhang J. Bao S. Liu I. Otterness D. Dean N.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We cloned an siRNA duplex for PP5 into the pSilencer vector and transfected the siPP5 plasmid into U2OS cells. Over a period of 4 weeks, G418 selection was used to obtain several PP5-suppressed U2OS clones. These clones were then screened by Western blotting, and one was chosen for further analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, PP5 protein expression was inhibited more than 90% by PP5 siRNA transfection. Immunofluorescence analysis of this clone also demonstrated that PP5 expression was suppressed (Fig. 4B). Using the PP5-su"

We hypothesize that inheritable aberrant chromatin states in cancer and aging are caused by genetic/environmental factors. In previous studies we demonstrated that either genetic mutations, or loss, of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha), can impair the integration of the retinoic acid (RA) signal at the chromatin of RA-responsive genes downstream of RARalpha, and can lead to aberrant repressive chromatin states marked by epigenetic modifications. In this study we tested whether the mere interference with the availability of RA signal at RARalpha, in cells with an otherwise functional RARalpha, can also induce epigenetic repression at RA-responsive genes downstream of RARalpha.To hamper the availability of RA at RARalpha in untransformed human mammary epithelial cells, we targeted the cellular RA-binding protein 2 (CRABP2), which transports RA from the cytoplasm onto the nuclear RARs. Stable ectopic expression of a CRABP2 mutant unable to enter the nucleus, as well as stable knock down of endogenous CRABP2, led to the coordinated transcriptional repression of a few RA-responsive genes downstream of RARalpha. The chromatin at these genes acquired an exacerbated repressed state, or state ""of no return"". This aberrant state is unresponsive to RA, and therefore differs from the physiologically repressed, yet ""poised"" state, which is responsive to RA. Consistent with development of homozygosis for epigenetically repressed loci, a significant proportion of cells with a defective CRABP2-mediated RA transport developed heritable phenotypes indicative of loss of function.Derangement/lack of a critical factor necessary for RARalpha function induces epigenetic repression of a RA-regulated gene network downstream of RARalpha, with major pleiotropic biological outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2006359313,"The recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by host Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 is a crucial step in developing protective immunity against several gram negative bacterial pathogens. Bordetella bronchiseptica and B. pertussis stimulate robust TLR4 responses that are required to control the infection, but a close relative, B. parapertussis, poorly stimulates this receptor, and TLR4 deficiency does not affect its course of infection. This led us to hypothesize that inefficient TLR4 stimulation enables B. parapertussis to evade host immunity. In a mouse model of infection, B. parapertussis grew rapidly in the lungs, but no measurable increase in TLR4-mediated cytokine, chemokine, or leukocyte responses were observed over the first few days of infection. Delivery of a TLR4 stimulant in the inoculum resulted in a robust inflammatory response and a 10- to 100-fold reduction of B. parapertussis numbers. As we have previously shown, B. parapertussis grows efficiently during the first week of infection even in animals passively immunized with antibodies. We show that this evasion of antibody-mediated clearance is dependent on the lack of TLR4 stimulation by B. parapertussis as co-inoculation with a TLR4 agonist resulted in 10,000-fold lower B. parapertussis numbers on day 3 in antibody-treated wild type, but not TLR4-deficient, mice. Together, these results indicate that inefficient TLR4 stimulation by B. parapertussis enables it to avoid host immunity and grow to high numbers in the respiratory tract of naïve and immunized hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2093428963,"Emerging evidence suggests that ubiquitination serves as a protein trafficking signal in addition to its well characterized role in promoting protein degradation. The yeast G protein alpha subunit Gpa1 represents a rare example of a protein that undergoes both mono- and poly-ubiquitination. Whereas mono-ubiquitinated Gpa1 is targeted to the vacuole, poly-ubiquitinated Gpa1 is directed instead to the proteasome. Here we investigate the structural requirements for mono- and poly-ubiquitination of Gpa1. We find that variants of Gpa1 engineered to be unstable are more likely to be poly-ubiquitinated and less likely to be mono-ubiquitinated. In addition, mutants that cannot be myristoylated are no longer mono-ubiquitinated but are still polyubiquitinated. Finally, we show that the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 is necessary for Gpa1 mono-ubiquitination in vivo and that the purified enzyme is sufficient to catalyze Gpa1 mono-ubiquitination in vitro. Taken together, these data indicate that mono- and poly-ubiquitination have distinct enzyme and substrate recognition requirements; whereas poly-ubiquitination targets misfolded protein for degradation, a distinct ubiquitination apparatus targets the fully mature, fully myristoylated G protein for mono-ubiquitination and delivery to the vacuole."
https://openalex.org/W2032843351,"Arabidopsis thaliana has three genes, Ape1L, Ape2, and Arp, that show homology to abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic) endonuclease genes of bacterial, yeast, or animal cells. In bacteria, yeast, and animals, abasic endonucleases function in base excision repair of oxidized and other modified DNA bases. Here we report that plants with knock-out mutations in any one of Ape1L, Ape2, or Arp show no apparent differences from wild type in growth rate, growth habit, and fertility. However, coincident knock-out mutations in Ape1L and Ape2 are lethal and lead to abortion of developing embryos. Mutations of Arp are not deleterious, even in combination with one of the other two mutations. The results are consistent with the interpretation that the process of base excision repair, involving at least one intact copy of Ape1L or Ape2, is required in the process of embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2002607497,"The pir multigene family, found in the genomes of Plasmodium vivax, P. knowlesi and the rodent malaria species, encode variant antigens that could be targets of the immune response. Individual parasites of the rodent malaria Plasmodium yoelii, selected by micromanipulation, transcribe only 1 to 3 different pir (yir) suggesting tight transcriptional control at the level of individual cells. Using microarray and quantitative RT-PCR, we show that despite this very restricted transcription in a single cell, many yir genes are transcribed throughout the intra-erythrocytic asexual cycle. The timing and level of transcription differs between genes, with some being more highly transcribed in ring and trophozoite stages, whereas others are more highly transcribed in schizonts. Infection of immunodeficient mice with single infected erythrocytes results in populations of parasites each with transcriptional profiles different from that of the parent parasite population and from each other. This drift away from the original ‘set’ of transcribed genes does not appear to follow a preset pattern and “epigenetic memory” of the yir transcribed in the parent parasite can be rapidly lost. Thus, regulation of pir gene transcription may be different from that of the well-characterised multigene family, var, of Plasmodium falciparum."

The organochlorine pesticide dieldrin is a persistent environmental toxicant thought to increase the risk of breast cancer and reduce survival in the human population. The objective of this study was to define the effect of developmental exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of dieldrin, on mammary tumor development in the offspring. Sexually mature FVB-MMTV/neu female mice were treated with vehicle (corn oil), or dieldrin (0.45, 2.25, and 4.5 µg/g body weight) daily by gavage for 5 days prior to mating and then once weekly throughout gestation and lactation until weaning. Dieldrin concentrations were selected to produce serum levels representative of human background body burdens, occupational exposure, and overt toxicity. Treatment had no effect on litter size, birth weight or the number of pups surviving to weaning. The highest dose of dieldrin significantly increased the total tumor burden and the volume and number of tumors found in the thoracic mammary glands. Increased mRNA and protein expression of the neurotrophin BDNF and its receptor TrkB was increased in tumors from the offspring of dieldrin treated dams. This study indicates that developmental exposure to the environmental contaminant dieldrin causes increased tumor burden in genetically predisposed mice. Dieldrin exposure also altered the expression of BNDF and TrkB, novel modulators of cancer pathogenesis."

Gastrointestinal transit was measured using gavage of a fluorescent tracer.In CF mice gastric emptying at 20 min post-gavage did not differ from WT, but was significantly less than in WT at 90 min post-gavage. Gastric emptying was significantly increased in WT mice by doxantrazole, but none of the mast cell stabilizers had any significant effect on gastric emptying in CF mice. Mast cell activation significantly enhanced gastric emptying in WT mice but not in CF mice. Small intestinal transit was significantly less in CF mice as compared to WT. Of the mast cell stabilizers, only doxantrazole significantly affected small intestinal transit in WT mice and none had any effect in CF mice. Mast cell activation resulted in a small but significant increase in small intestinal transit in CF mice but not WT mice.The results indicate that mast cells are not involved in gastrointestinal dysmotility but their activation can stimulate small intestinal transit in cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1973423826,"Presenilin 1 and 2 (PS) are critical components of the gamma-secretase complex that cleaves type I transmembrane proteins within their transmembrane domains. This process leads to release of proteolytically processed products from cellular membranes and plays an essential role in signal transduction or vital functions as cell adhesion. Here we studied the function of presenilins in cell-matrix interaction of wild-type and PS knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We found for PS1(-/-) cells an altered morphology with significantly reduced sizes of focal adhesion sites compared with wild type. Cell force analyses on micropatterned elastomer films revealed PS1(-/-) cell forces to be reduced by 50%. Pharmacological inhibition confirmed this function of gamma-secretase in adhesion site and cell force formation. On the regulatory level, PS1 deficiency was associated with strongly decreased phosphotyrosine levels of focal adhesion site-specific proteins. The reduced tyrosine phosphorylation was caused by a down-regulation of c-Src kinase activity primarily at the level of c-Src transcription. The direct regulatory connection between PS1 and c-Src could be identified with ephrinB2 as PS1 target protein. Overexpression of ephrinB2 cytoplasmic domain resulted in its nuclear translocation with increased levels of c-Src and a full complementation of the PS1(-/-) adhesion and phosphorylation phenotype. Cleavage of full-length EB2 and subsequent intracellular domain translocation depended on PS1 as these processes were only found in WT cells. Therefore, we conclude that gamma-secretase is vital for controlling cell adhesion and force formation by transcriptional regulation of c-Src via ephrinB2 cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1967759799,"The two transmitter binding sites of the neuromuscular acetylcholine (ACh) receptor channel contain several aromatic residues, including a tryptophan located on the complementary, negative face of each binding pocket. These two residues, Trp-55 in the epsilon subunit and Trp-57 in the delta subunit, were mutated (AEFHILRVY), and for most constructs the rate constants for acetylcholine binding and channel gating were estimated by using single channel kinetic analyses. The rate constants for unliganded channel opening and closing were also estimated for some mutants. From these measurements we calculated all of the equilibrium constants of the ""allosteric"" cycle as follows: diliganded gating, unliganded gating, dissociation from the C(losed) conformation, and dissociation from the O(pen) conformation. The results indicate the following. (i) These aromatic side chains play a relatively minor role in ACh receptor channel activation. (ii) The main consequence of mutations is to reduce the affinity of the O conformation of the binding site for ACh, with the effect being greater at the epsilon subunit. (iii) In epsilon (but not delta) the aromatic nature of the side chain is important in determining affinity, to a slightly greater degree in the O conformation. Phi value analyses (of both tryptophan residues) show Phi approximately 1 for both the ACh binding and diliganded gating reactions. (iv) This suggests that the structural boundaries of the dynamic elements of the gating conformational change may not be subunit-delimited, and (v) the mutated tryptophan residues experience energy changes that occur relatively early in both the ligand-binding and channel-gating reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2002539015,"In humans, the single polymorphic B locus of the major histocompatibility complex is linked to the microsatellite MIB. In rhesus macaques, however, haplotypes are characterized by the presence of unique combinations of multiple B genes, which may display different levels of polymorphism. The aim of the study was to shed light on the evolutionary history of this highly complex region. First, the robustness of the microsatellite MIB-linked to almost half of the B genes in rhesus macaques (Mamu-B)-for accurate B haplotyping was studied. Based on the physical map of an established haplotype comprising 7 MIB loci, each located next to a certain Mamu-B gene, two MIB loci, MIB1 and MIB6, were investigated in a panel of MHC homozygous monkeys. MIB1 revealed a complex genotyping pattern, whereas MIB6 analysis resulted in the detection of one or no amplicon. Both patterns are specific for a given B haplotype, show Mendelian segregation, and even allow a more precise haplotype definition than do traditional typing methods. Second, a search was performed for retroelements that may have played a role in duplication processes as observed in the macaque B region. This resulted in the description of two types of duplicons. One basic unit comprises an expressed Mamu-B gene, adjacent to an HERV16 copy closely linked to MIB. The second type of duplicon comprises a Mamu-B (pseudo)gene, linked to a truncated HERV16 structure lacking its MIB segment. Such truncation seems to coincide with the loss of B gene transcription. Subsequent to the duplication processes, recombination between MIB and Mamu-B loci appears to have occurred, resulting in a hyperplastic B region. Thus, analysis of MIB in addition to B loci allows deciphering of the compound evolutionary history of the class I B region in Old World monkeys."

The possibility of a fast exchange of ilicicolin between center N sites was excluded in two ways. First, kinetic modeling showed that fast movement of an inhibitor between monomers would result in a linear inhibition of the extent of cytochrome b reduction through center N. Second, we determined a very slow dissociation rate for ilicicolin (k = 1.2 × 10-3 s-1) as calculated from its displacement by antimycin. Ilicicolin binding to the reduced bc1 complex occurred in a single phase (kon = 1.5–1.7 × 105 m-1 s-1) except in the presence of stigmatellin, where a second slower binding phase comprising ∼50% of the spectral change was observed. This second kinetic event was weakly dependent on ilicicolin concentration, which suggests that binding of ilicicolin to one center N in the dimer transmits a slow (k = 2–3 s-1) conformational change that allows binding of the inhibitor in the other monomer.

Moser C.C. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Nature. 2004; 427: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The Rieske protein interacts with both monomers by traversing the membrane in a tilted angle from the vicinity of center N of one monomer to center P of the other monomer, where its movable extrinsic domain shuttles one electron at a time from QH2 to cytochrome c1.We have previously provided experimental evidence of the functional importance of the dimeric structure of the bc1 complex (reviewed in Ref. 6Covian R. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our results have indicated that only one center P in the dimer is able to oxidize QH2 when both center N sites are occupied by the tightly bound inhibitor antimycin but that electrons are able to reduce both bH hemes, implying electron crossover at the level of the bL hemes (7Covian R. Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15040-15049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We obtained more direct evidence for intermonomeric electron equilibration by blocking both center P sites and titrating cytochrome b reduction by QH2 through center N with antimycin (8Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In these experiments, non-linear inhibition by antimycin was obtained, and electrons were observed reaching the bH heme where antimycin had been bound before the addition of QH2. Assuming that antimycin did not dissociate from center N during the time scale of the experiments (<1 s), we interpreted these results as proof of electron equilibration between center N sites via the bL hemes. However, determination of dissociation constants for center N ligands is required to definitively discard alternative models that attempt to explain nonlinear titration curves in terms of fast exchange of inhibitor molecules between center N sites (9Bechmann G. Weiss H. Rich P.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Crofts A.R. Holland J.T. Victoria D. Kolling D.R. Dikanov S.A. Gilbreth R. Lhee S. Kuras R. Kuras M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1001-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).In the present work, we have analyzed the binding and dissociation kinetics of ilicicolin, a center N inhibitor with a lower affinity than antimycin but that binds almost stoichiometrically to the yeast bc1 complex in the μm range (11Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8708-8714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We show that the non-linear inhibition of cytochrome b reduction and the bH heme spectral shift induced by ilicicolin cannot be attributed to a fast exchange of the inhibitor between center N sites but instead reveals intermonomeric electron equilibration. Furthermore, we show that binding of ilicicolin is also sensitive to the center P occupants in a manner that indicates a dimeric regulation of the bc1 complex based on the position of the extrinsic domain of the Rieske protein. These results support a dimeric mechanism of half-of-the-sites regulation of the bc1 complex that involves non-rate-limiting electron movement between cytochrome b subunits (12Covian R.

Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), except that dodecylmaltoside concentration was increased to 0.05% in the elution buffers and the volume of DEAE-Bio Gel A was reduced to 25 ml to increase the yield of active enzyme. Quantification of the bc1 complex was performed as described before (18Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1972; 247: 1012-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 25.6 mm-1 cm-1 at 563–579 nm for the average absorbance of the bH and bL hemes in cytochrome b (20Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Inhibition of the Pre-steady State Reduction of the bH Heme and Determination of Spectral Shift by Ilicicolin-Pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome b was followed at room temperature by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using the OLIS rapid scanning monochromator as described before (18Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For these experiments, 3 μm bc1 complex was incubated with 3.6 μm stigmatellin and the indicated concentration of ilicicolin for 5 min in assay buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mm sodium azide, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20. The reaction was started by rapid mixing against an equal volume of the same buffer containing 30 μm DBH2. For each experiment, 8–10 data sets were averaged after subtracting the oxidized spectrum. The time course of absorbance changes at 563–579 nm were extracted using software from OLIS and exported to the Origin 5.0 program (OriginLab Corp.).Spectra from each kinetic trace collected between 0.2 and 0.3 s were averaged using the OLIS software and exported to Origin. To determine spectral shift displacements induced by ilicicolin bound before the addition of DBH2, the average spectrum collected in the absence of ilicicolin was normalized to create a reference spectrum that was subtracted from those collected in the presence of different ilicicolin concentrations. The normalization procedure has been described previously (8Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and involves converting to zero the absorbance of each spectrum at two reference wavelengths and then equalizing the maximum absorbance for the bH heme in the reference spectrum to that of each spectrum collected with ilicicolin. In the present work, we decided to use the isosbestic points at 516 and 569 nm as reference wavelengths instead of 539 and 579 nm, which are minimum absorbance values for cytochrome c1 and b, respectively, resulting in more symmetrical ilicicolin-induced spectral shifts than those reported before in the presence of antimycin (8Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22732-22740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Kinetic Modeling-Cytochrome b reduction was simulated using the Dynafit program (Biokin Ltd.), which allows the generation of time-dependent data according to different reaction mechanisms described as a series of kinetic steps (21Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). The script files describing the mechanisms used for simulations are provided as supplemental data. In all models, an extinction coefficient of 36 mm-1 cm-1 was assumed for bH reduction based on a 70% contribution of this heme to the total absorbance of cytochrome b (22Rich P.R. Jeal A.E. Madgwick S.A. Moody J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).All models assumed equilibration of the oxidized dimer (E) with ilicicolin (I) to form three possible complexes (E·I, I·E, and I·E·I). In the model that allowed intermonomeric electron transfer, association (konI) and dissociation rate constants (koffI) of 0.15 × 106 m-1 s-1 and 1 × 10-3 s-1, respectively, were used for ilicicolin based on experimental values we report in this work. QH2 binding and oxidation at center N resulted in reduction of the bH heme and formation of SQ either at half of the dimer (symbolized as SQ·bHE, EbH·SQ) or at both monomers (SQ·bHEbH·SQ), where the bH symbol at either side of the dimer (E) stands for a reduced bH heme. In complexes with an oxidized bH (SQ·bHE and EbH·SQ), the electron was allowed to equilibrate with the other monomer (to form SQ·EbH or bHE·SQ) with a rate that was varied in the simulations. SQ was then allowed to reduce the bH heme that was left oxidized due to the intermonomeric electron transfer to form complexes in which the two bH hemes were in the reduced state and Q was bound at either center N site (Q·bHEbH or bHEbH·Q). Rates for the individual reaction steps are included in the supplemental data file scripts.A second model used the same values for konI and koffI as above but assumed different rates of inhibitor exchange between monomers, resulting in interconversion between E·I and I·E. Because no intermonomeric electron transfer was assumed in this model, the only pathway for reduction of a bH heme was by QH2 oxidation to form SQ (SQ·bHE, EbH·SQ and SQ·bHEbH·SQ). A final model did not allow electron transfer or inhibitor exchange between monomers but assumed different higher values for the dissociation rate of the inhibitor (koffI) while maintaining the koffI/konI ratio to preserve the same overall binding affinity.Determination of the Dissociation Rate of Ilicicolin from Center N-The rate of displacement of ilicicolin from center N by antimycin was measured spectroscopically in an Aminco DW-2a spectrophotometer. The dithionite-reduced spectrum of 4 μm bc1 complex was collected between 520 and 640 nm and stored as a baseline before the addition of 10 μm ilicicolin and incubation for 5 min. The spectrum with ilicicolin was collected and stored and was considered as representing time 0. After the addition of 10 μm antimycin, spectra were collected every 2 min. The difference in absorbance between 566 and 559 nm, corresponding to the antimycin-induced spectral shift of the bH heme, was plotted relative to the time 0 spectrum and fitted to a monophasic exponential function in Origin.Kinetics of Inhibitor Binding to the bc1 Complex-Purified bc1 complex was diluted to 4 μm in the same buffer used for pre-steady state experiments, reduced with dithionite, and mixed rapidly against an equal volume of buffer containing different concentrations of ilicicolin. Where indicated, 5 μm myxothiazol or stigmatellin or different concentrations of DBH2 were added to the enzyme 2 min before rapid mixing. The fully reduced spectrum before mixing was stored as a baseline and subtracted from all subsequent scans, 8–10 data sets were averaged, and the time course of absorbance change at selected wavelengths was exported to the Origin program. The difference in absorbance between the peak (560 nm) and trough (566 nm) of the spectral shift induced by ilicicolin binding was plotted and fitted to monophasic or biphasic exponential functions.RESULTSNon-linear Inhibition of Cytochrome b Reduction by Ilicicolin-The pre-steady state reduction of the stigmatellin-bound bc1 complex by DBH2 at different ilicicolin concentrations is shown in Fig. 2. Cytochrome b reduction kinetics were compared with a model that assumed non-rate-limiting intermonomeric electron equilibration (see supplemental data for details), which was able to reproduce the different increase in inhibition at low and high ilicicolin concentrations (Fig. 2A, solid curves). This non-linear inhibition in the extent of cytochrome b reduction (Fig. 2B, circles) was simulated by assuming that inhibition of one center N site per dimer by ilicicolin still allowed both monomers to be reduced to the same extent as dimers with no inhibitor (Fig. 2B, solid curve). The lack of contribution of center P to cytochrome b reduction in the presence of stigmatellin during the time scale of the assay was indicated by the lack of cytochrome c1 reduction (Fig. 2B, inset).FIGURE 2Inhibition of the pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome b (cyt b) through center N by ilicicolin. A shows the reduction traces of 1.5 μm stigmatellin-inhibited cytochrome bc1 complex by 15 μm DBH2 preincubated in the presence of increasing ilicicolin concentrations (from 0 to 1.2 ilicicolin/bc1 monomer in 0.085 intervals). Solid curves correspond to the simulated kinetics at each ilicicolin concentration assuming intermonomeric electron transfer between center N sites at a rate of 500 s-1 (see supplemental data for details). The maximum extent of reduction at each ilicicolin concentration is shown in B (solid circles) taken from the spectra collected at 0.25 s (inset). The solid curve represents the expected extent of cytochrome b reduction assuming that dimers with only one ilicicolin bound contribute to the total absorbance as much as dimers with no ilicicolin. Enzyme-inhibitor complexes were calculated using the equilibration model described in the supplemental data assuming association and dissociation rates for ilicicolin of konI = 1.5 × 105 m-1 s-1 and koffI = 1 × 10-3 s-1, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Unimpeded electron equilibration of both cytochrome b subunits through only one center N site per dimer is consistent with fast electron transfer between monomers. However, an alternative model (9Bechmann G. Weiss H. Rich P.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that is still invoked to explain non-linear inhibition curves in the bc1 complex (10Crofts A.R. Holland J.T. Victoria D. Kolling D.R. Dikanov S.A. Gilbreth R. Lhee S. Kuras R. Kuras M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1001-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) proposes the existence of fast intermonomeric movement of tightly bound inhibitors between center N sites. As shown by the simulation in Fig. 3, such a mechanism would result in linear inhibition of cytochrome b reduction by a center N inhibitor. Interestingly, the same kinetic pattern was obtained irrespectively of the value assigned to the rate of the hypothetical intermonomeric inhibitor exchange (not shown), as long as both center N sites are assumed to be simultaneously active. Because movement of an inhibitor between monomers would still result in the same fraction of inhibited center N sites, linear inhibition curves would always be expected in such a mechanism. A variant of this model in which the dissociation rate (koffI) for the center N inhibitor was increased while maintaining the koff/kon ratio constant also yielded a linear decrease in the extent of cytochrome b reduction together with a loss of stoichiometric binding (see supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 3Simulation of the inhibition of pre-steady state reduction by an inhibitor that moves between center N sites. Simulated kinetic traces at the same concentrations of ilicicolin as in Fig. 2 were obtained assuming a rate of inhibitor movement of 500 s-1 between the two active sites in the dimer and no intermonomeric electron transfer (A). Identical curves were obtained with rates ranging from 0 to 50,000 s-1 (see supplemental data for details on the model). cyt b, cytochrome b.

Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8708-8714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, if substoichiometric concentrations of ilicicolin are bound to the oxidized and center P-blocked bc1 complex before the addition of DBH2, no spectral shift is expected to occur unless electrons can equilibrate into the bH heme of the ilicicolin-bound center N from the uninhibited monomer. As shown in Fig. 4, such a shift was observed within the first 300 ms after the addition of DBH2 (Fig. 4A). The amplitude of the ilicicolin-induced shift corresponded to the expected proportion of dimers with one inhibitor bound per dimer (Fig. 4B). This observation indicates that electrons entering the dimer through the uninhibited center N can reach the bH heme in the opposite monomer in a few hundred ms, unless ilicicolin is assumed to move within this time scale from an oxidized to a reduced center N site. This last possibility is in conflict with the kinetic analysis of Figs. 2 and 3 (see above) and also requires the doubtful assumption that the stable SQ formed in the vicinity of the reduced bH heme can dissociate rapidly to allow ilicicolin binding (8Covian R.

A shows the difference between the averaged spectra collected between 0.2 and 0.3 s at the indicated ilicicolin/bc1 monomer ratios and the average and normalized spectra collected in the absence of ilicicolin. B shows the maximal amplitude of the spectral shift induced by ilicicolin at different inhibitor/bc1 monomer ratios. The solid curve represents the relative change in concentration of dimers with only one ilicicolin bound at a center N site obtained at different inhibitor/enzyme ratios. Enzyme-inhibitor complexes were calculated using the equilibration model described in the supplemental data assuming association and dissociation rates for ilicicolin of konI = 1.5 × 105 m-1 s-1 and koffI = 1 × 10-3 s-1, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Slow Dissociation of Ilicicolin from Center N-To examine the possibility of fast ilicicolin dissociation from center N and reequilibration in the dimer, the dissociation rate of this inhibitor was determined by measuring the rate of its displacement by antimycin, which binds more tightly to center N and generates a distinct red shift in the spectrum of reduced bH heme (16Von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Antimycin binds to available center N sites within a few hundred ms when added at μm concentrations (12Covian R. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30925-30932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, when ilicicolin was already bound to center N, the antimycin-induced red shift occurred simultaneously with the disappearance of the blue shift caused by bound ilicicolin. The time scale of the displacement by antimycin was in the order of tens of minutes (Fig. 5B), yielding a dissociation rate of (koffI = 1.2 × 10-3 s) for ilicicolin. This value was unmodified by the presence of center P inhibitors during the displacement assay or by varying the concentrations of ilicicolin and antimycin (data not shown), indicating that antimycin and ilicicolin are competing only for center N and not for some unspecific hydrophobic site in the enzyme or in the detergent micelles to which the inhibitors might need to bind before gaining access to center N. These results conclusively exclude the possibility of fast movement of ilicicolin between center N sites because this would require a fast dissociation rate from center N that should have resulted in a much faster replacement by antimycin than was experimentally observed.FIGURE 5Rate of ilicicolin displacement from center N by antimycin. A shows the spectral shift generated after the addition of 10 μm ilicicolin to 4 μm fully reduced bc1 complex and incubation for 5 min (dashed spectrum). 10 μm antimycin was then added, and subsequent spectra (solid traces) were collected every 2 min, showing the simultaneous loss of the blue shift and appearance of a red shift, which indicate ilicicolin dissociation and antimycin binding, respectively. The time course of the spectral red shift induced by the binding of antimycin is shown in B. The solid curve corresponds to the fitting of the data to a one-exponential function, which yielded the indicated rate constant for ilicicolin dissociation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding Kinetics of Ilicicolin to Center N-The time course of ilicicolin binding to the vicinity of the bH heme showed monophasic kinetics in the presence of myxothiazol (Fig. 6A) or in the absence of center P inhibitors (not shown). In contrast, stigmatellin induced a change in the kinetics of ilicicolin binding that resulted in two kinetic phases, each comprising approximately half of the spectral shift amplitude (Fig. 6B). The first phase had a rate similar to that observed when center P was unoccupied or bound with myxothiazol. As shown in Fig. 7A, this fast phase was dependent on ilicicolin concentration, indicating that it was limited by the diffusion of the inhibitor to center N. However, the second slower phase observed only in the presence of stigmatellin was very weakly dependent on the concentration of ilicicolin, suggesting that a relatively slow change in conformation at half of the center N sites was limiting binding of the inhibitor.FIGURE 6Binding kinetics of ilicicolin to center N. The time-dependent increase in the amplitude of the blue shift generated by rapid mixing of 60 μm ilicicolin with 4 μm dithionite-reduced bc1 complex was determined after equilibrating the enzyme with myxothiazol (A) or stigmatellin (B). The best fit to either a single exponential (A) or a double exponential (B) function is shown as solid curves. A single exponential function in B (dashed curve) resulted in a worse fit as determined by comparing the residual plots (inset) resulting from the single (top) and double (bottom) exponential fits.

https://openalex.org/W1981701741,"Pyramidal neurons in the piriform cortex from olfactory-discrimination trained rats show enhanced intrinsic neuronal excitability that lasts for several days after learning. Such enhanced intrinsic excitability is mediated by long-term reduction in the post-burst after-hyperpolarization (AHP) which is generated by repetitive spike firing. AHP reduction is due to decreased conductance of a calcium-dependent potassium current, the sIAHP. We have previously shown that learning-induced AHP reduction is maintained by persistent protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) activation. However, the molecular machinery underlying this long-lasting modulation of intrinsic excitability is yet to be fully described. Here we examine whether the CaMKII, which is known to be crucial in learning, memory and synaptic plasticity processes, is instrumental for the maintenance of learning-induced AHP reduction. KN93, that selectively blocks CaMKII autophosphorylation at Thr286, reduced the AHP in neurons from trained and control rat to the same extent. Consequently, the differences in AHP amplitude and neuronal adaptation between neurons from trained rats and controls remained. Accordingly, the level of activated CaMKII was similar in pirifrom cortex samples taken form trained and control rats. Our data show that although CaMKII modulates the amplitude of AHP of pyramidal neurons in the piriform cortex, its activation is not required for maintaining learning-induced enhancement of neuronal excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2065254954,"Background Neural activation patterns proceed often by schemes or motifs distributed across the involved cortical networks. As neurons are correlated, the estimate of all possible dependencies quickly goes out of control. The complex nesting of different oscillation frequencies and their high non-stationariety further hamper any quantitative evaluation of spiking network activities. The problem is exacerbated by the intrinsic variability of neural patterns. Methodology/Principal Findings Our technique introduces two important novelties and enables to insulate essential patterns on larger sets of spiking neurons and brain activity regimes. First, the sampling procedure over N units is based on a fixed spike number k in order to detect N-dimensional arrays (k-sequences), whose sum over all dimension is k. Then k-sequences variability is greatly reduced by a hierarchical separative clustering, that assigns large amounts of distinct k-sequences to few classes. Iterative separations are stopped when the dimension of each cluster comes to be smaller than a certain threshold. As threshold tuning critically impacts on the number of classes extracted, we developed an effective cost criterion to select the shortest possible description of our dataset. Finally we described three indexes (C,S,R) to evaluate the average pattern complexity, the structure of essential classes and their stability in time. Conclusions/Significance We validated this algorithm with four kinds of surrogated activity, ranging from random to very regular patterned. Then we characterized a selection of ongoing activity recordings. By the S index we identified unstable, moderatly and strongly stable patterns while by the C and the R indices we evidenced their non-random structure. Our algorithm seems able to extract interesting and non-trivial spatial dynamics from multisource neuronal recordings of ongoing and potentially stimulated activity. Combined with time-frequency analysis of LFPs could provide a powerful multiscale approach linking population oscillations with multisite discharge patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1994879450,"A new circadian variant was isolated by screening the intercross offspring of wild-caught mice (Mus musculus castaneus). This variant was characterized by an initial maintenance of damped oscillations and subsequent loss of rhythmicity after being transferred from light-dark (LD) cycles to constant darkness (DD). To map the genes responsible for the persistence of rhythmicity (circadian ratio) and the length of free-running period (tau), quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed using F(2) mice obtained from an F(1) cross between the circadian variant and C57BL/6J mice. As a result, a significant QTL with a main effect for circadian ratio (Arrhythmicity; Arrh-1) was mapped on Chromosome (Chr) 8. For tau, four significant QTLs, Short free-running period (Sfp-1) (Chr 1), Sfp-2 (Chr 6), Sfp-3 (Chr 8), Sfp-4 (Chr 11) were determined. An epistatic interaction was detected between Chr 3 (Arrh-2) and Chr 5 (Arrh-3). An in situ hybridization study of clock genes and mouse Period1::luciferase (mPer1::luc) real-time monitoring analysis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) suggested that arrhythmicity in this variant might not be attributed to core circadian mechanisms in the SCN neurons. Our strategy using wild-derived variant mice may provide a novel opportunity to evaluate circadian and its related disorders in human that arise from the interaction between multiple variant genes."
https://openalex.org/W2120570889,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder caused by impaired phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). This condition results in hyperphenylalaninemia and elevated levels of abnormal phenylalanine metabolites, among which is phenylacetic acid/phenylacetate (PA). In recent years, PA and its analogs were found to have anticancer activity against a variety of malignancies suggesting the possibility that PKU may offer protection against cancer through chronically elevated levels of PA. We tested this hypothesis in a genetic mouse model of PKU (PAHenu2) which has a biochemical profile that closely resembles that of human PKU. Plasma levels of phenylalanine in homozygous (HMZ) PAHenu2 mice were >12-fold those of heterozygous (HTZ) littermates while tyrosine levels were reduced. Phenylketones, including PA, were also markedly elevated to the range seen in the human disease. Mice were subjected to 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) carcinogenesis, a model which is sensitive to the anticancer effects of the PA derivative 4-chlorophenylacetate (4-CPA). Tumor induction by DMBA was not significantly different between the HTZ and HMZ mice, either in total tumor development or in the type of cancers that arose. HMZ mice were then treated with 4-CPA as positive controls for the anticancer effects of PA and to evaluate its possible effects on phenylalanine metabolism in PKU mice. 4-CPA had no effect on the plasma concentrations of phenylalanine, phenylketones, or tyrosine. Surprisingly, the HMZ mice treated with 4-CPA developed an unexplained neuromuscular syndrome which precluded its use in these animals as an anticancer agent. Together, these studies support the use of PAHenu2 mice as a model for studying human PKU. Chronically elevated levels of PA in the PAHenu2 mice were not protective against cancer."
