Ubiquitinated H2B (uH2B) has been identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and mutation of the conserved ubiquitination site is shown to confer defects in mitotic cell growth and meiosis. uH2B was not detected in rad6 mutants, which are defective for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc2, thus identifying Rad6 as the major cellular activity that ubiquitinates H2B in yeast."

Its regulation is needed to protect tissues from inflammation, but mice with a disrupted gene for the complement regulator decay accelerating factor were normal. Mice that were deficient in another murine complement regulator, Crry, were generated to investigate its role in vivo. Survival of Crry-/- embryos was compromised because of complement deposition and concomitant placenta inflammation. Complement activation at the fetomaternal interface caused the fetal loss because breeding to C3-/- mice rescued Crry-/- mice from lethality. Thus, the regulation of complement is critical in fetal control of maternal processes that mediate tissue damage."

Deletion of ureI prevents this activation of cytoplasmic urease that is essential for bacterial acid resistance. UreI is an inner membrane protein with six transmembrane segments as shown by in vitro transcription/translation and membrane separation. Expression of UreI in Xenopus oocytes results in acid-stimulated urea uptake, with a pH profile similar to activation of cytoplasmic urease. Mutation of periplasmic histidine 123 abolishes stimulation. UreI-mediated transport is urea specific, passive, nonsaturable, nonelectrogenic, and temperature independent. UreI functions as a H+-gated urea channel regulating cytoplasmic urease that is essential for gastric survival and colonization."

Plants grown in colder temperatures have a higher content of trienoic fatty acids. Transgenic tobacco plants in which the gene encoding chloroplast omega-3 fatty acid desaturase, which synthesizes trienoic fatty acids, was silenced contained a lower level of trienoic fatty acids than wild-type plants and were better able to acclimate to higher temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2073565085,"Taxol, an antitumor agent derived from a plant, mimics the action of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice but not in humans. Although Taxol is structurally unrelated to LPS, Taxol and LPS are presumed to share a receptor or signaling molecule. The LPS-mimetic activity of Taxol is not observed in LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice, which possess a point mutation in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4); therefore, TLR4 appears to be involved in both Taxol and LPS signaling. In addition, TLR4 was recently shown to physically associate with MD-2, a molecule that confers LPS responsiveness on TLR4. To determine whether TLR4·MD-2 complex mediates a Taxol-induced signal, we constructed transformants of the mouse pro-B cell line, Ba/F3, expressing mouse TLR4 alone, both mouse TLR4 and mouse MD-2, and both mouse MD-2 and mouse TLR4 lacking the cytoplasmic portion, and then examined whether Taxol induced NFκB activation in these transfectants. Noticeable NFκB activation by Taxol was detected in Ba/F3 expressing mouse TLR4 and mouse MD-2 but not in the other transfectants. Coexpression of human TLR4 and human MD-2 did not confer Taxol responsiveness on Ba/F3 cells, suggesting that the TLR4·MD-2 complex is responsible for the species specificity with respect to Taxol responsiveness. Furthermore, Taxol-induced NFκB activation via TLR4·MD-2 was blocked by an LPS antagonist that blocks LPS-induced NFκB activation via TLR4·MD-2. These results demonstrated that coexpression of mouse TLR4 and mouse MD-2 is required for Taxol responsiveness and that the TLR4·MD-2 complex is the shared molecule in Taxol and LPS signal transduction in mice.

Soc. 1971; 93: 2325-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (3800) Google Scholar), is an antitumor agent that blocks mitosis by binding and stabilizing microtubules (2.Schiff P.B. Fant J. Horwitz S.B.

Ding et al. (4.Ding A.H. Porteu F. Sanchez E. Nathan C.F. Science. 1990; 248: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) found that Taxol induces the secretion of tumor necrosis factor and down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor receptors in murine macrophages. Although the structure of Taxol is quite different from that of lipopolysaccharide (LPS),1 Taxol has been shown to possess many LPS-like activities, such as tyrosine phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein kinases (5.Ding A. Sanchez E. Nathan C.F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5596-5602PubMed Google Scholar), induction of LPS-inducible gene expression (6.Manthey C.L. Brandes M.E. Perera P.-Y. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2459-2465PubMed Google Scholar), and activation of NFκB (7.Perera P.-Y. Qureshi N. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 878-884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Taxol mimics the actions of LPS on murine macrophages but not on human LPS-responsive cells including macrophages (8.Allen J.N. Moore S.A. Wewers M.D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 122: 374-381PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Lee L.-F. Schuerer-Maly C-C. Lofquist A.K. van Haffften-Day C. Ting J.P-Y. White C.M. Martin B.K. Haskill J.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1303-1308PubMed Google Scholar). LPS contains polysaccharide and lipid A portion, the latter of which mediates many LPS responses (10.Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Several synthetic and natural lipid A analogs, which lack LPS-like activities, have been shown to retain the ability to block LPS-induced cellular responses (11.Qureshi N. Takayama K. Kurtz R. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 441-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Christ W.J. Asano O. Robidoux A.L.C. Perez M. Wang Y. Dubuc G.R. Gavin W.E. Hawkins L.D. McGuinness P.D.

Fujishima S. Kawata T. Christ W.J. Kanazawa M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: 900-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Taxol-induced signaling events in murine macrophages are blocked by some of these LPS antagonists, suggesting that LPS and Taxol share a receptor or signaling molecule (14.Manthey C.L. Qureshi N. Stutz P.L. Vogel S.N. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although the target of the antagonists was not defined well, membrane-bound CD14 (mCD14), which has been demonstrated to be involved in LPS-induced signaling events on macrophages (15.Fenton M.J. Golenbock D.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), might not be the target, because the LPS antagonists suppress LPS-induced signaling under conditions in which it does not block LPS binding to mCD14 (16.Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the observation that Taxol signaling was blocked by an LPS antagonist in a mutant macrophage cell line defective in mCD14 expression (17.Kirikae F. Kirikae T. Qureshi N. Takayama K. Morrison D.C. Nakano M. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 486-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of molecules shared in LPS- and Taxol-induced signaling will provide a new insight into the development of anti-inflammatory drugs. The LPS-mimetic activity of Taxol was not observed in macrophages from a spontaneous LPS-hyporesponsive mutant, C3H/HeJ mice (4.Ding A.H. Porteu F. Sanchez E. Nathan C.F. Science. 1990; 248: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 5.Ding A. Sanchez E. Nathan C.F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5596-5602PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Manthey C.L. Brandes M.E.

Analysis of recombinant inbred mice showed that the genes controlling the responses to LPS and Taxol were closely linked (4.Ding A.H. Porteu F. Sanchez E. Nathan C.F. Science. 1990; 248: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The Lpsgene, which has been shown to be responsible for LPS hyporesponsiveness in C3H/HeJ mice, was recently mapped to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. TLR4 from C3H/HeJ mice has a point mutation that causes a failure to activate NFκB (18.Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TLRs constitute a mammalian transmembrane protein family and are similar to Drosophila Toll in that they have extracellular domains containing leucine-rich repeats and a cytoplasmic portion homologous to the intracellular signaling domain of the type 1 interleukin-1 receptor (21.Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar, 22.Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Studies over the past few years have demonstrated that Drosophila Toll and mammalian TLRs play crucial roles in innate immune recognition (23.Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Although C3H/HeJ and generated TLR4-deficient mice show LPS hyporesponsiveness (20.Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expression of TLR4 is not sufficient to confer LPS responsiveness on the human embryonic 293 cell line and the mouse pro-B cell line, Ba/F3, implying a lack of a factor in the transformants (24.Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Ayres T.M. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 25.Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Expression of MD-2, a molecule that physically associates with TLR4 on the cell surface, with TLR4 has been demonstrated to confer LPS responsiveness on Ba/F3, which expresses neither TLR4 nor MD-2 (25.Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). These recent findings prompted us to determine whether the TLR4·MD-2 complex is the shared molecule in Taxol and LPS signaling. In this paper we demonstrate that the mouse TLR4·MD-2 complex mediates LPS-mimetic signal transduction by Taxol. RPMI 1640 medium and Taxol from Taxus brevifolia were purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Atlanta Biologica. LPS prepared from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 was purchased from List Biological Laboratories. B464 was provided by Eisai Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Tetra-HisTMantibody was purchased from Qiagen. BCA protein assay reagents were purchased from Pierce. All other chemicals used were of reagent grade or better. The cDNA encoding human MD-2 was described previously (25.Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding mouse TLR4 or mouse MD-2 were cloned in our own laboratory and will be described elsewhere. 2S. Akashi and K. Miyake, manuscripts in preparation. Restriction sites (XhoI and BamHI) were introduced by polymerase chain reaction, and the cDNAs were cloned into an expression vector, pEFBOS (26.Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acid. Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment encoding the FLAG epitope followed by the 6xHis epitope was introduced into the pEFBOS vector such that all expressed protein bore the FLAG and 6xHis epitope at the C termini. The mouse TLR4Δ cDNA encodes the truncated protein in which the cytoplasmic region encompassing C-terminal 134 amino acids (662–835) was deleted. The Ba/F3 cell line was obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). A Ba/F3 cell line stably expressing human TLR4, human MD-2, and p55IgκLuc, an NFκB-dependent luciferase reporter construct, was established as described previously (25.Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). The expression constructs were transfected into Ba/F3 cells, which express neither endogenous TLR4 nor MD-2 (25.Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar), by electroporation in the order of the construct encoding mouse TLR4 or TLR4Δ and followed by that encoding mouse or human MD-2. The mouse MD-2 construct was also transfected into Ba/F3 cells stably expressing human TLR4 (named Ba/hTLR4), which was established previously (25.Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). p55IgκLuc was finally introduced into the transfectant expressing mouse TLR4 and mouse or human MD-2. Expression of mouse TLR4 or TLR4Δ was confirmed by staining the C-terminal FLAG epitope, which was located inside the cells. Expression of mouse or human MD-2 was confirmed by immunoblotting with Tetra-HisTM antibody. Ba/F3 and Ba/F3 stable transformants were maintained as described previously (27.Miyake K. Yamashita Y. Ogata M. Sudo T. Kimoto M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3333-3340PubMed Google Scholar) except for the use of heat-inactivated (56 °C for 30 min) fetal bovine serum. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were inoculated into a 48-well dish (Corning) or 1.5-ml tube (Treff) at 2 × 105 cells/500 μl of cell culture medium. Taxol, LPS, and LPS antagonists were added as described in the figure legends. After stimulation at 37 °C for 4 h, cells were harvested and lysed in 50 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega Corp.), and then luciferase activity was measured using 5 μl of lysate and 25 μl of luciferase assay substrate (Promega Corp.). The luminescence was quantified with a luminometer (Berthold Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Genetic characterization of C3H/HeJ mice suggested that a point mutation in TLR4 affects Taxol responsiveness in mice (4.Ding A.H. Porteu F. Sanchez E. Nathan C.F. Science. 1990; 248: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 18.Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoil P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar, 19.Qureshi S.T. Lariviere L. Leveque G. Clermont S. Moore K.J. Gros P. Malo D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). It was left undetermined whether TLR4 directly mediates Taxol-induced signaling. To address this question, we examined Taxol responsiveness by measuring NFκB activation in a Ba/F3 stable transfectant expressing epitope-tagged mouse TLR4 (mTLR4), named Ba/mTLR4, and in a Ba/F3 stable transfectant expressing both mTLR4 and epitope-tagged mouse MD-2 (mMD-2), named Ba/mTLR4/mMD2. After Taxol stimulation, nuclear extracts were prepared to measure NFκB activation by means of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). As shown in Fig. 1 A, Taxol evidently induced NFκB activation in Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 cells under the condition in which NFκB activation was not found and slightly induced in Ba/F3 and parental Ba/mTLR4 cells, respectively. Similar results were obtained with LPS stimulation (Fig. 1 A) as described previously (25.Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Requirement of coexpression of mTLR4 and mMD-2 for noticeable NFκB activation by Taxol was more evident when Taxol dose response of Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 was compared with that of other strains (Fig.1 B). Activation of NFκB by Taxol was also determined by measuring luciferase activity in Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 cells transfected with an NFκB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid, p55IgκLUC. Taxol increased the luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 B). These results showed that the Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 transfectant acquired Taxol responsiveness.Figure 2Taxol responsiveness is conferred by mouse TLR4·MD-2 but not by human TLR4·MD-2. A, Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 or Ba/hTLR4/hMD2 cells were cultivated in cell culture medium or the medium containing 10 ng/ml LPS, 10 μm Taxol or 1% Me2SO. After a 4-h cultivation, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured. The barsindicate averages of duplicate wells; deviations from the mean were <10%. B, Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 (●) and Ba/hTLR4/hMD2 (○) cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of Taxol at 37 °C for 4 h, and then luciferase activity was measured. Data represent the averages of triplicate wells. Error bars indicate standard deviations. C, Indicated cells were incubated without (−) or with (+) 30 μm Taxol or 100 ng/ml LPS as described in the legend of Fig. 1 A. After incubation, nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to EMSA to measure NFκB activation as described previously (33). The results shown are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether a Taxol-induced signal was mediated by the TLR4 cytoplasmic portion, which is thought to be involved in LPS signaling events (21.Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar, 23.Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), we measured NFκB activation by Taxol in a Ba/F3 stable transfectant expressing both mMD-2 and epitope-tagged mouse TLR4 lacking the cytoplasmic portion (mTLR4Δ), named Ba/mTLR4Δ/mMD2, by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 1, NFκB was not activated through Taxol stimulation on Ba/mTLR4Δ/mMD2 cells, implying that the TLR4 cytoplasmic portion is required for Taxol signaling, and that expression of mMD-2 without TLR4 on Ba/F3 is not sufficient for Taxol responsiveness. To eliminate the possibility that the difference in Taxol responsiveness between the transfectants was due to the expression levels of TLR4 and MD-2 proteins, we examined the expression level of the tagged proteins by immunoblot analysis. The expression levels of mTLR4 or mTLR4Δ protein in Ba/mTLR4, Ba/mTLR4/mMD2, and Ba/mTLR4Δ/mMD2 were similar, and that of mMD-2 protein was higher in Ba/mTLR4Δ/MD2 cells than in Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 cells (data not shown). These results, taken together, demonstrate that coexpression of mTLR4 and mMD-2 enables Ba/F3 cells to activate NFκB noticeably by Taxol stimulation. Such a requirement for coexpression of TLR4 and MD-2 has also been reported in the case of LPS responsiveness on Ba/F3 cells (Ref. 25.Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 A), suggesting that the mTLR4·mMD-2 complex is the shared molecule in Taxol and LPS signaling. We also examined the effect of Taxol on NFκB activation in a Ba/F3 stable transfectant expressing epitope-tagged human TLR4 (hTLR4), epitope-tagged human MD-2 (hMD-2), and reporter gene p55IgκLUC, named Ba/hTLR4/hMD2. Taxol at 10 μminduced NFκB activation in Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 cells but not in Ba/hTLR4/hMD2 cells, although the level of reporter activity induced by 10 ng/ml LPS was similar in Ba/hTLR4/hMD2 and Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 cells (Fig.2 A). These results imply that the species specificity of Taxol responsiveness can be ascribed to the difference in the TLR4·MD-2 complex between mouse and man. In addition, Taxol-induced NFκB activation was measured in a Ba/F3 stable transfectant expressing hTLR4 and mMD-2, named Ba/hTLR4/mMD2, and in a Ba/F3 stable transfectant expressing mTLR4 and hMD-2, named Ba/mTLR4/hMD2, by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2 C, Taxol induced NFκB activation in Ba/hTLR4/mMD2 cells but not in Ba/mTLR4/hMD2 cells. These results suggest that mouse MD-2, but not human MD-2, is involved in Taxol signaling. To further confirm that the mTLR4·mMD-2 complex is the shared molecule in Taxol and LPS signaling, the effect of a synthetic lipid A analog, B464, which blocks LPS-induced TNF production in macrophages (13.Soejima K. Ishizaka A. Urano T. Sayama K. Sakamaki F. Nakamura H. Terashima T. Waki Y. Tasaka S. Fujishima S. Kawata T. Christ W.J. Kanazawa M. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Surgery. 1994; 116: 339-347PubMed Google Scholar), on Taxol-induced NFκB activation was examined. B464 inhibited LPS-induced NFκB activation in Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 and Ba/hTLR4/hMD2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, LPS-induced NFκB activation being completely blocked with a 100-fold higher dose of B464 in both the transfectants (Fig.3, A and B). Next, we examined whether B464 inhibits Taxol-induced NFκB activation in Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 C, Taxol-induced NFκB activation was also inhibited in these cells by B464 in a dose-dependent manner. Reporter activity induced by 1 μm Taxol was reduced by 73% when the cells were preincubated with a 6.3-fold concentration of B464 (10 μg/ml, 6.3 μm), which did not affect the basal reporter gene activity. This result is consistent with the previous finding that LPS antagonists inhibit the LPS-mimetic activity of Taxol in murine macrophages (14.Manthey C.L. Qureshi N. Stutz P.L. Vogel S.N. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that LPS-induced signaling is dependent on serum as a source of LPS-binding protein and/or soluble CD14 (15.Fenton M.J. Golenbock D.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Induction of signals by LPS in Ba/hTLR4/hMD2 cells, which do not express mCD14 (25.Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y.

Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar), has been demonstrated to be dependent on soluble CD14 in serum.2 To determine whether serum factor(s) is required for Taxol-induced signaling via mTLR4·mMD-2, the dependence of NFκB activation by Taxol on serum was examined in the Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 transfectant. As shown in Fig.4, luciferase activity was clearly increased by Taxol even in the absence of serum, and the reporter activity was further increased when cells were stimulated by Taxol in medium supplemented with 10% serum. On the other hand, LPS-induced NFκB activation was absolutely dependent on serum. These results show that serum factor(s) is not required for Taxol-induced signaling mediated by mTLR4·mMD-2. In this study, we show that Taxol responsiveness is acquired through the coexpression of mTLR4 and mMD-2 on Ba/F3 cells. Furthermore, the LPS antagonist, B464, blocks both LPS- and Taxol-induced signals mediated by mTLR4·mMD-2 complex. Taken together, these results demonstrate that mTLR4·mMD-2 complex mediates the LPS-mimetic activity of Taxol and that the complex is the shared molecule in Taxol and LPS signaling. The Taxol-induced signal via mTLR4·mMD-2 complex activates NFκB. It has been demonstrated that expression of a constitutively, active human TLR4 construct, the extracellular portion of which was replaced by CD4, induced the activation of NFκB and that the induced signal was mediated by adaptor protein MyD88, which associates with the cytoplasmic portion of TLR4, and subsequently by IRAK and TRAF6 (28.Medzhitov R.

Taxol-induced NFκB activation might be mediated by a similar pathway, as we found in this study that the cytoplasmic portion of mouse TLR4 was required for Taxol signaling. The fact that Taxol-induced NFκB activation shares this pathway with LPS signaling might be responsible for its LPS-mimetic activity. An important question to be addressed is whether TLR4·MD-2 complex can directly recognize extracellular stimulants such as LPS and Taxol. To determine whether mTLR4·mMD-2 complex is a receptor for Taxol, [3H]Taxol binding to Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 cells was compared with that of parental Ba/F3 cells, and we did not detect any significant Taxol binding to Ba/mTLR4/mMD2 cells. 3K. Kawasaki, unpublished observations. Previously, we had also examined whether LPS binds to hTLR4·hMD-2, but we did not detect significant LPS binding to hTLR4·hMD-2 complex.2 Thus, the mechanism of recognition of the stimulant by TLR4·MD-2 remains to be elucidated. If mTLR4·mMD-2 were a receptor for Taxol, the binding of only a minute amount of Taxol to mTLR4·mMD-2, undetectable under our binding assay conditions, might be sufficient to induce a signal. Alternatively, another molecule(s) might serve as an initial receptor for Taxol, and then the Taxol·receptor complex might be recognized by mTLR4·mMD-2. Recently, several proteins were identified as Taxol-binding proteins, such as CD18 (30.Bhat N. Perera P-.Y. Carboni J.M. Blanco J. Golenbock D.T. Mayadas T.N. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7335-7342PubMed Google Scholar) and HSP-90 (31.Byrd C.A. Bornmann W. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Pavletich N. Rosen N. Nathan C.F. Ding A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5645-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). One or both of these Taxol-binding proteins might serve as an initial receptor and mediate signals to mTLR4·mMD-2 complex. Interestingly, Taxol-induced signaling was mediated by mTLR4·mMD-2 complex but not by hTLR4·hMD-2 complex, implying that a Taxol-responsive domain exists in mTLR4·mMD-2 complex. Human TLR4 exhibited 69% amino acid sequence identity with mouse TLR4, and human MD-2 exhibited 66% amino acid sequence identity with mouse MD-2.2 The relatively low homology of TLR4 and/or MD-2 between man and mouse may be responsible for the species specificity of Taxol responsiveness on TLR4·MD-2. Our results shown in Fig.2 C suggest that mouse MD-2, but not human MD-2, is important for mediating Taxol signaling. However, the precise role of TLR4 and/or MD-2 in Taxol signaling remains to be elucidated. Because the structure of Taxol is quite different from that of LPS, the molecular mechanism underlying Taxol recognition might be different from that of LPS recognition. Therefore, identification of the Taxol-responsive domain in mTLR4 (or hTLR4)·mMD-2 complex will provide a new clue for understanding the mechanism underlying ligand recognition by TLR4·MD-2 complex. Such fundamental information concerning signal transduction through TLR4·MD-2 complex will also provide a novel insight for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs.

One hypothesis is that the rotavirus evokes intestinal fluid and electrolyte secretion by activation of the nervous system in the intestinal wall, the enteric nervous system (ENS). Four different drugs that inhibit ENS functions were used to obtain experimental evidence for this hypothesis in mice in vitro and in vivo. The involvement of the ENS in rotavirus diarrhea indicates potential sites of action for drugs in the treatment of the disease."

These diverse molecules serve a wide range of functions, from affecting the compressive properties of cartilage to growth factor reception.

However, genetic experiments in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, established that proteoglycans, and their associated glycosaminoglycans, are required for normal development of this invertebrate model organism (reviewed in Ref. 1.Selleck S.B.

Biochemical studies of proteoglycans from both Drosophilaand C. elegans have been reported. In addition to the glypican, Dally, a Drosophila syndecan has been identified and shown to be heparan sulfate-modified (15.Spring J. Paine-Saunders S.E. Hynes R.O. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although these findings collectively show that proteoglycans exist inDrosophila and C. elegans, performing critical functions during development, very little is known about the different glycosaminoglycan structures found in these organisms. A detailed understanding of proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan functions in these systems will require structural information that can be used in conjunction with genetic and molecular data. We therefore devised a method for structural analysis of glycosaminoglycan-derived disaccharides suitable for the relatively small samples that can be easily obtained from these animals. We have applied these methods toward identifying tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific distributions of glycosaminoglycans, as well as to characterize glycosaminoglycans in animals bearing mutations in ttv, a gene proposed to affect heparan sulfate biosynthesis. The following standard unsaturated disaccharides from heparan sulfate were purchased from Sigma: 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-(4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose (ΔUA-GlcNAc), 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-4-O-(4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose (ΔUA-GlcNS), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-(4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose (ΔUA-GlcNAc6S), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose (ΔUA2S-GlcNAc), 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose (ΔUA-GlcNS6S), 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose (ΔUA2S-GlcNS), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose (ΔUA2S-GlcNAc6S), 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-4-O-(4-deoxy-2-O-sulfo-α-l-threo-hex-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-glucose (ΔUA2S-GlcNS6S), and heparan sulfate (from bovine kidney). The following standard unsaturated disaccharides from chondroitin sulfate were obtained from Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA): 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-glucose (ΔDi-HA), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-galactose (ΔDi-0S), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-4-O-sulfo-d-galactose (ΔDi-4S), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-sulfo-d-galactose (ΔDi-6S), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(2-O-sulfo-β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-d-galactose (ΔDi-UA2S), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(2-O-sulfo-β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-4-O-sulfo-d-galactose (ΔDi-diSB), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(2-O-sulfo-β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-d-galactose (ΔDi-diSD) and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-4,6-di-O-sulfo-d-galactose (ΔDi-diSE), 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(2-O-sulfo-β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-4,6-di-O-sulfo-d-galactose (ΔDi-triS), chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4), chondroitinase ACII (EC 4.2.2.5), and chondro-4-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.9). Heparin lyase I (EC 4.2.2.7, heparinase I, heparinase), heparin lyase II (heparinase II, heparitinase II), and heparin lyase III (EC 4.2.2.8, heparinase III, heparitinase I) were obtained from Sigma and Seikagaku America. Senshu Pak Docosil (4.6 × 150 mm; particle size, 5 μm) was obtained from Senshu Scientific (Tokyo, Japan). Ultrafree-MC DEAE and Biomax-5 (5000 normal molecular weight limit) were obtained from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). All other chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade. Human urinary bikunin was purified as described previously (22.Ochiai H. Toyoda H. Onodera M. Shinbo A. Shinomiya K. Imanari T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1988; 36: 3726-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The chromatographic equipment included a gradient pump (L-7000), a chromato-integrator (D-7500) from Hitachi Instruments (San Jose, CA), a double plunger pump for the reagent solution (AA-100-S, Eldex Laboratories, Napa, CA), a sample injector with a 20-μl loop (model 7125, Reodyne, Rohnert Park, CA), a fluorescence spectrophotometer (RF-10AXL, Shimadzu Scientific, Columbia, MD), a column heater (CH-30), a dry reaction bath (FH-40), and a thermocontroller (TC-55) from Brinkman Instruments (Westbury, NY). Unsaturated disaccharides produced enzymatically from heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate were determined by a reversed-phase ion-pair chromatography with sensitive and specific postcolumn detection (23.Toyoda H. Yamamoto H. Ogino N. Toida T. Imanari T. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 830: 197-201Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A gradient was applied at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min on a Senshu Pak Docosil (4.6 × 150 mm) at 55 °C. The eluents used were as follows: A, H2O; B, 0.2m sodium chloride; C, 10 mmtetra-n-butylammonium hydrogen sulfate; D, 50% acetonitrile. The gradient program was as follows: 0–10 min, 1–4% eluent B; 10–11 min, 4–15% eluent B; 11–20 min, 15–25% eluent B; 20–22 min, 25–53% eluent B; 22–29 min, 53% eluent B; equilibration with 1% B for 20 min. The proportions of eluent C and D were constant at 12 and 17%, respectively. To the effluent were added aqueous 0.5%(w/v) 2-cyanoacetamide solution and 0.25 m sodium hydroxide at the same flow rate of 0.35 ml/min by using a double plunger pump. The mixture passed through a reaction coil (internal diameter, 0.5 mm; length, 10 m) set in a dry reaction temperature controlled bath at 125 °C and a following cooling coil (internal diameter, 0.25 mm; length, 3 m). The effluent was monitored fluorometrically (excitation, 346 nm; emission, 410 nm). Adult worms were obtained by collection from agar plates, washed, and separated from E. coli on a 0.25% Ficoll gradient as described (24.Nelson G.A. Roberts T.M. Ward S. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For the analysis of both C. elegans and Drosophila, whole animals or tissues were first lyophilized to dryness. Approximately 20 mg of lyophilized sample was then homogenized with 1.0 ml of acetone. The homogenate was washed with acetone and dried. The pellet was extracted in 1.0 ml of 0.5% SDS, 0.1 m NaOH, 0.8% NaBH4 for 16 h at room temperature with constant stirring. Two hundred μl of 1.0m sodium acetate and 300 μl of 1 m HCl were then added, the solution was filtered, and 200 μl of 1 mHCl was added to the filtrate. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Seven ml of ethanol was added to the supernatant and chilled for 2 h at 0 °C, and the crude glycosaminoglycan fraction collected by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting precipitate was dissolved in 250 μl of water. A 20-μl portion of the crude glycosaminoglycan solution was diluted to 100 μl with water and used for the determination of chondroitin sulfate. For chondroitinase digestion, 5 μl of 0.2 m Tris-acetate buffer (pH 8.0) and 10 μl of an aqueous solution containing chondroitinase ABC (50 mIU) and chondroitinase ACII (50 mIU) were added to a 20-μl portion of the sample solution and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. An 8-μl portion of this mixture was loaded onto the high performance liquid chromatograph. To 230 μl of crude glycosaminoglycan sample, 50 μl of 0.3m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) was added, and the solution was applied on an Ultrafree-MC DEAE membrane, which had been equilibrated with sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.15m NaCl. The fractions eluted with 1.0 m NaCl in the same buffer were collected, desalted with Biomax-5, evaporated, and resuspended in 12 μl of water in preparation of heparin lyase digestion. For the analysis of Drosophila heparan sulfate, 5 μl of 0.1 m acetate buffer (pH 7.0) with 10 mm calcium acetate and 15 μl of an aqueous solution containing heparin lyase mixture (Seikagaku America), heparin lyase I (1 mIU), heparin lyase II (1 mIU), and heparin lyase III (1 mIU) were added to a 5-μl portion of sample. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, and an 8-μl aliquot was loaded onto the high performance liquid chromatograph. For the analysis of heparan sulfate from C. elegans, chondroitin was removed from the crude glycosaminoglycan solution prior to heparin lyase digestions by chondroitinase treatment followed by separation with Ultrafree-MC DEAE membrane. Enzymatic digestion with a heparin lyase mixture was then carried out as described above, with the exception that Sigma enzymes were used. We usedtout-velu l(2)00681 mutants for our analysis, the only allele for which genetic studies have been described (13.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar).ttv/CyO, P[wt GFP] green fluorescent protein animals were self-crossed, and ttv/ttv third instar larvae were identified by the lack of green fluorescence derived from the green fluorescent protein marked CyO balancer chromosome. We established a protocol for highly reproducible and sensitive HPLC analysis of unsaturated disaccharides from chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate in C. elegansand Drosophila. The coefficient of variation for each unsaturated disaccharide was less that 5% (adultDrosophila, n = 5). The lower determination limits of the HPLC for chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate were approximately 0.5 and 1.5 ng, respectively. All results described below were reproduced in at least duplicate experiments. The complete digestion of material from C. elegans with both chondroitinase ABC and ACII released disaccharides that co-chromatographed with ΔDi-0S using reverse phase ion-pair chromatography (Fig. 1 B). The identity of ΔDi-0S was established using graphitized carbon chromatography, which can resolve ΔDi-0S and ΔDi-HA, showing that chondroitin is found in this invertebrate organism (data not shown) (25.Mada A. Toyoda H. Imanari T. Anal. Sci. 1992; 8: 793-797Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Digestion with chondroitinase ACII alone generated the same chromatographic profile obtained with ACII plus ABC, indicating that the majority of chondroitin contains glucuronic acid and not iduronic acid (data not shown). We did not detect ΔDi-4S, ΔDi-6S, and other over-sulfated disaccharides found in vertebrate chondroitin sulfate in these unfractionated glycosaminoglycan preparations from C. elegans, nor were we able to detect ΔDi-HA in our preparations.

The composition of disaccharides produced from heparan sulfates in worms, compared with that derived from bovine kidney, is provided in Table II.

Open table in a new tab As for the analysis of glycosaminoglycan from C. elegans, the identities of Drosophila disaccharides were established by comparison with standards using two distinct separation methods, reverse phase ion-pair (23.Toyoda H. Yamamoto H. Ogino N. Toida T. Imanari T. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 830: 197-201Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and graphitized carbon chromatography (25.Mada A. Toyoda H. Imanari T. Anal. Sci. 1992; 8: 793-797Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Digestion of unfractionated glycosaminoglycans from adult flies with chondroitinases yields disaccharides that co-chromatograph with ΔDi-0S and ΔDi-4S (Fig. 1 C). As we observed for material from C. elegans, the equivalent release of disaccharides with chondroitinase ACII compared with digestion with both ACII and ABC indicates that the majority of polymers are glucuronate containing and hence derived form chondroitin sulfate, not dermatan sulfate (data not shown). The identity of the 4S species was confirmed by its conversion to ΔDi-0S with chondro-4-sulfatase. Chondroitin sulfate from adult flies has a relatively low degree of sulfation, and as in the human serum protein bikunin, only 4-O-sulfated disaccharides are represented (26.Toyoda H. Kobayashi S. Sakamoto S. Toida T. Imanari T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 16: 945-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ΔDi-HA from Drosophila was not detectable using these methodologies. The disaccharide composition of adult Drosophila chondroitin sulfate is listed in TableI. Heparan sulfate disaccharides are also found in glycosaminoglycan preparations from adult flies (Fig. 2 C). Fly heparan sulfate shows a greater degree of complexity than samples from C. elegans, with ΔUA-GlcNAc, ΔUA-GlcNS, ΔUA-GlcNAc6S, ΔUA-GlcNS6S, ΔUA2S-GlcNS, and ΔUA2S-GlcNS6S species generated by digestion with a mixture of heparin lyases I, II, and III. To determine whether the material we detected in Drosophila is a typical heparan sulfate polymer, we identified the disaccharides released by treatment with heparin lyase I or III. Heparin lyase I generated ΔUA-GlcNS6S, ΔUA2S-GlcNS disulfated disaccharides, and ΔUA2S-GlcNS6S trisulfated disaccharide (data not shown). Heparin lyase III generated ΔUA-GlcNAc, ΔUA-GlcNS, ΔUA-GlcNAc6S, and ΔUA-GlcNS6S disaccharides (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that material from Drosophila has heparin lyase disaccharide profiles typical of heparan sulfate and is not the unusual glycosaminoglycan found in the snail Achatina futica that is resistant to heparin lyase I and III digestion (27.Kim Y.S. Jo Y.Y. Chang I.M. Toida T. Park Y. Lindhardt R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11750-11755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Overall, the proportion of sulfated disaccharides is high, representing about 69% of total compared with 47% in bovine kidney. The composition of unsaturated disaccharides produced from adult Drosophilaheparan sulfates is given in Table II. In vertebrates, structural variants of glycosaminoglycans show tissue-specific distributions (28.Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29.Lindahl B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26091-26094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine whetherDrosophila tissues also show reproducible differences in glycosaminoglycans we examined different tissues and developmental stages in parallel samples from whole adult bodies, ovaries, embryos, and third instar larvae. We detected reproducible differences in the disaccharide profiles of heparan sulfates isolated fromDrosophila (Fig. 3 and TableIII). For example, third instar larvae show a reduced percentage of ΔUA-GlcNS, compared with embryos and adults. Embryos show higher relative amounts of ΔUA-GlcNS6S compared with larvae, adults, or ovaries. Ovaries show a significantly higher proportion of ΔUA2S-GlcNS. The ratios of heparan sulfate to chondroitin sulfate also vary widely in Drosophila (Table VI). The ovary showed the greatest proportion of heparan sulfate (heparan sulfate:chondroitin sulfate, 0.74), with larvae showing the lowest (0.06). The degree of 4-O-sulfation of chondroitin sulfate also differed among tissues, ranging from 36% in the ovary to 11% in whole adult flies (Table I).Table IIICompositions of unsaturated disaccharides produced from heparan sulfates in DrosophilaUnsaturated disaccarideTotal amountΔUAGlcNAcΔUAGlcNSΔUAGlcNAc6SΔUAGlcNS6SΔUA2SGlcNSΔUA2SGlcNS6SIn dry tissueIn body%ng/mgngOvary29.828.21.114.920.85.241.61.7Embryo30.827.42.023.312.04.526.00.054Larva (3rd) Wild type37.720.61.619.215.35.611.94.4 ttv/CyO38.619.22.019.715.35.210.63.1 ttv/ttvNDaND, not detected.NDNDNDNDNDNDNDAdult30.826.83.118.317.43.627.35.5a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab One of the utilities of structural analyses of glycosaminoglycans in Drosophila andC. elegans is to examine the effects of removing specific gene functions on the sugar polymers synthesized in an intact animal. We have used the analytical methods we developed to examine glycosaminoglycans in animals bearing mutations in ttv, a gene with 56% amino acid identity to the vertebrate tumor suppressor gene, EXT1 (13.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Both EXT1 and 2have been shown to encode enzymes with heparan sulfate co-polymerase activity, suggesting that ttv may also affect the synthesis of heparan sulfate (14.Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). We examined glycosaminoglycans in third instar larvae homozygous for a null allele of ttv. ttv mutant larvae show a marked reduction in heparan sulfate, to levels at least 10-fold less than wild type (Fig.4 and Tables III and IV). The chromatograph shown in Fig. 4 represents material greater than 5000 Da that dissociates from DEAE membranes between 0.15 and 1.0 mNaCl. Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans in this fraction or with molecular mass less than 5000 Da (data not shown) are below the detection limits of our methods. Animals heterozygous forttv show a slightly reduced amount of heparan sulfate with the same disaccharide composition as wild type. Chondroitin sulfate, however, is unaffected by ttv, consistent withttv encoding a heparan sulfate-specific co-polymerase.Table IVRatios of heparan sulfate to chondroitin sulfate in DrosophilaTotal amount (HS)Total amount (CS)HS/CSIn dry tissueIn bodyIn dry tissueIn bodyng/mgngng/mgngOvary41.61.756.12.30.741Embryo26.00.05494.90.200.274Larva (3rd) Wild type11.94.4208.477.10.057 ttv/CyO10.63.1254.575.30.042 ttv/ttvNDaND, not detected.ND234.249.00.000Adult27.35.5269.053.80.101a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Many studies inDrosophila have documented the important role of proteoglycans in developmental patterning. Yet at the structural level, little is known about glycosaminoglycans in Drosophila orC. elegans, another model organism that offers a powerful array of genetic and molecular tools. We describe here a sensitive method for analysis of disaccharides derived from chondroitin and heparan sulfates in these model organisms. Chondroitin polymers are found in adult Drosophila and C. elegans.Chondroitin-derived disaccharides in C. elegans were not sulfated, and only ΔDi-4S was detected in Drosophila. This is in contrast to chondroitin sulfate found in cartilage from a wide range of animals, including the squid, in which the vast majority of disaccharides released by chondroitinase treatment are sulfated at either the 4 or 6-O position (30.Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Equivalent release of disaccharides with chondroitinase ABC and ACII, or ACII digestion alone, suggests that dermatan sulfate is either not found, or represented at very modest levels in Drosophila and C. elegans. It is interesting that the profiles of disaccharides generated by chondroitinase treatment of C. elegans andDrosophila material resemble those generated from treatment of human bikunin (26.Toyoda H. Kobayashi S. Sakamoto S. Toida T. Imanari T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 16: 945-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), an abundant serum protein component of the inter-α-trypsin inhibitor family of protease inhibitors (reviewed in Ref. 31.Salier J.P. Rouet P. Raguenez G. Daveau M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This suggests that the chondroitin-modified proteins in these invertebrates may include protease regulators. In fact, a gene with striking homology to mouse bikunin is found in C. elegans,showing greater than 40% amino acid identity over a stretch of 100 amino acids (GenBankTM accession number U64857). TheC. elegans gene encodes a protein most similar to tissue factor pathway inhibitor, a member of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor/Kunitz family of protease inhibitors. Heparin lyase treatment of glycosaminoglycans from Drosophila and C. elegansreleases disaccharides found in vertebrates. Our analysis provides the first direct evidence for disaccharides bearing N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfations in these organisms. We did not detect ΔUA2S-GlcNAc or ΔUA2S-GlcNAc6S in either of these organisms using the methods that we developed for microdetermination of glycosaminoglycans, but it remains possible that these forms exist, albeit at levels below our current detection limits. Our methods, using heparin lyase digestion of small quantities of crude glycosaminoglycans, is not suitable for detection of 3-O-S sequences. We plan further characterization of heparan sulfate fromDrosophila and C. elegans using larger scale preparation of purified material and NMR spectroscopy. Our findings show that enzymes required for biosynthesis and modification of heparan sulfate must exist in Drosophila andC. elegans. Indeed, genes encoding proteins with significant homology to EXT1 (13.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar),N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (10.Lin X. Buff E.M. Perrimon N. Michelson A.M. Development. 1999; 126: 3715-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), C5 glucuronyl epimerase (GenBankTM accession number P46555), and heparan-sulfate sulfotransferase (12.Sen J. Goltz J.S. Stevens L. Stein D. Cell. 1998; 95: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 32.Merrill C. Bayraktaroglu L. Kusano A. Ganetzky B. Science. 1999; 283: 1742-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) enzymes from vertebrates are represented in Drosophila and C. elegans. Our analysis of ttv (see below) indicates that like its vertebrate homolog, EXT1, Ttv affects heparan sulfate biosynthesis. Structural studies of glycosaminoglycans from animals bearing mutations in these genes will show which genes are required for the generation of specific glycosaminoglycan forms in vivo. One of the most striking features of glycosaminoglycans is their structural diversity, with discrete structural variants found in different tissues (28.Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 33.Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Specific forms of heparan sulfate are also associated with different disease states and ages (29.Lindahl B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26091-26094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34.Feyzi E. Saldeen T. Larsson E. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13395-13398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that different forms of heparan sulfate are important for influencing the biological function of the associated proteoglycan. To determine whether Drosophila could provide a model system for exploring the function of different heparan sulfate structural variants, we examined glycosaminoglycans from different developmental stages and tissues. Indeed, Drosophila does show tissue- and stage-specific modifications of both heparan and chondroitin sulfate. For example, levels of ΔUA-GlcNS6S are relatively higher in embryos compared with larvae and adults. Given the importance of GlcN 6-O-sulfate groups for binding several growth factors (reviewed in Ref. 33.Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) the levels of these disaccharides are potentially important in regulating growth factor signaling throughout development (36.Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 37.Kreuger J. Prydz K. Pettersson R.F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The differences in 2-O-sulfated disaccharides in the ovary compared with other tissues and stages is worthy of note. Recently it has been shown that pipe, a gene required for establishing dorsal-ventral polarity in the embryo, encodes a protein related to heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase (12.Sen J. Goltz J.S. Stevens L. Stein D. Cell. 1998; 95: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). pipeis expressed only in the ventral follicle cells of the ovary that surround the developing oocyte, and is required for the proteolytic activation of the protein ligand, Spätzle. Spätzle in turn activates Toll, a Drosophila homologue of the vertebrate interleukin 1 receptor that specifies ventral cell fates in the future embryo (reviewed in Ref. 38.Roth S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R906-R910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that 2-O-sulfated heparan sulfate disaccharides are found in the ovary, in a proportion distinct from that found in embryos, whole adults, or larvae. These findings show that a heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase must exist in Drosophila,and the homology of pipe to vertebrate proteins with this activity suggests that the pipe could provide this function. One of the utilities of organisms like Drosophila and C. elegans is that they provide the means of determining the effects of specific genes on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis in whole animals. Using the methods we devised for disaccharide analysis inDrosophila, we examined glycosaminoglycans in animals bearing mutations in ttv, a gene encoding a protein with 56% amino acid identity to EXT1, a tumor suppressor with heparan sulfate co-polymerase activity (14.Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). We isolated glycosaminoglycans from third instar larvae homozygous for a null allele ofttv. These animals showed a normal level of chondroitinase-sensitive disaccharides but markedly reduced levels of heparan sulfate-derived disaccharides. The heparan sulfate fraction that elutes from DEAE between 0.15 and 1.0 m NaCl and has a molecular mass of greater than 5000 Da was reduced to below detectable limits in ttv. Nor could we detect any material in the same DEAE fraction that passed through a 5000 Da filter (data not shown). Further study using larger quantities of purified glycosaminoglycans will be required to characterize exactly what heparan sulfate forms, if any, remain in ttv mutants. Our findings clearly show that the methods of microdetermination of heparan sulfate-derived disaccharides that we developed can be applied to the analysis of mutants, and demonstrate directly that ttv + is required for normal heparan sulfate levels in larvae. These data support the proposal that this gene does indeed encode a heparan sulfate glycosyltransferase (13.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). This finding has implications toward understanding the biological functions of EXT genes in vertebrates. Although it is clear that loss of EXT gene function promotes cartilaginous tumor formation, the molecular mechanism of EXT-mediated tumor suppression in not known. Based on the finding that ttv affects the distribution of Hedgehog in the developing wing, it has been hypothesized that loss of EXT function affects the levels of Indian Hedgehog at the growth plate (13.Bellaiche Y. The I. Perrimon N. Nature. 1998; 394: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Indian Hedgehog limits the rate of chondrocyte differentiation, and loss of EXT could disrupt cartilage formation via abnormalities in Indian Hedgehog distribution (39.Lanske B. Karaplis A.C. Lee K.

Dev. 1998; 71: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Our finding that ttv affects heparan sulfate levels provides a link between EXT functions in vertebrates and Drosophila. Recently, analysis of ttv mutants using a monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope generated by heparinase III digestion supports the conclusion that these animals are defective in heparan sulfate biosynthesis (35.The I. Bellaiche Y. Perrimon N. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar).

The molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying these biophysical processes are unknown. Recent studies have implicated both extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein (ERK/MAP) kinase and calpain (EC 3.4.22.17) in these processes, but it is uncertain whether these are two distinct pathways acting on different modes of motility. We report that cell deadhesion involved in epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-mediated fibroblast motility requires activation of M-calpain downstream of ERK/MAP kinase signaling. NR6 fibroblasts expressing full-length wild type epidermal growth factor receptor required both calpain and ERK activation, as demonstrated by pharmacological inhibitors (calpeptin and calpain inhibitor I and PD98059, respectively) for EGF-induced deadhesion and motility. EGF induced rapid activation of calpain that was preventable by molecular inhibition of the Ras-Raf-MEK but not phospholipase Cγ signaling pathway, and calpain was stimulated by transfection of constitutively active MEK. Enhanced calpain activity was not mirrored by increased calpain protein levels or decreased levels of its endogenous inhibitor calpastatin. The link between ERK/MAP kinase signaling and cell motility required the M-isoform of calpain (calpain II), as determined by specific antisense-mediated down-regulation.

Cell motility has been found to be a very complex biophysical process involving multiple factors working together to accomplish concerted movement. To begin to understand the molecular bases of motility, fibroblast cell motility has been deconstructed into four separate events: extension of the lammelipod, formation of new focal adhesions at the leading edge, breaking of adhesions at the trailing edge, and translocation of the cell mass (1.Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). Failure of any one of these steps is sufficient to prevent cell motility (2.Couchman J.R. Lenn M. Rees D.A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 36: 182-194PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Maheshwari G. Lauffenburger D.A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These motility events are regulated by both cell intrinsic and extrinsic properties (4.Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 5.Wells A. Gupta K. Chang P. Swindle S. Glading A. Shiraha H. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 395-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Among the latter are regulatory inputs from growth factor receptors and the strength and nature of cell-substratum interactions. Previously, it had been demonstrated that motility of adherent cells occurs in a biphasic relationship to adhesiveness of the surface (6.Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsburg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar, 7.DiMilla P.A. Stone J.A. Quinn J.A. Albelda S.M. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that this also holds for growth factor-induced motility, in that epidermal growth factor (EGF)1receptor-mediated fibroblast motility is noted only at intermediate levels of cell adhesiveness to substrata (8.Ware M.F. Wells A. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2423-2432PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Maheshwari G. Wells A. Griffith L.G. Lauffenburger D.A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2814-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, signals that regulate adhesiveness to the substratum are of high importance, since the rear deadhesion of the cell from its substrate can be rate-limiting for motility under conditions of highly adhesive substrate and high speed motility (10.Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsburg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 11.Palecek S. Huttenlocher A. Horwitz A.F. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in NR6 fibroblasts results in acute retraction of cell processes (12.Welsh J.B. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which is mirrored by partial deadhesion from substratum and loss of focal adhesions (13.Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta D. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over the time period (2–6 h) required for NR6 cells to reorganize into a motile phenotype, much adhesiveness is regained, but it probably remains lower than during the sessile state (9.Maheshwari G. Wells A. Griffith L.G. Lauffenburger D.A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2814-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Despite this at least partial restoration of adhesiveness, interference reflection microscopy-demonstrable focal adhesions remain absent for at least 30 h (13.Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta D. Chang P.

Thus, it appears that EGFR signaling not only contributes to acute alterations in the nature of the cell-substratum adhesions but also promotes turnover of adhesions throughout sustained motility. We have shown that this acute deadhesion requires signaling through the ERK/MAP kinase pathway; EGF-induced focal adhesion disassembly was prevented by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 but still occurred in the absence of PLCγ signaling (13.Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta D. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which ERK/MAP kinases affect cell-substratum adhesiveness is still unsettled, with at least two possibilities proposed in the literature. One pathway is via myosin light chain kinase activation and subsequent contraction leading to motility (14.Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. deLanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), presumably leading to traumatic disruption of trailing adhesions with integrins shed onto the substratum (15.Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar, 16.Palecek S.P. Schmidt C.E. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 941-952PubMed Google Scholar). A second proposal is that ERK/MAP kinase alters inside-out signaling by preventing activation of integrins (17.Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), although the actual linkages are not detailed. Recently, a well known enzyme has been implicated in regulating cell-substratum adhesions. Calpain (EC 3.4.22.17), a calcium-dependent neutral protease that cleaves its target proteins in a limited fashion, has been shown to be required for both detachment of trailing cell tails and cell spreading (10.Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsburg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Horwitz, Huttenlocher, and colleagues (10.Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that inhibition of calpain in αIIbβ3 and α5β1 integrin-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells limited rear detachment of cells migrating on fibrinogen and fibronectin, respectively. Inhibition of calpain also led to an increase in tail length, minimal retraction of the rear of the cell, and decreased movement of the cell body, consistent with the failure to detach trailing edges. Under conditions of moderate to high adhesiveness, cells leave behind patches of integrins on the substrate as they move forward, which can be visualized by staining with anti-integrin fluorescent antibodies. Inhibition of calpain in αIIbβ3-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells reduced the appearance of these patches (10.Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsburg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This suggests that cleavage of the intracellular portion of integrins by calpain is important in regulating rear detachment in migrating cells. Calpain inhibition would stabilize the integrin-cytoskeletal linkage and thus increase the likelihood of integrin detachment from the extracellular matrix and not from the cell. Calpain inhibition also led to increased stability of peripheral focal adhesions, probably also due to increased integrin-cytoskeletal stabilization (10.Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsburg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Calpain also plays a role in mediating adhesion in nonadhesive cell types, namely lymphocytes and platelets (19.Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 20.Cooray P. Yuan Y. Schoenwaelder S.M. Mitchell C.A. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Calpain has been reported to facilitate the spreading of the lammelipod in NIH-3T3 cells (18.Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The use of NIH-3T3 cells that overexpress calpastatin, the endogenous calpain inhibitor, allowed examination of the dependence of cell spreading and actin modification on calpain. Inhibition of calpain suppressed the early filopodal and lammelipodal protrusion formation and eliminated the appearance of staining for F-actin at the lamellar border. These effects may have resulted from malformation of the actin network in the forming lammelipod, perhaps due to inhibition of calpain cleavage of ezrin, an actin-binding protein (18.Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 21.Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These data may appear to conflict with the activity of calpain in rear detachment; however, the basic role of calpain may be to facilitate turnover of focal adhesions and other forms of cell-substratum contacts, which would require both formation and disruption in the motile cell, but in a spatially regulated manner. We hypothesized that calpain may be a critical effector for EGFR-mediated deadhesion and cell motility, since the roles in turnover of adhesions seemed to be superficially similar. Herein, we demonstrate that a growth factor acutely activates calpain and that this occurs via the ERK/MAP kinase pathway and not the calcium-mobilizing PLCγ pathway. Previously, we had shown that EGF-induced motility was also abrogated by PD98059 in parallel with blocking focal adhesion disassembly (13.Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta D. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this strongly suggested, but did not prove, that deadhesion was a rate-limiting step for motility, since ERK/MAP kinases may have had numerous other downstream effects. By finding that calpain is downstream of ERK and that activation of calpain is necessary for EGFR-mediated cell deadhesion from substratum, we also could ascertain that this deadhesion was critical for EGFR-mediated cell motility. Last, we demonstrate that the calpain isoform required for EGFR-mediated motility is the M-isoform (22.Johnson G.V.W. Guttman R.P. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23.Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Calpeptin, calpain inhibitor-1, E-64-d, all calpain (M-clone 107–82, Mu-clone 9A4H8D3) and calpastatin (clone 1F7E3D10) antibodies, U73122, and ERK antisense and control oligonucleotides were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). PD98059 was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All cell culture reagents and Lipofectin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fugene transfection reagent was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. pFCMEK1 (active MEK) was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Human recombinant EGF was obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA. All other buffer reagents, ionomycin, puromycin, dichlorotriazinylaminofluorescein (DTAF), Me2SO, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. NR6 mouse fibroblasts transfected with either wild-type human EGFR (WT NR6) or a signaling-restricted construct lacking all autophosphorylation motifs c′973 (c′973 EGFR) (24.Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K.B. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 25.Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) were cultured using minimum essential medium (MEM)-α plus 26 mm sodium bicarbonate with 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm MEM, nonessential amino acids, and the antibiotics penicillin, streptomycin, and G418 (350 μg/ml) as the growth medium. Cells were quiesced at subconfluence using restricted serum conditions without G418 (MEM-α plus 26 mm sodium bicarbonate with 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm MEM nonessential amino acids, and the antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin) for 18–24 h prior to experiments. EGF-induced migration was assessed by the ability of the cells to move into an acellular area (24.Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K.B. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). WT NR6 cells were plated on a six-well plastic dish and grown to confluence in MEM-α with 7.5% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h quiescent in the media with 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, an area was denuded by a rubber policeman at the center of the plate. The cells were then treated with or without EGF (1 nm) and incubated at 37 °C; inhibitors or diluent alone were added at the same time as EGF. Photographs were taken at 0 and 24 h, and the relative distance traveled by the cells at the acellular front was determined. Cell-substratum adhesiveness was quantitated using an inverted centrifugation detachment assay. 24-well plates were coated with the human extracellular matrix Amgel (0.5 μg/ml) (26.Siegal G.P. Wang M.-H. Rinehart C.A. Kennedy J.W. Goodly L.J. Miller Y. Kaufman D.G. Singh R.K. Cancer Lett. 1993; 69: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature, after which they were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at room temperature. The plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and utilized for the following experiment. Cells were plated at a concentration of 105 cells/ml with quiescent medium into Amgel coated plates and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. Plates were filled with MEM-α with 1% bovine serum albumin and 25 mm HEPES. Then plates were sealed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay sealing tape (Corning, Cambridge, MA) and centrifuged inverted for 5 min at 3000 rpm at 37 °C using a Beckman CS6R plate centrifuge; 3000 rpm (1643 × g) was chosen empirically as the force required to detach approximately half of the EGF-treated cells. Before and after the centrifugation, the number of cells on the plates was counted by phase-contrast microscopy. Three different assays were used to assess calpain activity in stimulated cells. The first assay, referred to in this paper as microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-DTAF, measures calpain activity in cell lysates; the second, succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-aminomethylcoumarin (AMC), determines calpain activity in whole cells after treatment; the last assay, Boc, detects calpain activity in individual living cells. Thus, these three assays measure calpain activity in distinct but complementary manners, using three different calpain-preferential substrates. The first assay was adapted from literature reports (27.Tompa P. Schad E. Baki A. Alexa A. Batke J. Friedrich P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) was labeled with DTAF by incubation of MAP2 and DTAF in pH 8.5 PIPES buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Labeled MAP2 was then isolated by size exclusion column chromatography and dialyzed against pH 7.5 HEPES buffer overnight. Cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm tissue culture plates and quiesced for 24 h. After a 1-min treatment with EGF (10 nm), cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with cell lysis buffer (20 nm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium vanadate). After removing the cell debris by centrifugation, 0.9 μg of DTAF-labeled MAP2 was added to the samples with either 0 or 0.1 mm free Ca2+ concentration. Fluorescence was immediately measured by an Aminco-Bowman Series II spectrofluorimeter (Spectronic Instruments Inc., Rochester, NY) at excitation and emission wavelength of 490 and 520 nm, respectively, for 3 min at room temperature. The AMC assay was modified from literature reports (18.Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In short, cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm tissue culture plates and quiesced overnight. EGF (10 nm) was then added for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with 3 ml of 0.05% trypsin with 0.53 mm EDTA for 3 min. Three ml of complete medium was added to neutralize the trypsin, and the cells were collected. Cells were pelleted in microcentrifuge tubes (7.5 × 105cells/tube) and washed with Hanks' buffered salt solution twice. Cells were resuspended in Hanks' buffered salt solution at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were then held on ice for up to 1 h. The Aminco-Bowman spectrofluorimeter was warmed to 37 °C using an attached water bath. Of each sample, 96 μl was added to a 0.2-ml quartz cuvette and allowed to warm in the fluorometer to 37 °C. At time −1 min, ionomycin (2.5 μm) in Me2SO was added to the cell suspension (Me2SO alone was the control). At time 0, 50 μm AMC (Enzyme Systems Products) was added to bring the total volume to 100 μl, and fluorescence was measured immediately at excitation of 360 nm and emission of 460 nm for 3 min. To determine calpain activity in single cells, enabling transient transfections of dominant-negative and constitutively active constructs, as well as antisense oligonucleotides, we utilized the Boc assay (28.Rosser B.G. Powers S.P. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 268: 23593-23600Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 50% confluence on glass coverslips. The cells were then either treated with drug inhibitors and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to 1 h or transfected using the manufacturer's protocol for Lipofectin (Life Technologies) or Fugene (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) lipid transfection reagents and incubated for 18–24 h. The cells (drug-treated or transfected) were then incubated for 20 min in the presence of 50 μm t-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Met-chloromethylaminocoumarin (Boc-LM-CMAC) (Molecular Probes) and treated with 10 nm EGF for 10 min; control cells were not treated with EGF. Boc-LM-CMAC is retained within the cells by conjugating with intracellular thiol groups. Cleavage of the substrate results in retention of the chloromethylaminocoumarin portion of the molecule in the cell and results in increased fluorescence. The coverslips were then wet mounted on glass slides and observed for chloromethylaminocoumarin fluorescence using an Olympus fluorescent microscope (model BX40 with an Olympus M-NUA filter). Representative images of each slide were captured using a SPOT CCD camera. The image exposure settings were identical within each experiment (i.e. for treatment with and without EGF) but did vary slightly between experiments; thus, one can directly compare fluorescence intensity within an experiment but not between experiments. Transfected cells were identified by observing expression of green fluorescent protein, which was co-transfected with the plasmid or oligonucleotide of interest (Olympus M-NIBA filter). Levels of calpain I, calpain II, and calpastatin were assessed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies (Biomol). The isoform-specific role of calpain activity (24.Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K.B. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 29.Chen P. Murphy-Ullrich J. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in cell motility was determined by down-regulating each calpain using antisense phosphothiorate-linked oligonucleotides. Cells were treated with 20 μmoligonucleotide (Life Technologies, Inc.) throughout the cell motility assay. The oligonucleotides were designed to hybridize with the initiation codon for each isoform (5′-ACTCCTCTGTCATCCTGGGG-3′ for Mu-calpain (calpain I) and 5′-TGCCCGCCATGGTAGCGATC-3′ for M-calpain (calpain II)), with the two oligonucleotides serving as controls for each other. To evaluate efficacy of down-regulation of calpain, we analyzed calpain levels under conditions similar to those seen during the productive locomotion phase (9.Maheshwari G. Wells A. Griffith L.G. Lauffenburger D.A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2814-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) of the motility experiment. Briefly, cells were treated with EGF (10 nm) and oligonucleotide for 6 h to deplete the pre-existing calpain. Cells were then incubated for a further 12–14 h in the presence of oligonucleotide but not EGF to allow for recovery from EGF exposure but prevent de novocalpain synthesis. Subsequently, calpain activation by EGF was assessed after a brief (10-min) pulse with EGF. Isoform-specific calpain degradation was assessed by immunoblotting with antibodies (Biomol) at specific times after EGF (10 nm) exposure in the presence of puromycin (40 μm). A central postulate of our model of EGF-induced motility is that calpain activity is required for fibroblast morphology changes and locomotion. Therefore, we first determined whether inhibition of calpain would affect that motility. Using an in vitro wound healing assay, the calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, limited EGF-induced cell migration in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1). Since calpeptin can also block activation of Rho-kinase (30.Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Cooray P. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1694-1702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), a second inhibitor was also utilized, calpain inhibitor I. This agent also prevented EGF-induced cell migration (Fig. 1). Inhibition of calpain limited EGF-induced mitogenesis only at higher concentrations of agents (data not shown). These data show that calpain activity is needed for EGFR-mediated motility but do not yet define active involvement in EGFR signaling. The next question was which biophysical event was dependent on calpain signaling. Our model, based on the reports of calpain in adhesion turnover (10.Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsburg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 18.Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), implicates calpain during deadhesion noted acutely upon EGFR activation. Using an inverted centrifugation assay, which enables the detection of changes in adhesiveness of even still tightly adherent cells (9.Maheshwari G. Wells A. Griffith L.G. Lauffenburger D.A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2814-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31.Shiraha H. Gupta K. Glading A. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 243-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that inhibition of calpain by either agent limited EGFR-mediated de-adhesion (Fig.2). At a force empirically defined as that needed to dislodge approximately half the cells upon EGF treatment for 30 min but few if any of untreated NR6 cells, both calpeptin and calpain inhibitor I prevented EGF-induced cell deadhesion. It is interesting to note that the inhibitors alone slightly lessened the fraction of adherent cells. This would be consistent with the concept that calpain is needed for adhesion turnover and maintenance (18.Potter D.A. Tirnauer J.S. Janssen R. Croall D.E. Hughes C.N. Fiacco K.A. Mier J.W. Maki M. Herman I.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We had earlier reported that EGFR-mediated focal adhesion disassembly was signaled via the ERK/MAP kinase pathway (13.Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta D. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That deadhesion was similarly signaled was demonstrated both molecularly and pharmacologically. First, the MEK inhibitor PD98059, which blocks EGF-induced motility (13.Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta D. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also prevents deadhesion of NR6 cells expressing the full-length WT EGFR (Fig.3 A). Second, using a signaling-restricted EGFR that activates the ERK/MAP kinase pathway but not the PLCγ pathway (24.Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K.B. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 32.Vega Q. Cochet C. Filhol O. Chang C.-P. Rhee S.G. Gill G.N. Mol. Cel"

Cardiac excitation is uncoupled from contraction at the level of the myofilaments. Selective proteolysis of the thin filament protein troponin I has been correlated with stunned myocardium. Here, transgenic mice expressing the major degradation product of troponin I (TnI 1–193 ) in the heart were found to develop ventricular dilatation, diminished contractility, and reduced myofilament calcium responsiveness, recapitulating the phenotype of stunned myocardium. Proteolysis of troponin I also occurs in ischemic human cardiac muscle. Thus, troponin I proteolysis underlies the pathogenesis of a common acquired form of heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W1993924886,"It has been reported that free hemoglobin (Hb) reacts with NO at an extremely high rate (K(Hb) approximately 10(7) M(-1) s(-1)) and that the red blood cell (RBC) membrane is highly permeable to NO. RBCs, however, react with NO 500-1000 times slower. This reduction of NO reaction rate by RBCs has been attributed to the extracellular diffusion limitation. To test whether additional limitations are also important, we designed a competition test, which allows the extracellular diffusion limitation to be distinguished from transmembrane or intracellular resistance. This test exploited the competition between free Hb and RBCs for NO generated in a homogenous phase by an NO donor. If the extracellular diffusion resistance is negligible, then the results would follow a kinetic model that assumes homogenous reaction without extracellular diffusion limitation. In this case, the measured effective reaction rate constant, K(RBC), would remain invariant of the hematocrit, extracellular-free Hb concentration, and NO donor concentration. Results show that the K(RBC) approaches a constant only when the hematocrit is greater than 10%, suggesting that at higher hematocrit, the extracellular diffusion resistance is negligible. Under such a condition, the NO consumption by RBCs is still 500-1000 times slower than that by free Hb. This result suggests that intrinsic RBC factors, such as transmembrane diffusion limitation or intracellular mechanisms, exist to reduce the NO consumption by RBCs."

We have recently characterized a closely related isoform, DYRK1B, that is predominantly expressed in testis and muscle (3.Leder S. Weber Y. Altafaj X. Estivill X. Joost H.-G. Becker W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The homolog of DYRK1A and DYRK1B in Drosophila, the protein kinase MNB, is encoded by the minibrain gene whose mutation results in specific defects in the development of the central nervous system (4.Tejedor F.

The human gene for DYRK1A is located in the “Down syndrome critical region” of chromosome 21, and the similarity of DYRK1A and MNB suggests that the triplication of the DYRK1Agene may play a role in mental retardation of patients with Down syndrome (5.Guimerá J.

DYRK1A, DYRK1B, and MNB belong to a subfamily of protein kinases with structurally related catalytic domains and similar enzymatic properties (2.Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J.

Biol. 1999; 62: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). At least 7 different DYRK-related kinases exist in mammals, of which DYRK1A and DYRK1B are targeted to the nucleus, whereas DYRK2 and DYRK3 are located in the cytoplasm (2.Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,3.Leder S. Weber Y. Altafaj X. Estivill X.

Members of the DYRK family have also been found in lower eukaryotes, such as Yak1p inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (11.Garrett S. Broach J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), Pom1p inSchizosaccharomyces pombe (12.Bähler J. Pringle J.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1356-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and YAKA inDictyostelium discoideum (13.Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar). Although mutations inYAK1, pom1, and yakA have diverse phenotypic consequences, it appears reasonable to generalize that DYRK-related kinases are involved in the regulation of growth and development. The enzymatic activity of DYRK1A has been shown to depend on the presence of tyrosine residues in the activation loop, a result that suggests an activation mechanism similar to that of the MAP2 kinases (1.Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schürmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, the participation of DYRK1A or other DYRK-related kinases in a particular signal transduction pathway has not been elucidated so far. The selective recognition of the correct substrates by protein kinases is an important biochemical mechanism that underlies the specificity of cellular responses to various stimuli. It is therefore important to define the structural determinants of substrate recognition by DYRK1A in order to understand its function in the regulation of cellular processes. In this study, we have identified the phosphorylation site for DYRK1A in the in vitro substrate, histone H3. On the basis of this result, we designed a peptide library on cellulose paper (SPOT membrane) (14.Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 15.Frank R. Overwin H.

Ther. 1999; 82: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) to determine the consensus sequence for substrate recognition by DYRK1A. Sequence specificity of DYRK1A was similar to, but not identical with, that of the MAP kinase ERK2. This definition of the consensus phosphorylation sequence of DYRK1A should facilitate studies on physiological substrates of the kinase. The expression plasmids for GST-DYRK1A, GST-DYRK2, GST-DYRK3, and GST-CLK3 have been described earlier (1.Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schürmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H.

Acta. 1996; 1312: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). An NcoI site at base pair 1624 of the rat cDNA was used to create a C-terminal deletion (amino acids 500–763, numbering refers to Swiss-Prot accession number Q63470) in GST-DYRK1A-ΔC. GST-DYRK1A-ΔC was used in all phosphorylation reactions except for the experiment shown in Fig. 1 A. To construct an expression plasmid for GST-DYRK1B, the open reading frame of the longest splice variant (3.Leder S. Weber Y. Altafaj X. Estivill X. Joost H.-G. Becker W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH, catalog number HL1161x) with appropriate primers and inserted into the pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion proteins were partially purified fromEscherichia coli by affinity adsorption to glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (19.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Recombinant, active ERK2 prepared from E. coli containing constitutively active MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase was obtained from New England Biolabs. Protein substrates were purchased from the following suppliers: histone type II-S and MBP, Sigma; histone H3, H2B, and H4, Roche Molecular Biochemicals; GST-ELK-1307–428, New England Biolabs. Recombinant histone H3 (rH3) was prepared from bacterial inclusion bodies as described elsewhere (20.Himpel S. Joost H.G. Becker W. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Point mutants of rH3 were generated by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (21.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The DYRK phosphorylation site in histone H3 was reproduced in a synthetic peptide named H338–52 (PHRYRPGTVALREIR; the phosphorylation site is underlined). The sequence of a second peptide was designed as an optimized substrate for DYRK1A based on the results of the SPOT assay (RRRFRPASPLRGPPK, DYRKtide). Kemptide (LRRASLG), a substrate for cAMP-dependent kinases, and angiotensin (ATII, DRVYIHPF), a substrate for some dual-specificity kinases (22.Featherstone C. Russell P. Nature. 1991; 349: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 23.Yuan C.-J. Huang C.-Y. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17683-17686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were purchased from Sigma. For the determination of kinetic parameters, assays were performed with 5 or 6 different substrate concentrations that were arranged according to the method of Cleland (24.Cleland W.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1967; 29: 1-32PubMed Google Scholar). Substrates were incubated for 8 min (4 min with DYRKtide) at 30 °C with 100–200 pmol/ml GST-DYRK1A-ΔC in phosphorylation buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 μm[γ-32P]ATP (100–150 μCi/ml). Incorporation of32P into histone was determined in triplicate by dotting aliquots of the reaction mixture onto Whatman P-81 ion exchange paper, washing in 5% phosphoric acid (10 times for 5 min), and subsequent liquid scintillation counting. To control for linearity of the reaction, another aliquot was taken after 4 min (2 min for DYRKtide). The amount of 32P bound to P-81 paper in assays without substrate was subtracted as background. Apparent K mand V max values were derived by fitting the data into the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Graphpad Prism 1.03 program (GraphPad Software Inc.). To calculate specific enzyme activities, the amount of intact, catalytically active GST-DYRK1A-ΔC (88-kDa band) was estimated by comparison to known amounts of bovine serum albumin present in adjacent lanes of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Each substrate was assayed with two independent preparations of GST-DYRK1A-ΔC. For preparative purposes (mass spectrometry and protein sequencing), larger amounts of the kinase were used, and phosphorylation took place for 1–2 h. [γ-32P]ATP was added as needed to trace the reaction. Buffer and free ATP were removed by gel filtration through NAP desalting columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To achieve maximal incorporation of phosphate into rH3, conditions for phosphorylation were modified as follows. Seven nmol of rH3 were incubated at a concentration of 10 μm in phosphorylation buffer containing 500 μm ATP with 180 pmol GST-DYRK1A for 105 min at 30 °C. Fresh aliquots of the kinase (90 pmol) were added to the reaction mixture after 15, 30, and 45 min of incubation. To allow tracing of the phosphorylated histone in further steps, an equivalent, but 5-fold down-scaled reaction, was carried out in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (500 μCi/ml). After removing unincorporated 32P by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, products of both reactions were combined and lyophilized. A sample of 100 μg of lyophilized phosphorylated rH3 was dissolved in 3m guanidinium HCl, pH 4.5, containing 30% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.4% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and fractionated by RP-HPLC (Sephasil C-18 SC 2.1/10 column connected to a SMART system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0.42% (v/v) per min) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow of 100 μl/min. Phosphorylated rH3 was detected by Cerenkov counting, and its identification was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of the dried gel. For mass spectrometry, about 5–10 μg of lyophilized, phosphorylated, or unphosphorylated rH3 were dissolved in 1 μl of 33% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. After addition of 1 μl of matrix solution (saturated solution of sinapic acid in 33% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid), 0.5 μl of this solution was subjected to mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, Biflex III TOF, Bruker-Franzen Analytik). Spectra were produced by accumulating data from 200 laser shots (nitrogen laser, 337 nm, 3-ns pulse duration). Time to mass conversion was achieved by external calibration using cytochrome c(m/z = 12, 327 Da/e) and myoglobin (m/z= 16, 950 Da/e). After SDS-PAGE (16% gel) and electrophoretic transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore), radioactively labeled, phosphorylated rH3 was identified by autoradiography, cut, and subjected to acid hydrolysis with 6 m HCl for 1.5 h at 110 °C (25.Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The hydrolysate was lyophilized and resolubilized in 10 μl of water supplemented with carrier phosphoamino acids (2 μg/μl each of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine). Phosphoamino acids were separated by thin layer chromatography on cellulose plates (10 × 20-cm plates, 0.25-mm layer of cellulose 300 on glass, Macherey & Nagel) with a solution of isobutyric acid and 0.5m ammonium hydroxide (50/30, v/v) as the ascending solvent (26.Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Positions of phosphoamino acid standards were visualized by ninhydrin staining, and 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. For electrophoretic analysis, a sample of 600 μg of phosphorylated rH3 containing 4 × 106 cpm of 32P (Cerenkov counting) was proteolyzed with 12 μg of endoproteinase Glu-C (V8-protease, fromStaphylococcus aureus, sequencing grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 25 mm ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 7.8, at 26 °C. At different time points, aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed and prepared for gel electrophoresis by immediate addition of sample buffer and heating to 95 °C. Samples were subjected to Tricine/SDS-PAGE without urea (16.5% T, 6% C; gel size 17 × 18 cm × 1 mm; 40 mA, 330 V max) as described by Schägger and von Jagow (27.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Polypeptide SDS-PAGE molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad; triosephosphate isomerase, 26.6 kDa; myoglobin, 17.0 kDa; α-lactalbumin, 14.4 kDa; aprotinin, 6.5 kDa; insulin B-chain, oxidized, 3.5 kDa; and bacitracin, 1.4 kDa) were used to determine sizes of rH3 fragments. For autoradiography, gels were destained only until standards could just be evaluated since further treatment led to a diffuse band and higher background radioactivity. For preparative RP-HPLC and subsequent automated Edman sequencing, 190 μg of phosphorylated rH3 were digested by endoproteinase Glu-C at a weight ratio of 1:50 for 20 h as described above. The resulting digest was loaded on a Sephasil C-18 column (Super Pac Sephasil C18 5 μm, 4 × 250 mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and fractionated by developing the column with a linear acetonitrile gradient (0.5% acetonitrile/min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were manually collected and radioactivity was determined by Cerenkov counting. Peptides were dotted onto an untreated polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to N-terminal Edman degradation on a KNAUER protein sequencer 910 using the executive routine for proline-rich peptides. Phenylthiohydantoin amino acids were detected at 269 nm after separation by RP-HPLC through a C18 microbore column connected on line to the converter of the sequencer. The HPLC eluates were collected, lyophilized, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Since only a small fraction of the radioactivity was recovered in these eluates, wash solutions from the reaction chamber were also collected by manually changing the collection tube after the S2 wash preceding each cleavage reaction. Counts/min values of these fractions were approximately 40 times higher than those of the respective HPLC eluates. An array of 300 peptides was synthesized on cellulose paper (5.0 × 10.3 cm) as described (14.Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 15.Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of peptides on the SPOT paper by GST-DYRK1A-ΔC was essentially done as established for cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (16.Tegge W. Frank R. Hofmann F. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10569-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), except for adapting the buffers to the requirements of DYRK1A. The paper was moistened in ethanol and incubated overnight at room temperature in 15 ml of kinase buffer supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 100 mm NaCl but lacking ATP. The solution was decanted; 15 ml of kinase buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 μm ATP were added, and the reaction vessel was equilibrated at 30 °C for 45 min. After this blocking step, the buffer was changed for 13 ml of the reaction solution (kinase buffer supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (300 μCi/mmol)). The reaction was started by adding 17.6 μg (200 pmol) of GST-DYRK1A-ΔC, and the paper was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with slight agitation. After extensive washing (10 × 15 min in 1m NaCl, 3 × 5 min in H2O, 3 × 15 min in 5% H3PO4, 3 × 5 min in H2O, 2 × 2 min in ethanol), the paper was air-dried and incorporation of 32P into the peptides was evaluated by film autoradiography (exposure times of 1–3 d) and with the PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics). We have previously shown that calf thymus histones can be used as in vitro substrates for DYRK1A (1.Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schürmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 2.Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Of the different preparations of histones tested (including histone H2A, data not shown), histone H3 was the best substrate for DYRK1A (Fig.1). Fig. 1 shows also that a truncated construct of DYRK1A lacking the non-catalytic C-terminal domain (GST-DYRK1A-ΔC) is an active protein kinase with the same substrate specificity as undeleted DYRK1A. GST-DYRK1A-ΔC was used for all further experiments of this work since this construct appeared to have a higher specific activity than GST-DYRK1A when purified from recombinant E. coli. 3P. Panzer, H. Kentrup, and W. Becker, unpublished data. To avoid potential problems due to post-translational modifications or sequence microheterogeneity of histone H3 isoforms, we decided to use recombinant histone H3 (rH3) for the following experiments. Construction of the expression plasmid and the method to prepare bacterially expressed rH3 are presented elsewhere (20.Himpel S. Joost H.G. Becker W. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In order to determine the number of phosphorylation sites in rH3, we analyzed unphosphorylated and phosphorylated rH3 by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 2, A and B). Unphosphorylated rH3 was detected at a mass of 15,930 Da, close to the calculated mass of 15,925 Da (assuming cleavage of the N-terminal methionine). After phosphorylation by DYRK1A, a new peak appeared with a separation of plus 81 Da, corresponding with the addition of a single phosphate moiety to rH3 (80 Da). By phosphoamino acid analysis, only phosphothreonine was detected in DYRK1A-phosphorylated rH3 (Fig.2 C). Taken together, these data indicate that a single threonine residue in rH3 is phosphorylated by DYRK1A under our conditions. Endoproteinase Glu-C (protease V8) was used to generate peptides of phosphorylated rH3 suitable for sequencing. Even after prolonged digestion, two radioactively labeled bands were detected after electrophoretic separation in Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3 A). The sizes of these bands (4.4 and 4.9 kDa) did not match any of the expected cleavage products, indicating partial or nonspecific cleavage of the protein. Elution of these bands from the gel did not yield enough material to identify the phosphorylated amino acid by protein sequencing. The proteolytic fragments were therefore fractionated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 3 B). A single peak contained most of the32P radioactivity, and this material was further analyzed by automated Edman degradation. The N-terminal sequence, together with the size of the fragment, suggested that the residues Thr-32, 4Numbering of amino acids in histone H3 (Swiss-Prot accession number P06351) refers to the processed protein lacking the initiator methionine. Thr-45, and Thr-58 were the potential phosphorylation sites in this fragment. It should be noted that the cleavage site giving rise to this peptide (C-terminal of Lys-23) did not correspond with the known specificity of endoproteinase Glu-C (C-terminal of Glu or Asp). The irregular cleavage was reproduced with different batches of the proteinase and rH3. This surprising finding cannot easily be explained by an inadvertent modification of the recombinant H3, since we confirmed the amino acid sequence around the cleavage site by N-terminal sequencing of the protein. To determine the degradation cycle in which the labeled phosphate was released, the HPLC eluates of automated Edman degradation were collected for liquid scintillation counting (Fig. 3 C). A very similar profile as in Fig. 3 C was obtained by evaluation of the collected S2 washes (see “Experimental Procedures”). As noted by others (28.Wang Y. Fiol C.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Bell A.W. Hermodson M.A. Roach P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), 32P-containing products of the Edman reaction were inefficiently recovered from the reaction chamber, leading to extensive tailing of radioactivity peaks into the following cycles (Fig. 3 C). However, the significant increase in eluted radioactivity identified Thr-45 as the phosphorylated residue, whereas there was no increase after cleavage of the other relevant threonine residue, Thr-32. To confirm this result by an independent method, we generated mutants of each threonine in the 32P-containing proteolytic fragment (T32A, T45A, and T58A) and tested their phosphorylation by GST-DYRK1A-ΔC (Fig. 4). Incorporation of 32P into rH3 was abolished when Thr-45 was exchanged for alanine, whereas substitution of other threonine residues did not affect phosphorylation of rH3 by DYRK1A. This result shows that Thr-45 is the only residue in rH3 efficiently phosphorylated by DYRK1A. We have previously shown that DYRK-related kinases exhibit similar, but not identical, substrate specificity toward different histones (2.Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In order to assess whether these kinases recognize the same target site in rH3, we compared the phosphorylation of wild type rH3 and rH3-T45A by bacterial GST fusion proteins of DYRK1B, DYRK2, and DYRK3 (Fig.5). With all kinases of the DYRK family, incorporation of 32P into H3 was greatly reduced or completely abolished in the mutant protein, clearly indicating that Thr-45 is the main phosphorylation site in histone H3 for DYRK-related kinases. For comparison, GST-CLK3 was included as a more distantly related protein kinase (18.Becker W. Kentrup H. Heukelbach J. Joost H.-G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Large amounts of the kinase were required to achieve detectable phosphorylation of rH3, and no difference was observed between rH3 and rH3-T45A (Fig. 5). In order to ascertain that the amino acid residues flanking Thr-45 indeed determine substrate recognition by DYRK1A, a peptide containing 15 amino acids surrounding Thr-45 of histone H3 (H338–52) was synthesized and tested as a substrate for DYRK1A. To exclude the possibility that Tyr-41 might contribute to phosphate incorporation, a second peptide was synthesized that contained a phenylalanine at this position (H338–52Y41F). Both peptides were phosphorylated by DYRK1A to a similar degree, whereas selected peptide substrates of other kinases (Kemptide, angiotensin) were not recognized (Fig.6). For the further definition of the consensus phosphorylation sequence, we took advantage of the SPOT assay which offers the possibility to compare simultaneously a large number of different peptides as substrates for protein kinases (16.Tegge W. Frank R. Hofmann F. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10569-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17.Dostmann W.R.G. Nickl C. Thiel S. Tsigelny I. Frank R. Tegge W.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29.Toomik R. Edlund M. Ek P. Öbrink B. Engström L. Peptide Res. 1996; 9: 6-11PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the sequence of H338–52, a series of 300 peptides was designed, each harboring a single amino acid exchange. The peptides were synthesized as individual spots on a cellulose paper and phosphorylated by GST-DYRK1A-ΔC. Relative incorporation of radioactivity into each peptide was evaluated by autoradiography with the help of a storage phosphor screen (Fig. 7). The most striking effects of amino acid substitutions were observed at the phosphorylation site (P), at the position C-terminal to the phosphorylation site (P +1), and at two N-terminal positions (P −2 and P −3). First, exchange of the valine for proline at the P +1 position resulted in a 10-fold increase of peptide phosphorylation. DYRK1A also prefers a proline at the P −2 site. Second, an arginine residue is absolutely required at the P −3 site. Third, serine is preferredversus threonine as the phosphate acceptor, and no tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in this experiment.

This study shows that coexpression of β-arrestin with CXCR4 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells attenuated chemokine-stimulated G protein activation and inhibition of cAMP production. Truncation of the C-terminal 34 amino acids of CXCR4 (CXCR4-T) abolished the effects of β-arrestin on CXCR4/G protein signaling, indicating the functional interaction of the receptor C terminus with β-arrestin. On the other hand, receptor internalization and the subsequent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases were significantly promoted by coexpression of β-arrestin with CXCR4, whereas the C-terminal truncation of CXCR4 did not affect this regulation of β-arrestin, suggesting that β-arrestin can functionally interact with CXCR4 with or without the C terminus. Moreover, β2V54D, the dominant inhibitory mutant of β-arrestin 2, exerted no effects on CXCR4/G protein signaling, but strongly influenced receptor internalization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Further cross-linking experiments demonstrated that β-arrestin as well as β2V54D could physically contact both CXCR4 and CXCR4-T. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay showed that β-arrestin was able to bind efficiently in vitro to both the third intracellular loop and the 34-amino acid C terminus of CXCR4. Taken together, our data clearly establish that β-arrestin can effectively regulate different functions of CXCR4 and that this is mediated through its distinct interactions with the C terminus and other regions including the third loop of CXCR4.

Despite the increasingly prominent role of CXCR4 and SDF-1α in the regulation of HIV infection, little is known about the regulation of signal transduction of CXCR4. The classical mechanism of signal transduction is based on the work of the β2-adrenergic receptor, a well studied model system of the GPCR superfamily. Upon agonist stimulation, the receptors are phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent kinase A, protein kinase C, or G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK), followed by binding of an important regulator, arrestin. Arrestin proteins have been shown to play important roles in the desensitization and internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor and receptor-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (16.Pippig S.

Up to date, six members of the arrestin family have been cloned and characterized: visual arrestin, β-arrestins 1 and 2, X-arrestin, D-arrestin, and E-arrestin (19.Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Visual arrestin, which was originally named S-antigen, is a highly pathogenic protein and is responsible for induction of experimental autoimmune uveitis, a T-cell-mediated disease (20.Mochizuki M. Nussenblatt R.B. Kuwabara T. Gery I. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1985; 26: 226-232PubMed Google Scholar).

Studies on CXCR4 in leukocytes have revealed that CXCR4, in response to SDF-1α, can mediate many signaling events such as inhibitory G protein activation, receptor phosphorylation, internalization, inositol phosphate generation, and ERK phosphorylation (25.Ganju R.K.

In this study, we used the well established HEK 293 cell system to investigate the regulation by β-arrestin of the signaling and internalization of CXCR4. Our results demonstrate that β-arrestin effectively regulates the different functions of CXCR4 and, more interestingly, that the regulation by β-arrestin appears to be mediated via at least two distinct interaction sites on CXCR4. Human wild-type CXCR4 cDNA with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the N terminus and human β-arrestin 1 and 2 cDNA constructs were as described (27.Ling K. Wang P. Zhao J. Wu Y.L. Cheng Z.J. Wu G.X. Hu W. Ma L. Pei G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7922-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The human HA-tagged CXCR4-T (with a truncation of the C-terminal 34 amino acids of CXCR4) cDNA clone and β2V54D (the dominant inhibitory mutant of β-arrestin 2 with valine 54 substituted by aspartic acid) cDNA clone were constructed by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. All of the above constructs were in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The sequence of the CXCR4 third intracellular loop subdomain (amino acids 219–243) was generated by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequence of the GST-fused CXCR4 C-terminal (the last 34 amino acids in the C terminus) subdomain was inserted into pcDNA3. Authenticity of sequences was confirmed by DNA sequencing. SDF-1α was obtained from PeproTech (London, United Kingdom). HEK 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were plated on 60-mm tissue culture dishes at 1 × 106cells/dish in modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum 20 h before transfection. Transfection was performed using 2.0 μg of chemokine receptor and 2.0 μg of β-arrestin cDNA/1 × 106 cells and the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method as described (28.Didsbury J. Uhing R. Tomhave E. Gerard C. Gerard N. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11564-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant (4 μg of cDNA/1 × 106 cells) by addition of pcDNA3. The cells were used 48 h post-transfection. The level of chemokine receptor expression was carefully controlled and monitored by flow cytometry or immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Expression of β-arrestin was monitored by Western blot analysis. The expression levels of both the receptor and β-arrestin were kept consistent in this study. Cells were challenged with agonist in the presence of 30 μm forskolin (Sigma) and 500 μm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxantine (Sigma) at 37 °C for 15 min. The reactions were terminated with 1 n perchloric acid and neutralized with 2 n K2CO3. The cAMP level of each sample was determined in duplicate using radioimmunoassay as described previously (29.Cheng Z.J. Fan G.H. Zhao J. Zhang Z. Wu Y.L. Jiang L.Z. Zhu Y. Pei G. Ma L. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1913-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Data were averaged from several independent measurements and calculated as follows: 100 × [cAMP(for+agonist) − cAMP(basal)]/[cAMP(for) − cAMP(basal)], where cAMP(for+agonist) is cAMP accumulation in the presence of forskolin and agonist, cAMP(basal) is in the absence of forskolin and agonist, and cAMP(for) is in the presence of forskolin alone. The experiments were performed as described previously (29.Cheng Z.J. Fan G.H. Zhao J. Zhang Z. Wu Y.L. Jiang L.Z. Zhu Y. Pei G. Ma L. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1913-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA at 4 °C, and the lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 10 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended, and an aliquot (8 μg of protein) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 40 μm GDP, and 8 nm[35S]GTPγS (1200 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in the presence or absence of agonist. The reaction was terminated by dilution in cold phosphate-buffered saline and filtered through GF/C filters under vacuum. Bound radioactivity was determined in duplicate by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. Basal binding was determined in the absence of agonist, and nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm nonradioactive GTPγS. Data were averaged from several independent measurements, and percentage of stimulated [35S]GTPγS was calculated as follows: 100 × ((cpmsample − cpmnonspecific)/(cpmbasal − cpmnonspecific)). Cells were challenged with or without 10 nm SDF-1α in modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 30 min. After treatment, cells were placed on ice and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The presence of HA-tagged chemokine receptors on the cell surface was detected as described (27.Ling K. Wang P. Zhao J. Wu Y.L. Cheng Z.J. Wu G.X. Hu W. Ma L. Pei G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7922-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) against the influenza HA epitope (5 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 2 h and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Tago, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Basal cell fluorescence intensity was determined with cells stained with the secondary antibody alone. Cells were challenged with 10 nm SDF-1α in modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were then lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmEDTA, 2% SDS, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Aliquots (50 μg of protein) of the whole cell extracts prepared were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The total amounts of ERK and phosphorylated ERK were detected by anti-total p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies and anti-phospho-p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies (New England Biolabs Inc.), respectively. Western blot results were quantified by densitometric scanning of x-ray films using a Bio-Rad Model GS 700 imaging densitometer. Immunoblotting of β-arrestin and HA-tagged chemokine receptors and receptor fragments was performed using anti-β-arrestin polyclonal antibodies and mouse 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies against the influenza HA epitope, respectively. The immunoprecipitation experiment was performed as describe (27.Ling K. Wang P. Zhao J. Wu Y.L. Cheng Z.J. Wu G.X. Hu W. Ma L. Pei G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HEK 293 cells grown on a 60-mm culture dish were lysed in 0.8 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.4% digitonin) containing protease inhibitors on ice for 45 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were incubated with 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies (0.5 μg) and protein A-Sepharose (Life Technologies, Inc.) on ice for 4 h. After washing with immunoprecipitation buffer, the immunocomplexes absorbed onto protein A-Sepharose were eluted in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), and the presence of CXCR4 was detected by Western blot analysis using 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies. The cross-linking was performed using disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, HEK 293 cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and stimulated with SDF-1α (10 nm) at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were then incubated with disuccinimidyl suberate (0.1 mm) at room temperature for 30 min in a total volume of 400 μl. The reaction was terminated by addition of cold Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 10 mm and incubation for an additional 15 min. The samples were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. The cross-linked complex of β-arrestin and chemokine receptors was detected by anti-β-arrestin antibodies. The GST pull-down experiment was performed as described (31.Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). GST and GST fusion proteins with the CXCR4 third loop (GST-TL) were expressed in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3). GST fusion proteins with the CXCR4 C terminus (GST-C) were expressed in HEK 293 cells due to protein degradation when expressed in bacteria. All of the fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cytosolic fractions from HEK 293 cells expressing β-arrestin 2 and β2V54D were incubated with ∼5 μg of GST fusion proteins bound to the glutathione resin in 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with 0.2 ml of the same buffer and then eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and applied to a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins retained on the resin were detected by anti-GST and anti-β-arrestin antibodies, respectively. Data were analyzed by Student'st test for comparison of independent means, with pooled estimates of common variances. Previous studies on CXCR4 have revealed that signaling and internalization of CXCR4 are regulated by phosphorylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively, and that truncation of the last 34 amino acids in the C terminus of CXCR4 (CXCR4-T) causes total loss of phosphorylation of the receptor (26.Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I. Sozzani S. Peiper S.C. Horuk R. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28726-28731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The current study was undertaken to test the possible role of β-arrestin in the signaling and internalization mediated by CXCR4 or by the same truncated receptor (CXCR4-T) in HEK 293 cells. Both receptors, with HA tags at their amino termini, were well expressed on the cell surface as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies (Fig.1 A). Expression of CXCR4 and CXCR4-T was further confirmed by Western blot analysis with 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies after immunoprecipitation of receptors from plasma membranes of transfected HEK 293 cells, with apparent molecular masses of ∼44 kDa for CXCR4 and ∼41 kDa for CXCR4-T (Fig.1 B). Western blot analysis was also used to show that β-arrestin is endogenously expressed in HEK 293 cells and that transfection of β-arrestin 1 or 2 cDNA resulted in a 5–10-fold increase in β-arrestin expression over the basal level (Fig.1 C). The expression levels of β-arrestin in cells cotransfected with either receptor were kept comparable (data not shown). Activation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 stimulates inhibitory G proteins and subsequently inhibits adenylyl cyclase. Therefore, the effects of β-arrestin on the activation of the inhibitory G proteins stimulated by SDF-1α were examined using the [35S]GTPγS binding assay and the cAMP assay in cells coexpressing β-arrestin and CXCR4. It was shown that SDF-1α stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to cell membranes (Fig.2 A) and inhibited cellular cAMP production (Fig. 2 B) in cells expressing exogenous CXCR4. The CXCR4-mediated G protein activation was strongly attenuated by coexpression of either β-arrestin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A), with a 50% inhibition at 10 nm SDF-1α (p < 0.01), suggesting that more rapid clearance of the receptor from the membrane would reduce the response of the ligand with regard to GTP binding. Cotransfection of either β-arrestin with CXCR4 also significantly attenuated SDF-1α-induced inhibition of cellular cAMP production (Fig.2 B). In both assays, the SDF-1α concentration-response curves were shifted to the right, and the EC50 values for SDF-1α were increased 10-fold in cells cotransfected with β-arrestin and CXCR4 as compared with those in cells expressing CXCR4 alone (Fig. 2, A and B). These data clearly indicate that β-arrestin plays a significant role in the regulation of CXCR4/G protein coupling and subsequent G protein-mediated downstream signaling. To investigate the effect of cotransfected β-arrestin on CXCR4 internalization in HEK 293 cells, we measured CXCR4 internalization following a 30-min exposure to 10 nm SDF-1α by flow cytometry after fluorescence staining of the cell-surface receptor with 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies (Fig.3 A). When expressed alone in HEK 293 cells, CXCR4 was internalized ∼20%. Internalization of the receptor was modestly enhanced by coexpression of β-arrestin 1, but was significantly increased up to ∼40% by coexpression of β-arrestin 2 (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, cotransfection of β-arrestin 1 or 2 with a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK2) produced a synergistic increase in CXCR4 internalization, indicating that β-arrestin-enhanced CXCR4 internalization can be facilitated by GRK phosphorylation. The function of β-arrestin in CXCR4-mediated ERK activation was also investigated (Fig. 3 B). It has been reported that SDF-1α treatment can activate ERK via CXCR4 (25.Ganju R.K. Brubaker S.A. Meyer J. Dutt P. Yang Y. Qin S. Newman W. Groopman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23169-23175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Our results show that a 10-min exposure to SDF-1α led to an increase in ERK phosphorylation ∼3–4-fold above the control level (without SDF-1α stimulation) in cells transfected with CXCR4 (Fig.3 B). Under such conditions, coexpression of either β-arrestin resulted in a dramatic increase in SDF-1α-induced ERK phosphorylation to ∼6–7-fold above the control level (Fig.3 B), whereas the basal expression of ERK was unchanged in the same cells (data not shown). Thus, in contrast to the negative regulation by β-arrestin of CXCR4-mediated G protein activation, β-arrestin exerted a remarkably positive effect on CXCR4 internalization and receptor-mediated ERK activation. The third intracellular loop and carboxyl terminus have previously been implicated in GPCR interaction with cytosolic proteins such as GRK and arrestin (31.Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L.

It has recently been demonstrated that truncation at different sites in the CXCR4 C terminus causes total loss of receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization (25.Ganju R.K.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To access the contribution of the C terminus of CXCR4 to the regulation by β-arrestin of receptor responsiveness, CXCR4-T (with the carboxyl-terminal 34 amino acids removed) was constructed. The results show that truncation of the CXCR4 C terminus strongly attenuated interference of β-arrestin with both SDF-1α-stimulated activation of G proteins and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Fig.4, A and B), which indicated that the C-terminal structure of CXCR4 is crucial for β-arrestin to regulate receptor/G protein coupling. In contrast, the same truncation of the CXCR4 C terminus did not significantly affect the enhancement role of β-arrestin in SDF-1α-stimulated receptor internalization and ERK activation (Fig.5, A and B). This suggests that the C-terminal domain of CXCR4 is not essential for β-arrestin to regulate receptor internalization, and it also implies that some regions of CXCR4 other than the C terminus would be subject to this regulation.Figure 5β-Arrestin regulation of receptor internalization and ERK activation in CXCR4 and CXCR4-T. HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with CXCR4 or CXCR4-T plus pcDNA3 or β-arrestin 2 (β-arr2) or β2V54D cDNA. A, 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated without (control) or with 10 nm SDF-1α for 30 min at 37 °C, and receptor internalization was determined by flow cytometry.

Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The current study revealed that coexpression of β2V54D exhibited little effect on the receptor signaling of CXCR4 or CXCR4-T (Fig. 4, A andB), but dramatically decreased SDF-1α-stimulated internalization of both receptors (Fig. 5 A). Coexpression of β2V54D also significantly impaired SDF-1α-induced ERK activation by 40 and 50% in cells expressing CXCR4 and CXCR4-T, respectively (Fig. 5 B), indicating a critical role of β-arrestin-promoted CXCR4 internalization in ERK activation, as in the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor. Our data thus demonstrate that β-arrestin regulation of two important signaling functions of CXCR4, namely G protein activation and receptor internalization, is mediated by at least two distinct interactions since the CXCR4/β-arrestin interactions can be separately disrupted by the mutation of either the receptor (CXCR4-T) or β-arrestin (β2V54D). The direct physiological interaction between β-arrestin and CXCR4 was further accessed using a cross-linking assay that has been successfully applied in the study of the β2-adrenergic receptor (18.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). When coexpressed with CXCR4 in HEK 293 cells, either β-arrestin 2 or β2V54D could be coprecipitated with the HA-tagged receptor after exposure of the cells to SDF-1α and the covalent cross-linking agent (Fig. 6 A). Both arrestins were also shown to be cross-linked to CXCR4-T in an agonist-dependent manner (Fig. 6 B) at even higher levels compared with wild-type CXCR4. Our data indicate that β-arrestin can effectively interact with CXCR4 whether the C terminus of the receptor is present or not, thus further supporting the existence of multifunctional interactions via at least two distinct sites between β-arrestin and CXCR4. To define the concrete sites on CXCR4 contributing to its interaction with β-arrestin, a GST pull-down assay was employed. The results show that β-arrestin 2 expressed in HEK 293 cells bound effectively to both GST-C and GST-TL fusion proteins, but not to the control GST proteins (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the β-arrestin 2 mutant β2V54D interacted with GST-TL as efficiently as its wild-type counterpart, whereas it bound much less to GST-C compared with wild-type β-arrestin. The lack of interaction of β2V54D with GST-C in this assay agreed well with the results showing that the β-arrestin 2 mutant did not affect CXCR4 signaling and that it blocked the receptor internalization of both CXCR4 receptors with or without the C terminus. Thus, our data provide clear evidence that β-arrestin can directly interact with the chemokine receptor CXCR4 via at least two distinct sites, the third loop domain and the C terminus, and that different interactions of β-arrestin with CXCR4 play differential functional roles in the regulation of CXCR4 by β-arrestin. Although it has been reported that β-arrestin can functionally regulate many chemokine receptors such as CCR5, CCR2B, and CXCR1 (23.Aragay A.M. Mellado M. Frade J.M. Martin A.M. Jimenez-Sainz M.C., A. Martinez-C Mayor Jr., F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,24.Aramori I. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Zhang J. Cullen B. Cullen M.G. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), it was not known until this study was performed whether β-arrestin could play similar functional roles in CXCR4 signal transduction. Our results have demonstrated that β-arrestin is critically involved in the regulation of the most studied signal pathways mediated by CXCR4, a chemokine receptor of considerable interest due to its role as both chemoattractant receptor and HIV co-receptor. Since CXCR4 is wildly expressed in human blood neutrophils and lymphocytes (38.Loetscher M. Geiser T. O'Reilly T. Zwahlen R. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 232-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which β-arrestin expression is also very high (21.Parruti G. Lombardi M.S. Chuang T.T. De Blasi A. J. Recept. Res. 1993; 13: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the functional regulation of CXCR4 by β-arrestin, as revealed by this study, should play an important role in CXCR4- and other chemokine receptor-mediated immunological responses. Moreover, it can be reasonably speculated that β-arrestin may be also functionally involved in the process of HIV infection due to its regulation of the two HIV co-receptors, CXCR4 and CCR5 (24.Aramori I. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Zhang J. Cullen B. Cullen M.G. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It has been reported that truncation of the C terminus of CXCR4 leads to higher receptor-mediated activities in inositol phosphate formation and in the induction of sustained calcium fluxes as compared with wild-type CXCR4 (26.Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Fisher I. Sozzani S. Peiper S.C. Horuk R. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28726-28731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these phenomena are due to loss of down-regulatory control to the mutant receptor. The current results that β-arrestin can effectively regulate CXCR4/G protein signaling of CXCR4, but not that of CXCR4-T, indicate that the inhibitory regulation of CXCR4 by β-arrestin could be the hypothesized down-regulatory control and partly explain the previous observation. For most members of the GPCR family, agonist-stimulated phosphorylation of GPCR occurs at serine and threonine in the intracellular domains of the C terminus and/or the third intracellular loop (32.Benovic J.L.

Lefkowitz R.J Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of CXCR4 contains 18 serine/threonine residues, among the highest in the chemokine receptors. Truncation of its C terminus is reported to cause nearly total loss of receptor phosphorylation in rat basophilic leukemia cells stably expressing CXCR4 while producing no change in CXCR4 internalization (26.Haribabu B.

The current study reveals that β-arrestin significantly augments SDF-1α-induced internalization of both CXCR4 and CXCR4-T in HEK 293 cells, indicating that the regulation of receptor internalization by β-arrestin is not critically dependent on phosphorylation of the receptor C terminus. Of interest, the synergistic increase in receptor internalization by coexpression of β-arrestin with GRK2 shown in this report for CXCR4 and in an earlier study for CCR5 (24.Aramori I. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Zhang J. Cullen B. Cullen M.G. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) implies that chemokine receptor internalization can be facilitated by GRK at least under the conditions of overexpression. It has demonstrated that CXCR4 undergoes significant spontaneous endocytosis and that recycling of internalized receptors is not efficient (41.Tarasova N.I. Stauer R.H. Michejda C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15883-15886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Our data show that overexpression of β-arrestin exerted little effect on CXCR4 spontaneous endocytosis while remarkably increasing receptor recycling to the membrane (data not shown). Further study to investigate the role of β-arrestin in CXCR4 internalization and recycling is to be continued. The dominant inhibitory mutant of β-arrestin 2 (β2V54D) is known to prevent GPCR targeting to clathrin-coated pits and subsequent receptor internalization (17.Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In the current study, overexpression of the same β-arrestin 2 mutant led to a dramatic decrease in SDF-1α-induced internalization of both CXCR4 and CXCR4-T. SDF-1α-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK via both receptors was also inhibited by β2V54D. Taken together, our data demonstrate that β-arrestin-facilitated receptor internalization plays a crucial role in CXCR4-mediated ERK activation, as in the well known case of the β2-adrenergic receptor (18.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that opioid-mediated ERK activation is not dependent on κ-opioid receptor internalization (43.Li J.-G. Luo L.-Y. Drupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Liu-Chen L.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12087-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggesting that receptor internalization-dependent ERK activation may not be universal and may have some receptor specificity. It is also worth noting that β-arrestin 2 induced a more robust increase in CXCR4 internalization than did β-arrestin 1, although they appeared equal in enhancing CXCR4-mediated ERK activation. However, β-arrestins 1 and 2 were equivalent in the regulation of CXCR4 internalization in the presence of overexpressed GRK2, suggesting that regulation by β-arrestin 1 more likely depends on CXCR4 phosphorylation. β-Arrestin has been reported to interact with GPCRs at their third intracellular loop (31.Wu G.

Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). However, no evidence has emerged that β-arrestin can functionally interact at two distinct domains of GPCRs simultaneously. This study has demonstrated that β-arrestin efficiently interferes with both receptor/G protein coupling, which is mediated by the CXCR4 C terminus, and receptor internalization, which is independent of the C terminus. The regulation of CXCR4 internalization by β-arrestin seems likely to be mediated by its interaction with the third intracellular loop and/or other intracellular domain(s) such as the second loop of the receptor. Our results from in vivo cross-linking and in vitroGST pull-down assays provide direct evidence of a physical interaction between β-arrestin and two distinct sites of CXCR4, namely the C terminus and the third intracellular loop. Moreover, this study further establishes that the distinct interaction of β-arrestin with different domains of CXCR4 produces the differential regulation of receptor functions by β-arrestin. Thus, it is feasible both in theory and in practice to block or to enhance one of the regulatory functions of β-arrestin for receptors by purposely modifying the structures of β-arrestin or the receptors it regulates.

The induction of these detoxifying enzymes by a variety of agents occurs at the transcriptional level and is regulated by a cis-acting element, called the antioxidant response element (ARE) or electrophile-response element. In this study, we identified a signaling kinase pathway that negatively regulates ARE-mediated gene expression. Treatment of human hepatoma HepG2 and murine hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells with tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) stimulated the activity of p38, a member of mitogen-activated protein kinase family. Inhibition of p38 activation by its inhibitor, SB203580, enhanced the induction of quinone reductase activity and the activation of ARE reporter gene by tBHQ. In contrast, SB202474, a negative analog of SB203580, had little effect. Consistent with this result, interfering with the p38 kinase pathway by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38 or MKK3, an immediate upstream regulator of p38, potentiated the activation of the ARE reporter gene by tBHQ, whereas the wild types of p38 and MKK3 diminished such activation. In addition, inhibition of p38 activity augmented the induction of ARE reporter gene activity bytert-butylhydroxyanisole, sulforaphane, and β-naphthoflavone.

In this study, we demonstrated that p38 was involved in the regulation of phase II gene expression and acted as a negative regulator. We also showed that such a negative role of p38 was regulated by an upstream kinase, MKK3. Human HepG2 and mouse Hepa1c1c7 hepatoma cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were normally starved overnight in serum-free medium before treatment, unless otherwise indicated. The rabbit anti-p38 polyclonal antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). The anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. GST-ATF2-(1–96)-expressing plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. J. Silvio Gutkind (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). pARE-TI-luciferase reporter construct (containing a single copy of the 41-base pair murine GST-Ya ARE and minimal TATA-Inr promoter) has been described previously (38.Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The expression vector for wild-type p38, pcDNA3-HA-p38α, was obtained from Dr. Zhengbin Yao (Amgen Inc., Boulder, CO). The expression vectors pCMV-Flag-p38α(AGF), pRSV-Flag-MKK3, and pRSV-Flag-MKK3(ala) were gifts from Dr. Roger J. Davis (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Worcester, MA). The specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580, and its negative analog, SB202474, were purchased from Calbiochem. tBHQ, BHA, and β-NF were purchased from Aldrich, and SUL was purchased from LKT Laboratories (St. Paul, MN). [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. After treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the whole cell lysate was prepared as described previously (39.Yu R. Jiao J.-J. Duh J.-L. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2954-2959PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and the endogenous p38 was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-p38 polyclonal antibody with the aid of protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunocomplex was spun down at high speed for 1 min and washed twice with the buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 100 μmNa3VO4, 5 μm ZnCl2, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm iodoacetatic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100) and twice with kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate). Kinase reaction was performed by incubation of the immunoprecipitate with 5 μg of GST-ATF2, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 μm ATP in a 30-μl kinase assay for 30 min and terminated by Laemmli buffer. The phosphorylated product was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by electrophoresis, autoradiography, and phosphor imaging. HepG2 cells were plated in six-well plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well) 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors using the FuGENETM 6 protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The transfection mixture was replaced with fresh medium 12 h after transfection. Cells were cultured for an additional 12 h prior to drug treatment. The β-galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (40.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was determined according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, after treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in reporter lysis buffer. Following a brief centrifugation, a 20-μl supernatant was used for the assay of luciferase activity with a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity. HepG2 cells were transfected with pARE-TI-luciferase construct using a FuGENETM 6 protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were cultured in fresh medium containing 0.8 mg/ml G418 24 h after transfection. Clonal cell lines were selected for growth in the presence of G418 by limiting dilution and confirmed by the inducible activity of ARE-luciferase reporter gene by tBHQ. To avoid clonal variation, four randomly selected clones were tested. Because similar results were obtained with these clones, only the data with clone 4 (C4) were presented in this report. After treatment, Hepa1c1c7 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 125 mm sucrose. Cell suspension was sonicated for 15 s and left on ice for 10 min. The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. QR activity in the supernatants was determined by measuring the reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol. Five μg of protein, as determined by the Bradford method, was added to the cuvette containing 1 ml of assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 60 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Tween 20, 5 μm FAD, 0.2 mmNADH, and 80 μm 2,6-dichloroindophenol). The reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 5 min and terminated by 30 μmdicumarol. Absorbance at 600 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer. The specific QR activity was expressed as nmol of 2,6-dichloroindophenol reduced by 1 mg of protein within 1 min. Cell lysates were prepared as described in the immunocomplex kinase assays. 25 μg of protein, as determined by the Bradford method, was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difuoride membrane using a semidry transfer system (Fisher). Membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 8 g/liter NaCl, and 0.2 g/liter KCl) for 1 h at room temperature, prior to incubation with 1 μg/ml of an anti-p38 polyclonal antibody in TBS containing 3% nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight. Membrane was then washed three times with TBS and blotted with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:3,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by three washes in TBS. The protein was visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human hepatoma HepG2 and mouse hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 have been used as the model cell lines for the study of phase II enzyme induction by various agents (41.Prochaska H.J. Talalay P. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4776-4782PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Prestera T. Holtzclaw W.D. Zhang Y. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As shown in Fig.1 A, 100 μm tBHQ strongly induced p38 activity in HepG2 cells, as determined by immunocomplex kinase assays. Pretreatment with SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38 (20.Lee J.C.

Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar), had little effect. Treatment with SB203580 alone also significantly decreased the basal activity of p38 as compared with the control cells. Similar results were obtained when Hepa1c1c7 cells were tested (Fig.1 B). Phase II detoxifying enzymes include GST, UDP-glucuronosyl transferase, epoxide hydrolase, and QR. Experiments with Hepa1c1c7 cells showed that QR induction is a useful indicator of overall phase II enzyme induction (3.Zhang Y. Talalay P. Cho C.G. Posner G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2399-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 41.Prochaska H.J. Talalay P. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4776-4782PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Gerhauser C. You M. Liu J. Moriarty R.M. Hawthorne M. Metha R.J. Moon R.C. Pezzuto J.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 272-278PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the role of p38 activation in phase II enzyme regulation, we examined the effect of SB203580 on the induction of QR activity by tBHQ. Treatment of Hepa1c1c7 cells with tBHQ (100 μm) for 24 h resulted in a 4-fold induction of QR activity (Fig.2). Surprisingly, co-treatment of tBHQ with SB203580 potentiated such induction. Furthermore, SB203580 alone also increased the QR activity. In contrast, the negative analog SB202474 had no effect on either the basal or tBHQ-induced QR activity. These results suggest that activation of p38 has a negative effect on the induction of phase II genes such as QR. Previous studies have shown that the induction of QR activity by tBHQ is transcriptionally regulated by an ARE DNA response element (45.Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Jaiswal A.K. Pharmacogenetics. 1994; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To examine if the inhibitory effect of p38 on tBHQ induction of QR activity is due to the changes in ARE-dependent gene expression, we performed transient and stable transfection assays. As shown in Fig.3 A, tBHQ induced more than 3-fold luciferase activity in HepG2 cells transfected transiently with ARE-luciferase reporter construct. SB203580 but not SB202474 significantly enhanced tBHQ-induced luciferase activity. Furthermore, SB203580 alone that inhibited the basal activity of p38 (Fig.1 A) stimulated luciferase activity (approximately 2-fold over control). In contrast, no induction of luciferase activity was observed when HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the control vector (Ti-luciferase), indicating that the activation of reporter gene was specifically mediated by the ARE enhancer. Similar results were obtained in a HepG2-derived cell line (C4) that was stably transfected with an ARE-luciferase construct. SB203580 potentiated the induction of luciferase activity by tBHQ in a dose-dependent manner, whereas SB202474 had little effect even at 20 μm concentration (Fig.3 B). To provide further evidence for the negative role of p38, we examined the effect of blockade of the p38 pathway with a dominant-negative p38 mutant on tBHQ-induced ARE reporter gene activity. HepG2 cells were transfected with ARE-luciferase reporter construct together with the plasmids encoding a dominant-negative p38 mutant, p38(AGF), or wild-type p38. After transfection, cells were treated with tBHQ (100 μm) for 24 h or left untreated as control. Overexpression of p38(AGF) substantially augmented the induction of ARE reporter gene by tBHQ in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4). Similar to SB203580, mutant p38 also raised the basal activity of ARE reporter gene in untreated cells. In contrast, forced expression of wild-type p38 decreased both basal and tBHQ-induced ARE reporter gene activities (Fig. 4). These data substantiate a negative role of p38 in the activation of ARE-dependent phase II genes. Phase II detoxifying enzymes are induced by a variety of chemicals. We next asked whether p38 MAPK plays a similar role in the induction of phase II enzymes by other inducers. As shown in Fig.5 A, treatment with BHA, β-NF, and SUL stimulated the luciferase activity in the stably transfected C4 cells. The induction of luciferase activity by all three inducers was strongly enhanced by cotreatment with SB203580 but not with SB202474. Treatment with SB203580 alone also stimulated luciferase activity in the C4 cells. These results suggest that p38 also functions as a negative regulator of BHA-, β-NF-, and SUL-induced phase II gene expression. Interestingly, BHA and β-NF, like tBHQ, stimulated p38 activity that was inhibited by SB203580, whereas SUL is inactive (Fig.5 B). The data above indicate that p38 negatively regulates both basal and inducible ARE-mediated gene expression. To obtain information on the potential target of p38, we compared the time courses of the effect of SB203580 and the effect of tBHQ on ARE-driven transcription in C4 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, no significant induction of luciferase activity was observed until 6 h after challenge with tBHQ (100 μm). However, the induction of luciferase activity by SB203580 (5 μm) appeared earlier and was detectable 3 h post-treatment. The stimulated luciferase activity by both agents accumulated as the treatments progressed. This result suggests that p38 may act directly on ARE-binding proteins or on the proximal components of the ARE-binding proteins. To understand the mechanism of p38 activation by tBHQ, we examined the roles of upstream kinases, MAPK kinases. Previous studies have shown that p38 activity can be regulated by both MKK3 and MKK4 (23.Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 24.Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Gotoh Y. Iwamatsu A. Irie K. Mori E. Kuroyanagi N. Hagiwara M. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26981-26988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, MKK4 but not MKK3 can also activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (23.Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 25.Kyriakis J. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Given that tBHQ is a poor activator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway (47.Yu R. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28962-28970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we focused on the role of MKK3. As shown in Fig.7 A, while expression of MKK3 attenuated the induction of ARE reporter gene activity by tBHQ, dominant-negative MKK3 mutant, MKK3(ala), augmented the induction. Consistent with the luciferase assay result, wild-type MKK3 potentiated the activation of p38 by tBHQ, whereas MKK3(ala) showed the opposite effect (Fig. 7 B). These data suggest that MKK3 is an upstream regulator for the negative role of p38 in tBHQ-induced phase II gene expression. Phase II detoxifying enzymes are induced by a variety of chemicals. A number of studies suggest that this induction is regulated through the signal transduction pathways that are initiated by the inducers (48.Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1989; 28: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 49.Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that treatment of human or murine hepatoma cells with tBHQ stimulated p38 activity. Inhibition of tBHQ-induced p38 activity by its inhibitor, SB203580, potentiated the induction of QR activity and ARE-reporter gene expression by tBHQ, whereas SB202474, which did not inhibit p38 activity, was inactive. Interestingly, SB203580 also enhanced the basal and the inducible activities of ARE-reporter gene by BHA, β-NF, and SUL. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38 or its upstream kinase, MKK3, augmented the induction of ARE-driven transcription. However, overexpression of the wild-type p38 or MKK3 showed opposite effects. Therefore, this study, for the first time, unravels a signal transduction pathway that negatively regulates ARE-dependent phase II gene expression. Although we provide good evidence that p38 inhibits basal and inducible ARE-mediated gene expression, the cellular target that mediates such a negative role of p38 is not clear. Since the induced luciferase activity by SB203580 appears 3 h after treatment and shows an earlier kinetics than that by tBHQ, we speculate that p38 may directly act on ARE-binding proteins. p38 has been shown to phosphorylate several transcription factors, including ATF2 (23.Derijard B.

However, these known substrates do not seem to be the mediators of negative action of p38, because we are unable to detect their presence in ARE-protein complex. 2R. Yu, and A.-N. T. Kong, unpublished results. Recently, using gel shift assays and cDNA transfection, several groups have identified various ARE-binding proteins, including the members of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family, Nrf1 (15.Venugopal R.

Whether these ARE-binding proteins can serve as substrates of p38 remains to be investigated. It is also possible that p38 phosphorylates a protein that is able to regulate the transcriptional activities of ARE-biding proteins. Indeed, a murine cytosolic protein, named Keap1, has been identified to suppress Nrf2 transcriptional activity by retaining Nrf2 in the cytoplasm (50.Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Yasutake K. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). A human homologue of Keap1 has also been cloned independently (51.Nagase T. Seki N. Tanaka K. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 164-174Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of Keap1 and its human homologue reveals several potential MAPK phosphorylation sites. It will be interesting to examine the phosphorylation of Keap1 protein by MAPKs and the biological consequence of this event. Activation of p38 by tBHQ and other phase II enzyme inducers is intriguing. p38 is preferentially activated by stress stimuli, such as UV radiation (26.Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M.

Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that activation of p38 by these stress stimuli is mediated by upstream kinase, TAK1 or ASK1, that directly activates MKK3 or MKK6, which, in turn, activates p38 (53.Shirakabe K.

Since tBHQ, BHA, and β-NF are easily oxidized to reactive intermediates, resulting in chemical stress, it is therefore conceivable that a similar mechanism may also underlie the activation of p38 by these agents. Indeed, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of MKK3 inhibited p38 activation by tBHQ and attenuated the inhibitory effect of p38. Interestingly, expression of a dominant negative mutant of TAK1 or ASK1 also inhibited tBHQ-induced p38 activity; however, we were unable to detect any significant induction of TAK1 or ASK1 activity in tBHQ-treated HepG2 cells, implicating the involvement of a TAK1- or ASK1-related protein.2 The detailed mechanism by which tBHQ and other phase II enzyme inducers stimulate p38 activity is currently under investigation. Protein kinases have been previously implicated in the activation of phase II genes. Okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase, and Ras, a small GTPase that activates many kinase pathways, have been shown to potently induce ARE-mediated gene expression (55.Ainbinder E. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Most recently, we demonstrated a role of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), another member of the MAPK family, in the induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes by chemicals (56.Yu R. Lei W. Mandlekar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J. Wu J. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ERK2 activation by a specific MAPK kinase inhibitor, PD98059, or by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of ERK2 attenuated the activation of ARE-dependent reporter gene as well as the induction of QR activity by tBHQ and SUL in HepG2 and Hepa1c1c7 cells. Blockade of ERK pathway also attenuated Ha-Ras-induced ARE-reporter gene activity. Thus, in contrast to p38, ERK2 acts as a positive regulator of phase II gene induction. The opposite effects of p38 and ERK2 indicate that a complex mechanism may exist in regulating phase II gene expression. Differential activation of these positive and negative pathways, such as ERK versus p38, may determine the potency of a phase II enzyme inducer. Although tBHQ, BHA, and β-NF activate both ERK and p38 pathways, SUL stimulates ERK activity only, suggesting that activation of the two kinase pathways can be dissociated from each other. This may provide a molecular basis for the future design of potential phase II enzyme inducers through structural refinement that enhances the activation of ERK but does not induce or even inhibit p38 activity. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a signaling kinase, p38, negatively regulates the induction of ARE-dependent phase II gene expression. Such a negative role of p38 is mediated by an upstream kinase, MKK3. Future studies will unravel the downstream effectors of p38. We thank Dr. J.

Crane D.D. Musser J.M. Barry III, C.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), are believed to be targets of the activated inhibitor(s).Progress made thus far notwithstanding the mechanisms of INH action and resistance are still poorly understood. Purified KatG from eitherM. tuberculosis (18.Johnsson K. King D.S. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5009-5010Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar) or Mycobacterium smegmatis(19.Zabinski R.F. Blanchard J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2331-2332Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) catalyzes the in vitro inactivation of InhA by INH in the presence of NADH and Mn2+. However, the molecular nature for the INH activation by KatG and the functional role of Mn2+ remain unclear. InhA is also inactivated in a slow nonenzymatic, Mn2+-dependent activation of INH. The crystal structure of the resulting InhA-inhibitor complex has been determined, which shows that the bound inhibitor is an isonicotinic acyl NADH (20.Rozwarski D. Grant G.A. Barton D.H.R. Jacobs W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). It is, however, uncertain whether or not the inhibitor generated by this nonenzymatic activation is identical to that formed in the KatG-dependent process. Moreover, the inhibitor derived from INH by either the nonenzymatic or the KatG-dependent activation has never been isolated, and no simple method has been developed for the detection and quantification of the inhibitor. Consequently, biochemical or biophysical characterizations of the nature and consequences of the inhibitor binding by InhA have been greatly hindered by these limitations.We are interested in the mechanisms of the INH action and resistance. This work was carried out to isolate for the first time the InhA inhibitors generated by the nonenzymatic and the M. tuberculosis KatG-dependent processes and to characterize the free inhibitors and the InhA-inhibitor complexes. Evidence is also presented to show that neither Mn2+ nor InhA is essential to the M. tuberculosis KatG-mediated activation of INH.DISCUSSIONAn InhA-inhibitor complex can be obtained by a slow INH activation reaction that is Mn2+-mediated but KatG-independent; the identity of the bound inhibitor as isonicotinic acyl NADH has been established from the determination of the crystal structure of such a complex (20.Rozwarski D. Grant G.A. Barton D.H.R. Jacobs W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). An InhA inhibitor can also be obtained by a rapid KatG-dependent activation of INH. However, it is not clear whether these two inhibitors are the same. Moreover, the inhibitor derived from either activation process has never been isolated in solution. In this work, procedures were developed for the isolation and quantification of the InhA-inhibitor complex and the free inhibitor using either the M. tuberculosis KatG-dependent or the Mn2+-mediated process for the INH activation. The InhA-inhibitor complex obtained by the KatG-dependent activation of INH was apparently identical to its counterpart derived from the Mn2+-mediated activation with respect to absorption spectra and the lack of enoyl reductase activity. The free inhibitors obtained from these two complexes were also identical in their absorption spectra, HPLC retention times, and mass spectra. These results indicate that the same InhA inhibitor was generated by either the slow Mn2+-mediated or the fast KatG-catalyzed INH activation.Both the free and the InhA-bound inhibitor were sufficiently stable to allow the isolation and the subsequent characterization of the inhibitor. The complexes derived from both activation processes were indistinguishable from those reconstituted from InhA and the isolated free inhibitor with respect to absorption spectra. The binding of the inhibitor to InhA was apparently very tight with a dissociation constant estimated to be lower than 0.4 nm. The free inhibitor has absorption peaks at 260 and 326 nm (Fig. 2 A). In comparison with NADH, the 326-nm peak of the inhibitor is stronger in absorptivity (ε326 about 6900m−1 cm−1) and in a shorter wavelength range than the NADH 340-nm peak (ε340 6200m−1 cm−1). Upon binding to InhA, the inhibitor 326-nm peak was blue-shifted, but the complex still showed a pronounced shoulder around 320 nm (Fig. 2 A). The characteristic absorption around 320 nm provides a very useful reporting signal for monitoring the formation and isolation of the inhibitor. The spectral changes resulting from the inhibitor binding by InhA, especially the ΔA 353 (Fig.2 B), also provide a convenient means for investigating the binding of the inhibitor by InhA. Using this method, the KatG S315T mutant frequently encountered in INH-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates has been shown to fail to catalyze the formation of the InhA inhibitor. 2B. Lei and S.-C. Tu, unpublished results. We believe that the methodology developed in this report can also be applied to a recently identified INH target KasA (17.Mdluli K. Slayden R.A. Zhu Y. Ramaswamy S. Pan X. Mead D. Crane D.D. Musser J.M. Barry III, C.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) for further verification and investigation of the inactivation mechanism.There are some debates about whether InhA is a primary target of activated INH in M. tuberculosis (29.Mdluli K. Sherman D.R. Hickey M.J. Kreiswirth B.N. Morris S. Stover C.K. Barry III, C.E. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), in part due to the infrequency of mutation in the inhA gene in INH-resistantM. tuberculosis strains. Particularly, the S92A mutation of InhA, which confers high INH resistance in M. smegmatis(15.Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quemard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. de Lisle G. Jacobs W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), has not been encountered in M. tuberculosis isolates from INH-resistant patients. Our findings support InhA as a primary target of INH action in M. tuberculosis. KatG catalyzes the formation of the InhA inhibitor. The extremely high affinity of the inhibitor to InhA (K d < 0.4 nm) is consistent with the high susceptibility of M. tuberculosisto INH. There are two possibilities for the lack of the S92A InhA allele in M. tuberculosis. One is that the selection pressure is not high enough for the mutation. M. smegmatis(which does not cause tuberculosis) and M. tuberculosis are sensitive to INH with minimum inhibitory concentrations of > 5 and 0.01–0.02 μg/ml, respectively. The M. smegmatis InhA S92A mutant confers INH resistance of minimum inhibitory concentrations > 50 μg/ml, whereas most of clinical INH-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates have minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1–5 μg/ml. In clinical treatments, INH was absorbed by the gut to reach peak levels of 3–7 μg/ml in 1–2 h after a usual oral dosage of 300 mg (30.Holdiness M.R. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1984; 9: 511-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). At such an in vivolevel of INH, the InhA S92A mutation of M. tuberculosiswould not be effectively selected. The other possibility is that, because the InhA enzymes from M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis have 11.7% nonidentity in their amino acid sequences, the M. tuberculosis InhA S92A mutant may be distinct from the corresponding M. smegmatis mutant in remaining sensitive to the inhibitor. This latter possibility is under current investigation.The M. smegmatis KatG has been shown to require Mn2+ for the activation of INH for the inhibition of InhA (19.Zabinski R.F. Blanchard J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2331-2332Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), possibly by converting Mn2+ to Mn3+, which in turn oxidizes INH (31.Magliozzo R.S. Marcinkeviciene J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8867-8870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We found that, although Mn2+ enhanced the INH activation by M. tuberculosis KatG, the M. tuberculosis KatG can efficiently activate INH without exogenously added Mn2+. We did not find any detectable amount of Mn2+ in the Pi buffer, the purified InhA, or the purified KatG used in the activation reaction. Therefore, Mn2+ is apparently not essential to the activation of INH by M. tuberculosis KatG. The two KatG enzymes from M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis are thus different in their modes of the INH activation. Such a difference might be related to the differential susceptibilities of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis to INH.Previous in vitro experiments of INH activation all included InhA in the reaction. It is not clear whether InhA is required in addition to KatG for INH activation. A similar level of the InhA inhibitor was generated in the KatG reactions with or without InhA. Therefore, the simultaneous presence of InhA and KatG is not required for the inhibitor production.KatG used in this report had a Met-Asn-Ser tripeptide fused to the first residue Met of the wild type KatG. In comparison with the wild-type KatG, the purified modified enzyme exhibited essentially the same A 408/A 280 ratio, kinetic parameters, the ability to activate INH, and blue shift of the Soret band A 408 (32.Wengenack N.L. Todorovic S., Yu, L. Rusnak F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15825-15834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) upon INH binding (not shown). The extra peptide apparently does not significantly change the structure or function of KatG. This is in contrast with another fusion enzyme that had a Met-Glu-Phe-Val tetrapeptide fused to the second residue Pro. This latter modified KatG bound only about 0.5 heme/dimer, in comparison with 2 heme/dimer by the wild type and our modified KatG, and thus had a much lower enzyme activity (33.Nagy J.M. Cass A.E.G. Brown K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31265-31271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A constitutive expression was adopted to slowly accumulate our enzyme while the other KatG fusion was overexpressed with an inducible system. The difference in the expression strategy could lead to the difference in the incorporation of the heme cofactor.

In this work, procedures were developed for the isolation and quantification of the InhA-inhibitor complex and the free inhibitor using either the M. tuberculosis KatG-dependent or the Mn2+-mediated process for the INH activation. The InhA-inhibitor complex obtained by the KatG-dependent activation of INH was apparently identical to its counterpart derived from the Mn2+-mediated activation with respect to absorption spectra and the lack of enoyl reductase activity. The free inhibitors obtained from these two complexes were also identical in their absorption spectra, HPLC retention times, and mass spectra. These results indicate that the same InhA inhibitor was generated by either the slow Mn2+-mediated or the fast KatG-catalyzed INH activation.Both the free and the InhA-bound inhibitor were sufficiently stable to allow the isolation and the subsequent characterization of the inhibitor. The complexes derived from both activation processes were indistinguishable from those reconstituted from InhA and the isolated free inhibitor with respect to absorption spectra. The binding of the inhibitor to InhA was apparently very tight with a dissociation constant estimated to be lower than 0.4 nm. The free inhibitor has absorption peaks at 260 and 326 nm (Fig. 2 A). In comparison with NADH, the 326-nm peak of the inhibitor is stronger in absorptivity (ε326 about 6900m−1 cm−1) and in a shorter wavelength range than the NADH 340-nm peak (ε340 6200m−1 cm−1). Upon binding to InhA, the inhibitor 326-nm peak was blue-shifted, but the complex still showed a pronounced shoulder around 320 nm (Fig. 2 A). The characteristic absorption around 320 nm provides a very useful reporting signal for monitoring the formation and isolation of the inhibitor. The spectral changes resulting from the inhibitor binding by InhA, especially the ΔA 353 (Fig.2 B), also provide a convenient means for investigating the binding of the inhibitor by InhA. Using this method, the KatG S315T mutant frequently encountered in INH-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates has been shown to fail to catalyze the formation of the InhA inhibitor. 2B. Lei and S.-C. Tu, unpublished results. We believe that the methodology developed in this report can also be applied to a recently identified INH target KasA (17.Mdluli K. Slayden R.A. Zhu Y. Ramaswamy S. Pan X.

Science. 1998; 280: 1607-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) for further verification and investigation of the inactivation mechanism.There are some debates about whether InhA is a primary target of activated INH in M. tuberculosis (29.Mdluli K. Sherman D.R. Hickey M.J. Kreiswirth B.N. Morris S. Stover C.K. Barry III, C.E. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), in part due to the infrequency of mutation in the inhA gene in INH-resistantM. tuberculosis strains. Particularly, the S92A mutation of InhA, which confers high INH resistance in M. smegmatis(15.Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quemard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. de Lisle G. Jacobs W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), has not been encountered in M. tuberculosis isolates from INH-resistant patients. Our findings support InhA as a primary target of INH action in M. tuberculosis. KatG catalyzes the formation of the InhA inhibitor. The extremely high affinity of the inhibitor to InhA (K d < 0.4 nm) is consistent with the high susceptibility of M. tuberculosisto INH. There are two possibilities for the lack of the S92A InhA allele in M. tuberculosis. One is that the selection pressure is not high enough for the mutation. M. smegmatis(which does not cause tuberculosis) and M. tuberculosis are sensitive to INH with minimum inhibitory concentrations of > 5 and 0.01–0.02 μg/ml, respectively. The M. smegmatis InhA S92A mutant confers INH resistance of minimum inhibitory concentrations > 50 μg/ml, whereas most of clinical INH-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates have minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1–5 μg/ml. In clinical treatments, INH was absorbed by the gut to reach peak levels of 3–7 μg/ml in 1–2 h after a usual oral dosage of 300 mg (30.Holdiness M.R. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1984; 9: 511-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). At such an in vivolevel of INH, the InhA S92A mutation of M. tuberculosiswould not be effectively selected. The other possibility is that, because the InhA enzymes from M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis have 11.7% nonidentity in their amino acid sequences, the M. tuberculosis InhA S92A mutant may be distinct from the corresponding M. smegmatis mutant in remaining sensitive to the inhibitor. This latter possibility is under current investigation.The M. smegmatis KatG has been shown to require Mn2+ for the activation of INH for the inhibition of InhA (19.Zabinski R.F. Blanchard J.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2331-2332Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), possibly by converting Mn2+ to Mn3+, which in turn oxidizes INH (31.Magliozzo R.S. Marcinkeviciene J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8867-8870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We found that, although Mn2+ enhanced the INH activation by M. tuberculosis KatG, the M. tuberculosis KatG can efficiently activate INH without exogenously added Mn2+. We did not find any detectable amount of Mn2+ in the Pi buffer, the purified InhA, or the purified KatG used in the activation reaction. Therefore, Mn2+ is apparently not essential to the activation of INH by M. tuberculosis KatG. The two KatG enzymes from M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis are thus different in their modes of the INH activation. Such a difference might be related to the differential susceptibilities of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis to INH.Previous in vitro experiments of INH activation all included InhA in the reaction. It is not clear whether InhA is required in addition to KatG for INH activation. A similar level of the InhA inhibitor was generated in the KatG reactions with or without InhA. Therefore, the simultaneous presence of InhA and KatG is not required for the inhibitor production.KatG used in this report had a Met-Asn-Ser tripeptide fused to the first residue Met of the wild type KatG. In comparison with the wild-type KatG, the purified modified enzyme exhibited essentially the same A 408/A 280 ratio, kinetic parameters, the ability to activate INH, and blue shift of the Soret band A 408 (32.Wengenack N.L. Todorovic S., Yu, L. Rusnak F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15825-15834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) upon INH binding (not shown). The extra peptide apparently does not significantly change the structure or function of KatG. This is in contrast with another fusion enzyme that had a Met-Glu-Phe-Val tetrapeptide fused to the second residue Pro. This latter modified KatG bound only about 0.5 heme/dimer, in comparison with 2 heme/dimer by the wild type and our modified KatG, and thus had a much lower enzyme activity (33.Nagy J.M. Cass A.E.G. Brown K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31265-31271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A constitutive expression was adopted to slowly accumulate our enzyme while the other KatG fusion was overexpressed with an inducible system. The difference in the expression strategy could lead to the difference in the incorporation of the heme cofactor. An InhA-inhibitor complex can be obtained by a slow INH activation reaction that is Mn2+-mediated but KatG-independent; the identity of the bound inhibitor as isonicotinic acyl NADH has been established from the determination of the crystal structure of such a complex (20.Rozwarski D. Grant G.A. Barton D.H.R. Jacobs W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2026596261,"Two genes encoding thioredoxin are found on theEscherichia coli genome. Both of them are capable of reducing protein disulfide bonds in vivo and in vitro. The catalytic site contains a Cys-X 1-X 2-Cys motif in a so-called thioredoxin fold. Thioredoxin 2 has two additional pairs of cysteines in a non-conserved N-terminal domain. This domain does not appear to be important for the function of thioredoxin 2 in donating electrons to ribonucleotide reductase, 3′-phosphoadenylsulfate-reductase, or the periplasmic disulfide isomerase DsbC. Our results suggests that the two thioredoxins are equivalent for most of the in vivo functions that were tested. On the other hand, transcriptional regulation is different. The expression of trxC is regulated by the transcriptional activator OxyR in response to oxidative stress. Oxidized OxyR binds directly to the trxC promoter and induces its expression in response to elevated hydrogen peroxide levels or the disruption of one or several of the cytoplasmic redox pathways. Mutants lacking thioredoxins 1 and 2 are more resistant to high levels of hydrogen peroxide, whereas they are more sensitive to diamide, a disulfide bond-inducing agent.

The two cysteines of the conserved active site (WCX 1 X 2C) form a disulfide bond after reduction of exposed disulfides in a variety of substrate proteins. The reduced form is regenerated by the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase which in turn is kept reduced by NADPH (1.Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, thioredoxin is an electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase, for methionine sulfoxide reductase (2.Russel M. Model P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14997-15005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and for 3′-phosphoadenylylsulfate (PAPS)1 reductase in the sulfate assimilation pathway (3.Lillig C.H. Prior A. Schwenn J.D.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). E. coli thioredoxin is also an essential subunit of the DNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 and is essential for the assembly of several filamentous phages (5.Russel M. Model P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The redox activities of the protein are not required for these latter functions (6.Huber H.E. Russel M. Model P. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15006-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many additional roles for thioredoxin have been proposed in eukaryotic organisms (7.Schulze-Osthoff K. Schenk H. Droge W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8.Iwata S. Hori T. Sato N. Hirota K. Sasada T. Mitsui A. Hirakawa T. Yodoi J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3108-3117PubMed Google Scholar). Thioredoxin can also help in the cellular defense against oxidative stresses, such as exposure to hydrogen peroxide or hydroxyl radicals (9.Spector A. Yan G.Z. Huang R.R. McDermott M.J. Gascoyne P.R. Pigiet V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4984-4990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Takemoto T. Zhang Q.M. Yonei S. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1998; 24: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species can oxidize cysteine or methionine residues leading to the formation of disulfide bridges or methionine sulfoxide (11.Moskovitz J. Rahman M.A. Strassman J. Yancey S.O. Kushner S.R. Brot N. Weissbach H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Such reactions will often inactivate cellular proteins. Reduction of both of these products may be accomplished in microbial systems by thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase (12.Farr S.B. Kogoma T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 561-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a second gene encoding a thioredoxin was discovered inE. coli (13.Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14.Stewart E.J. Åslund F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In vitro data show that thioredoxin 2 (trxC gene product) is a functional thioredoxin, as it was able to reduce insulin and ribonucleotide reductases in a thioredoxin reductase-dependent manner (13.Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and serve as a hydrogen donor for PAPS reductase (3.Lillig C.H. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Åslund F.

These finding were confirmed in vivo, where the overexpressedtrxC gene product could complement mutant strains for various functions (14.Stewart E.J. Åslund F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, the wild-type expression level of thioredoxin 2 was not sufficient to replace either thioredoxin 1 or glutaredoxin 1 in the reducing pathway of sulfate assimilation, as atrxA grxA double mutant was not viable on minimal media (4.Russel M. Model P. Holmgren A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Whereas thioredoxins are usually similar in size and share the three-dimensional “thioredoxin fold” structure, E. colithioredoxin 2 contains, in addition, a novel N-terminal domain of 30 amino acids. This domain contains two pairs of cysteine residues both in CX 1 X 2C sequences.In vitro, this N-terminal region partly regulates the enzymatic activity of thioredoxin 2 as a protein-disulfide reductase (13.Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this study, we have asked whether there are specific physiological roles attributable to thioredoxin 2 that differentiate it from thioredoxin 1, and whether the unusual N terminus of thioredoxin 2 might contribute to any such differences. Our findings indicate that there is substantial overlap in the reactions that can utilize either of the two thioredoxins. However, our studies on the regulation of TrxC suggest an important role for thioredoxin 2 in the response of E. coli to oxidative stress that may differentiate it from thioredoxin 1. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI. Cells were grown routinely in NZY medium (15.Guzman L.M. Barondess J.J. Beckwith J. J.

Open table in a new tab Site-specific mutations were introduced in trxC to change cysteine residues to serines. Wild-type trxC was amplified by PCR with pEJS62 as template and the primers fs1-XbaI, AAGTCTAGATACTCATCCCGAGGTTAGTT, and fs2-HindIII, CGCTAAGCTTAAAGAGATTCGTTCAGCCA. (i) To get TrxC mutants with C5S/C8S or C8S the primer fs1-XbaI was replaced by either GCTCTAGATACTCATCCCGAGGTTAGTTATGAATACCGTTAGTACCCATAGTCAGGCCATCA or GCTCTAGATACTCATCCCGAGGTTAGTTATGAATACCGTTTGTACCCATAGTCAGGCCATCA for the PCR reaction. The mutagenic base changes are shown in boldface. (ii) To get the mutations for TrxC C25S/C28S and C64S/C67S two PCR reactions were carried out. First, the 5′ end oftrxC was amplified using pEJS62 as template and the mutagenic oligonucleotides AGTCGTGACCGCTGCGTCCGCTTTTTGCCGCATC (C25S/C28S) or GAAATTACGGGAGGGGCCGGACCACGGTGC (C64S/C67S) and fs1-XbaI as primers. The product of this PCR reaction was then used in a second round of PCR to amplify the entire trxC gene with pEJS62 as template and fs2-HindIII as second primer. The PCR products were cut withXbaI and HindIII and ligated with pBAD33 cut withXbaI and HindIII to give the desired plasmids. In order to get the mutant C8S/C25S/C28S pDR1008 was both digested withPvuI and DraIII. The DNA fragment containing the 3′ part of trxC was then ligated with pDR1007 cut withPvuI and DraIII. This resulted in the plasmid pDR1011. We also constructed similar variants of TrxC to the ones described by Miranda-Vizuete et al. (13.Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The complete trxCcoding sequence was amplified by PCR using pEJS62 as template and TAGTTATATGAATACCGTTTGTACCC as well as TTATTGCTCAGCAAGAGATTCGTTCAGCCAG as primers containing anNdeI and BlpI restriction site (underlined), respectively. The product was digested with NdeI andBlpI and ligated with the expression vector pET15b cut with the same restriction enzymes to create plasmid pDR1000. The same expression construct was also placed under the control of the arabinose promoter by cutting pDR1000 with XbaI and HindIII and ligating with pBAD33 cut with XbaI andHindIII to give pDR1005. Finally, a truncated version oftrxC was created by PCR lacking the 5′ region coding for amino acids 2–29 again using pEJS62 as template and GTGCATATGCACGACTTGTTTGACG plus fs2-HindIII as primers. The amplified DNA fragment was cut with NdeI andHindIII and ligated with pDR1005 digested with the same enzymes to yield pDR1006. To obtain a trxC promoter plasmid, a fragment carrying the trxC promoter region was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using the primers GGACAGAATTCACTTTGACC and CGGGATCCCGATTGATGGCCTGAC. The 290-base pair fragment was cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pUC18 to generate pGSO105. The integrity of all of these plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing. To obtain a translational fusion of the N-terminal part of TrxC with β-galactosidase, a DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA from DHB4 as template and GGAATTCTCCAGTGCCAGAACGCAATC plus CCGGATCCAAGTCGATCACCACAGGTAGATCAT as primers. The first primer hybridizes to a position 814 nucleotides upstream of the predicted translation start site of trxC and contains anEcoRI site. The second primer hybridizes within thetrxC-coding region and contains a BamHI site. The amplified DNA fragment was cut with EcoRI andBamHI and ligated into pNG102 that had been cut withEcoRI and BamHI as well to give plasmid pHMP1, and the integrity was confirmed by sequencing. The construct expresses a hybrid protein with the first 58 codons of TrxC fused to β-galactosidase. The fusion was then integrated into the chromosome of DHB4 using specialized transduction with lambda InCh 2Boyd, D., Weiss, D., Chen, J., and Beckwith, J., J. Bacteriol, in press. to give HP15 and subsequently transferred to other recipient strains by generalized transduction with P1 (17.Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Assays on plate and in liquid media were performed as described (17.Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase activity inhibitor PETG (Bachem, Torrance, CA) was added to minimal plates at a final concentration of 1 mm (18.Schatz P.J. Riggs P.D. Jacq A. Fath M.J. Beckwith J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) to facilitate distinction between strains exhibiting wild-type expression levels of thetrxC′-′lacZ fusion and mutants that had acquired a higher expression level. To determine the effect of H2O2 and diamide (diazenedicarboxylic acid bis(N,N′-dimethylamide), Sigma) on growth rate, cells were grown to an A 600 of about 0.15 in rich medium at 37 °C, and H2O2 or diamide was then added to a final concentration of 5 mm or 800 μm, respectively. The growth of the cells was then followed by determining the absorbance at 600 nm. The plasmid pDR1000 was transformed into BL21/λDE3, and one large colony was used to inoculate 1 liter of NZ medium with 200 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown to mid-log phase at 37 °C. After addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, expression of thioredoxin 2 was then induced for 2 h. Cells were harvested and broken by three passages through a French press at 16,000 pounds/square inch. The crude extract was then applied onto a Ni2+-affinity column (Novagen, Madison, WI). After washing the column, His6-TrxC was eluted with 60 mm imidazole and dialyzed against a buffer with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at 1.5 mg/ml. Polyclonal antibodies against thioredoxin 2 were then raised in New Zealand White rabbits (Covance, Denver, PA). The antibodies were affinity purified on PVDF blots. Purified His6-TrxC was electrophoresed on a 15% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by semi-dry electroblotting (Bio-Rad). Anti-TrxC serum was diluted 10-fold with phosphate-buffered saline, and 500-μl aliquots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 5 × 13-mm piece of PVDF membrane containing 60 μg of thioredoxin 2 each. After extensive washing, antibodies were eluted first with 100 μl of 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.5, and then with 100 μl of triethylamine, pH 11.7. The pH was immediately neutralized by adding 1/10 volume of 1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0. Glycerol was finally added to a final concentration of 20%, and the purified antibodies were stored at −20 °C. The in vivo redox state of TrxC was measured by acid trapping of thiols and alkylation with the high molecular mass molecule AMS (4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) essentially as described (19.Åslund F. Zheng M. Beckwith J. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the cell cultures at mid-log phase were mixed with 1/10 volume of 100% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation and washed once with 1 ml of acetone. The dried pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 15 mm AMS and incubated 1 h at room temperature. Finally, 12-μl aliquots of the alkylated proteins were separated on 15% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, transferred to PVDF membranes with a semi-dry blotter, and probed with anti-TrxC or anti-DsbC antibodies. The antibodies were detected by using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA was isolated from MC4100 and GSO47 as described previously (20.Zheng M. Doan B. Schneider T.D. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4639-4643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using an oligonucleotide specific to trxC (GATTGATGGCCTGACAATGGGTAC), the RNA samples were subjected to primer extension assays as described elsewhere (21.Storz G. Altuvia S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The DNase I footprinting assay of OxyR binding to the trxC promoter, contained on theBamHI-EcoRI fragment of pGSO105, was carried out as described previously (22.Toledano M.B. Kullik I. Trinh F. Baird P.T. Schneider T.D. Storz G. Cell. 1994; 78: 897-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to determine the physiological roles that thioredoxin 2 might play. Here, we analyze the functions of the two thioredoxins in vivo and ask whether the N-terminal domain of thioredoxin 2 influences these activities. For this purpose, we have constructed derivatives of the trxC gene on a plasmid that expressed proteins altered either in the active site cysteines of the thioredoxin fold or in the N-terminal domain containing the additional four cysteines. Each of the three pairs of cysteines in thioredoxin 2 were mutated to serines (the third pair being the active-site cysteines). However, we found that the mutation of cysteine residue 5 led to a significant decrease in expression (data not shown). Therefore, Cys-8 was mutated alone, and this mutation was combined with the mutation C25S/C28S to give a TrxC variant that was missing three out of four of the extra cysteines. Finally, we constructed a deletion of the N-terminal domain of TrxC (amino acids 2–29). As the expression level of the truncated TrxC is lower than the wild type, we incorporated the constructs into an expression vector in which they were fused to an N-terminal linker coding for a His6 tag. In this vector, induction by arabinose of the pBAD promoter leads to expression levels of thioredoxin 2 comparable to those of thioredoxin 1. A trxA, grxA double mutant is unable to grow on minimal media because of a requirement for either thioredoxin 1 or glutaredoxin 1 for PAPS reductase activity. This defect results in a cysteine requirement on minimal media. Previous results have shown that thioredoxin 2 expressed from a plasmid complements this growth defect (14.Stewart E.J. Åslund F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We find that the influence of the N-terminal domain on the ability to complement the growth defect on minimal medium is minimal, as all TrxC mutant variants that have an intact active site are capable of replacing thioredoxin 1/glutaredoxin 1 (data not shown). Cytoplasmic thioredoxin 1 is also required to maintain the proper redox state of the periplasmic protein, DsbC. DsbC is itself a thioredoxin-like protein that has protein disulfide isomerase activity. The active-site cysteines are kept in a reduced state by the integral membrane protein DsbD, which in turn derives reducing power from cytoplasmic thioredoxin 1. A mutant strain lacking thioredoxin 1 (trxA) or thioredoxin reductase (trxB) accumulates oxidized DsbC suggesting that thioredoxin 1 ordinarily is the exclusive hydrogen donor to DsbD/DsbC (23.Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of thioredoxin 2 did restore the reduction of DsbC to a mutant completely lacking any thioredoxin (Fig.1). Mutational changes in the N-terminal domain of TrxC did not alter the capacity to complement (Fig. 1). Again, although chromosomal expression of TrxC is not sufficient to maintain DsbC in a reduced state, thioredoxin 2 is able to perform this function when expressed at levels comparable to that of thioredoxin 1. Finally, we looked at methionine sulfoxide reductase, which requires thioredoxin 1 but not thioredoxin 2 for its activity; mutations intrxA alone elicit a mutant phenotype (2.Russel M. Model P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14997-15005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A methionine auxotrophic strain (e.g. metE) cannot grow on methionine sulfoxide as sole source of methionine if thioredoxin 1 is missing. Previous results suggested that overexpressed thioredoxin 2 can only poorly complement this defect (14.Stewart E.J. Åslund F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5543-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that the N-terminal domain of thioredoxin 2 interferes with its ability to interact with some thioredoxin 1 substrates. However, none of the several mutant TrxC proteins were able to restore growth of the A313 strain on minimal medium with methionine sulfoxide when expressed at similar levels as chromosomal thioredoxin 1. We observed slight complementation only when high levels of wild-type TrxC were expressed (as is the case with pDR1005). In summary, thioredoxin 2 is capable of complementing various growth defects caused by the lack of thioredoxin 1. It can function as hydrogen donor for PAPS reductase, ribonucleotide reductase (not shown), and is able to donate reducing equivalents to the periplasmic disulfide bond isomerase DsbC via the membrane protein DsbD. Mutants, which lack one or several N-terminal cysteines or have this domain entirely removed, can still function as well as wild-type thioredoxin 2 in these assays. However, methionine sulfoxide reductase appears to be acted upon much more efficiently by thioredoxin 1. Moreover, thioredoxin 2 is not able to restore a functional T7 phage infection cycle, 3E. Stewart, personal communication. another example where the interaction between a substrate and thioredoxin is specific for thioredoxin 1. The results described above do not reveal any special physiological role for thioredoxin 2 nor does it appear to differ greatly in its specificity from thioredoxin 1. Therefore, we chose another approach to see if it was possible to distinguish a different function for this second thioredoxin. We considered that if we could identify genes that regulated the expression of trxC, these might give clues as to the conditions under which thioredoxin 2 becomes important to the cell. A direct genetic selection for mutations that increase trxCexpression is made possible by the finding that overexpression oftrxC from a plasmid restores growth on minimal medium to thetrxA, grxA double mutant WP813. Thus, mutations in a regulatory gene that expressed TrxC constitutively might also allow growth of the double mutant. To exclude mutations that would simply change the promoter region of trxC we integrated a translational trxC′-′lacZ fusion into the chromosome at the attachment site of the phage λ (attB) in a strain still carrying trxC (HP24). Mutant strains that are able to grow on minimal medium and at the same time are blue on indicator plates should contain mutations in trans-acting elements that are responsible for the expression of trxC. A wild-type strain containing the trxC′-′lacZ fusion (HP15) remains white on these plates with the β-galactosidase inhibitor PETG (see “Experimental Procedures”). We used two different approaches to generate mutants to test in our combined selection and screening plate assay. First, we used a transposon mutagenesis to select specifically for mutants due to the inactivation of a “repressing” element, and second we selected for spontaneous suppressors of the growth defect of HP24 on minimal plates that should yield a wide array of either loss of function or gain of function mutations. Transposon mutagenesis with a recombinant λ phage NK1324 that carries a mini-Tn10 with a chloramphenicol resistance marker on HP24 was done as described (24.Kleckner N. Bender J. Gottesman S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 139-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). 12 mutants were obtained; all of them showed a dark blue color on plates with chromogenic substrate X-gal, indicating thattrxC was activated in these strains. By using P1 transduction, we found that only two mutants showed linkage of the chloramphenicol resistance to restoration of growth on minimal plates. We amplified DNA fragments flanking the Tn10 insertion site of these two mutants by PCR using chromosomal DNA as template and arbitrary primers plus a Tn10-specific primer (25.O'Toole G.A. Kolter R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1991) Google Scholar). The PCR fragments were then sequenced to determine the transposon insertion site. In both mutants (DR379 and DR380), the transposon was inserted in the same region as follows: one insertion was 29 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site of ahpC, whereas the second strain had the Tn10 insertion in the coding region ofahpC, disrupting the open reading frame at codon 32.ahpC encodes the smaller subunit (C) of a two-subunit protein complex that has alkyl hydroperoxidase activity (26.Storz G. Jacobson F.S. Tartaglia L.A. Morgan R.W. Silveira L.A. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2049-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and an active site disulfide bond. The larger subunit (F52) is highly homologous to thioredoxin reductase (27.Tartaglia L.A. Storz G. Brodsky M.H. Lai A. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10535-10540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can directly interact with AhpC and reduce its active site cysteines in an NADH-dependent manner (28.Poole L.B.

SecYEG was reconstituted into liposomes composed of defined synthetic phospholipids, and proteoliposomes were analyzed for their preprotein translocation and SecA translocation ATPase activity. The activity strictly required the presence of anionic phospholipids, whereas the non-bilayer lipid phosphatidylethanolamine was found stimulatory. The latter effect could also be induced by dioleoylglycerol, a lipid that adopts a non-bilayer conformation. Phosphatidylethanolamine derivatives that prefer the bilayer state were unable to stimulate translocation. In the absence of SecG, activity was reduced, but the phospholipid requirement was unaltered. Remarkably, non-bilayer lipids were found essential for the activity of the Bacillus subtilis SecYEG complex. Optimal activity required a mixture of anionic and non-bilayer lipids at concentrations that correspond to concentrations found in the natural membrane."

The current model of Wnt signal transduction proposes that in the absence of a Wnt signal, β-catenin binds an APC1-Axin complex, where it is phosphorylated by GSK-3β and subsequently targeted for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. When Wnt signaling is activated via ligand binding to the frizzled encoded receptors, the activity of GSK-3β is inhibited, and cytosolic β-catenin accumulates and interacts with TCF/LEF-1 transcription factors, leading to translocation to the nucleus and transcriptional modulation of target genes (3.Dale T.C.

The dishevelled gene family (dsh/Dvl) encodes cytoplasmic proteins that are essential for transmission of the wg/Wnt signal.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid screen and X-gal colony filter assays were performed as described (23.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The hybrid bait was constructed by fusing the region encoding the Dvl2 PDZ domain (amino acids 186–391) to the LexA DNA-binding domain in pEG202 (provided by R. Brent, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). A human fetal brain cDNA library expressed from pJG4–5 (provided by D. Krainc, Harvard Medical School) was screened, and interactions were detected in the yeast strain EGY48 (matα ura3 trp1 his3 3LexAop-Leu2) based on galactose-dependent growth on SD/−His/−Ura/−Trp media lacking leucine and galactose-dependent β-galactosidase activity. The pSV-Dvl3 construct was made by subcloning the 2.5-kilobase pair Dvl3 cDNA EcoRI/XhoI fragment into pSVK3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pCS-PP2Cα construct was generated by subcloning a BamHI/XhoI fragment containing a full-length PP2Cα cDNA into the corresponding sites of the expression vector pCS2+. The phosphatase mutants pCS-PP2C-R/K and pCS-PP2C-R/A were generated by replacing the Arg195 with a Lys or Ala codon, respectively, using a standard polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis protocol. Clones harboring the R195K amino acid substitution were identified by DNA sequence analysis. The Myc epitope-tagged Axin construct and Wnt-1 expression plasmid were kindly provided by F. Costantini (Columbia University, New York) and A. McMahon (Harvard Medical School), respectively. The LEF-1 and LEF-luciferase expression plasmids were generously provided by R. Grosschedl (University of California, San Francisco). The tau expression plasmid was kindly provided by M. Monteiro (University of Maryland, Baltimore). Transfections in COS-1 cells were performed using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). COS-1 cells (6 × 105) were incubated for 3 h with SuperFect reagent-DNA complexes, with the optimal ratio determined to be 30 μl of SuperFect reagent/5 μg of DNA. The total amount of DNA for each transfection was kept constant by the addition of the empty expression vector pCS2+. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Transfected COS-1 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO4, 1 mm calyculin A) containing the protease inhibitor mixture CompleteTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated for 20 min on ice. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell lysates (150 μg) were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PP2Cα (Upstate Biotechnology) using standard procedures. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times in RIPA buffer containing 0.05% SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were generated against a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the 100 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of Dvl3 using the ClonaCellTM-HY hybridoma cloning kit (Stem Cell Technologies, Inc.). Hybridoma supernatants were initially screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against the fusion protein, with positive clones undergoing a second screen against GST to eliminate those recognizing the GST portion of the fusion protein. The supernatants from positive clones were subsequently screened against GST and the fusion protein by Western blot analysis. Hybridoma clone 3-4D3 displayed the highest level of reactivity and was specific for Dvl3. Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were resuspended in 3× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was performed with anti-Dvl3, anti-β-catenin (Transduction Labs), anti-PP2Cα (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-tau C-17 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-Myc-horseradish peroxidase(Invitrogen) antibodies using standard procedures. Blots were visualized with the ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were transfected with 2.0 or 1.5 μg of each expression plasmid, 1.0 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of LEF-1 expression plasmid, and 0.5 μg of pCMV β-galactosidase expression vector as an internal control. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured 24 h after transfection using reagents from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 20 μg of protein was used for luciferase determination, except for samples from β-catenin transfected cells, in which case 0.5 μg was used. The relative luciferase activities presented were normalized by dividing the luciferase activity by the β-galactosidase activity. COS-1 cells (6 × 105) transfected with the Myc-Axin expression construct were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 0.1% SDS, and cell lysates (150 μg) were immunoprecipitated with 1.2 μg of anti-Myc antibody A-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were recovered with protein G-SepharoseTM and washed four times with RIPA buffer containing no phosphatase inhibitors and twice in phosphatase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) in the presence or absence of 60 mm magnesium acetate. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 20 μl of phosphatase reaction buffer containing 0.04 μg of PP2Cα (Upstate Biotechnology) in the presence or absence of 60 mm magnesium acetate, or in the presence of 60 mm magnesium acetate and 2.5 μm okadaic acid, and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 15 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. COS-1 cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 35-mm dishes and transfected with 1 μg of Myc-Axin and 4 μg of either pCS2 or pCS2-PP2C using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). After 24 h, pulse-chase analysis was performed essentially as described (24.Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Kishida M. Ikeda S. Takada S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10681-10684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected COS-1 cells were preincubated for 15 min in medium lacking methionine and cysteine prior to labeling. After labeling for 30 min, plates were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmNaVO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm calyculin A, and protease inhibitor mixture CompleteTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cell lysates were precleared for 1 h using protein G-Sepharose and incubated overnight with anti-Myc epitope antibody. Immune complexes were recovered with protein G-SepharoseTM, washed three times with lysis buffer, suspended in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. Samples were analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. To understand the molecular mechanisms of Dvl function, we searched for new interacting proteins with Dvl. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library conditionally expressed from the GAL1 promoter identified three positive clones that interacted with the LexA-Dvl2 PDZ domain bait construct. The specificity of these interactions was assessed using the colony color filter assay for β-galactosidase activity; no β-galactosidase activity was observed when the three clones were co-expressed with a second bait protein consisting of the LexA domain fused to a portion of theDrosophila bicoid protein (data not shown). These results confirmed that the interactions were specific for the Dvl2 PDZ domain and not the LexA portion of the bait hybrid. Sequencing of the clones identified them as CW-1, a homologue of the mouse tctex-1 gene family; β-filamin (ABP-278), a member of the filamin protein family showing homology to actin binding protein 280 (25.Takafuta T. Wu G. Murphy G.F. Shapiro S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17531-17538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); and PP2C, a magnesium-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase (26.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). All three proteins also interacted in the yeast system with the PDZ domain of Dvl1 (data not shown), consistent with the high level of sequence conservation among the Dvl proteins. Initial attempts to co-immunoprecipitate FLAG epitope-tagged constructs of CW-1 and β-filamin with Dvl3 were unsuccessful, and we focused therefore on our third positive clone, PP2C. To confirm the interaction between PP2C and Dvl in mammalian cells, we co-expressed PP2C and Dvl3 in COS-1 cells by transient transfection and analyzed immunoprecipitates by Western blot. When PP2C and Dvl3 were co-expressed in COS-1 cells, an anti-PP2C polyclonal antibody immunoprecipitated Dvl3 protein (Fig.1 A). This antibody also co-precipitated endogenous β-catenin as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). Additionally, we found that Dvl3 and β-catenin co-immunoprecipitated using antibodies against either β-catenin or Dvl3. 2D. Song, D. J. Sussman, D. and Seldin, unpublished results. Previously, it had been shown that Axin binds β-catenin to regulate its abundance (9.Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Based on our observations that PP2C associates with β-catenin and recent evidence demonstrating a direct interaction between Dvl1 and Axin (20.Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S.-I. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr III G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility of a physical interaction between PP2C and Axin. When lysates from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with PP2C and Myc epitope-tagged Axin were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PP2C, Myc-Axin was detected in the immune complexes (Fig. 1 A). Likewise, PP2C was brought down with immunoprecipitated Myc-Axin (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that PP2C associates with both Dvl and Axin and suggest that these proteins exist in a complex with β-catenin. β-Catenin has been shown to interact with LEF-1 DNA binding factors and regulate transcription (10.Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). To ascertain a role for PP2C inWnt signaling, we analyzed the effect of PP2C on LEF-1-mediated transcription of a luciferase reporter gene. A CMV-driven β-galactosidase construct was utilized as an internal control for normalization of luciferase activities. Whereas expression of PP2C had no effect on β-galactosidase activity (data not shown), the expression of PP2C and LEF-1 in COS-1 cells resulted in a marked increase in luciferase activity (Fig.2 A), demonstrating activation of the Wnt pathway. Moreover, co-expression of PP2C with Wnt-1, Dvl3, or β-catenin enhanced LEF-1 reporter activity 1.75-, 1.81-, and 1.70-fold, respectively, when compared with cells expressing Wnt-1, Dvl3, or β-catenin alone (Fig. 2, B andC). In an analysis of five independent experiments, the inclusion of PP2C resulted in a synergistic effect, as the average fold induction over the minus LEF-1 controls by PP2C or Wnt alone was 8.40 and 9.01, respectively, whereas co-expression caused a 25.40-fold induction (data not shown). Only low levels of transcription of the LEF-1 reporter were observed in the absence of co-expressed LEF-1, indicating that PP2C, Wnt-1, Dvl3, and β-catenin mediate their effects on reporter gene transcription through LEF-1. A catalytically deficient PP2C mutant, PP2CR/K, was generated to verify that phosphatase activity is required for activation of the LEF-1 reporter gene. This mutation, in which the conserved Arg195 is altered to Lys, has been shown to confer reduced phosphatase activity in the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog FEM-2 without affecting the overall structure and stability of the protein (27.Chin-Sang I.D. Spence A.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2314-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PP2CR/K demonstrated some residual activity, as evidenced by transcriptional activation of the LEF-1 reporter gene; however, luciferase activities were approximately 47% lower than those obtained in COS-1 cells expressing wild-type PP2C (Fig. 2 A). In addition, co-expression of PP2CR/K with Wnt-1, Dvl3, or β-catenin failed to significantly enhance reporter gene activity. Similar results were obtained with a second mutant, PP2CR/A, in which the conserved Arg195 is altered to Ala (data not shown). Axin has been identified as a negative regulator of Wntsignaling (4.Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction of PP2C and Axin affects the ability of Axin to inhibit Wnt signal transduction, the LEF-1 reporter gene assay was performed. As seen in previous studies (8.Sakanaka C. Weiss J.B. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3020-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), expression of Axin alone failed to activate LEF-1 reporter gene transcription, and co-expression of Axin with Wnt-1 inhibited the effects of Wnt-1 on LEF-1 reporter activity (Fig. 2 D). Co-expression of PP2C with Wnt-1 and Axin, however, restored transcription levels to those obtained with Wnt-1 alone (Fig. 2 D), whereas PP2CR/K had no effect (Fig.2 D). Previous studies in Drosophila and mammalian cell lines have shown that a hyperphosphorylated, membrane-associated form of dsh/Dvl is generated in response to wg/Wnt signaling (15.Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar,28.Steitz S.A. Tsang M. Sussman D.J. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1996; 32: 441-445Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29.Lee J.-S. Ishimoto A. Yanagawa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21464-21470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A number of signaling molecules are activated when translocated to the plasma membrane, suggesting that the hyperphosphorylated form of dsh/Dvl represents an active form of the protein involved in mediating the wg/Wnt signal (15.Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possibility that PP2C acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt pathway by dephosphorylating Dvl. To determine whether Dvl3 was a substrate for PP2C, we assessed the phosphorylation status of Dvl3 by examining the effect of PP2C on its electrophoretic mobility. We observed no change in the migration or relative composition of the hyper- or hypophosphorylated forms of transfected Dvl3 in the presence of co-transfected PP2C (data not shown), suggesting that Dvl3 is not the direct target of PP2C. We next examined the effect of PP2C on the activity of GSK-3β, a serine/threonine kinase that negatively regulates the Wntpathway through the phosphorylation of β-catenin (30.Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Our results from the LEF-1 reporter assay indicate that PP2C activatesWnt signal transduction. Based on these observations, we reasoned that PP2C might function to inhibit the kinase activity of GSK-3β, thereby promoting the Wnt signal. We monitored the effect of PP2C on GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of tau (31.Wagner U. Utton M. Gallo J-M. Miller C.C.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1537-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in COS-1 cells. Western blot analysis of tau-transfected COS-1 cells using a phosphorylation-independent tau antibody revealed that tau migrated as a doublet (Fig. 3 A). Consistent with previous observations (32.Wagner U. Brownless J. Irving N.G. Lucas F.R. Salinas P.C. Miller C.C.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), co-transfection of tau with GSK-3β resulted in the phosphorylation of tau by GSK-3β, reducing the electrophoretic mobility of the tau protein (Fig. 3 A). Co-expression of PP2C with tau and GSK-3β did not effect GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of tau (Fig. 3 A), implying that the stimulation of Wnt signaling by PP2C does not occur through the down-regulation of GSK-3β activity. In view of these results, we investigated β-catenin, APC, and Axin as possible targets of PP2C by examining the phosphorylation status of these proteins by Western blot analysis when co-expressed with Wnt-1, GSK-3β, PP2C, and PP2CR/K. Recent studies have demonstrated that Axin and APC form a tetrameric complex with GSK-3β and β-catenin (6.Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Sakamoto I. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10823-10826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and that this complex induces the degradation of β-catenin by promoting its phosphorylation by GSK-3β (7.Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Uochi T. Ikeda S. Koyama S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 9.Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of APC by GSK-3β has been shown to enhance the interaction of APC with β-catenin (33.Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar), and recently, the ability of GSK-3β to phosphorylate Axin was demonstrated (9.Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Comparison of cells co-expressing β-catenin or APC with Wnt-1, GSK-3β, PP2C, or PP2CR/K revealed no change in the electrophoretic mobility of β-catenin or APC (data not shown). In contrast, co-expression of PP2C with Axin resulted in a significant shift in the ratio of a slower to faster migrating species of Axin when compared with cells co-expressing GSK-3β or PP2CR/K (Fig. 3 B). The shift in migration is presumably because of the dephosphorylation of Axin by PP2C. We used an in vitro phosphatase assay to determine whether Axin could serve as a direct substrate for PP2C. Western blot analysis of Axin immunocomplexes treated with PP2C resulted in a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of Axin that was not observed in untreated samples (Fig. 3 C). Moreover, the dephosphorylation of Axin by PP2C was dependent on the presence of Mg2+ (Fig.3 C), consistent with the known properties of PP2C enzymes (26.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Addition of okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of types 1, 2A, and 2B phosphatases (34.Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar), did not prevent the observed dephosphorylation of Axin (Fig. 3 C), providing further evidence that PP2C is the enzyme mediating this effect. Taken together, these results suggest that PP2C functions to relieve Axin's inhibition of Wnt-1signaling through the dephosphorylation of Axin. A recent study determined that the phosphorylation of Axin is important for its stability (24.Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Kishida M. Ikeda S. Takada S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10681-10684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To determine whether PP2C expression has an effect on Axin half-life, we performed pulse-chase experiments on COS-1 cells co-transfected with vectors expressing a Myc-tagged Axin and PP2C. As shown in Fig. 4, the expression of PP2C leads to a significant decrease in half-life of the Myc-tagged Axin. The reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a fundamental mechanism in signal transduction systems that regulate a variety of cellular events, and the important role of protein phosphatases in this process is well documented (35.Depaoli-Roach A.A. Park I.-K. Cerovsky V. Csortos C. Durbin S.D. Kuntz M.J. Sitikov A. Tang P.M. Verin A. Zolnierowicz S. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1994; 34: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We identified PP2C as a new potential component of the Wnt signal transduction pathway and have demonstrated its ability to function as a positive regulator ofWnt signaling possibly through interactions with Dvl and Axin. Axin contains several predicted sites for serine/threonine phosphorylation and is directly phosphorylated by GSK-3β (9.Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Although the phosphorylation status of Axin does not affect its binding to GSK-3β and β-catenin in vitro (9.Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar), it is correlated with its stability, with the phosphorylated form of Axin representing the more stable form of the protein (24.Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Kishida M. Ikeda S. Takada S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10681-10684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In addition, the phosphorylation of APC and β-catenin by GSK-3β has been demonstrated to be critical for the rapid turnover of β-catenin by the ubiquitination-proteosome pathway. Our results demonstrate that PP2C dephosphorylates Axin and propagates the Wnt signal; however, the biochemical mechanisms regulating this process, as well as the precise role of the association between PP2C and Dvl, remains unclear. The activation of Wnt signaling by Dvl and PP2C is interesting in light of the findings that these proteins have opposing effects on the regulation of the Jun-NH2-terminal kinase pathway (18.Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 19.Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. Caruso A.M. McMahon A. Sussman D.J. Wu D.

Recently, the catalytic subunit of PP2A was shown to interact with Axin (38.Hsu W. Zeng L. Costantini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3439-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), whereas the PP2A B56 regulatory subunit interacts with APC and β-catenin (39.Seeling J.M. Miller J.D. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to PP2C, PP2A was found to be inhibitory to Wnt signaling, as expression of the B56 subunit reduced the abundance of β-catenin and decreased its transcriptional activity (39.Seeling J.M. Miller J.D. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2014047151,"Vesicular stomatitis is an economically important arboviral disease of livestock. Viremia is absent in infected mammalian hosts, and the mechanism by which insects become infected with the causative agents, vesicular stomatitis viruses, remains unknown. Because infected and noninfected insects potentially feed on the same host in nature, infected and noninfected black flies were allowed to feed on the same host. Viremia was not detected in the host after infection by a black fly bite, but because noninfected black flies acquired the virus while co-feeding on the same host with infected black flies, it is concluded that a viremic host is not necessary for an insect to be infected with the virus. Thus co-feeding is a mechanism of infection for an insect-transmitted virus."

Here we show that binding of C2 toxin depends on the presence of asparagine-linked carbohydrates. A recently identified Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant (Fritz, G., Schroeder, P., and Aktories, K. (1995) Infect. Immun. 63, 2334–2340) was found to be deficient inN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I. C2 sensitivity of this mutant was restored by transfection of anN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I cDNA. C2 toxin sensitivity was reduced after inhibition of α-mannosidase II. In contrast, Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants deficient in sialylated (Lec2) or galactosylated (Lec8) glycoconjugates showed an increase in toxin sensitivity compared with wild-type cells. Our results show that the GlcNAc residue linked β-1,2 to the α-1,3-mannose of the asparagine-linked core structure is essential for C2II binding to Chinese hamster ovary cells. Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin is a binary toxin composed of an enzymatic subunit (C2I) capable of ADP-ribosylating actin and a binding subunit (C2II) that is responsible for interaction with receptors on eukaryotic cells. Here we show that binding of C2 toxin depends on the presence of asparagine-linked carbohydrates. A recently identified Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant (Fritz, G., Schroeder, P., and Aktories, K. (1995) Infect. Immun. 63, 2334–2340) was found to be deficient inN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I. C2 sensitivity of this mutant was restored by transfection of anN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I cDNA. C2 toxin sensitivity was reduced after inhibition of α-mannosidase II. In contrast, Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants deficient in sialylated (Lec2) or galactosylated (Lec8) glycoconjugates showed an increase in toxin sensitivity compared with wild-type cells. Our results show that the GlcNAc residue linked β-1,2 to the α-1,3-mannose of the asparagine-linked core structure is essential for C2II binding to Chinese hamster ovary cells. Chinese hamster ovary UDP-GlcNAc:α-d-mannoside-β1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (EC 2.4.1.101) lens culinaris agglutinin polymerase chain reaction tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin is one of several binary toxins that recruit a binding component to deliver the enzymatic active component to the interior of eukaryotic cells (1.Boquet P. Munro P. Fiorentini C. Just I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 49-kDa catalytically active component (C2I) exhibits ADP-ribosyltransferase activity toward actin (2.Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and is translocated into cells through interaction of its N-terminal domain with the binding component C2II (3.Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage by trypsin removes an N-terminal 20-kDa fragment, thereby activating the C2II binding component (4.Ohishi I. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activated C-terminal 60-kDa fragment is then capable of binding both the enzymatic component and its receptor on eukaryotic cell membranes (5.Ohishi I. Yanagimoto A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4648-4655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After binding, the C2I-C2II complex is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis (6.Simpson L.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 1223-1228PubMed Google Scholar). Inside the cell, probably in an acidic endosomal compartment, C2I is translocated into the cytosol. In the cytosol, C2I ADP-ribosylates monomeric G-actin at arginine 177 (2.Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar,7.Vandekerckhove J. Schering B. Bärmann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 696-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylated G-actin is not able to polymerize but binds to the growing end of actin filaments in a capping protein-like manner, resulting in depolymerization of microfilaments (8.Wegner A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13739-13742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the morphological level, the breakdown of F-actin polymers is accompanied by the rounding up of toxin-treated cells. Toxins that act in a similar manner have been cloned from Clostridium spiroforme (9.Popoff M.R. Boquet P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar),Clostridium perfringens (iota toxin) (10.Perelle S. Scalzo S. Kochi S. Mock M. Popoff M.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 146: 117-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), andClostridium difficile CD196 (11.Perelle S. Gibert M. Bourlioux P. Corthier G. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All are of binary structure, modifying G-actin, although they show some variations with respect to their substrate specificity. While C2 only ADP-ribosylates β- and γ-actin, iota toxin can modify all actin isoforms (12.Mauss S. Chaponnier C. Just I. Aktories K. Gabbiani G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The binding components of these toxins exhibit about 40% sequence homology to C2II (13.Kimura K. Kubota T. Ohishi I. Isogai E. Isogai H. Fujii N. Vet. Microbiol. 1998; 62: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although the former three are more similar to each other than to C2II. The receptor structure for none of these toxins has been defined yet. Recently, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)1 cell mutant (RK14) resistant to C2 toxin has been isolated (14.Fritz G. Schroeder P. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2334-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resistance of this mutant could be attributed to a lack of toxin binding rather than mutation of an intracellular factor that could inhibit the toxic action of C2 (14.Fritz G. Schroeder P. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2334-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that inability of RK14 cells to bind C2 toxin is based on deficiency inN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAc-TI) activity, thus providing evidence that an N-linked complex (or hybrid) carbohydrate is essential for C2 toxin binding. Lec2 and Lec8 cells (15.Stanley P. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell. Genet. 1977; 3: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Lec13 (16.Ripka J. Adamany A. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), ldlD.Lec1 (17.Stanley P. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and 15B cells (18.Gottlieb C. Baenziger J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3303-3309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Pamela Stanley (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, New York) and Dr. Felix Wieland (Biochemie-Zentrum, Universität Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. Monoclonal antibody 735 directed against polysialic acid (19.Frosch M. Gorgen I. Boulnois G.J. Timmis K.N. Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. Rita Gerardy-Schahn (Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover, Germany). An antiserum against C2II was generated by immunization of rabbits with a peptide (ANANRDTDRDGIPDE) corresponding to the amino terminus of trypsin-activated C2II. Lectins, swainsonine, and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-phalloidin were obtained from Sigma.Taq polymerase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Recombinant C. botulinum toxin C2I and C2II were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, and the toxin components were liberated using thrombin as described recently (20.Barth H. Preiss J.C. Hofmann F. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29506-29511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). C2II was activated by incubation with 0.2 μg of trypsin/μg of C2II for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding trypsin inhibitor (2 μg/μg of trypsin). Toxin components were stored at −20 °C. CHO mutants Lec2, Lec8, Lec13, 15B, and ldlD.Lec1 were maintained in α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. CHO-K1 wild-type and RK14 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics described above. In experiments where cytotoxic effects of C2 toxin were compared among CHO-K1, RK14, and the other CHO mutants, all cells were maintained in α-modified Eagle's medium to exclude differences in C2 cytotoxicity due to different medium components or pH values. Semiconfluent monolayer cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of equimolar amounts of C2I and trypsin-activated C2II. After appropriate incubation at 37 °C, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, and the percentage of rounded cells was determined. In a second approach, cells were seeded at low density into 96-well cell culture plates (2 × 103cells/well) in the presence of increasing amounts of C2 toxin. When the untreated control wells became confluent, the C2 concentration that led to more than 90% cell death was determined. Lectin sensitivity of CHO mutants was determined in the same way, using increasing concentrations of the ricin B chain, lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA), and concanavalin A. To determine the protective effect of α-mannosidase II inhibition, cells were first incubated with 10 μm swainsonine for 48 h, before treatment with C2 toxin. The influence of toxin treatment on the colony forming ability was determined by incubating CHO cells at a density of 500 cells/6-cm cell culture dish with increasing amounts of C2 toxin for 4 h. Thereafter, cells were washed three times with PBS, medium was added, and the appearing colonies were counted 12–14 days later. Toxin-treated or untreated cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with 0.75 μg/ml TRITC-phalloidin for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, cells were washed four times for 10 min each with PBS followed by a short rinse in water. Specimens were embedded in Kaiser's gelatin. 1:1 mixtures of different CHO mutants were seeded in 35-mm culture dishes (approximately 5 × 105 cells in total). The next day, cell fusion was induced using 50% polyethylene glycol 4000 in 75 mm Hepes (pH 8.0). Another 24 h later, cells were harvested and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. After transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, nonspecific binding sites were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS. Polysialic acid was detected using monoclonal antibody 735 and anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate. Bound secondary antibodies were revealed using ECL chemiluminescence detection. Hamster GlcNAc transferase I was cloned from genomic DNA from CHO-K1 wild-type cells and mutants RK14 and 15B by PCR using Taq polymerase and primers 5′-GCGGTACCATGCTGAAGAAGCAGTC-3′ and 5′-GCGAATTCAGTCCAGCTAGGATCATAG-3′ (the KpnI andEcoRI restriction sites introduced to facilitate subcloning are underlined). The PCR product was subcloned into the KpnI and EcoRI sites of the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), resulting in the plasmid pGnT1. CHO-RK14 cells were transfected with pGnT1 using LipofectAMINE, following the instructions of the manufacturer. G418-resistant colonies were isolated and examined for C2 toxin sensitivity. Cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Lysates were diluted 10-fold with 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and subjected to an ADP-ribosylation assay as described (20.Barth H. Preiss J.C. Hofmann F. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29506-29511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (50 μg of protein) were incubated with 300 ng of C2I in 35 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 μm[α-32P]NAD for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by methanol-chloroform precipitation (21.Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 138: 141-143Crossref Scopus (3108) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were dissolved in Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) followed by PhosphorImager analysis. Confluent monolayers were prechilled at 4 °C and than incubated with different amounts of C2II in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, cells were washed six times with PBS and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (23.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Equal amounts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as described above. C2II was detected by sequential incubation with anti-C2II antiserum and anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugate followed by ECL detection, as described (3.Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of several bacterial toxins to target cells has been shown to be carbohydrate-dependent (24.Sandvig K. Garred O. van Deurs B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 412: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that cell binding of C2 toxin might be carbohydrate-dependent (25.Sugii S. Kozaki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1034: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To characterize the receptor for the C2II binding component of C2 toxin, we used several mutant CHO cell lines with well defined glycosylation defects (see TableI). Lec2 and Lec8 mutants lack sialylated and galactosylated glycoproteins and glycolipids, due to genetic defects in the CMP-sialic acid and UDP-galactose transporter, respectively (26.Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I.B. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 27.Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lec13 cells cannot produce GDP-fucose and therefore lack fucosylated glycoconjugates (16.Ripka J. Adamany A. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 15B cells are deficient in GlcNAc-TI (18.Gottlieb C. Baenziger J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3303-3309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, they produce only high-mannose and hybrid N-glycans, whereasO-linked glycans and glycolipids are normal. The cytotoxic effect of these mutants was compared with that of CHO-K1 wild-type cells and the C2 toxin-resistant CHO mutant RK14, described previously (14.Fritz G. Schroeder P. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2334-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the cytotoxic effect of C2 toxin, the cell rounding activity of increasing C2 toxin concentrations was determined for all cell lines (Fig. 1). CHO wild-type cells as well as the mutants Lec8 and Lec13 were sensitive against C2 toxin. However, significant differences in the sensitivity were observed. Lec8 cells were approximately 4-fold more sensitive than wild-type cells (Fig. 1 j), and the same was true for Lec2 cells (data not shown). In contrast, Lec13 cells were found to be slightly (2-fold) more resistant than wild-type cells. As reported previously (14.Fritz G. Schroeder P. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2334-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RK14 cells were strongly resistant to C2 toxin. Moreover, the CHO mutant 15B, which lacks complex and hybrid N-linked carbohydrates, was C2-resistant. This was also true for an independent mutant belonging to the same complementation group (ldlD.Lec1; data not shown). The above results could be confirmed by determination of the colony forming ability of toxin-treated cells (Fig.2). Again, Lec13 cells were found to be more resistant, whereas Lec2 and Lec8 cells exhibited increased sensitivity to C2 toxin compared with wild-type cells. In a different approach, cells were seeded at low density in 96-well plates and treated with increasing concentrations of C2 toxin. When untreated control wells were confluent, the lowest C2 concentration that causes more than 90% cell death was determined. The results obtained further confirmed the above results (TableII).Table ICHO glycosylation mutants used in this studyMutantGene affectedPhenotype15BN-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase INo complex and hydrid N-glycansRK14N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase INo complex and hydrid N-glycansLec2CMP-sialic acid transporterNo sialylated glycansLec8UDP-galactose transporterNo galactosylated glycansLec13GDP-D-mannose-4,6-dehydrataseNo fucosylated glycans Open table in a new tab Figure 2Influence of C2 toxin on the colony-forming ability of CHO mutant and wild-type cells.

To show the specificity of the cytotoxic effects and to exclude the possibility that differences in the organization of the cytoskeleton are responsible for the differences observed, mutants were treated with other clostridial toxins known to affect actin fibers by glucosylating Rho GTPases (28.Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 29.Just I. Wilm M. Selzer J. Rex G. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13932-13936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). All mutants tested (Lec13, Lec2, Lec8, 15B, and RK14) were equally sensitive to the action of C. difficiletoxins A and B (data not shown). Binding of C2II to CHO cells was examined by Western blotting using a specific antiserum directed against the carboxyl terminus of the toxin (Fig. 3 a). Wild-type, Lec13, and Lec8 cells bound C2II in a concentration-dependent manner. However, significant differences in C2II binding were not evident. Only a faint, nonspecific binding to RK14 cells was observed. In order to correlate the rounding activity of C2 toxin with the ADP-ribosylation of actin, we determined the amount of modified actin in toxin-treated cells. Cell lysates from toxin-treated cells were incubated with C2I to [32P]ADP-ribosylate the unmodified actin fraction. As expected, actin from untreated cells was effectively ADP-ribosylated (Fig. 3 b, −C2II). By contrast, after toxin treatment (200 ng/ml C2I and 400 ng/ml C2II for 6 h) most actin in wild-type, Lec8, and Lec13 cells was no longer ADP-ribosylated (Fig. 3 b, +C2II). On the other hand, most of the actin from RK14 cells was still modified by C2I, indicating that it has not been ADP-ribosylated before. The slight reduction in the amount of ADP-ribosylated actin compared with untreated RK14 cells is probably due to the presence of cells that regained the ability to synthesize complex N-glycans. Such revertants, which are C2 toxin-sensitive, appeared after several weeks of culture. Since both 15B and RK14 cells were resistant to C2 toxin, we next investigated whether they belong to the same (Lec1) complementation group. A phenotypic characterization of 15B and RK14 cells revealed that both exhibit nearly identical sensitivity against the lectins ricin, LCA, and concanavalin A (TableIII). A complementation assay using polysialic acid as a marker for expression of complexN-linked carbohydrates (30.Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) showed that RK14 belongs to the 15B/Lec1 complementation group (Fig. 4). While fusions between RK14 and 15B, both of which are negative for polysialic acid, did not correct the phenotype, control fusions with the mutant Lec8 led to reexpression of the marker polysialic acid. Thus, RK14 and 15B cells most probably have a defect in the same gene. This conclusion was confirmed by expressing a cDNA encoding hamster GlcNAc-TI in RK14 cells. RK14 cells stably transfected with pGnT1, encoding hamster GlcNAc-TI, were as sensitive to C2 toxin as CHO wild-type cells (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results prove that C2 toxin resistance of RK14 cells is a result of GlcNAc-TI deficiency and not of an unrelated genetic defect. The hypothesis of a genetic defect in the GlcNAc-TI gene was confirmed by PCR cloning of the GlcNAc-TI gene from RK14 cells. Sequencing of the PCR product revealed a nonsense mutation (G → A) at nucleotide position 287 resulting in a stop codon instead of Trp-96 (Fig.6 a). To exclude PCR errors, two independent clones were sequenced. We also sequenced the GlcNAc-TI gene from 15B cells and found a missense mutation (A730G), which changes Asn-244 to Ser-244 (Fig. 6 b). Notably, Asn-244 is conserved among all GlcNAc-TI genes cloned to date, including that ofC. elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana.Table IIILectin sensitivity of RK14, CHO-15B, and Lec8 cellsLectinBinds toRK14CHO-15BLec8Ricin B chainGalβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-RR= 32R = 64R = 2LCABi- and triantennary complex N-glycans containing a core fucoseR > 8R > 16S = 4Concanavalin AHigh mannose/hybridN-glycansS = 3S = 4Not doneCells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 103 per well in the presence of increasing concentrations of the lectins indicated.

The next step in N-glycan processing following the condensation of GlcNAc by GlcNAc-TI is the removal of the two terminal mannose residues by α-mannosidase II. To further characterize the carbohydrate structure necessary for C2 toxin uptake, CHO cells were treated with the α-mannosidase II inhibitor swainsonine. Pretreatment with 10 μm swainsonine for 48 h resulted in a weak protection (4-fold increase in resistance) of CHO wild-type cells against C2 toxin (Table II and Fig.7, a–d). The effect was much stronger in Lec8 cells, where pretreatment with swainsonine resulted in an approximately 16-fold decrease in sensitivity (Table II and Fig. 7,e–h). While treatment of Lec8 cells with 100 ng/ml C2II and 200 ng/ml C2I for 4 h caused rounding up of more than 80%, pretreatment with swainsonine did not result in a significant increase in the number of rounded cells, and there was apparently no breakdown of F-actin filaments (Fig. 7 h). In contrast, swainsonine treatment of Lec13 cells affected toxin sensitivity only slightly (Table II). In fact, swainsonine-treated Lec8, Lec13, and wild-type cells were found to be similarly sensitive to C2 toxin. Increasing the toxin concentration (or longer incubations; data not shown) resulted in strong morphological changes, indicating that swainsonine-treated cells are still C2 toxin-sensitive (Fig. 7 j). RK14 cells have been isolated from mutagenized CHO cells by selection for C2 toxin resistance and were found to be deficient in a functional receptor for this toxin (14.Fritz G. Schroeder P. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2334-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that the inability of RK14 cells to bind C2II is the result of a mutation in the GlcNAc-TI gene, which prevents the cells from producingN-linked complex and hybrid carbohydrates. Correcting this defect by transfecting a cDNA encoding an active GlcNAc-TI made the cells C2-sensitive again. Furthermore, independent mutants of the same complementation group (15B, ldlD.Lec1) are also C2-resistant. Thus, the possibility can be excluded that a secondary genetic defect is responsible for C2 resistance in RK14 cells, showing that binding of C2II depends on the presence of N-linked complex or hybrid carbohydrates. Since synthesis of glycolipids is unaffected in GlcNAc-TI-deficient cells, our results also indicate that glycolipids do not serve as receptors for C2 toxin. Treatment of CHO cells with the α-mannosidase II inhibitor swainsonine reduced the toxin sensitivity but did not abolish toxin binding completely. The only difference in the N-glycan structures of RK14 or 15B cells and swainsonine-treated Lec8 cells is the absence of the β1,2-linked GlcNAc to the α-1,3-linked mannose of the core structure (Fig.8) in the former cell lines (note that CHO cells did not express the bisecting enzymeN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III) (31.Campbell C.

Our results therefore provide strong evidence that this GlcNAc residue is an essential determinant of the C2 toxin receptor. Partial inhibition of the cytotoxic effect by swainsonine suggests that complex carbohydrates are more efficient in C2II binding than hybrid structures. Alternatively, the two terminal mannose residues of the GlcNAc1-Man5-GlcNAc2 hybrid structure might interfere with toxin binding. However, the observation that Lec8 and Lec2 cells are highly C2-sensitive clearly demonstrate that galactose and sialic acid are not required for toxin binding. In contrast, the higher sensitivity to C2 toxin of Lec2 and Lec8 cells suggests that sialic acid partially blocks the interaction of the toxin with its receptor. Masking of cell surface receptor structures by sialic acid is not uncommon due to their exposed position and negative charge (32.Traving C. Schauer R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1330-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In line with our results, Sugii and Kozaki (25.Sugii S. Kozaki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1034: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) showed that hemagglutination by C2II is not inhibited by sialic acid and that neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes are more sensitive to the hemolytic activity of C2II. Fucose-lacking Lec13 cells are slightly less sensitive to C2 toxin. One possible explanation is that fucose is part of the receptor structure. Alternatively, the fucose deficiency of Lec13 cells might reduce the cell surface expression level of the receptor. At present, it is not possible to decide between these possibilities. However, a direct involvement of fucose in toxin binding would be in agreement with observations by Sugii and Kozaki (25.Sugii S. Kozaki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1034: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) showing that hemagglutination by C2II can be inhibited by GlcNAc, mannose, and fucose. In this context, it is noteworthy that the sensitivity of CHO glycosylation mutants to C2 toxin is similar to their sensitivity to LCA, which specifically binds to α-1,6-fucosylated complex bi- and triantennaryN-glycan core structures (33.Cummings R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 66-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Lec1 cells are highly resistant to LCA and Lec2, and Lec8 cells are more sensitive than wild-type cells (Ref. 34.Stanley P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 525-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar; see also Table III). Furthermore, Lec13 cells are more resistant to LCA than CHO wild-type cells (34.Stanley P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 525-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). C2II exhibits significant sequence homology to the binding components of other actin ADP-ribosylating toxins, namely C. difficileCD196 toxin (11.Perelle S. Gibert M. Bourlioux P. Corthier G. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), C. perfringens iota toxin (35.Perelle S. Gibert M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5147-5156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), andC. spiroforme toxin (9.Popoff M.R. Boquet P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, sequence comparison showed that anthrax protective antigen is structurally related to C2II. Considering the fact that anthrax toxin protective antigen binds its receptor via the C terminus (36.Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Quinn C.P. Chaudhary V.K. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15493-15497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to assume that the other toxins mentioned above recognize their receptors also by their C termini. Interestingly, sequence similarity between C2II and the other toxins is completely absent from the C terminus. Thus, it seems very likely that the C2-related toxins have different structural requirements for binding. At least this holds true for iota toxin, which is able to enter C2 toxin-resistant RK14 cells (14.Fritz G. Schroeder P. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2334-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At present, it remains unclear whether GlcNAc-ylatedN-glycans are sufficient for C2II binding or whether C2II binding requires also the presence of a specific receptor protein. A C2-specific receptor has to be ubiquitously expressed, because no naturally C2 toxin-resistant cell line has been found, and even erythrocytes from different species are agglutinated by C2II (25.Sugii S. Kozaki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1034: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). C2 toxin-resistant CHO mutants expressing complex carbohydrates have not been found in the screen reported by Fritz et al. (14.Fritz G. Schroeder P. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2334-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which might be due to the very high frequency of GlcNAc-TI-deficient CHO mutants obtained after chemical mutagenesis (34.Stanley P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 525-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2023282529,"Replication licensing factor (RLF) is a multiprotein complex involved in ensuring that chromosomal DNA replicates only once in a single cell cycle. It comprises two components, termed RLF-M and RLF-B. Purified RLF-M consists of a mixture of complexes containing all six members of the MCM/P1 family of minichromosome maintenance proteins. The precise composition of these different complexes and their contribution to RLF-M activity has been unclear. Here we show that in Xenopus extracts, MCM/P1 proteins mainly form heterohexamers containing each of the six proteins. This heterohexamer is readily split into subcomplexes, whose interactions and subunit composition we characterize in detail. We show for the first time an ordered multistep assembly pathway by which the heterohexamer can be reformed from the subcomplexes. Importantly, this novel pathway is essential for DNA replication, since only the full heterohexamer can bind productively to chromatin and provide RLF-M activity."
https://openalex.org/W2159829592,"The yeast Cdc14 phosphatase has been shown to play an important role in cell cycle regulation by dephosphorylating proteins phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28/clb. We recently cloned two human orthologs of the yeastCDC14, termed hCDC14A and -B, the gene products of which share ∼80% amino acid sequence identity within their N termini and phosphatase domains. Here we report that the hCdc14A and hCdc14B proteins interact with the tumor suppressor protein p53 both in vitro and in vivo. This interaction is dependent on the N termini of the hCdc14 proteins and the C terminus of p53. Furthermore, the hCdc14 phosphatases were found to dephosphorylate p53 specifically at the p34Cdc2/clb phosphorylation site (p53-phosphor-Ser315). Our findings that hCdc14 is a cyclin-dependent kinase substrate phosphatase suggest that it may play a role in cell cycle control in human cells. Furthermore, the identification of p53 as a substrate for hCdc14 indicates that hCdc14 may regulate the function of p53. The yeast Cdc14 phosphatase has been shown to play an important role in cell cycle regulation by dephosphorylating proteins phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28/clb.

Furthermore, the identification of p53 as a substrate for hCdc14 indicates that hCdc14 may regulate the function of p53. open reading frame polymerase chain reaction glutathioneS-transferase 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis green fluorescent protein Cdc14 is a protein phosphatase conserved from yeast to man (1.Li L.

Genetic analyses suggest that the yeast Cdc14 plays pleiotropic roles during the cell cycle, including the regulation of DNA replication and the exit from mitosis (2.Hardy C.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1832-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3.Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Tinker-Kulberg R.L. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2803-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that Cdc14 can, in at least two ways, antagonize the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28/clb, which is the master regulator of the cell cycle in yeast (5.Mendenhall M.D. Hodge A.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1191-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Firstly, Cdc14 dephosphorylates the substrates phosphorylated by Cdc28/clb (4.Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Secondly, Cdc14 dephosphorylates the transcription factor Swi5, resulting in the nuclear accumulation of Swi5 and the transactivation of the Cdc28/clb inhibitor Sic1 (6.Toyn J.H. Johnson A.L. Donovan J.D. Toone W.M. Johnston L.H. Genetics. 1997; 145: 85-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Cdc14 is itself regulated by compartmentalization in the nucleus. During the G1, S, G2, and early mitosis Cdc14 is anchored in the nucleolus and redistributed throughout the nucleus at the beginning of anaphase (7.Visintin R. Hwang E.S. Amon A. Nature. 1999; 398: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 8.Shou W. Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Baskerville C. Moazed D. Chen Z.W. Jang J. Shevchenko A. Charbonneau H. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1999; 97: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has cloned two human orthologs of the yeastCDC14, termed hCDC14A and hCDC14B, the gene products of which share ∼80% amino acid sequence identity within their N termini and phosphatase domains (1.Li L. Ernsting B.R. Wishart M.J. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29403-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Both hCdc14A and hCdc14B were found to be localized to the nucleus when overexpressed in mammalian cells. Using the yeast strain harboring a temperature-sensitive mutation in theCDC14 gene, we showed that introduction of either of the two human CDC14 genes could suppress the phenotype of the yeastcdc14 temperature-sensitive mutant. This finding suggests that the hCdc14s may perform functions in human cells similar to those performed by the Cdc14 in yeast. Analogous to the inactivation of the yeast Cdc28/clb by Swi5-induced Sic1, the human p34Cdc2/clb kinase can in part be inactivated by the p53-regulated Cdk inhibitor p21WAF1 (9.Dulic V. Kaufman W.K.

Interestingly, p53 can be phosphorylated by human p34Cdc2/clb at serine 315 (10.Wang Y. Prives C. Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), parallel to the fact that Swi5 is phosphorylated by the yeast Cdc28/clb kinase (11.Moll T. Tebb G. Surana U. Robitsch H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 66: 743-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Because the yeast Cdc14 can dephosphorylate Swi5, we wanted to explore whether the hCdc14A and hCdc14B may dephosphorylate p53. In this study, we report that the two hCdc14 phosphatases physically interact with the p53 protein both in vitro and in vivo. Such interaction involves the highly conserved N termini of the hCdc14 proteins and the C terminus of p53. Furthermore, both hCdc14 forms could specifically dephosphorylate the p34Cdc2/clb phosphorylation site of p53 (Ser315). We propose that hCdc14 phosphatases may, together with p34Cdc2, regulate p53 function by controlling the phosphorylation status of Ser315 of p53. TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae EGY48 strain was obtained fromCLONTECH and cultured according to the manufacturer's suggested condition (CLONTECH). To generate the pLexA-hCdc14B plasmid, the hCdc14B open reading frame (ORF)1 was cloned in-frame into the BamHI/XhoI restriction sites of the pLexA vector (CLONTECH). The pLexA-PTP3 plasmid was constructed by ligating the PCR product of the S. cerevisiaephosphatase PTP3 ORF in-frame into the EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites of the pLexA vector. The pB42AD-p53 plasmid was constructed by ligating the PCR product of the human p53 ORF in-frame into the EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites of the pB42AD vector (CLONTECH). The construction of the green fluorescent protein fusion plasmids pEGFP-hCdc14A, pEGFP-hCdc14As, and pEGFP-hCdc14B, as well as the plasmids pT7H-Cdc14A, pT7H-Cdc14B, pET-Cdc14A, and pET-Cdc14B were accomplished as described previously (1.Li L. Ernsting B.R. Wishart M.J. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29403-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To make the pET-Cdc14A1–158 and pET-Cdc14A120–580 plasmids, the hCdc14A coding sequences from nucleotide 1 to 474 and 360 to 1740, respectively, were PCR-amplified and ligated in-frame into theNdeI/XhoI restriction sites of the pET23a vector (Novagen). The plasmids pET-Cdc14B1–230 and pET-Cdc14B150–459 were constructed by PCR amplifying the coding sequence of hCdc14B from nucleotide 1 to 690 and 450 to 1377, respectively, followed by ligation in-frame into theNdeI/XhoI restriction sites of the pET23a vector. The GST-p53 fusion plasmid pGST-p53 was constructed by cloning human p53 ORF in-frame into the EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites of the pGEX-5X-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To make pGST-p531–210, pGST-p53100–296, and pGST-p53250–393, the coding sequence of human p53 from nucleotides 1 to 630, 300 to 788, and 750 to 1179, respectively, were PCR-amplified and ligated in-frame into theEcoRI/XhoI restriction sites of the pGEX-5X-1 vector. All constructs were sequenced using automated sequencing (University of Michigan Sequencing Core Facility). To synthesize 35S-labeled hCdc14 proteins, an in vitro transcription/translation system from Promega was used. Recombinant His6-tagged hCdc14 and GST-p53 proteins were prepared from Escherichia coli as described previously (1.Li L. Ernsting B.R. Wishart M.J. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29403-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,12.Gottlin E.B. Xu X. Epstein D.M. Burke S.P. Eckstein J.W. Ballou D.P. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27445-27449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The yeast strain EGY48 was transformed with the bait plasmids pLexA, pLexA-hCdc14B, or pLexA-PTP3 as described previously (1.Li L. Ernsting B.R. Wishart M.J. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29403-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Transformants carrying the bait plasmids were selected on SD −Ura, −His plates. EGY48 cells carrying bait plasmids were then transformed with the prey plasmids pB42AD or pB42AD-p53, and the transformants were selected on SD −Ura, −His, −Trp plates. Any interactions between the expressed protein products from the bait and prey constructs result in the activation of the reporter genesLEU and lacZ enabling the yeast cells to grow on SD −Ura, −His, −Trp, −Leu (SD-UHWL) plates. X-gal was included in the growth agar in order for the colonies expressing lacZ to turn blue. The Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human cell line 293 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with the plasmids pEGFP-hCdc14A, pEGFP-hCdc14As, or pEGFP-hCdc14B using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in a phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, proteinase inhibitor mix (BMB). Endogenous p53 was immunoprecipitated using polyclonal anti-p53 antibody (BMB). The immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer five times and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The gel was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with anti-EGFP monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) to analyze whether any EGFP-hCdc14 fusion proteins may co-immunoprecipitate with p53. In vitro translated and35S-labeled hCdc14 proteins were incubated with glutathione-agarose-immobilized GST-p53 fusion proteins at 4 °C for 2 h in PBST (4 mm NaH2PO4, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mmNaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After washing the agarose beads six times with the above buffer, SDS sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The gel was treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray film. Purified recombinant GST-p53 fusion proteins were phosphorylated in vitro by either p34Cdc2/cyclin B kinase or CKII according to the conditions provided by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). The phosphorylated GST-p53 fusion proteins (300 ng) in 50 μl of glutathione-agarose beads were mixed with 1 μg of recombinant hCdc14A, hCdc14B, PTEN, YG4E, or bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C for 30 min. GST-p53 protein-agarose beads were then precipitated by centrifugation. The relative amounts of 32P released into the supernatant as well as the 32P bound to p53 were quantitated by scintillation counting. To study whether the hCdc14 proteins could interact with the p53 protein, we used the yeast two-hybrid assay. After co-transformation of pLexA-hCdc14B and pB42AD-p53 plasmid into the S. cerevisiaeEGY48 strain, the LEU reporter gene within the EGY48 strain was activated and enabled the yeast cell to grow on selective media (see “Materials and Methods” for details). The colonies turned blue as a result of lacZ gene activation (Fig.1 A). Yeast cells transformed with either pLexA-hCdc14B or pB42AD-p53 alone could not grow on the selective medium. Co-transformation with another unrelated phosphatase, yeast PTP3 in the pLexA vector (pLexA-PTP3), along with pB42AD-p53 did not result in the activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 1 A). These results indicate that the hCdc14B protein can physically interact with p53. To determine whether hCdc14A and hCdc14B interact with p53 in mammalian cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using extracts from 293 cells transfected with either the EGFP-Cdc14A or EGFP-Cdc14B fusion construct (pEGFP-Cdc14A and pEGFP-Cdc14B). Immunoprecipitation of p53 was performed 48 h after transfection using anti-p53 antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-EGFP antibodies. As shown in lane 1 of Fig. 1 B, a band corresponding in size to the EGFP-hCdc14A fusion protein (93 kDa) was detected on the blot, suggesting that EGFP-hCdc14A and p53 proteins co-existed in the immunocomplex. Lane 3 shows a band corresponding in size to the EGFP-hCdc14B fusion protein (82 kDa), suggesting that the hCdc14B protein also formed immunocomplexes with the p53 protein. Interestingly, p53 could also form immunocomplexes with EGFP-hCdc14As, which lacks the C-terminal domain (truncated from amino acid 365). This result suggests that hCdc14s interact with p53 via their highly conserved N-terminal domain. To ensure that the interaction between the hCdc14 phosphatases and p53 was specific and unique, the 293 cells were transfected with either the EGFP vector alone or with another EGFP fusion construct coding for a putative dual specific protein phosphatase PTEN (pEGFP-PTEN). In these experiments, we could not detect any co-immunoprecipitation of either PTEN or EGFP with the anti-p53 antibody (expected size of 75 and 27 kDa, respectively) (lanes 4 and 5). Western blot with whole cell lysates indicated that all EGFP fusion proteins were expressed at similar levels (data not shown). Taken together, the results obtained with both the yeast two-hybrid system and with the immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the hCdc14A and hCdc14B phosphatases can physically interact with p53. To further confirm that the N terminus of hCdc14 interacts with p53, we performed binding assays using full-length recombinant GST-p53 proteins and various truncation mutants of hCdc14A and -B that had been synthesized by an in vitro translation procedure. Both hCdc14A1–158 and hCdc14B1–230 bound to GST-p53, whereas neither hCdc14A120–580 nor hCdc14B150–459 did (Fig.2, A and B). As a control, we demonstrated that neither of these in vitrotranslated hCdc14 proteins interacted with the GST protein (data not shown). We next performed in vitro binding assays to determine what domain of the p53 protein is involved in the interaction.35S-Labeled hCdc14A and hCdc14B proteins, synthesized from pET-Cdc14A or pET-Cdc14B by in vitro translation, were incubated with recombinant proteins of GST fused to various domains of the p53 protein as indicated in Fig. 2 C. As shown in Fig. 2,D and E, the full-length GST-p53 protein as well as the GST-p53250–393 bound well to hCdc14A and hCdc14B, retaining ∼20% of the input radiolabeled hCdc14s. In contrast, except for the p53 N terminus (GST-p531–210), which bound less than 2% of the input hCdc14B, GST-p531–210, GST-p53100–296, or GST could not bind tightly with hCdc14A or hCdc14B. Taken together, these results show that the N terminus of Cdc14 and the C terminus of p53 are required for the interaction. It has been shown that the C terminus of p53 undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites (reviewed in Ref. 13.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). p34Cdc2/clb kinase can specifically phosphorylate p53 Ser315 in vitro as well as in vivo (10.Wang Y. Prives C. Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 14.Bischoff J.R. Friedman P.N. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 4766-4770Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) whereas casein kinase II can specifically phosphorylate Ser392 of human p53 (15.Meek D.W. Simon S. Kikkawa U. Eckhart W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3253-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,16.Herrmann C.P. Kraiss S. Montenarh M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 877-884PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the phosphorylation status of p53 can interfere with its binding with hCdc14, GST-p53 proteins were specifically labeled on Ser315 or Ser392 using P34Cdc2/clb kinase or CKII kinase, respectively. We found that GST-p53 with the Ser315 to Ala mutation abolished the radioactive labeling by p34Cdc2/clb, suggesting the specific labeling of the Ser315 site by p34Cdc2/clb (data not shown). Ser315- or Ser392-phosphorylated GST-p53 proteins bound equally well as unphosphorylated GST-p53 to the in vitro translated hCdc14A or hCdc14B protein (data not shown). hCdc14 has been shown to act as a dual specificity protein phosphatase (1.Li L. Ernsting B.R. Wishart M.J. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29403-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Because hCdc14A and hCdc14B were found to physically interact with the C terminus of p53, we next examined whether hCdc14 proteins dephosphorylate the C-terminal phosphorylation site(s) of p53. Recombinant hCdc14A and hCdc14B with C-terminal His6 tag were purified from E. coliand incubated with GST-p53 phosphorylated at either Ser315or Ser392. Both hCdc14A and hCdc14B were able to dephosphorylate p53 phosphorylated at Ser315. About 30–50% of the total label incorporated at Ser315 was removed by hCdc14A or hCdc14B within 30 min of incubation (Fig.3). In contrast, neither hCdc14A nor hCdc14B had any phosphatase activity toward p53 phosphorylated at Ser392 (Fig. 3). As expected, the inactive mutant (hCdc14BCS) protein with its catalytic cysteine mutated to serine does not show any phosphatase activity against either site of p53. Two other unrelated phosphatases (PTEN and YG4E proteins) were used in the assay as controls. Like hCdc14, PTEN is a putative dual specific protein phosphatase with low activity against the artificial substratesp-nitrophenyl phosphate and 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (1.Li L. Ernsting B.R. Wishart M.J. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29403-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). YG4E is an active protein phosphatase that exhibits strong activity against the substrates p-nitrophenyl phosphate and 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (data not shown). We found that neither PTEN nor YG4E could dephosphorylate GST-p53 phosphorylated at Ser315 or Ser392(Fig. 3). The yeast Cdc14 protein phosphatase plays important roles in the regulation of the cell cycle. As shown in the Fig.4 A, the yeast Cdc14 dephosphorylates several Cdc28/Clb substrates such as Hct1, Sic1, and Swi5. Cdc14-mediated dephosphorylation of Hct1 results in degradation of cyclin B (17.Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Morgan D.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), whereas dephosphorylation of the Cdc28/clb kinase inhibitor Sic1 results in Cdc28/clb accumulation (18.Verma R. Feldman R.M. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cdc14-mediated dephosphorylation of the transcription factor Swi5 allows its nuclear translocation and subsequent transactivation of Sic1 (19.Jans D.A. Moll T. Nasmyth K. Jans P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17064-17067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Taken together, the yeast Cdc14 appears to reverse the effects of Cdc28/clb by directly dephosphorylating proteins phosphorylated by Cdc28/clb (4.Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar,17.Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Morgan D.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We recently cloned the human Cdc14 orthologs, hCDC4A and hCdc14B (1.Li L. Ernsting B.R. Wishart M.J. Lohse D.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29403-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that hCdc14A and hCdc14B physically interact with the human tumor suppressor protein p53 both in vitroand in vivo. Such interaction specifically involves the highly conserved N termini of the hCdc14 proteins and the C terminus of the p53 protein. Furthermore, we showed that recombinant hCdc14A and hCdc14B specifically dephosphorylate p53 at Ser315, a site that has been shown to be phosphorylated by p34Cdc2/clb (10.Wang Y. Prives C. Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). No hCdc14 phosphatase activity was detected against p53 phosphorylated at the Ser392 site, which can be phosphorylated by casein kinase II (13.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). Other phosphatases tested, such as PTEN or YG4E, show no in vitro activity toward p53 phosphorylated at either Ser315 or Ser392. Our results that hCdc14s specifically dephosphorylate the p34Cdc2/clb phosphorylation site of p53 suggest that hCdc14 phosphatases may function analogously to the yeast Cdc14 by dephosphorylating substrate(s) of p34Cdc2/clb kinase. p53 is a well studied tumor suppressor protein that plays important roles in the cellular response to DNA-damaging agents and other cellular stresses. p53 is normally present in low amounts in normal cells but accumulates in the cell nucleus in response to various cellular stresses (13.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). The nuclear accumulation of p53 leads to the transactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1, causing cell cycle arrest at G1/S as well at the G2/M phase (20.O'Connor P.M. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 151-182PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to their roles in G1 cell cycle arrest, p53 and p21WAF1 has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of the mitotic exit check point in mammalian cells (21.Cross S.M. Sanchez C.A. Morgan C.A. Schimke M.K. Ramel S. Idzerda R.L. Raskind W.H. Reid B.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Loss or inactivation of p53 or p21WAF1 is associated with tetraploidy or aneuploidy due to the failure of cytokinesis (22.Chang T.H. Ray F.A. Thompson D.A. Schlegel R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2383-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23.Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar, 24.Barboule N. Chadebech P. Baldin V. Vidal S. Valette A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p53 appears to stimulate the exit of mitosis following a transient G2/M cell cycle arrest induced by various DNA-damaging agents in many cell types (25.Guiilouf C. Roselli F. Kirshnaraju K. Moustacchi E. Hoffman B. Lieberman D.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2263-2270PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the fact that yeast Cdc14 facilitates mitotic exit by dephosphorylating Cdc28/clb substrates and in turn deactivating Cdc28/clb activity, we speculate that hCdc14-dependent dephosphorylation of p53 (and other p34Cdc2 substrates) may stimulate exit from mitosis in mammalian cells (Fig.4 B). Human p53 has been shown to undergo numerous phosphorylations in vivo and in vitro. The phosphorylation status of p53 is determined by several kinases that target at least six different serines clustered in two domains on the protein (13.Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). Two phosphorylated serines within the C terminus domain, Ser315and Ser392, are phosphorylated by p34Cdc2/clb and casein kinase II, respectively (10.Wang Y. Prives C. Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 15.Meek D.W. Simon S. Kikkawa U. Eckhart W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3253-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). p53 phosphorylation at Ser392 can enhance p53 sequence-specific DNA bindingin vitro and is important for p53-mediated transcriptional activation in vivo (26.Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3167-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In addition, UV irradiation has been reported to increase the Ser392 phosphorylation (27.Kapoor M. Loranzo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2834-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,28.Lu H. Taya Y. Ikeda M. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6399-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Prolonged stability and/or activation of p53 by those phosphorylation events under stress conditions lead to G1/S or G2/M arrest. Several phosphatases including PP2A and PP5 have been inferred to inhibit p53 transcriptional activity by regulating the phosphorylation status of p53, although the targeting sites of these phosphatases are not known (29.Yan Y. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 15220-15226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 30.Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 12250-12258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (106) Google Scholar). So far, the effect of Ser315 phosphorylation is not clear. Earlier studies showed that Ser315 phosphorylation increases the sequence-specific DNA binding capacity of p53, suggesting that Ser315 phosphorylation is an activating modification (10.Wang Y. Prives C. Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). However, mutation of the Ser315 residue has been reported to prolong the half-life of the p53 protein, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser315 may target p53 for degradation (31.Lin W.C. Desiderio S. Science. 1993; 260: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Contrary to those reports, recent studies in which Ser315 and other phosphorylation sites had been mutated suggest no role for the Ser315 in regulating the stability or activity of p53 (32.Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 33.Hengstermann A. Whitaker N.J. Zimmer D. Zentgraf H. Scheffner M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because the Ser315 site of p53 is located adjacent to its nuclear localization signal, it is conceivable that Ser315 phosphorylation may regulate p53 localization. Experiments studying the p53 localization showed that mutating Ser315 into alanine, which mimics constitutively dephosphorylated serine, does not affect the ability of p53 to translocate into the nucleus (34.Liang S.H. Hong D. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19817-19821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be excluded from that study that phosphorylation of Ser315 may result in cytoplasmic retention of p53. In fact, the regulation of p53 nuclear export has been shown to be an important mechanism by which cells regulate p53 stability (35.Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 36.Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 37.Lain S. Midgley C. Sparks A. Lane E.B. Land D.P. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 248: 457-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because the previous studies addressing p53 Ser315 phosphorylation were done using transient overexpression of p53 in transformed cell lines, they may fail to detect the effect of p53 Ser315 phosphorylation in normal cells, where only a minute amount of p53 is present. Further studies are needed to clarify the function of p53 Ser315phosphorylation and its regulation by hCdc14 phosphatases. In summary, our results demonstrate that hCdc14 proteins can interact with p53 and specifically dephosphorylate the p34Cdc2/clb-mediated Ser315 phosphorylationin vitro. Such findings suggest that Cdc14 may be an evolutionary conserved cyclin-dependent kinase phosphatase. Because the yeast Cdc14 phosphatase dephosphorylates multiple Cdc28/clb substrates (3.Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Tinker-Kulberg R.L. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2803-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 4.Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), it is possible that one or both of the human Cdc14 proteins can dephosphorylate multiple substrates phosphorylated by Cdks in mammalian cells. The fact that there are several closely related human p53 homologues recently being discovered (p73 and p63ket) raises an intriguing possibility that different hCdc14 proteins might regulate different p53 homologues. Further study regarding the regulation of hCdc14s will provide valuable insight toward the understanding of mammalian cell cycle control and the regulation of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2035534587,"Previous studies have established that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are composed of independent folding domains. Based on this findings we attempted to rescue the function of clinically relevant missense mutations (R137H, S167L, and R181C) within the N-terminal domain of the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2-R), by coexpressing mutated full-length (Y280C) and C-terminally truncated (E242X) receptor constructs in COS-7 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies demonstrated a specific association of E242X with full-length V2-Rs even in the presence of missense mutations. Systematic analysis of the structural requirements for the observed receptor/fragment association showed that N-terminal fragments containing at least transmembrane regions 1–3 interact with the full-length V2-R. Despite this specific interaction, no functional reconstitution was achieved for mutant V2-Rs following coexpression with E242X and Y280C. However, functional activity of R137H and R181C upon coexpression with E242X was regained by mutational disruption of the extracellular disulfide bond, which is highly conserved among GPCRs. Our data with the V2-R are consistent with a structural model in which class I GPCRs form contact oligomers by lateral interaction rather than by a domain-swapping mechanism.

George S.R. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lynch K.R. O'Dowd B.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 370-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, mutational alteration of GPCR function is reflected in an ever growing number of diseases caused by mutations within GPCR genes. It has been demonstrated that single amino acid substitutions and receptor truncations are responsible for several hereditary and acquired diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, familial male precocious puberty, hyper- and hypothyroidism, or X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (2.Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Based on findings that GPCRs are composed of multiple folding units (3.Gudermann T. Schöneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), we recently demonstrated that functionally inactive V2 vasopressin receptors (V2-Rs) containing clinically relevant mutations in the C-terminal third of the receptor can be functionally rescued by coexpression with a C-terminal V2-R fragment (4.Schöneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 5.Schöneberg T. Sandig V. Wess J. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The application of this approach for gene therapy purposes appears promising because reconstitution of receptor function is predicted to occur only in cells where the mutant receptor is expressed endogenously, and, therefore, specific cell targeting is not required. The observed ability of the C-terminal V2-R fragment to interact with different mutant V2-Rs is consistent with several recent reports, suggesting that GPCRs can form dimers. In the last few years, a large body of evidence has evolved demonstrating the formation of homo and heterodimers in class I and III GPCRs (6.Monnot C. Bihoreau C. Conchon S. Curnow K.M. Corvol P.

As shown for epitope-tagged β2-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, the association is highly specific for a given receptor subtype giving rise only to homodimers (16.Hebert T.E. Moffett S.

In addition to investigations in transient expression systems, in situ studies with the dopamine D3 receptor and rhodopsin suggest the coexistence of receptor monomers and oligomeric complexes under physiological circumstances (18.Nimchinsky E.A. Hof P.R. Janssen W.G.M. Morrison J.H. Schmauss C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29229-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 19.Colley N.J. Cassill J.A. Baker E.K. Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3070-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Two structural models of dimer formation have been proposed (20.Gouldson P.R. Snell C.R. Bywater R.P. Higgs C. Reynolds C.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). One dimeric structure, referred to as the “contact dimer,” is based on the two-dimensional electron diffraction map of rhodopsin (21.Schertler G.F. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Two tightly packed bundles of seven transmembrane domains (TMDs) are positioned next to each other. The contact interface between the two monomeric receptors is assumed to be located between the lipid-orientated transmembrane receptor portions. The so-called “domain-swapped dimer” has been proposed to explain the reconstitution phenomenon observed with truncated (4.Schöneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22.Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23.Ridge K.D. Lee S.S. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and chimeric GPCRs (24.Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In this dimer structure, the two receptor molecules fold around a hydrophilic interface by exchanging their N-terminal (TMDs 1–5) and C-terminal (TMDs 6–7) folding domains. The domain-swapped dimer model is supported by reconstitution studies with two chimeric α2-adrenergic and m3 muscarinic receptors (24.Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Based on the domain-swapped dimer model and the functional data from reconstitution experiments, we hypothesized that receptors mutationally altered in the N-terminal folding domain (TMDs 1–5) can be rescued by coexpressing a nonmutated N-terminal receptor fragment. However, all attempts to restore function of mutant V2-Rs failed despite a noncovalent interaction between the two molecules as shown by ELISA and coimmunoprecipitation studies. When the extracellular disulfide bond known to be essential for GPCR function was disrupted by mutation, the function of mutant receptors was restored upon fragment coexpression. The results of our study favor a model in which GPCRs specifically associate by lateral interaction rather than by a domain-swapped mechanism. All V2-R mutations (see Fig. 1) were introduced into V2-R-pcDps (4.Schöneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), a mammalian expression vector containing the entire coding sequence of the human V2-R, using a polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis and restriction fragment replacement strategy (25.Higuchi R. Ehrlich H.A. PCR Technology. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar). For immunological detection of the various V2-R constructs, a stretch of nucleotides coding for a nine-amino acid epitope (YPYDVPDYA) (26.Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein (HA tag) was inserted after the initiating Met codon. The wild-type human cholecystokinin type A receptor (CCKA-R; a generous gift from Dr. S. A. Wank, NIH) was subcloned into pcDps. In addition to the wild-type V2-R (HA-V2-R), all missense-mutated V2-R constructs, the C-terminally truncated V2-Rs, the CCKA-R (HA-CCKA-R), and the rat m3 muscarinic receptor (HA-m3-R) (27.Schöneberg T. Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) were tagged with an N-terminal HA epitope. The identity of the various constructs and the correctness of all polymerase chain reaction-derived sequences were confirmed by restriction analysis and direct DNA sequencing according to standard methodology by using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). To monitor the transfection efficiency and for control purposes in ELISA studies, a mammalian expression plasmid (pEGFP-C1 vector,CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 7% CO2 incubator. For transient transfection of COS-7 cells, a calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (28.Hitt M. Bett A.J. Addison C.L. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Adolph K.W. Viral Gene Techniques. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 13-30Google Scholar) was applied. Thus, cells were split into 12-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) and transfected with a total amount of 5 μg of plasmid DNA/well. After 48 h cells were prelabeled with 2 μCi/ml of [3H]adenine (31.7 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and incubated overnight. For cAMP assay, transfected cells were washed once in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), followed by incubation in the presence of the indicated arginine vasopressin (AVP; Sigma) concentrations for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by aspiration of the medium and addition of 1 ml of 5% trichloric acid. The cAMP content of cell extracts was determined by anion exchange chromatography as described (29.Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). For radioligand binding studies, cells were harvested 72 h after transfection (20 μg of plasmid DNA/100-mm dish), and saturation binding assays were performed using membrane homogenates. Incubations were carried out for 1 h at 22 °C in a 0.25-ml volume with six different concentrations (1.25–100 nm) of [3H]AVP (64 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). Nonspecific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 10 μm AVP. Binding data were analyzed by a nonlinear curve-fitting procedure using the computer program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To estimate cell surface expression of receptors carrying an N-terminal HA-tag, we developed an indirect cellular ELISA (4.Schöneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), hereafter referred to as “surface ELISA.” Briefly, COS-7 cells were seeded into 48-well plates, transfected, fixed without disrupting the cell membrane, and incubated with a biotin-labeled anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Bound anti-HA antibody was detected with the help of a peroxidase-labeled streptavidin conjugate (Sigma). To further assess the amounts of full-length HA-tagged V2-Rs and to demonstrate the association of V2-R constructs, a previously developed “sandwich ELISA” was used (5.Schöneberg T. Sandig V. Wess J. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In brief, 3 days after transfection (12 μg of plasmid DNA/60-mm dish), COS-7 cells were harvested, and cell pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1% desoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and supernatants were used for ELISAs. Microtiter plates were coated with a polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 29 amino acids of the human V2-R (kindly provided by Dr. Paul Goldsmith, NIH; 5 μg/ml in PBS). After incubation at 4 °C for 16 h, plates were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS. Cell lysates were added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (PBS-T). The biotin-labeled monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5; 1 μg/ml PBS-T) was added, and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Plates were washed with PBS-T and incubated with an 1:5,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h at 37 °C. After removal of excess unbound conjugate, H2O2 ando-phenylenediamine (2.5 mm each in 0.1m phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.0) were added to serve as substrate and chromogen, respectively. After 15 min the enzyme reaction (carried out at room temperature) was stopped by the addition of 1m H2SO4 containing 0.05m Na2SO3, and color development was measured bichromatically at 492 and 620 nm using an ELISA reader (Titertek Multiskan MCC/340, Flow Laboratories, Inc. McLean, VA). To compare the expression levels of epitope-tagged receptor constructs including truncated V2-Rs, HA-CCKA-R, and HA-m3-R an indirect ELISA, referred to as “total ELISA,” was developed. Transfected COS-7 cells were harvested and lysed as described above (see sandwich ELISA). Lysates were prediluted 1:4 with PBS, and microtiter plates (MaxiSorp plate; Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 200 μl of receptor lysate/well. After incubation at 4 °C for 16 h, plates were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS. Plates were washed three times with PBS-T. Then the biotin-labeled monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5; 10 μg/ml PBS-T) was added, and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Bound anti-HA antibody was detected by using a peroxidase-labeled streptavidin conjugate as described above for the sandwich ELISA. COS-7 cells were transfected with various V2-R constructs (12 μg of plasmid DNA/60-mm dish) as described above. About 72 h later, cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with 150 μl of lysis buffer. After vigorous vortexing, followed by removal of cell debris by centrifugation, 150 μl of PBS-T and 20 μg/ml of the anti-V2-R antibody were added to the supernatants containing solubilized receptor protein. Following incubation of samples at 4 °C for 2 h at constant rotation, 60 μl of 10% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were added, and samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were pelleted (12,000 × g for 3 min) and washed twice with 1 ml of washing buffer A (600 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40) and twice with 1 ml of washing buffer B (300 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Pellets were boiled with 40 μl of SDS sample buffer, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) was performed. After electrotransfer the nitrocellulose filter was probed with a biotin-labeled anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5, 1 μg/ml in PBS/0.1% Tween 20). The peroxidase-labeled streptavidin conjugate (1:5,000 in PBS/0.1% Tween 20) and the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to detect the bound anti-HA antibody. We have recently shown that mutant V2-Rs harboring missense or nonsense mutations within the last third (TMDs 6–7) of the receptor molecule can be functionally rescued by supplying a receptor fragment spanning the mutated receptor portion (4.Schöneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The targeted expression of specific receptor polypeptides may lead to novel strategies in the treatment of diseases caused by inactivating GPCR mutations (5.Schöneberg T. Sandig V. Wess J. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because of the “subunit character” of GPCRs, we hypothesized that the function of receptors carrying inactivating mutations within TMDs 1–5 can also be restored by coexpression with N-terminal receptor fragments. In initial experiments, clinically relevant mutant V2-Rs (HA-R137H, HA-S167L) were expressed alone and with a fragment (HA-E242X) truncated within the third intracellular loop (Fig. 1). In accord with the fact that both missense mutations were found in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, AVP administration resulted only in minor increases in intracellular cAMP levels (about 2-fold) as compared with the wild-type HA-V2-R (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, coexpression with HA-E242X did not significantly increase the signaling efficacy of the two mutant V2-Rs. Similar negative results were obtained by coexpression of HA-R137H with a full-length V2-R containing an inactivating mutation (HA-Y280C) in TMD 6 (data not shown). Radioligand binding and ELISA studies that were performed in parallel revealed a dramatic reduction in cell surface expression levels of HA-R137H and HA-S167L (<15% of HA-V2-R) but comparable whole cell expression levels (TableI). Control coexpression experiments with the complementary N- and C-terminal folding domains (HA-E242X + E242tail) showed the expected reconstitution of receptor function (Fig.2 A) (4.Schöneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We speculated that intracellular retention of the mutant receptors may somehow interfere with functional receptor reconstitution. Therefore, an additional nephrogenic diabetes insipidus-causing missense mutation (R181C) was chosen that is characterized by proper plasma membrane expression but a right-shifted concentration-response curve (Tables I andII and Fig. 2 B). However, coexpression of HA-R181C with HA-E242X or HA-Y280C resulted neither in a significant increase in specific AVP-binding sites (data not shown) nor in a shift of the concentration-response curve to lower AVP concentrations comparable with those found with the HA-V2-R or HA-V2-R plus HA-E242X (Fig. 2 B and Table II).Table IRadioligand binding and ELISA studies for determination of expression levels of mutant V2 vasopressin receptorsTransfected construct[3H]AVP bindingOD492nmB maxK dSurface ELISASandwich ELISAreceptors/cellnm% HA-V2-RHA-V2-R1.1 ± 0.4 × 1051.4 ± 0.5100100HA-C112A—a—, no saturable AVP-binding sites.—43.1 ± 3.2108 ± 3HA-R137H0.18 × 105—12.8 ± 1.5144 ± 49HA-S167L——3.7 ± 0.384 ± 2HA-R181C——130 ± 2299 ± 18HA-C192A——43.7 ± 10136 ± 3HA-C112A/R181C——61.4 ± 2.4121 ± 5HA-R137H/C192A——13 ± 156 ± 5HA-W71X——9.5 ± 30b0, not distinguishable from background.HA-R113X——12.4 ± 3.60HA-E242X——12.1 ± 3.50HA-R337X——10.7 ± 3.10HA-C112A/E242X—14.6 ± 10HA-C192A/E242X——10.8 ± 0.70V2-RNDcND, not determined.ND00R137HND—00R181CND—00For radioligand binding assays COS-7 cells were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA/10-cm dish using a calcium phosphate method, and cells were harvested 3 days after transfection.

Direct interaction between the mutant full-length receptor and the supplied receptor fragment is a necessary prerequisite for functional reconstitution. Because the function of mutant V2-Rs was not restored after coexpression of HA-E242X, sandwich ELISA and immunoprecipitation studies were performed to demonstrate a direct interaction of N-terminal receptor fragments with the full-length V2-R. To quantify the association of HA-E242X with nontagged full-length V2-Rs, a sandwich ELISA was used (5.Schöneberg T. Sandig V. Wess J. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because nontagged V2-Rs contained only the C-terminal epitope and all truncated receptors the N-terminal HA epitope but not the C-terminal epitope, a positive signal in the sandwich ELISA can only be achieved if both proteins form a complex. Lysates from COS-7 cells cotransfected with the full-length HA-V2-R and V2-R (known to form dimers (16.Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

To control the specificity of this interaction, HA-m3-R and HA-CCKA-R were coexpressed with nontagged V2-R. OD readings less than 25% of the positive control were observed highlighting the specificity of V2-R oligomerization. First, nontagged versions of R137H and R181C were coexpressed with HA-E242X. As shown in Table III, both mutant V2-Rs (R137H and R181C) showed a significant association with HA-E242X, indicating that a missing interaction between the mutant full-length receptors and the supplied fragment was not responsible for the lack of functional reconstitution. Interestingly, R181C displayed a similar ability to interact with HA-E242X as compared with the wild-type V2-R. Transfection of R137H, R181C, V2-R, and HA-E242X alone gave no OD readings in the sandwich ELISA (Table I).Table IIIAssociation of C-terminally truncated V2 vasopressin receptors with the wild-type and mutant V2-Rs and N-terminally truncated V2-R fragmentsTransfected constructELISASandwichTotal% HA-V2-RHA-V2-R + V2-R100 (7)100 (3)HA-W71X + V2-R19.5 ± 5.5 (2)80.3 ± 19.3 (3)HA-R113X + V2-R19.0 ± 5 (2)71.0 ± 15.9 (3)HA-V206X + V2-R52.6 ± 10.5 (3)85.6 ± 1.8 (3)HA-E242X + V2-R88 ± 9.4 (4)113.7 ± 13.7 (3)HA-W284X + V2-R87.4 ± 13.7 (4)121.0 ± 14.0 (3)HA-W293X + V2-R88.6 ± 27.4 (4)124.3 ± 10.5 (3)HA-L312X + V2-R97.6 ± 8.4 (4)121.0 ± 11.3 (3)HA-R337X + V2-R118.9 ± 14.6 (7)145.0 ± 12.0 (3)HA-m3-R + V2-R20.6 ± 7.2 (5)96.7 ± 21.6 (3)HA-CCKA-R + V2-R25.2 ± 12.2 (4)125.7 ± 20.1 (3)HA-E242X + R137H46.1 ± 13.1 (2)HA-E242X + R181C81.5 ± 26.5 (2)HA-W71X + E242tail0 (1)aNot distinguishable from background.HA-R113X + E242tail0 (3)aNot distinguishable from background.HA-V206X + E242tail24.2 ± 15.2 (4)HA-E242X + E242tail73.2 ± 28.9 (5)HA-R337X + E242tail107.1 ± 59.4 (5)HA-R337X + L292tail0 (2)aNot distinguishable from background.For sandwich ELISAs, COS-7"

Activation of the IGF-IR induces tyrosine autophosphorylation and the binding of a series of adaptor molecules, thereby leading to the activation of MAPK. It has been demonstrated that pertussis toxin, which inactivates the Gi class of GTP-binding proteins, inhibits IGF-I-mediated activation of MAPK, and a specific role for Gβγ subunits in IGF-I signaling was shown. In the present study, we have investigated the role of heterotrimeric Gi in IGF-IR signaling in neuronal cells.

Similarly, in IGF-IR-null mouse embryo fibroblasts transfected with the human IGF-IR, Gi was complexed with the IGF-IR. Gαs was not associated with the IGF-IR in any cell type. IGF-I induced the release of the Gβ subunits from the IGF-IR but had no effect on the association of Gαi.

G-protein coupled receptor mitogen-activated protein kinase tyrosine kinase receptor insulin-like growth factor-I receptor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase insulin receptor substrate-1 Many receptors are coupled to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins). Prototypic G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 contain a seven-membrane spanning region (1.Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Activated GPCRs bind to G-proteins and induce the release of Gβγ subunits from Gα subunits, which allows for the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα subunit. Activated Gi subunits and Gβγ heterodimers interact with numerous signaling effectors, including adenylyl cyclase, ion channels, protein kinases, and phospholipases (2.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev.

In addition to their role in fully differentiated cells, GPCRs have been linked to mitogenesis and development (5.van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr.

A specific role for Gi in the induction of mitogenesis has been highlighted by the use of pertussis toxin, which inactivates Gi by ADP-ribosylation of the Gα subunit. However, Gα subunits from several classes of G-proteins are not strongly mitogenic. Rather Gβγ heterodimer subunits activate a series of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, which in turn activates p21 ras and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (or MAPK). Thus, Gβγ subunits serve to bridge intracellular signaling of classical GPCRs and mitogenic tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs). Gi also appears to be involved in the mitogenic actions of RTKs. Pertussis toxin variably inhibits the metabolic actions of insulin, both in vitro and in vivo (9.Goren H.J. Northup J.K. Hollenberg M.D. Can. J. Physiol.

(31.Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16495-16498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) demonstrated that MAPK activation by IGF-I was also inhibited by Gβγ subunit binding proteins. Inhibitory effects of pertussis toxin have been observed for other IGF-I-dependent cellular effects (32.Poiraudeau S. Lieberherr M. Kergosie N. Corvol M.T. J. Cell.

Because IGF-I exerts profound proliferative and survival effects on many cell types, including neuronal cells, we have investigated the role of Gi in IGF-I signaling in neuronal cells. We report the specific association of Gi with the IGF-IR and inhibition of MAPK activation by pertussis toxin. Importantly, IGF-I stimulation induces the release of Gβγ subunits from the IGF-IR. The findings offer a model wherein Giheterotrimers are constitutively associated with the IGF-IR and identify a discrete pool of Gβγ subunits available for IGF-IR signaling. Antibodies against Gαi, Gαs, Gβ, IGF-IR β domain, and anti-phosphotyrosine (py99) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-MAPK and anti-phospho-MAPK (E10) antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and horse anti-mouse IgG antibodies and signal-enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Pertussis toxin was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Human recombinant IGF-I was obtained from Bachem Bioscience, Inc., (King of Prussia, PA). All other chemical and biochemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Balb/c3T3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Mouse embryo fibroblasts with targeted knockout of the IGF-IR (R− cells) and R− cells that express human IGF-IR (R+) cells were a gift from Dr. R. Baserga (Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University). The generation and characterization of R− and R+ cells have been described elsewhere (40.Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P.

Fibroblasts were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% normal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. NG-108 neuroblastoma cells, a gift from Dr. I. Diamond, University of California, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 6% (v/v/) fetal calf serum and supplemented with 1 μm aminopterin, 100 μmhypoxanthine, and 16 μm thymidine. Fibroblasts and NG-108 cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 18 h prior to addition of IGF-I. Where indicated, cells were treated with pertussis toxin for 4 h prior to the addition of IGF-I. Rat cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from 7-day-old rat pups as reported previously (42.Zhang F.X. Rubin R. Rooney T.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 43.Zhang F.X. Rubin R. Rooney T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26596-26602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebella were obtained from postnatal day 7 Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat pups, cross-chopped (400 × 400 μm), and then treated with 0.025% trypsin-EDTA (including 0.01% DNase I) for 15 min, 37 °C. Cells were triturated and plated at a density of 1 × 106/cm2 on poly-d-lysine-coated plates in Basal Medium Eagle (BME) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added after 24 h to inhibit nonneuronal replication. Cerebellar neurons were used after 7 days in vitro. For treatment with IGF-I, cells were washed twice and cultured for 2 h in BME with 5 mm KCl. Cells were lysed in ice-cold Triton lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm sodium PPI, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μm AEBSF (Sigma), 150 nm aprotinin, 1 μm E-64 (Sigma), and 1 μm leupeptin). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations were determined by a colorimetric assay (44.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Cell lysates containing 30 μg of protein were electrophoresed in 11% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. For immunoprecipitations, supernatants were diluted with 1 volume of HNTG (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF and 2 mm Na3VO4). Equal amounts of protein (250 μg) from each sample were immunoprecipitated using 0.4 μg/ml of antibody to either IGF-IR or G-protein subunits and were captured using protein A-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and visualized by Western blotting. For Western blot analysis, the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and probed with antibodies (1:2000 for all antibodies except 1:1000 for anti-MAPK antibodies), followed by secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or horse anti-mouse IgG antibodies. Membranes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The figures are scanned images and are representative of 3–5 experiments. The role of Gi in the activation of p42/p44 MAPK by IGF-I was investigated in Balb/c 3T3 cells, rat cerebellar granule neurons, and NG-108 neuronal cells (Fig.1). Basal MAPK phosphorylation was reduced by pertussis toxin in Balb/c 3T3 and NG-108 cells but not in cerebellar granule neurons. In agreement with a previous report (31.Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16495-16498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), pertussis toxin markedly inhibited IGF-I-induced MAPK phosphorylation in all cell types. Total MAPK content was unchanged under all conditions. Pertussis treatment had no effect on cell viability. Pertussis toxin inactivates both Gi and Go, but 3T3 cells lack Go. The results indicate that Giis at least partially required for MAPK activation by IGF-I. Having established a requirement for Gi in IGF-I-induced neuronal MAPK activation, we next examined the relationship between Gαi and the IGF-IR. IGF-IR was immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions and probed for Gαi content by Western blot analysis with anti-Gαi antibody. Fig.2 illustrates that Gαi is associated with the IGFR-I in both cerebellar granule cells and NG-108 cells. The IGF-IR and Gαi were similarly complexed in Balb/c 3T3 cells (data not shown). Gαs subunits were not detected in IGF-IR immunoprecipitates from any cell type despite copious expression in total cell lysates (not shown). The IGF-IR/Gαi interaction was completely disrupted when the IGF-IR was immunoprecipitated under denaturing conditions (not shown). IGF-I had no effect on the association of Gαi with the IGF-IR. The IGF-IR was active under these experimental conditions, as manifest by IGF-I-induced tyrosine autophosphorylation of the β domain of the IGF-IR in both cell types (Fig. 2, bottom panel). The anti-IGF-IR antibody did not cross-react with Gαi. Fig. 3 demonstrates that Gαi subunits were not identified using anti-IGF-IR antibodies in mouse embryo fibroblasts with targeted knockout of the IGF-IR (R− cells). Both proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-IGF-IR antibody upon restoration of IGF-IR expression (R+ cells) A requirement for Gβγ subunit release in IGF-IR-induced MAPK activation was suggested by the studies of Luttrell et al. (31.Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16495-16498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In conjunction with the observation that Gαi does not dissociate from the IGF-IR in response to IGF-I, we conjectured that IGF-I induces Gβγ subunit release from the IGF-IR. Fig. 4demonstrates that Gβ subunit coimmunoprecipitates with the IGF-IR in both cerebellar granule neurons and NG-108 cells. The amount of Gβ subunit associated with the IGF-IR decreased dramatically in response to IGF-I. Gβ subunit expression within total cell lysates was identical under all conditions. Fig. 4also demonstrates that pertussis toxin prevented the release of Gβ subunit from the IGF-IR but had no effect on the expression of IGF-IR or Gβ subunit. We conclude that heterotrimeric Gi is constitutively associated with IGF-IR and responds to IGF-I by release of free Gβγsubunits. The use of pertussis toxin and βγ subunit binding proteins has provided indirect evidence for an additional role of Gi in the activation of MAPK by IGF-I (31.Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16495-16498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the current study, we extended these findings to neuronal cell types and now provide direct evidence for the constitutive association of heterotrimeric Gi with the IGF-IR complex. Both Gαi and Gβsubunits co-immunoprecipitate with IGF-IR in cerebellar neurons and NG-108 cells. Importantly, IGF-I induces the release of Gβ subunits from the IGF-IR complex, whereas the association of Gαi with the IGF-IR is unaffected. The current data do not allow us to determine whether Gαibinds directly to the IGF-IR or to another protein in the IGF-IR complex. Gβγ subunits exhibit a pleckstrin homology domain which mediates binding to several molecules that are part of the IGF-IR signaling complex including IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase (3.Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). However, these interactions are unlikely to play a role in binding of Gβγ subunits to the IGF-IR because IRS-1 and PI 3-kinase are not bound to the IGF-IR in its unactivated state. RTKs for insulin, IGF-I and EGF, among others, contain SH2 binding domains which anchor adaptor proteins such as IRS-1 and Shc (28.Rubin R. Baserga R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 311-331PubMed Google Scholar, 29.LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these intermediaries leads to the activation of p21 ras, MAPK, and transcriptional activation. Both IRS-1 and Shc can independently lead to MAPK activation, although studies in some cell types have suggested that Shc may ultimately be more important for mitogenesis (45.Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 46.Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31107-31114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IGF-IR also activates PI 3-kinase, which has diverse functions, including an anti-apoptotic role mediated by its activation of Akt (47.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar, 48.Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). However, the relative contribution of these diverse signaling pathways to functional effects must be studied individually. There is also ample experimental evidence to support a role for the IGF-IR in the maintenance of the transformed phenotype. Notably, R− cells are resistant to transformation in response to several oncogenic influences (50.Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F105-F126Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Transformation is restored upon expression of the IGF-IR. In contrast, Leroith and co-workers have recently demonstrated that a constitutively active mutant of Gα13 can transform R− cells (51.Liu J.L. Blakesley V.A. Gutkind J.S. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29438-29441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The role of Gi in IGF-I signaling likely varies among different cell types. Pertussis toxin variably inhibits biological actions of IGF-I. In 3T3 cells (30.Kanzaki M. Nie L. Shibata H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4964-4969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and chondrocytes (32.Poiraudeau S. Lieberherr M. Kergosie N. Corvol M.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), pertussis toxin inhibits IGF-I-induced mobilization of intracellular calcium. Anti-Gαi antibodies inhibit the opening of a calcium-permeable cation channel in response to IGF-I (30.Kanzaki M. Nie L. Shibata H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4964-4969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin also inhibits the activation of human neutrophil phagocytosis (35.Jin G.F. Guo Y.S. Ball C. Houston C.W. Regul. Pept. 1993; 49: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and blocks IGF-I induced proliferation of myoblasts (33.Sarbassov D.D. Jones L.G. Peterson C.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 2038-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By contrast, pertussis toxin failed to inhibit several IGF-I-dependent phenomena including GTP[S] binding to rat kidney epithelial cell membranes (36.Siebler T. Kiess W. Linder B. Kessler U. Schwarz H.P. Nissley S.P. Regul. Pept. 1996; 62: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), DNA synthesis in MG-63 osteosarcoma cells (38.Linder B. Harris S. Eisen A. Nissley P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and IGF-I-induced human melanoma cell motility (39.Stracke M.L. Kohn E.C. Aznavoorian S.A. Wilson L.L. Salomon D. Krutzsch H.C. Liotta L.A. Schiffmann E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We have also noted that pertussis toxin has no effect on the ability of IGF-I to protect cerebellar granule cells from apoptosis induced by removal of growth factors and low extracellular potassium (43.Zhang F.X. Rubin R. Rooney T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26596-26602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 52.D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). 2H. Hallak, and R. Rubin, unpublished data. Thus, as is the case for other signaling mediators of the IGF-IR, the specific functional role of Gβγ subunits in IGF-I signaling is likely dependent upon cell context. Gi may also associate with the insulin receptor. Gαi2 and Gβ (but not Gαi1 orGαi3) were identified in purified insulin receptor preparations (14.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10135-10143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In a recent study, Sanchez et al. (19.Sanchez-Margalet V. Gonzalez-Yanes C. Santos-Alvarez J. Najib S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) reported that activation of the insulin receptor recruits Gαi to this receptor, in a manner similar to classical GPCRs. However, this differs from our finding that Gαiconstitutively associates with the IGF-IR. Pertussis toxin inhibits metabolic and mitogenic actions of insulin in a variety of cell culture models (9.Goren H.J. Northup J.K. Hollenberg M.D. Can. J. Physiol.

Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), antibodies targeted against Gαi but not Gαo, prevented insulin-stimulated GTP binding. Similarly, anti-Gαiantibodies blocks insulin-induced NADPH-dependent generation of hydrogen peroxide in human adipocyte membranes (14.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10135-10143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the IGF-IR induces Gβγ subunit release is unclear. Direct tyrosine phosphorylation of Gαi by the insulin receptor was suggested in studies of phospholipid vesicles co-inserted with Gαi (17.Krupinski J. Rajaram R. Lakonishok M. Benovic J.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12333-12341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, other data are inconsistent with the notion that Gαi is phosphorylated by the insulin receptor (53.Luttrell L. Kilgour E. Larner J. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16873-16879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Gawler D. Houslay M.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 55.Pyne N.J. Heyworth C.M.

Chem. 1988; 263: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a pathway other than tyrosine kinase activation may account for Gβγrelease, perhaps a configurational change induced by IGF-I. Our preliminary studies are in agreement with this view. Although we can detect tyrosine phosphate residues within Gαi by Western blotting, IGF-I has no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation state of the Gαi subunit protein. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the constitutive association of Gi with the IGF-IR, and provides a mechanism for release of an IGF-I-sensitive pool of Gβγ subunits. In cerebellar granule cells and NG-108 cells specifically, Gβγsubunit release is required for MAPK activation. The findings highlight the potential role of Gβγ subunits in the regulation of neuronal MAPK activity, which is a key element in neuronal development and regeneration.

Within the endoplasmic reticulum of LoVo cells, proSKI-1 is converted to SKI-1 by processing of its prosegment into 26-, 24-, 14-, 10-, and 8-kDa products, some of which remain tightly associated with the enzyme. N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometric analysis were used to map the cleavage sites of the most abundant fragments, which were confirmed by synthetic peptide processing. To characterize its in vitro enzymatic properties, we generated a secreted form of SKI-1. Our data demonstrate that SKI-1 is a Ca2+-dependent proteinase exhibiting optimal cleavage at pH 6.5. We present evidence that SKI-1 processes peptides mimicking the cleavage sites of the SKI-1 prosegment, pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and the sterol regulatory element-binding protein SREBP-2. Among the candidate peptides encompassing sections of the SKI-1 prosegment, the RSLK137- andRRLL186-containing peptides were best cleaved by this enzyme. Mutagenesis of the latter peptide allowed us to develop an efficiently processed SKI-1 substrate and to assess the importance of several P and P′ residues.

Mbikay M. Marcinkiewicz M. Chrétien M. Hook V.Y.H Proteolytic and Cellular Mechanisms in Prohormone and Neuropeptide Precursor Processing. R. G. Landes Co., Georgetown, TX1998: 49-76Google Scholar). The former cleavage type occurs in many growth factors and their receptors, most polypeptide hormones and neuropeptide precursors, surface glycoproteins (including adhesion and viral envelope glycoproteins), as well as a host of other secretory proteins (1.Seidah N.G.

Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The latter type of cellular processing has been implicated in the generation of bioactive peptides (4.Ling N. Burgus R. Guillemin R.

Some of the proteinases involved in intracellular endoproteolytic events that result in cleavage at specific single or paired basic residues are members of a family of calcium-dependent serine proteinases related to the yeast subtilase kexin (1.Seidah N.G.

These dibasic- and monobasic-specific “precursor convertases” (PCs), of which seven mammalian members are presently known, comprise PC1 (PC3), PC2, furin (PACE), PC4, PC5 (PC6), PACE4, and PC7 (LPC, PC8). Each of these kexin-like subtilases contains a unique N-terminal prosegment that presumably functions both as an intramolecular chaperone and a proteinase inhibitor (1.Seidah N.G. Day R.

Efforts to identify the proteinases responsible for the intracellular processing of precursors at hydrophobic or small aa have led to the recent cloning of a new subtilase called SKI-1 (10.Seidah N.G.

According to Siezen and Leunissen's classification (9.Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), this enzyme belongs to the pyrolysin branch of subtilases (compared with PCs, which are within the kexin branch). Tissue distribution analyses by both Northern blots and in situ hybridization reveal that SKI-1 mRNA is widely expressed (10.Seidah N.G. Mowla S.J. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi A.M. Benjannet S. Toure B.B.

We reported previously that human SKI-1 (hSKI-1) produces a 28-kDa product from the 32-kDa brain-derived neurotrophic factor precursor (proBDNF) via selective cleavage within the sequence R GL T ↓SL (10.Seidah N.G.

Independently, Sakai et al. demonstrated that hamster SKI-1/S1P is responsible for the site 1 cleavage of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) (11.Sakai J. Rawson R.B. Espenshade P.J.

In their model, SKI-1/S1P cleaves SREBP-2 at an R SV L ↓SF sequence within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutational analyses demonstrated that the presence of Arg at the P4 substrate position is critical for cleavage, whereas the P1 Leu could be replaced by a number of other aa (8.Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this work, we first present data regarding the cellular biosynthesis of membrane-bound hSKI-1 and its zymogen processing. Then, based on our previous discovery of a secreted (shed) form of hSKI-1 (10.Seidah N.G. Mowla S.J. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi A.M. Benjannet S. Toure B.B. Basak A. Munzer J.S. Marcinkiewicz J. Zhong M.

This isoform, collected from cell media, was used to study the in vitro cleavage properties of this enzyme on a number of synthetic substrates. In addition, we present data on thein vitro inhibitory character of three prosegment constructs of SKI-1, which we obtained as bacterial recombinant proteins. Moreover, we examined the processing of hSKI-1 in LoVo cells infected with a VV recombinant as well as in a stable transfectant of HK293 cells (10.Seidah N.G. Mowla S.J. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi A.M.

A. 1999; 96: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The preparation of a soluble form of hSKI-1 involved the initial amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of a 1250-base pair product encompassing nucleotides 491–1740 of the hSKI-1 cDNA (12.Nagase T. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Sazuka T. Seki N. Sato S. Tabata S. Ishikawa K. Kawarabayasi Y. Kotani H.

The sense (s) and antisense (as) oligonucleotides were 5′-GTGACCATGAAGCTTGTCAACATCTGG-3′ and 5′-ACACTGGTCCCTGAGAGGGCCCGGCA-3′, respectively. This completely sequenced fragment, which had been inserted into the PCR2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), was first digested with NotI andAccI. It was then ligated with the similarly digested full-length hSKI-1 cDNA 3.5-kilobase pair product, resulting in a product called 5′-hSKI-1-FL. In order to obtain a soluble form of hSKI-1 with a hexa-His sequence just before the stop codon, PCR amplification was carried out using the sense and antisense oligonucleotides: 5′-ATTGACCTGGACAAGGTGGTG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTCTAGATCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCTCCTGGTTGTAGCGGCCAGG-3′. This resulted in a 165-base pair fragment encoding the C-terminal sequence PGRYNQE997-(H6)* (10.Seidah N.G. Mowla S.J. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi A.M. Benjannet S. Toure B.B. Basak A. Munzer J.S.

Following digestion with 5′ EcoNI and 3′ XbaI, the product was ligated to the aforementioned and similarly digested 5′ hSKI-1-FL. This cDNA, coding for BTMD-SKI-1 ending with a hexa-His sequence, was then transferred to the BamHI/XbaI site of the (VV) transfer vector PMJ601. A recombinant was then isolated as previously reported (13.Munzer J.S. Basak A. Zhong M. Mamarbachi A. Hamelin J. Savaria D. Lazure C. Benjannet S. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol.

Seventeen hours following infection with 2 plaque-forming units each of VV:SKI-1 and VV:BTMD-SKI-1 recombinants, human LoVo cells (3 × 106) were radiolabeled with 500 μCi of [3H]Leu for 2 h or pulsed for 15 min followed by a chase of 2 h, in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) as described (10.Seidah N.G.

They were then transferred into the BamHI/XhoI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET 24b (Novagen). These recombinants were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21. Protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, and the cultures were grown for 3 h at 37 °C. The cell pellets were sonicated on ice in a binding buffer containing 6 m guanidine-HCl (Novagen) until a clear solution was obtained. The clarified and filtered solution was then applied to a nickel affinity column (Novagen) and eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The eluates were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 7). The protein precipitate was solubilized with glacial acetic acid, filtered through a 0.45-μm disc, and further purified on a 5-μm C4 column (0.94 × 25 cm; Vydac) by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The purity was assessed by Coomassie staining and the identity of the products verified by mass spectrometry on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/time of flight (MALDI-TOF) Voyageur DE-Pro instrument (PE PerSeptive Biosystems). The amounts of prosegments were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis (13.Munzer J.S. Basak A. Zhong M. Mamarbachi A. Hamelin J. Savaria D. Lazure C. Benjannet S. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J.

Following infection of BSC40 cells (75 × 106 cells) with 2 plaque-forming units/cell of recombinant VV:BTMD-SKI-1, the cells were washed and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h in a serum-free minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Media (45 ml) were then dialyzed, concentrated 20-fold to 2.2 ml on Centriprep-30 (Amicon) and stored at −20 °C in 40% glycerol. For purification, 2Although we managed to produce limited quantities of partially purified SKI-1 using metal chelating resins, there was insufficient enzyme to carry out full kinetic analyses. However, since the medium of WT virus-expressing (or control vector-expressing) cells produced no significant peptide hydrolysis (with the exception of peptides VIII and IX), we mainly used the concentrated media of BSC40 cells infected with VV:BTMD-SKI-1. Thus, the metal chelation-purified enzyme served mainly to verify that the enzyme from concentrated media behaved similarly to this form. We therefore confirmed all of the peptide cleavage sites, the SREBP-2 pH optimum, and the Ca2+ requirement presented below. the concentrated media were applied to a Ni2+ affinity resin (Novagen) or a Co2+ affinity resin (CLONTECH) as described by the manufacturer. After two washes with 5 mm imidazole, the protein was eluted with 200 mm imidazole and tested for enzymatic activity and immunoreactivity by Western blot (see below). Aliquots of partially purified BTMD-SKI-1 were separated by 8% or 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by electrotransfer of the proteins onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). These membranes were probed with an antiserum directed against either SKI-1 (aa 217–233 (Ab:N) or aa 634–651 (Ab:S)) or pro-SKI-1 ((aa 18–188 (Ab:P)). Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Concentrated media obtained from either VV:BTMD-SKI-1-infected BSC40 cells or from a stable transfectant of full-length hSKI-1 in HK293 cells (10.Seidah N.G. Mowla S.J. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi A.M.

Proteins were eluted at 2 ml/min using a 1%/min linear gradient (15–70%) of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN with monitoring at 210 nm. The products were analyzed by Western blotting, after which the immunoreactive fractions were further purified on a Vydac 5-μm C4 column (0.46 × 25 cm). Mass values were obtained by MALDI-TOF spectrometry using the 2matrix 3,5 dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich). For N-terminal sequencing, fraction IV proteins (Fig. 3 A) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes, and stained with Ponceau Red. The 14- and 5-kDa bands were excised and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems model 477 sequenator operating in the gas-phase mode (15.Basak A. Boudreault A. Chen A. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G.

All Fmoc amino acid derivatives (l-form), the coupling reagents, and the solvents for peptide synthesis were purchased from PE Biosystems Inc. (Framingham, MA, USA), Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), or Richelieu Biotechnologies (Montréal, Quebec, Canada).

Except for the first two peptides, which were purchased from the Sheldon Biotechnology Institute (McGill University, Quebec, Canada), all other peptides were synthesized with the C terminus in the amide form. Peptides III–XI were prepared on a solid phase peptide synthesizer (Pioneer model, PE Biosystems) using either 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/N-hydroxybenzotriazole orO-[7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl]-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/diisopropyl ethyl amine-mediated Fmoc chemistry with polyamide-linker-polyethyleneglycol (PAL-PEG) unloaded resin and the standard side chain protecting groups (16.Basak A.

For the incorporation of the two unnatural amino acids (Abz and Y(NO2)), an extended coupling cycle was used instead of either the standard or fast cycles. The crude peptides were purified by RP-HPLC using a semi-preparative Chromatographic Sciences Co. Inc. (CSC)-Exsil C18 column (0.94 × 25 cm). Monitoring at 210 nm, the peptides were eluted with a 1%/min linear gradient (5% to 60%) of aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN at 2 ml/min. The peptide purity and concentration were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis (16.Basak A. Ernst B. Brewer D. Seidah N.G. Munzer J.S. Lazure C. Lajoie G.A. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The identity of each purified peptide was confirmed by MALDI-TOF spectrometry using the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich). For digestions, each peptide was typically reacted at 37 °C with 10 μl of the concentrated enzyme preparation in a buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES (ICN Biomedicals Inc), 50 mm MES (Sigma), and 3 mm Ca2+-acetate (pH 6.5). The digestion products were separated by RP-HPLC on a Beckman 5-μm Ultrasphere C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm) and eluted with a 1%/min linear gradient of aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN (5–45%) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The collected peptides were characterized by mass spectrometry and amino acid composition, which was also used to quantitate the amount of various substrates and products. The digestions of the quenched fluorogenic peptides were analyzed by RP-HPLC using a dual UV (210 nm) and fluorescence (excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 420 nm, respectively) detector (Rainin). The protocols used were essentially the same as reported previously (13.Munzer J.S. Basak A. Zhong M. Mamarbachi A. Hamelin J. Savaria D. Lazure C. Benjannet S. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol.

Stocks of the buffer described above were adjusted to pH 5.0–8.5 at 0.5-unit increments by addition of either acetic acid or sodium hydroxide. In order to investigate the calcium requirement of SKI-1, increasing concentrations of Ca2+-acetate were used ranging from 0 to 10 mm. For inhibition studies, the enzyme in the reaction buffer was preincubated with the desired agents for 30 min prior to addition of peptide II. Following digestion reactions with increasing substrate concentrations, the products were separated by RP-HPLC. The rate of substrate hydrolysis was obtained from the integrated peak areas of the chromatograms.K m(app) andV max(app) values were estimated using nonlinear regression analysis (Enzfitter software; Elsevier Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom) of plots of the hydrolysis rate versus the substrate concentration. For apparent inhibitor constant (K i(app)) determinations, variable inhibitor concentrations within the range of 15–70% inhibition were used at three concentrations of peptide IV ranging from 0.6 to 3.5 times the K m(app) value. TheK i(app) values were estimated from Dixon plots as described (16.Basak A. Ernst B. Brewer D. Seidah N.G. Munzer J.S. Lazure C. Lajoie G.A. J. Pept.

We have previously shown that overexpression of full-length SKI-1 (FL-SKI-1) in HK293 cells results in shedding of a 98-kDa form (sSKI-1) of this enzyme into the medium (10.Seidah N.G. Mowla S.J. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi A.M. Benjannet S. Toure B.B. Basak A. Munzer J.S. Marcinkiewicz J. Zhong M. Barale J.C. Lazure C. Murphy R.A. Chrétien M. Marcinkiewicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, we engineered a soluble form of SKI-1 (BTMD-SKI-1), ending at residue 997, to which we added a hexa-His sequence at the C terminus (Fig. 1 A). In a comparative biosynthetic analysis, shown in Fig. 1 B, LoVo cells were infected with the SKI-1 virus constructs VV:FL-SKI-1, VV:BTMD-SKI-1, and wild type virus (VV:WT). After labeling the cells for 3 h with [35S]Cys, proteins in the media were immunoprecipitated with an antiserum directed against either the prosegment of SKI-1 (Ab:P) or an internal SKI-1 sequence (Ab:S). In both cases, a protein of ∼14 kDa co-immunoprecipitated with the 98-kDa sSKI-1 or the 100-kDa BTMD-SKI-1 (bSKI-1, Fig. 1 B) that was not seen with VV:WT infections. Since Ab:P was raised against a recombinant SKI-1 prosegment peptide and has been shown previously to detect the SKI-1 zymogen (10.Seidah N.G. Mowla S.J. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi A.M. Benjannet S. Toure B.B. Basak A. Munzer J.S. Marcinkiewicz J. Zhong M. Barale J.C. Lazure C. Murphy R.A. Chrétien M. Marcinkiewicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), we concluded that the ∼14-kDa peptide is most likely derived from the cleaved prosegment (the full-length prosegment is ∼24 kDa; see below). The fact that it co-immunoprecipitated with the enzyme under denaturing conditions suggests a strong interaction between SKI-1 and this region of its prosegment. The actual stoichiometry of enzyme-to-prosegment is not clear from this experiment, since it was carried out using two different antisera and denaturing conditions. We also observed that some of the 100-kDa BTMD-SKI-1 is cleaved into a 98-kDa form similar to that found with FL-SKI-1 (Fig. 1 B). This conversion is presumably carried out by endogenous “shedding enzymes” (10.Seidah N.G. Mowla S.J. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi A.M. Benjannet S. Toure B.B. Basak A. Munzer J.S. Marcinkiewicz J. Zhong M.

https://openalex.org/W2039321714,"The human pulmonary surfactant protein A (hSP-A) has been implicated in the early capture and phagocytosis of the pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis by alveolar macrophages. In this report, we examined the interaction of alveolar proteinosis patient hSP-A with Mycobacterium bovis BCG, the vaccinating strain, as a model of pathogenic mycobacteria, andMycobacterium smegmatis, a nonpathogenic strain. We found that hSP-A binds to the surface of M. bovis BCG, but also to a slightly lesser extent, to M. smegmatis, indicating that hSP-A does not discriminate between virulent and nonpathogenic strains. Among the various glycoconjugates isolated from the mycobacterial envelope, we found that the best ligands are the two major lipoglycans: the mannosylated lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) and the lipomannan. In contrast, the mannose-capped arabinomannan, structurally close to the ManLAM, as well as the LAMs from the non pathogenicM. smegmatis are poorly recognized by hSP-A. These results clearly show that the presence of both the terminal mannose residues and the phophatidyl-myo-inositol anchor are necessary to achieve the highest binding affinity. Selective removal of either the terminal mannose or the acyl residues esterifying the glycerol moiety of the ManLAM abrogates the interaction with hSP-A, further supporting the notion that the hSP-A recognition of the carbohydrate epitopes of the lipoglycans is dependent of the presence of the fatty acids.

Ann. Intern. Med. 1997; 126: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) has renewed interest in pathogenic mycobacteria, which remain the leading cause of mortality due to a single infectious agent (2.Raviglione M.C. Snider Jr., D.E. Kochi A. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1995; 273: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). However, despite decades of effort, the molecular basis of the pathogenicity ofMycobacterium tuberculosis is poorly defined. M. tuberculosis is a facultative intracellular pathogen of the alveolar macrophages located in the apical regions of the lung. Most of the recent findings suggest that the adhesion and the invasion of the target cells constitute essential steps determining the fate of the primary infection (3.Bloom B.R. Murray C.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 4.Fenton M.J. Vermeulen M.W. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 683-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is now well established that pathogenic mycobacteria use numerous paths to invade human macrophages (5.Ernst J.D. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and great effort has been made to delineate the molecular basis of the adhesion of the bacillus to its host cell. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the attachment of mycobacteria to phagocytes varies according the mycobacterial strain (i.e. slow or fast growing) and the type, origin, or maturation state of the phagocyte. Recently, two key components of pulmonary innate immunity, the human surfactant proteins A and D (hSP-A, hSP-D),1 were found to interact with M. tuberculosis. However, despite their great structural analogy, they have opposite effects toward the phagocytosis of invading mycobacteria. Whereas hSP-D seems to reduce the uptake of pathogenic bacilli by macrophages (6.Ferguson J.S. Voelker D.R. McCormack F.X. Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 312-321PubMed Google Scholar), hSP-A was shown to promote the attachment of M. tuberculosis to phagocytes (7.Downing J.F. Pasula R. Wright J.R. Twigg III, H.L. Martin W.J., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4848-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting a new way for the pathogenic bacillus to gain access to its target cell. Moreover, further elucidation of the effect of hSP-A shows that this protein may have different roles. Direct interaction between hSP-A and phagocytes leads to the up-regulation of the macrophage mannose receptor that is responsible for the increase in M. tuberculosis uptake (8.Gaynor C.D. McCormack F.X. Voelker D.R. McGowan S.E. Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5343-5351PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Weikert et al. (9.Weikert L.F. Edwards K. Chroneos Z.C. Hager C. Hoffman L. Shepherd V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L989-L995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that hSP-A may also act as an opsonin, enhancing the phagocytosis of Mycobacterium bovis BCG by macrophages. This result suggests that opsonization mechanisms leading to the phagocytosis of invading pathogenic mycobacteria may occur in the alveolar space, just following the initial inoculation, despite the low concentration of soluble serum complement opsonins. Because of the major importance of these processes in the capture of the airborne pathogenic mycobacteria and their transfer across the pulmonary surfactant toward their target cells, we focused our attention on the opsonizing role of hSP-A. In their study, Weikertet al. (9.Weikert L.F. Edwards K. Chroneos Z.C. Hager C. Hoffman L. Shepherd V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L989-L995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that phagocytosis of hSP-A coatedM. bovis BCG results from the binding of the collagen-like domain of hSP-A to a specific phagocyte surface receptor (SPR210). Moreover the interaction of hSP-A with mycobacteria was shown to be calcium and carbohydrate-dependent, suggesting that the binding is mediated by the lectin domains of hSP-A. However, the identity of the mycobacterial ligand(s) to which hSP-A binds remains to be defined. The mycobacterial cell wall is known to contain large quantities of glycoconjugates, including glycolipids, lipopolysaccharides, lipophosphoglycans, polysaccharides and glycoproteins, all constituting potential binding sites for hSP-A at the surface of the bacilli. Among these, the phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs), the glucan, and the mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) are already identified as possible mediators of the adhesion of the mycobacteria to the phagocyte by binding to the serum mannose-binding protein (10.Hoppe H.C. de Wet B.J. Cywes C. Daffe M. Ehlers M.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3896-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the macrophage CR3 (11.Cywes C. Hoppe H.C. Daffe M. Ehlers M.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4258-4266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the mannose receptor (12.Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2920-2930PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. More recently, ManLAM was also shown to be the predominant ligand of SP-D (6.Ferguson J.S. Voelker D.R. McCormack F.X. Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 312-321PubMed Google Scholar). The goal of the present report was 1) to examine whether hSP-A discriminates pathogenic (M. bovis BCG) from nonpathogenic (Mycobacterium smegmatis) mycobacteria, 2) to identify the putative mycobacterial surface glycoconjugates which may serve for hSP-A attachment, and 3) to determine the ligand structural motifs mediating the interaction. Our results demonstrate that hSP-A opsonization is not restricted to pathogenic mycobacteria and may be mediated by major lipoglycans found in the mycobacterial envelope. Moreover, the observations reported here highlight that the lipidic components of the ligand are required for the recognition of the carbohydrate epitopes by hSP-A.

Mycobacterial culture M. bovis BCG 1173P2 and M. smegmatis MC2155 were cultured as pellicles on SAUTON medium. After removal of the medium, cells used for solid phase binding assays were desegregated by treatment with glass beads (3-mm diameter) and washed three times in coating buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mmNaHCO3, pH 9.5, 1% sodium deoxycholate). “Cellular” and “parietal” LAMs fromM. smegmatis mc2155, M. bovis BCG 1173P2, and M. tuberculosis H37Rv were purified in our laboratory as described previously (13.Nigou J.

After neutralization with HCl, the reaction product was dialyzed with 6000-8000 molecular weight cutoff membranes (spectra/por®, Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc., Houston, TX) against deionized water. M. bovis BCG cellular ManLAM (200 μg) was incubated (6 h) at 37 °C in 30 μl of α-mannosidase from jack bean (2 mg/ml, 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 4.5, 1 mm ZnSO4). After a second addition of 50 μl of enzyme, the solution was incubated overnight, then dialyzed against 50 mm NH4CO3, pH 7.6. Elimination of α-mannosidase was achieved by denaturation (2 min, 110 °C) followed by overnight tryptic digestion (37 °C, trypsin/α-mannosidase ratio = 2% by weight). After extensive dialysis against deionized water, the reaction products were analyzed by capillary zone electrophoresis as described previously (13.Nigou J. Gilleron M. Cahuzac B. Bounery J.D. Herold M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23094-23103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). hSP-A was purified from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with alveolar proteinosis (15.Wright J.R. Wager R.E. Hawgood S. Dobbs L. Clements J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2888-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, alveolar surfactant was isolated from 150 ml of BALF by centrifugation (20,000 ×g, 4 °C, overnight). The pellet was delipidated by extraction with 100 ml of n-butyl alcohol. After centrifugation (5000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min), the pellet, containing n-butyl alcohol insoluble proteins, was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The resulting powder was suspended in 50 ml of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm n-octyl glucoside to solubilize serum proteins. hSP-A and others insoluble proteins were collected by ultracentrifugation (200,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min). The pellet was washed twice in the same buffer and then suspended in 5 ml of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Elimination of the residual n-octyl glucoside was achieved by extensive dialysis against the same buffer. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 20 °C, 30 min) and the supernatant containing hSP-A was frozen in small aliquots. Solid phase binding assays were carried out on microtiter plates (Nunc-Immuno, Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). Cell wall glycoconjugates (100 ng/50 μl of EtOH/H2O 1:1) or mycobacterial cells (107 cells/100 μl in coating buffer) were adsorbed in the microtiter wells by air drying at 37 °C or by incubation (1 h at 37 °C) and extensively rinsed with washing buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.4% low fat dry milk) at the end of each incubation time. Subsequent steps were performed at room temperature (unless otherwise stated). The wells were blocked for 2 h with blocking buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 30% low fat dry milk) before addition of 100 μl of hSP-A solution (1–60 μg/ml in washing buffer). After overnight incubation, 100 μl of rabbit anti-hSP-A serum (1/1000 in washing buffer) were loaded in microtiter wells and allowed to react for 3 h. After extensive washing, 100 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (clone RG 16, 1/2000 in washing buffer) were added and incubated for 1 h. Microtiter wells were then extensively washed with substrate buffer (15 mmNa2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.5, 0.1 mm MgCl2), and alkaline phosphatase activity was detected at 37 °C by addition of 100 μl ofpara-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg/ml in substrate buffer). Absorbency at 405 nm was measured on a microtiter plates reader (Titertek Multiskan®, Flow Laboratories, Helsinki, Finland). Nonspecific binding was estimated by replacing the calcium in the hSP-A solutions by 5 mm EDTA. To examined the ability of hSP-A contained in BALF to bind to mycobacterial cells, 107 cells in 100 μl of coating buffer were adsorbed in the microtiter wells by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing with washing buffer without Tween 20, the wells were blocked for 2 h with blocking buffer before addition of 100 μl of hSP-A solution (60 μg/ml) or BALF adjusted to 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.4% low fat dry milk. Subsequent steps were the same as described above except that the dilutions of primary and secondary antibodies and all steps of washing were performed in washing buffer without Tween 20. Quantification of the amount of ligand bound to the microtiter wells was performed as described previously (6.Ferguson J.S. Voelker D.R. McCormack F.X. Schlesinger L.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 312-321PubMed Google Scholar) using the DIG-Glycan Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). Monosaccharide competition studies were carried out on microtiter plates. Microtiter wells were coated with 50 μl of M. bovis BCG cellular ManLAM (10 μg/ml in EtOH/H2O 1:1) by air drying at 37 °C. Wells were incubated 2 h with blocking buffer and then extensively rinsed with washing buffer. 100 μl of hSP-A (15 μg/ml) plus competitors (0–100 mm in washing buffer) were added and allowed to react overnight with coated M. bovis BCG cellular ManLAM. Bound hSP-A was detected as described above. Competition assays using mycobacterial glycoconjugates as competitors were performed as above at 5 and 50 μg/ml in hSP-A solutions. The number of maximum binding sites and the equilibrium dissociation constants for hSP-A/M. bovis BCG cellular ManLAM or mycobacterial cells were determined by fitting experimental results with either one or two site binding hyperbola using Graph Pad Prism® (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The IC50 for the different competitors was graphically determined as the competitor concentration resulting in 50% of inhibition. To examine the interaction of hSP-A with mycobacteria, 1 × 107 M. bovis BCG cells were coated onto microtiter plates and allowed to react with increasing concentration of hSP-A in the presence of calcium. Fig. 1 A shows that hSP-A binds to mycobacterial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of 5 mm EDTA greatly reduces the binding (up to 80%), indicating that the interaction is calcium-dependent as reported previously (9.Weikert L.F. Edwards K. Chroneos Z.C. Hager C. Hoffman L. Shepherd V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L989-L995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The saturation is reached at approximately 1 μg of added hSP-A. The maximum level of specific binding (B max) toM. bovis BCG is 8.4 ng/1 × 107 cells, and the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, calculated from the saturation curve fitted by nonlinear regression, is KdBCG ∼4.5 ± 0.7 × 10−9m consistent with the previous values observed for the binding of hSP-A to M. tuberculosis (16.Pasula R. Downing J.F. Wright J.R. Kachel D.L. Davis Jr., T.E. Martin W.J., II Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similar experiments performed with M. smegmatis (Fig.1 B) revealed that hSP-A also binds to nonpathogenic mycobacteria in a concentration and calcium-dependent manner. The maximum level of specific binding and the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant are of the same order but slightly lower when compared with M. bovis BCG:B max = 6.8 ng/1 × 107 M. smegmatis cells and Kdsmegmatis ∼ 13.3 ± 2 × 10−9m. This result clearly demonstrates that the interaction of hSP-A with mycobacteria is not restricted to the pathogenic strains. The need for calcium strongly suggests that hSP-A binding to mycobacteria is specifically mediated by the carbohydrate recognition domains. However, as noticed by several others workers (9.Weikert L.F. Edwards K. Chroneos Z.C. Hager C. Hoffman L. Shepherd V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L989-L995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Pasula R. Downing J.F. Wright J.R. Kachel D.L. Davis Jr., T.E. Martin W.J., II Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Invest. 1992; 89: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we observed a very limited inhibitory effect of monosaccharides (mannose, glucose, galactose) at concentrations up to 100 mm (data not shown). In a same way, the addition of multivalent ligands such asSaccharomyces cerevisiae mannan or mannosylated bovine serum albumin (up to 1 mg/ml) does not affect significantly the binding of hSP-A to mycobacteria. Although others report some inhibition using mannosylated bovine serum albumin at 10 mg/ml (16.Pasula R. Downing J.F. Wright J.R. Kachel D.L. Davis Jr., T.E. Martin W.J., II Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17.Zimmerman P.E. Voelker D.R. McCormack F.X. Paulsrud J.R. Martin W.J., II J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), such high protein concentration may affect the interaction nonspecifically. In their study, Weikert et al. (9.Weikert L.F. Edwards K. Chroneos Z.C. Hager C. Hoffman L. Shepherd V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L989-L995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that hSP-A may act as an opsonin, enhancing the phagocytosis of M. bovisBCG by macrophages. This result suggests that opsonization mechanisms leading to the phagocytosis of invading mycobacteria may occur in the alveolar space, just following the initial inoculation. Because in the alveolar surfactant, hSP-A is associated with phospholipids, we examined the ability of hSP-A contained in BALF to bind to mycobacterial cells. As shown by Fig. 2, hSP-A present in BALF also binds to mycobacterial cells, indicating that the lipids do not alter the binding properties of the protein. This observation support the assumption that, in vivo, hSP-A can bind to invading mycobacteria in the alveolar environment. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the difference in the level of binding to M. bovis BCG and M. smegmatis is more pronounced with the crude hSP-A contained in BALF then with the purified protein. To identify the mycobacterial surface determinants involved in the binding, the most abundant glycoconjugates associated with the envelope were tested by a solid phase binding assay. In a previous study, Weikert et al. have postulated that the arabinogalactan could be a ligand for hSP-A (9.Weikert L.F. Edwards K. Chroneos Z.C. Hager C. Hoffman L. Shepherd V.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L989-L995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the present work we found that purified arabinogalactan (AG), obtained after alkali treatment of mycobacterial cell wall (18.Daffe M. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 383-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), failed to interact with hSP-A in the solid phase assay (Fig.3). This result is consistent with the previous carbohydrate affinity studies showing that hSP-A binds to mannose and glucose, but not to galactose (19.Haurum J.S. Thiel S. Haagsman H.P. Laursen S.B. Larsen B. Jensenius J.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). From this observation we expected that hSP-A should interact with any glycoconjugates containing terminal mannose or glucose residues. However the S. cerevisiae mannan or the glucan (GL), one of the most abundant glycogen-like polysaccharidic components of the mycobacterial external capsule (20.Ortalo-Magne A. Dupont M.A. Lemassu A. Andersen A.B. Gounon P. Daffe M. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), were found to interact poorly with hSP-A at the concentrations tested in solid phase assay (Fig. 3). In the same way, the M. bovis BCG arabinomannan (ManAM), which shares with the ManLAM the same mannose-capped polysaccharidic backbone, is poorly recognized by hSP-A. Surprisingly, the PIMs, recently identified as predominant ligand of the mannose-binding protein (10.Hoppe H.C. de Wet B.J. Cywes C. Daffe M. Ehlers M.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3896-3905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were also found to react very slightly with hSP-A despite the presence of terminal α-mannosyl residues. Finally, as suspected from previous observations (22.Schlesinger L.S. Hull S.R. Kaufman T.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4070-4079PubMed Google Scholar) the cellular mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (cManLAM) isolated from M. bovis BCG was found to strongly interact with hSP-A. However, more surprisingly, hSP-A binds also to the mycobacterial lipomannan (LM), which is devoid of mannose caps. Similar experiments performed with the crude BALF confirm that the specificity of hSP-A binding to the lipoglycans is not affected by the presence of the other surfactant components and in particular by the endogenous phospholipids (data not shown). To verify whether the lack of interaction with the mycobacterial polysaccharides do not results from differences in the amount of coated materials, the quantity of each adsorbed ligand was estimated by the digoxigenin-glycan assay. As shown in TableI, the adsorption was found similar for all the compounds except for the AG and GL, which display higher responses, indicating higher amount of adsorbed material.Table IGlycoconjugates adsorption to microtiter platesGlycoconjugatesA 405 nmS.E.LM0.1610.007ManAM0.1830.013PIM0.2280.056AG0.5580.133GL0.3650.011ScMan0.1660.022M. bovis BCG cManLAM0.2180.011M. bovis BCG pManLAM0.1850.021M. tuberculosiscManLAM0.2730.011M. tuberculosispManLAM0.2310.028M. smegmatisPILAM0.2410.036M. smegmatisPIGAM0.1750.031Glycoconjugates (100 ng/50 μl EtOH/H2 3-O-1:1) were adsorbed in the microtiter wells by air drying at 37 °C and incubated with sodium metaperiodate followed by digoxigenin 3-O-succinyl-ε-amidocaproic acid hydrazide.

These results demonstrate that, among the different major glycoconjugates of the mycobacterial cell wall, both ManLAM and LM are likely to be the predominant target molecules for the attachment of the pulmonary collectin to the surface of mycobacteria in the alveolar airspace. The specificity of hSP-A binding to M. bovis BCG lipoglycans was assessed by the solid phase binding assay using cellular ManLAM as a model ligand. The results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that, in presence of calcium, hSP-A exhibits a dose-dependent binding to the ManLAM. Compared with the background, the addition of EDTA completely abolished the binding, indicating that the interaction is exclusively through a calcium-dependent mechanism. Optimum binding was obtained with 100 ng of coated ManLAM/well. In these conditions, the saturation threshold is reached with an hSP-A concentration of 40–50 μg/ml, consistent with previous work (23.Van Iwaarden J.F. Pikaar J.C. Storm J. Brouwer E. Verhoef J. Oosting R.S. van Golde L.M. van Strijp J.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The fit of the experimental data with a single binding site model curve gives an apparent equilibrium dissociation constantK d of 8 × 10−9m, close to the value obtained with cells. The carbohydrate binding characteristics were determined by competitive inhibition using various monosaccharides (Fig.5). Among the free monosaccharides tested, d-mannose was found to be the most efficient competitor with an IC50 (inhibitor concentration that reduces the binding by 50%) of 20 mm (3.8 g/liter).d-Glucose, but also surprisingly d-arabinose, inhibit efficiently the binding of hSP-A to ManLAM (IC50: 66 and 58 mm, respectively). In contrast,l-arabinose and d-galactose (as observed previously (19.Haurum J.S. Thiel S. Haagsman H.P. Laursen S.B. Larsen B. Jensenius J.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)) have no inhibitory activity. The inhibition by d-arabinose, but not by thel-isomer, strongly suggested that hSP-A may bind to the ManLAM arabinan domain exclusively constituted ofd-arabinofuranosyl residues. Indeed, at equilibrium, arabinose in solution adopts the pyranoid but also, to a lesser extent, the furanoid conformation present in ManLAM. Then, to identify the arabinose form responsible for the inhibition, we performed further competition experiments with various methyl arabinosides corresponding to the different conformations adopted by the free monosaccharide in solution. Unexpectedly, the methyl arabinofuranoside (Me-α-d-Araf) was unable to inhibit the interaction, clearly showing that hSP-A do not bind to the arabinan chains of ManLAM (Fig. 6). In contrast, the methyl arabinopyranoside (Me-β-d-Arap) effectively competes for the binding of hSP-A to ManLAM. This result demonstrates that the inhibition is due to the energetically favored1C4 chair pyranoid conformation. Indeed, in this conformation, the hydroxyl of the d-Arapring carbons 2 and 3 are both equatorial and display the same relative spatial arrangement than that of C3 and C4 hydroxyl groups ofd-Manp or d-Glcp (Fig.6). Thus, by analogy with mannose-binding protein carbohydrate binding scheme (24.Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), we propose that the binding ofd-Arap results from the direct ligation of the OH-2 and OH-3 by either coordination bonds with the calcium atom and hydrogen bonds with the amino acids constituting the binding pocket of the carbohydrate recognition domain. In addition, the absence of interaction with the l-Arap can also be explained by the 4C1-chair conformation of thel enantiomer. In this case the hydroxyl groups OH-2, OH-3, and OH-4 can be strictly superimposed to those of thed-Galp and so cannot fit with the binding scheme described for the d-Manp or thed-Arap. Thus, these data confirm that the interaction of hSP-A with the ManLAM results from the binding of the hSP-A lectin domains to terminal mannosyl residues of this complex lipoglycan. From a structural point of view both LM and LAM (of any type) share a similar linear mannan segment constituted of an α1→6-linked mannopyranosyl backbone decorated with branched α1→2 terminal mannopyranosyl units. The main difference between LM and LAMs result from the substitution of the LAM mannan core by an additional arabinan domain. The similar level of binding observed with the ManLAM and the LM suggests that the hSP-A carbohydrate recognition domains interact with the common structure shared by these two compounds: the mannan core. To verify this assumption, we tested the hSP-A binding to the phosphoinositol-capped LAMs produced by M. smegmatis, which bears phosphoinositol caps in place of the mannose caps (14.Gill"

The full-length cDNA that encodes the β subunit of human MAT II was cloned and found to encode for a 334-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 37,552. Analysis of sequence homology showed similarity with bacterial enzymes that catalyze the reduction of TDP-linked sugars. The β subunit cDNA was cloned into the pQE-30 expression vector, and the recombinant His tagged protein, which was expressed in Escherichia coli, was recognized by antibodies to the human MAT II, to synthetic peptides copying the sequence of native β subunit protein, and to the rβ protein. There is no cross-reactivity between the MAT II α2 or β subunits. None of the anti-β subunit antibodies reacted with protein extracts of E. coli host cells, suggesting that these bacteria have no β subunit protein.

In this study, we report the complete sequence of cDNA encoding the entire MAT II β subunit, and we show that the protein expressed inEscherichia coli associates with the E. coli as well as the human catalytic α subunits of MAT. The association of β and α subunits changes the kinetic properties of MAT, thereby providing direct evidence for the regulatory role of the MAT II β subunit. Degenerate primers were designed based on partial amino acid sequence of two tryptic peptides (generated by partial digestion of pure MAT II β protein as described previously (29.De La Rosa J.

The forward 5′ DEG primer (5′-GTNGGNMGNGARAARGARYTNWSNATHCAYTTYGTNCC) was based on the sequence of the N-terminal peptide (VGREKELSIHFVPGSNELV), and the reverse 3′ DEG primer (5′-GTYTGYTCRTTNCCNSWCCARTGRAANGTNCCYTT) was based on the sequence of an internal peptide (LDPSIKGTFHWSGNEQT). Total RNA was extracted from the human T cell leukemia lines, Jurkat (ATCC-8163), or MOLT4 (ATCC-1582) using RNazol B (Tel-Test, Inc.). The RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using 25 units of avian myeloblastoma virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), oligo(dT)15(Promega), and 1 mm dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA was amplified using Taq DNA polymerase and the 5′ DEG and 3′ DEG primers. After 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 48 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, a 765-bp PCR product was generated. The amplified PCR product was purified from agarose gel using QIAquick gel extraction spin columns (Qiagen), ligated into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), and used to transform E. coli strain JM109 (Promega). Positive clones were selected on LB agar (Difco) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 40 μg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside), and 100 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (all chemicals were from Sigma). Plasmid DNA was purified from positive clones and checked by restriction digestion with EcoRI (Promega) to verify the presence of the cloned PCR product. The cloned DNA was sequenced using the fmol cycle sequencing system (Promega). Clone 1, which contained sequences matching both degenerate primers, as well as sequences that encode the remaining amino acid sequence in the N-terminal and internal β subunit peptides, was selected for further sequencing (see Fig. 1). Based on the sequence of Clone 1, nondegenerate primers were synthesized. Because Clone 1 was a partial sequence, the RACE methodology was employed to obtain overlapping 5′ and 3′ clones from human Jurkat and MOLT4 cell cDNAs. The missing 5′ sequence of the β subunit cDNA was obtained by 5′ RACE technique. Marathon Ready MOLT4 cDNA (CLONTECH) was amplified using Marathon Ready primer AP1 and a 3′ MAT II β subunit-specific (3′β) primer (5′-CATTCTCTTCTCTGCTAGCTGCC). The 776-bp PCR product was purified using QIAquick gel purification spin columns (Qiagen) and subjected to nested PCR using the AP1 primer and another β subunit-specific (3′β2) primer (5′-CTCTCTGTAAGGTGGATTTGT). The 508-bp nested PCR product was purified and cloned, and 10 clones were sequenced as described above. The sequence provided the putative ATG initiation signal and verified the previous sequence obtained with the degenerate primers. Clone 2, which represents the consensus sequence, was selected for further studies. To obtain the DNA sequence that encodes the C-terminal end of the β-subunit, we utilized 3′ RACE technique. RNA from Jurkat cells was reverse transcribed into cDNA as described above, except that a T-tailed primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACT17) was used in place of oligo(dT)15. The cDNA was amplified using the 5′ MAT II β subunit-specific forward (5′β) primer (5′-CTGTCGGCTGGTGGAGGAGGAA), and a 3′-primer identical to the primer used to make the cDNA, but lacking the T tail. The resulting 981-bp PCR product was subjected to a nested PCR reaction using a 5′β2 forward primer complementary to the internal region of the cloned DNA (5′-GCAACAAGTCAGCAAACATGG). A 433-bp PCR product was generated, ligated into the pGEM T-easy vector, and used to transformE. coli strain JM109. Positive clones were selected as described above, and the cloned DNA was sequenced using Thermo-Sequence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the Visible Genetics cycle sequencing system utilizing fluorescent Cy5 labeled M13-forward and M13-reverse primers. A total of 10 clones were sequenced to verify the in frame sequence from base 765 to base 1005, the last base in the stop codon (TAG). Clone 3 was selected for further studies (Fig.1). The cDNA prepared from resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) total RNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and the MAT II β 5′ subunit-specific primer, 5′ βr (5′-CGAGCTCATGGTGGGGAGGGAGAAAGAACTGT) and 3′ subunit-specific primer, 3′ βr (5′-CCCAAGCTTAACCCAACACAAATAAACTAATGA). For cloning purposes, the 5′ primer contained a SacI restriction site, and the 3′ primer had a HindIII site. The PCR product was purified using QIAquick gel extraction (Qiagen) as described above. Using 200 nm dATP and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), A-overhangs were added to the purified PCR product in a reaction carried out at 72 °C for 2 h. Following cleanup of the modified PCR product, the product was ligated into the pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega) and subsequently used to transform E. colistrain JM109. Ten positive clones were fully sequenced using the fmol cycle sequencing system (Promega) to rule out any possible base substitutions, and one representative clone, Clone 4, which represented the full-length β subunit cDNA, was used for further studies. The sequence of the ORF was identical for cDNA representing RNA from Jurkat cells, MOLT4 cells, and normal human PBMC. The MAT II β cDNA was excised from the pGEM T-easy vector using SacI and HindIII and purified. Expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen), which is designed to express proteins containing a His6 tag at the N-terminal was used. The vector was linearized by digestion with the restriction enzymesSacI and HindIII for 1 h at 37 °C, then purified from an agarose gel, and incubated at 37 °C with 5 units of alkaline phosphatase (Promega) to enhance the efficiency of ligation.SacI- and HindIII-digested Clone 4 was directionally cloned into unique SacI and HindIII sites in the multiple cloning site of the pQE-30 vector. Following ligation of the MAT II β cDNA into the prepared pQE-30 vector, the ligated vector was used to transform E. coli expression strain M15 (Qiagen). Cursory sequencing of 20 positive clones was carried out using the fmol cycle sequencing system (Promega), and the clones were verified for proper frame and orientation of the MAT II β cDNA. A representative clone, Clone 5, was inoculated into LB broth containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was incubated, with shaking, at 37 °C until anA 600 of 0.5–0.7 was reached, and then isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was allowed to incubate for an additional 4 h under the same conditions. Bacterial pellets were disrupted using sonication and then analyzed via Western blot and MAT II β-specific polyclonal antibodies that were generated to the two MAT II β peptides (29.De La Rosa J.

The MAT II β expression clone, Clone 5, was inoculated into 1 liter of LB broth containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin and then incubated with shaking at 37 °C until an A 600of 0.5–0.7 was reached. isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was allowed to incubate for an additional 4 h under the same conditions. Initial attempts to purify His-tagged MAT II β subunit under native conditions via sonication and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resulted in a complex of theE. coli MAT α subunit and the recombinant human β subunit. Therefore, subsequent purification of MAT II β away from the endogenous E. coli MAT α was performed by two methods. The first involved purification of the His-tagged protein under denaturing conditions of 8 m urea, and the second involved separation of SDS-PAGE and elution of the β subunit protein from the gel. To purify recombinant MAT II β protein under denaturing conditions, the cell pellet was lysed at room temperature by stirring the pellet in a buffered solution containing 8 m urea, pH 8.0 (denaturing conditions). Once the solution became translucent, the cellular debris were removed by centrifugation. The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) to capture the His-tagged protein. The column was washed with several volumes of buffered 8 m urea, pH 6.3, until aA 280 of 0.001–0.005 is reached. Elution of the recombinant MAT II β (rMAT II β) was carried out using buffered 8m urea, pH 5.9 and 4.5. The eluted protein was extensively dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then concentrated and analyzed by Western blots and silver-stained SDS-PAGE for determination of size and purity. The pure recombinant human MAT II β subunit protein was used to immunize rabbits and to generate polyclonal antibodies as detailed below. In some experiments, the nickel-agarose purified proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by impregnation in cold 300 mm KCl, and the band corresponding to the 38–39-kDa protein was excised, and the protein was electroeluted from the gel into Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8, dialyzed against 10 mmammonium bicarbonate and then lyophilized. The lyophilized protein was reconstituted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and analyzed by Western blotting and silver staining for size and purity. The purified β subunit protein was also analyzed for functional activity in MAT assays containing E. coli MAT α or recombinant human MAT II α protein. The nickel-agarose and SDS-PAGE purified β subunit protein retained functional activity. Polyclonal antibodies were generated to the β subunit synthetic peptides (VGREKELSIHFVPGSNELV and LDPSIKGTFHWSGNEQT; Refs.29.De La Rosa J. LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol.

Both antibodies were generated in male New Zealand White rabbits (Myrtle's Rabbitry), weighing 5–6 lb. Prior to initial immunizations, a preimmune blood was drawn, and sera were used as a negative control in subsequent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer determinations and in Western blots. The two synthetic β subunit peptides were combined, emulsified in an equal volume of Freund's Adjuvant Complete (Sigma), and injected into rabbits. The purified rMAT II β subunit was similarly treated. Initial injections were made in three sites: each hindquarter and the back of the neck. Boosters were made every 2 weeks following the removal of 10 cc of blood from the ear vein for the determination of antibody titers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma) was used in all booster injections. Antibody titers were determined in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the rMAT II β protein diluted in a 50 mmNaHCO3 solution, pH 9.6, and incubated overnight at 37 °C in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer plates. Following a wash with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween (PBS-T), the wells were blocked for 30 min at 37 °C with a solution containing 1× PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin (1% BSA-PBS). After washing, serial dilutions of rabbit antiserum in 1% BSA-PBS were added to wells containing the bound rMAT II β protein and incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Following a wash with 1× PBS, secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit/horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA-PBS) was added to each well and then incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. The final wash was made with 1× PBS-T, followed by a wash with 1× PBS. Color reagent (5 mm 5-aminosalicylic acid, pH 6.0, and 10 μl/ml 0.5% H2O2) was added to each well and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Titers were determined by measuring absorbance at 478 nm with a cut-off of 0.1 over control wells containing preimmune serum. After the titers had reached a plateau (12–14 weeks), the final rabbit serum was collected. E. coli cell extracts containing recombinant MAT II β subunit or pure recombinant MAT II β subunit protein were diluted in loading buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol), heated in a boiling water bath for 4 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% total acrylamide, 2.7% bisacrylamide) as previously (29.De La Rosa J. LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10699-10704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electroblotting the proteins onto the nitrocellulose for 1 h at 25–30 V/cm, the blots were blocked overnight with 6% nonfat dry milk in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl). Following the removal of the blocking solution, the blot was washed in TBS and incubated with primary polyclonal anti-holoenzyme antisera (33.Kotb M. Geller A.M. Markham G.D. Kredich N.M.

The blots were developed with secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the luminol-chemiluminescence reagents (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (29.De La Rosa J. LeGros Jr., H.L. Geller A.M. Kotb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10699-10704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The processed blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film, and the autoradiograms were analyzed. For some experiments, the autoradiograms were scanned using a Howtek Scanmaster-3 scanner (Protein Data Base, Inc., Huntington Station, NY), and the intensity of the desired band was integrated and expressed in arbitrary units. MAT activity was assayed as described previously (22.Kotb M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3923-3930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.De La Rosa J. LeGros Jr., H.L.

The assay contained 2–200 μml-Met, 5 mm ATP in 50 mm TES buffer (2-[Tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]-1-ethanesulfonic acid), pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, and 4 mm dithiothreitol. Thel-Met concentration was varied as indicated in the kinetic analysis. One unit of MAT activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 nmol/ml AdoMet in 1 h. The lines were drawn by the computer for best fit. The K m was calculated from the computer-generated equation. The cloning strategy was based on the design of degenerate primers representing partial amino acid sequence of an N-terminal (19-mer) and an internal (17-mer) peptides of the trypsin digested β subunit protein, purified from human lymphocytes (29.De La Rosa J.

However, a single cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase activity was detected and purified from one such organism, Methanococcus jannaschii. The amino-terminal sequence of this protein corresponded to the predicted sequence of prolyl-tRNA synthetase. Biochemical and genetic analyses indicated that this archaeal form of prolyl-tRNA synthetase can synthesize both cysteinyl-tRNA(Cys) and prolyl-tRNA(Pro). The ability of one enzyme to provide two aminoacyl-tRNAs for protein synthesis raises questions about concepts of substrate specificity in protein synthesis and may provide insights into the evolutionary origins of this process."

Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The identification of physiological substrates can be of great utility in defining the biological function of PTPases. In addition, PTPases are also promising targets for new therapeutics directed against various cellular disorders and diseases (2.Zhang Z.-Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For example, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has been implicated as a negative regulator of cellular signaling mediated by the insulin receptor. Mice lacking functional PTP1B have been shown to exhibit increased sensitivity toward insulin and to be obesity-resistant, suggesting that synthetic PTP1B inhibitors could serve as potential anti-diabetes and anti-obesity drugs (3.Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.-C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). An assessment of PTPase substrate specificity should not only help to identify physiological substrates for PTPases, but may ultimately assist in the design of PTPase-specific inhibitors. The identity of the physiological substrates for most PTPases is currently unknown. In addition, because the physiological substrates for PTPases are tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, even if one knows the identity of the physiological substrate, it is still difficult to get sufficient quantities of site specifically and stoichiometrically tyrosine-phosphorylated protein molecules for detailed enzymological and biochemical studies. Thus, the current approach to probe PTPase substrate specificity has been to use synthetic phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P))-containing peptides that correspond to natural phosphorylation sites in proteins. It has been shown that PTPases display a range ofk cat/K m values for relatively short peptide substrates (4.Cho H. Ramer S.E. Itoh M. Winkler D.G. Kitas E. Bannwarth W. Burn P. Saito H. Walsh C.T.

In addition, thek cat/K m values for the peptides are orders of magnitude higher than that of Tyr(P) alone, suggesting that amino acids flanking the Tyr(P) contribute to high affinity binding. From these limited studies, it appears that efficient substrate recognition by PTPases requires the presence of amino acids on both sides of Tyr(P). However, because of the differences in sequence and size of the individual peptides examined, one cannot draw any definitive conclusions regarding the structural requirements for substrate recognition. Clearly, a more systematic and thorough approach, such as the use of peptide libraries, is needed for the elucidation of structural features that control substrate specificity for individual PTPases. Indeed, combinatorial peptide libraries have been useful in the determination of optimal amino acid sequence for protein kinase and SH2 domain recognition (12.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M.

Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). We describe herein a novel peptide-based library approach to assess PTPase substrate specificity. Peptides were synthesized on CLEAR amide resin (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) using a standard protocol for HBTU/HOBt/collidine activation of Fmoc/t-butyl-protected amino acid derivatives (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, KY). Side chains of Asn, Cys, Gln, and His were trityl-protected; Lys and Trp weretert-butyloxycarbonyl-protected; and Arg was protected with the Pbf group. The coupling reaction was performed in DMF for 1 h using a 3-fold excess of amino acid. The couplings became more difficult with increasing peptide length, and coupling times were extended to 2 h and multiple couplings were performed when necessary. Fmoc removal was performed with 22% piperidine in DMF. Phosphotyrosine was incorporated into the growing peptide chain as the prephosphorylated species Fmoc-Tyr(PO(OBzl)OH)-OH (where Bzl is benzyl) (Nova Biochem, San Diego, CA) by double coupling using 1.1 eq for the first coupling (overnight) and 0.5 eq for the second coupling (5 h). The NH2 terminus of the peptides was acetylated with 2.5% acetic anhydride, 5% DIPEA, in DMF for 15 min. Final cleavage and side chain deprotection was achieved with 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% TIS, 2.5% EDT, and 2.5% water for 2 h. Peptides containing Met, His, or Trp were deprotected with 80% trifluoroacetic acid, 10% dimethyl sulfide, 5% EDT, 4% TIS, and 1% water to prevent benzylation of these residues. The resin was removed by filtration, and the remaining trifluoroacetic acid solution concentrated under nitrogen flow. Dry diethyl ether was added and the precipitated peptides collected by centrifugation. The peptides were resuspended, washed twice with ether, and lyophilized from acetic acid. Certain peptide sequences showed contamination by (a) deletion of an alanine residue, (b) deletion of the NH2-terminal amino acid (defined position −4), (c) incomplete Fmoc removal after residue −3 or −4, (d) incomplete acetylation of residue −4. In particular, peptides containing amino acids with aliphatic, hydrophobic side chains, such as Val, Leu, and Ile in position +4, −3, or −4, respectively, were affected. Alanine-rich peptides are known to be difficult to synthesize due to aggregation, which prevents complete acylation and Fmoc removal. Trifluoroacetic acid is known to disrupt those aggregates, and we subsequently resynthesized these peptides using a modified synthesis protocol to allow washes with neat trifluoroacetic acid during peptide synthesis. These peptides were synthesized using the trifluoroacetic acid-stabile MBHA resin (Nova Biochem, San Diego, CA), and the first 7 amino acid were coupled using standard Fmoc chemistry as described above. Peptides not containing trifluoroacetic acid-sensitive side chain protection groups were then washed with neat trifluoroacetic acid twice before the next amino acid was coupled. The Fmoc group was removed with 30% piperidine/3% DBU in DMF. Complete NH2-terminal acetylation was ensured by coupling of acetylated alanine in position −4 or multiple acetylation with 5% acetic anhydride, 5% DIPEA in DMF. Peptides were deprotected and cleaved with 8% TFMSA in trifluoroacetic acid containing 12% thioanisole/EDT (2:1) for 10 min at 0 °C, followed by 30 min at room temperature. All peptides synthesized using this protocol were obtained in high purity (>80–95%). Peptides were analyzed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and analytical HPLC. The majority of peptides appeared basically as single peak during HPLC analysis, and the product content for all peptides was estimated from UV absorbance at 214 nm to be 85–99%. Impurities seen during HPLC analysis are most likely traces of remaining scavengers, because peptidic contaminations were not observed during MALDI mass spectral analysis. The recombinant PTP1B was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described (14.Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13420-13425Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The PTP1B-catalyzed hydrolysis of Tyr(P)-containing peptides was continuously monitored at 305 nm for the increase in tyrosine fluorescence with excitation at 280 nm (5.Zhang Z.-Y. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Maclean D. Roeske R. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). When [S] ≪K m, the Michaelis-Menten equation reduces to the following equation (Equation 1). v=kcatKm[E][S]Equation 1 Under this condition, the reaction is first order with respect to [S]. At a given enzyme concentration, the observed apparent first order rate constant is equal to (k cat/K m)[E]. The substrate specificity constantk cat/K m value is calculated by dividing the apparent first order rate constant by the enzyme concentration. Fluorometric determinations were performed on a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B fluorometer. The instrument was equipped with a water-jacketed cell holder, permitting maintenance of the reaction mixture at the desired temperature. The enzyme assays were conducted at 30 °C. The reaction mixture (1.0 ml) contained 1–10 μm peptide substrate in 50 mm3,3-dimethylglutarate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol with an ionic strength of 0.15 m (adjusted with NaCl). The reaction was initiated by addition of PTP1B at a final concentration in the range of 5–100 nm PTP1B. The data were analyzed using a nonlinear least squares regression program (KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software). At the outset, we felt it advantageous to develop an information rich library that would not only furnish a general assessment of PTPase substrate specificity, but provide detailed kinetic data for individual members of the library as well. Consequently, we employed a library based on the PTPase-catalyzed dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) peptides, rather than simple binding of the PTPase to a substrate mimic or binding of a catalytically inactive PTPase mutant to a Tyr(P) peptide. Unfortunately, classic combinatorial library methods do not readily lend themselves to detailed kinetic analyses, especially at the individual member level. We ruled out the one bead/one compound approach (15.Chen C.L. Strop P. Lebl M. Lam K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as well as the positional scanning method (16.Houghten R.A. Pinilla C. Blondelle S.E. Appel J.R. Dooley C.T. Cuervo J.H.

Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 221-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) due to difficulties associated with quantitatively measuring kinetic constants in either the solid state or on nonequimolar mixtures of Tyr(P) peptides (18.Boutin J.A. Gesson I. Henlin J.M. Bertin S. Lambert P.H. Volland J.P. Fauchere J.L. Mol. Divers. 1997; 3: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although these combinatorial methods cannot be used to assess the substrate efficacy of individual library members, both approaches generate a large number of peptides and therefore furnish a comprehensive appraisal of the diversity space associated with the substrate binding pocket on the target enzyme(s). We have demonstrated that, in addition to peptides, PTPases catalyze the dephosphorylation of a variety of simple aromatic and aliphatic monophosphate esters (19.Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7868-7872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that thek cat/K m values for Tyr(P) peptides are orders of magnitude higher than that of Tyr(P) alone, suggesting that amino acids flanking the Tyr(P) contribute to high affinity binding (5.Zhang Z.-Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6994-7002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of a PTP1B-Tyr(P) peptide (21.Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), we predicted (and have confirmed) that a peptide composed of 8 Ala residues and a single central Tyr(P) would be recognized as a substrate by PTP1B. The classic “alanine scan” is used to probe (peptide ligand)/protein interactions by successively replacing each individual amino acid of the peptide ligand with an alanine (22.Montigiani S. Neri G. Neri D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The inverse alanine scanning method illustrated in Fig.1 separately and sequentially replaces each alanine residue with the other 19 standard amino acids. The advantages associated with a library of pure compounds include the ability to obtain detailed kinetic data for each individual library member and that, because the synthesis “history” of each library member is known, structural deconvolution of lead substrates is not necessary. However, libraries synthesized in parallel are often deemed to have the disadvantage of low relative structural diversity. To probe 8 positions around Tyr(P), a large number of peptides (208= 2.56 × 1010) would have to be synthesized by the classic combinatorial methods. In contrast, the inverse alanine scanning approach dramatically reduces this number to only 8 × 19 + 1 = 153 peptides, while retaining molecular diversity. Peptides were manually synthesized using a teflon block designed to accommodate the simultaneous preparation of 20 peptides at a time. An Fmoc-based synthesis protocol was employed, and the phosphorylated tyrosine was utilized during solid phase peptide synthesis (see “Experimental Procedures”). All members of the inverse alanine scan library were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. No significant contamination was detected and all peptides were used in the subsequent assay without further purification. The PTPase activity assay was based on increased tyrosine fluorescence following dephosphorylation (5.Zhang Z.-Y. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Maclean D. Roeske R. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thek cat/K m value, a measure of substrate specificity, was directly calculated from the reaction progress curve (see “Experimental Procedures”). The k cat/K m values for all 153 peptides ranged over 2 orders of magnitude and changed significantly for different substitutions within a single position. The results of the inverse alanine scanning of the entire peptide library for PTP1B are shown in Fig. 2. An examination of the scanning data revealed a number of factors that control the substrate specificity of PTP1B. Noteworthy features of PTP1B's substrate specificity include: the salutary effect of acidic residues at most sites and the fact that the incorporation of a Phe residue at position −1 furnishes the single most dramatic enhancement in substrate efficacy. The preference for acidic residues at positions NH2-terminal to Tyr(P) is consistent with results from previous analysis of Tyr(P)-containing peptides corresponding toin vivo phosphorylation sites (6.Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. McNamara D. Dobrusin E.M. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4446-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 7.Hippen K.L. Jakes S.

Ruzza P. Borin G. Calderan A. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A preference for aromatic residues at the −1 position was also noted in affinity selections from targeted peptide libraries containing nonhydrolyzable Tyr(P) mimics phosphonodifluoromethyl phenylalanine or malonyltyrosine using the epidermal growth factor receptor peptide DADEpYL as a template (23.Huyer G. Kelly J. Moffat J. Zamboni R. Jia Z. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24.Pellegrini M.C. Liang H. Mandiyan S. Wang K. Yuryev A. Vlattas I. Sytwu T. Li Y.-C. Wennogle L.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15598-15606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The excellent agreement between the current results and previous studies at the −1 position validate the inverse alanine scanning approach. In addition, the results outlined in Fig. 2 have revealed an array of surprising and heretofore unknown aspects of PTP1B specificity. First, in addition to acidic and aromatic residues, PTP1B is able to accommodate a host of structurally diverse residues including Leu, Ile, Val, Cys, and Thr at the −1 position. These results suggest that the −1 binding pocket possesses a remarkable degree of flexibility such that residues with drastically different structures can be accommodated. In short, the simple notion that PTP1B has a specific, and therefore limited, preference for either aromatic or acidic residues at the −1 position is decidedly incorrect. Second, the presence of either Lys or Arg at all positions has deleterious consequences in terms of hydrolytic efficacy. Third, PTP1B exhibits a surprising preference for the two sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and cysteine, at the +1 position and a marked aversion for Pro at this site. Finally, this study provides the first evidence that PTP1B substrate recognition extends to specific residues well beyond the +1 position. A strong preference for acidic residues is observed for position +2 and a strong preference for aromatic residues is evident for position +3. Inverse alanine scanning treats the binding contribution of each residue as independent of adjacent amino acids. To test the validity of this assumption, we synthesized a peptide corresponding to the consensus sequence, as well as a number of peptides where certain positions of the consensus peptide were substituted by “undesirable” amino acids (Table I). The consensus peptide, Ac-ELEFpYMDYE-NH2, is one of the best peptide substrates ever reported for PTP1B, exhibiting ak cat/K m value of 2.2 × 107m−1 s−1 at pH 7.0 (I = 0.15 m) and 30 °C. Substitution of Phe at the −1 position with a Lys results in 3-fold decrease ink cat/K m, whereas replacement of Met at the +1 position by a Pro leads to 16-fold reduction ink cat/K m. If subsites −1 and +1 independently interact with the enzyme, one would predict a 48-fold decrease in k cat/K m for the doubly substituted consensus peptide. Indeed, this is precisely what we observed (Table I). These results are consistent with the crystal structure of a PTP1B-Tyr(P) peptide complex (21.Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), in which the bound peptide lies in an extended conformation without any interactions between side chains of the peptide itself. Finally, Ac-KKKKpYPKKK-NH2, which was predicted to be the worst substrate based on the scanning results, is resistant to PTP1B-catalyzed hydrolysis.Table IKinetic constants for the consensus peptide and its substituted variantsSubstratek cat/K m× 10 −7 m −1 s −1Ac-ELEFpYMDYE-NH22.2 ± 0.05Ac-ELEKpYMDYE-NH20.70 ± 0.01Ac-ELEFpYPDYE-NH20.14 ± 0.004Ac-ELEKpYPDYE-NH20.050 ± 0.0002Ac-KKKKpYPKKK-NH2No reaction Open table in a new tab In summary, we have developed a novel combinatorial approach to identify consensus sequence motifs for PTPases. Inverse alanine scanning offers several advantages over classical combinatorial library methods. Most notable is the use of a small number of peptides of defined purity, rather than complex mixtures, to interrogate structural diversity space. Consequently, explicit kinetic data can be acquired for all library members, thereby furnishing general specificity trends in the context of rigorous kinetic information. The library data reported herein has revealed an array of heretofore unknown features of the substrate specificity of PTP1B, including clear preferences and aversions to specific residues at sites both adjacent to and noncontiguous with the hydrolyzable Tyr(P) moiety. These data have allowed us to prepare a potent peptide-based substrate for this enzyme as well as the first example of a Tyr(P)-containing peptide that fails to serve as a PTP1B substrate. We anticipate that the subsequent analysis of other members of the large PTPase family, as well as other enzymes that catalyze a variety of post-translational modifications, should likewise furnish consensus sequence motifs."

In the present work, the four Phe residues of IF2 C (positions 531, 599, 657, and 721) were replaced with Trp, yielding four variant proteins having intrinsic fluorescence markers in different positions of the molecule. Comparison of the circular dichroism and Trp fluorescence changes induced by increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride demonstrated that IF2 C indeed consists of two subdomains: the more stable N-terminal (IF2 C-1) subdomain containing Trp-599, and the less stable C-terminal (IF2 C-2) subdomain containing Trp-721. Isolated subdomain IF2 C-2, which consists of just 110 amino acids (from Glu-632 to Ala-741), was found to bind fMet-tRNA with the same specificity and affinity as native IF2 or IF2 C-domain. Trimming IF2 C-2 from both N and C termini demonstrated that the minimal fragment still capable of fMet-binding consists of 90 amino acids. IF2 C-2 was further characterized by circular dichroism; by urea-, guanidine hydrochloride-, and temperature-induced unfolding; and by differential scanning calorimetry. The results indicate that IF2 C-2 is a globular molecule containing predominantly β structures (25% antiparallel and 8% parallel β strands) and turns (19%) whose structural properties are not grossly affected by the presence or absence of the N-terminal subdomain IF2 C-1.

To accomplish this function, IF2 interacts with both 30 and 50 S ribosomal subunits and with the initiator tRNA. The latter is one of the most important interactions in the pathway of translation initiation, playing an essential role in the selection of mRNA initiation sites. The specificity of fMet-tRNA recognition by IF2 rests mainly on the presence of the blocked αNH2 group of methionine, a typically eubacterial feature (2.Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L.

The active site of IF2 involved in the interaction with the 50 S ribosomal subunits is localized, together with the GTP/GDP binding site, in the central domain (G-domain) of the molecule (40 kDa), which is related to the family of GTP/GDP-binding proteins (see Refs. 5.Cenatiempo Y.

The 24.5-kDa C-terminal domain (IF2 C) contains the molecular determinants for the recognition and binding of fMet-tRNA (8.Gualerzi C.O. Severini M. Spurio R. La Teana A. Pon C.L. J. Biol.

This C-domain, obtained as a recombinant protein by genetic manipulation ofB. stearothermophilus infB, has been further characterized spectroscopically. Thermal and GdnHCl-induced unfolding carried out in this study indicated that IF2 C unfolds in a stepwise process via a stable intermediate, suggesting that this domain may consist of two subdomains (10.Misselwitz R. Welfle K. Krafft C. Gualerzi C.O. Welfle H. Biochemistry. 1997; 6: 3170-3178Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To verify this hypothesis and possibly characterize the subdomains with respect to the primary sequence of IF2 C, in the present study we have introduced intrinsic fluorescence markers at specific sites of the molecule by replacing with Trp residues the four fairly regularly spaced Phe residues of IF2 C; after verifying that the variants were structurally and functionally comparable to the wild type molecule, the fluorescence and CD changes occurring during the unfolding of the four variant proteins were compared. The results demonstrated that IF2 C consists of two subdomains, IF2 C-1 and IF2 C-2, corresponding to roughly the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the domain molecule, respectively. Isolated IF2 C-2, which contains the last 110 amino acids of IF2, was further characterized structurally and functionally. IF2 C-2 was found to be folded like a stable protein and to contain all the molecular determinants necessary and sufficient for the specific recognition and binding of fMet-tRNA.

The mutagenized EcoRI-HindIII fragments were subsequently recloned in pXP401C, and the corresponding variant proteins were hyperexpressed and purified as described previously for IF2 C (9.Spurio R.

As seen from Table I, this procedure resulted in DNA fragments encoding for a total of 136 and 114 residues in the case of IF2 C-1 and IF2 C-2, respectively.

Upon growth at 30 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (60 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) to an A 600 of about 0.9, overexpression of IF2 C-2 was obtained following 20 min of induction at 42 °C and further incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in Buffer I, and rapidly frozen at −80 °C. Approximately 30 g of cells, resuspended in Buffer I supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm) and DNase I (2.5 μg/g of cells), were sonicated in an ice bath. The supernatant resulting after centrifugation for 1 h at 30,000 ×g was diluted 10 times with Buffer II and loaded onto a phosphocellulose (Whatman P-11) column (30 ml of bed volume) equilibrated with Buffer II containing 20 mmNH4Cl. Subdomain IF2 C-2, recovered in the flow-through, was loaded directly onto a DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE52) column (120 ml of bed volume) equilibrated with Buffer II containing 20 mmNH4Cl. After washing with equilibration buffer (4 bed volumes), elution was performed with a linear NH4Cl gradient (20–150 mm) in Buffer II. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, the fractions containing IF2 C-2 were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration on Amicon YM1 membrane. Further purification was obtained subjecting 5-ml aliquots of IF2 C-2 to gel filtration (2 ml/min) at room temperature on Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer III. After concentration by Amicon ultrafiltration IF2 C-2, which at this stage was judged to be >95% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, was stored at −80 °C. Prior to some experiments, IF2 C-2 was subjected to an additional cycle of purification, after which it was judged to be homogeneous by: (a) analytical gel filtration performed at 20 °C on a calibrated Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) applying protein samples (≅1 mg·ml−1) in Buffer IV and (b) by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The latter method sometimes showed the presence of a faster moving band whose N-terminal amino acid sequence indicated that it resulted from the specific cleavage of the acid-sensitive Asp-640–Pro-641 bond, which is significantly more labile in IF2 C-2 compared with IF2 C, indicating an increased accessibility of this bond in the subdomain compared with the whole IF2 C. In agreement with this interpretation, site-directed deletion of Pro-641 resulted in a much more stable protein. Overall, the yield was estimated to be about 4 mg·g−1 of cells. Before spectroscopic and microcalorimetric measurements, the proteins were subjected to gel filtration in Buffer IV on a Superose 12 HR10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The peak fractions were pooled and exhaustively dialyzed against Buffer IV, Buffer V, or Buffer IV containing GdnHCl at various concentrations. For Raman measurements, the protein solutions were concentrated to about 20 mg·ml−1 using Microcon tubes (Amicon) with 10-kDa cutoff. Protein concentrations were determined from the A 276 nm, assuming absorption coefficients of 0.65 ml·mg−1 and 0.69 ml·mg−1 for IF2 C mutants and IF2 C-2, respectively, calculated (12.Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) from the amino acid composition, with seven Tyr and one Trp residue in the case of the IF2 C mutants, and with just six Tyr residues in the case of IF2 C-2. CD measurements were performed at 25 °C with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermostated cell holder and a temperature control system (Neslab) as described (13.Misselwitz R. Hausdorf G. Welfle K. Höhne W.E. Welfle H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1250: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mean residue ellipticities [Θ] were calculated using mean residue masses of 110.3 and 113.1 Da for IF2 C Phe → Trp mutants and IF2 C-2, respectively. Far-UV CD spectra were measured in a 0.010-cm or 0.10-cm cuvette at protein concentrations of 0.80 and 0.080 mg·ml−1, respectively. CD spectra in the near-UV region were recorded in a 1.0-cm cell at protein concentrations of about 2.0 mg·ml−1. Thermal unfolding of IF2 C-2 in Buffer IV in the presence of various guanidine hydrochloride concentrations was analyzed measuring the ellipticity at 218 nm using a heating rate of 20 °C/h. The secondary structure content was calculated from the far-ultraviolet CD spectra using the variable selection method (program VARSLC1) starting with a set of 33 reference proteins (14.Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Measurements were carried out at 25 °C with 5-nm monochromator bandwidths for both the excitation and emission using a Shimadzu RF-5001PC fluorimeter. Fluorescence intensities were measured on samples absorbing <0.1 at the excitation wavelength, corrected for buffer and denaturing agent contributions, and normalized with respect to the protein concentration and the Raman band of water, which was used as an internal intensity standard. Quenching with KI was performed at 25 °C in Buffer IV using NaCl to maintain a constant ionic strength at 1.375 m. For each KI concentration, separate samples were prepared by mixing the protein solution with appropriate aliquots of 4 m KI (containing 1 mm Na2S2O3 to inhibit the formation of I3−) and 4m NaCl. Raman spectra were measured with a T64000 Raman spectrometer (Jobin-Yvon, France) equipped with an Innova 90-5 argon ion laser (Coherent). For excitation the 488-nm line was used, the Rayleigh light scattering was removed with a Notch filter, and the Raman scattering was detected with a CCD detector. Protein solutions were measured at 23 °C in the macro chamber with a 90° setup and data analyzed with the software package Spectramax (Jobin-Yvon) supplemented by several in-house programs.

Measurements were performed with a precision scanning calorimeter DASM-1 (Pushchino, Russia) as described earlier (13.Misselwitz R. Hausdorf G. Welfle K. Höhne W.E. Welfle H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1250: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A heating rate of 1 K·min−1 was kept constant in all experiments. The IF2 C-2 samples were in Buffer IV without and with 0.45, 0.65, and 1.0m GdnHCl at protein concentrations in the range of 1–1.5 mg·ml−1. For data analysis and deconvolution, the Origin for DSC software package (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) was used, providing half transition temperatures Tm and enthalpy changes ΔHm . Heat capacity change ΔCp , entropy change ΔSm at Tm , and free energy change ΔG 25 at 25 °C were calculated according to standard equations (Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3). ΔCp=d(ΔH)/dTEquation 1 ΔSm=ΔHm/TmEquation 2 ΔG25(T)=ΔHm(1−T/Tm)+ΔCp[(T−Tm)+T ln (Tm/T)]Equation 3 Denaturant-dependent conformational transitions were monitored measuring changes of the fluorescence spectra and of the circular dichroism at 220 or 218 nm. Separate samples for each point were made with a protein concentration of 0.080 mg·ml−1. For refolding experiments. IF2 C mutants and IF2 C-2 were first unfolded by incubation in the presence of 7m GdnHCl for at least 6 h at room temperature and then refolded by addition of renaturation buffer. All solutions were incubated overnight at room temperature and were measured at 25 °C. Concentration of GdnHCl stock solution in Buffer IV was determined from refractive index measurements, and the fraction of unfolded protein was calculated as described by Pace and Scholtz (16.Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 299-321Google Scholar). Assuming “two-state” transitions of unfolding the free energy changes ΔG NI between native and intermediate state (N→I) and ΔG IU between intermediate and unfolded state (I→U) of IF2 C mutants, and the free energy change ΔG NU between native and unfolded state (N→U) of IF2 C-2 were calculated as described (10.Misselwitz R. Welfle K. Krafft C. Gualerzi C.O. Welfle H. Biochemistry. 1997; 6: 3170-3178Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The activity of intact IF2, of IF2 C (wild type and mutants), and of IF2 C-2 in binding fMet-tRNA was measured quantifying the protection conferred by these proteins on the initiator tRNA with respect to spontaneous hydrolysis occurring at alkaline pH (8.Gualerzi C.O.

Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (50 μl) in Buffer VI contained 22 μm f[35S]Met-tRNA and the indicated concentrations of the proteins to be tested. Samples (20 μl), withdrawn after 0 and 60 min of incubation at 37 °C, were spotted on Whatman 3MM paper discs for determination of the cold trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity. As mentioned in the Introduction, unfolding studies carried out onB. stearothermophilus IF2 C suggested that this domain may consist of two subdomains with different stability. To confirm this premise and possibly identify the regions of IF2 C corresponding to the two subdomains, we decided to compare the global CD changes occurring during IF2 C unfolding with the fluorescence changes induced by the same process originating from intrinsic fluorescence markers introduced at specific sites of the molecule. Considering that IF2 C contains no Trp residues and only four Phe residues fairly regularly spaced (positions 531, 599, 657, and 721), we replaced these four Phe residues with Trp, thus producing four variant proteins. The IF2 C F531W, IF2 C F599W, IF2 C F657W, and IF2 C F721W mutants, constructed, expressed in E. coli, and purified to >95% homogeneity (as described under “Experimental Procedures”), contain 222 amino acids corresponding to a calculated molecular mass of 24491 g·mol−1. They all have Ser (corresponding to Ser-520 of native IF2) at their N terminus and, like wt IF2 C (10.Misselwitz R. Welfle K. Krafft C. Gualerzi C.O. Welfle H. Biochemistry. 1997; 6: 3170-3178Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), behave as monomers on a Superose 12 column in Buffer IV. Aside from some minor differences detected in the spectra of IF2 C F599W and IF2 C F721W, their far-UV and near-UV CD spectra (data not shown) are almost superimposable on those of wt IF2 C (10.Misselwitz R. Welfle K. Krafft C. Gualerzi C.O. Welfle H. Biochemistry. 1997; 6: 3170-3178Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), indicating that they all have the same type of folding and secondary structure. Our results suggested, however, that the Trp residue in position 721 has a somewhat lower mobility and higher asymmetry compared with the Trp residues introduced in the other three positions. Similar indications are also given by Raman spectroscopy of the mutant proteins. Aside from the expected presence of the additional bands due to the Trp residues, the Raman spectra of the four mutant proteins (data not shown) are similar to that of wt IF2 C (10.Misselwitz R. Welfle K. Krafft C. Gualerzi C.O. Welfle H. Biochemistry. 1997; 6: 3170-3178Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The lack of significant spectral differences involving the amide I bands near 1667 cm−1 indicates conservation of the general protein fold in all IF2 C mutants. Furthermore, the identical intensity ratio of the Tyr doublet at 828 and 854 cm−1(I 854/I 828 = 1.83 ± 0.02) found for the mutants F531W, F599W, and F657W and for wt IF2 C indicates that in these proteins the Tyr residues have similar properties and are found in similar environments; the slightly higher ratio (1.92) found in the F721W mutant, on the other hand, indicates that the Tyr residues of this protein are in a slightly more hydrophilic environment and/or that one of them is involved in the formation of a strong H bond. The only biological activity characteristic of wt IF2 C is that of recognizing and binding fMet-tRNA with the same specificity and affinity as the complete IF2 molecule (9.Spurio R. Severini M. La Teana A. Canonaco A.M. Pawlik R.T. Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. Nierhaus K.H. Franceschi F. Subramanian A.R. Erdmann V.A. Wittmann-Liebold B. The Translational Apparatus: Structure, Function, Regulation. Plenum Press, New York1993: 241-252Crossref Google Scholar). Functional tests carried out with the four mutants demonstrated that, compared with wt IF2 C, IF2 C F531W and IF2 C F657W are fully active, IF2 C F721W slightly less active, and the F599W mutant ≅3-fold less active in initiator tRNA binding (data not shown). Taken together, the preliminary characterization of the four IF2 C mutants indicates that none of the four Phe residues of IF2 C plays an essential role in the recognition and binding of initiator tRNA and that, as expected from the conservative nature of the amino acid replacements, none of the individual Phe → Trp substitutions grossly alter the structure or function of IF2 C. Thus, we concluded that all these variants, including the F721W mutant, which exhibits some minor structural and functional anomalies, can be used as models to monitor the unfolding behavior of IF2 C. Since fluorescence changes accompanying the GdnHCl-induced unfolding of a protein depend on the individual properties of the tryptophan fluorophor(s), which in turn depend on the hydrophobicity of their environment, the tryptophan residues at positions 599 and 721 seemed to be the most suitable fluorescence markers to follow the process of protein unfolding. In fact, the emission maxima of both Trp-599 and Trp-721 (upon Trp excitation at 295 nm) were found to be blue-shifted (at 332 nm) compared with those of Trp-531 and Trp-657 (both at 348 nm) and KI quenching, quantified by Stern-Volmer plots (data not shown), was found to be in the order F657W > F531W > F599W > F721W, indicating that Trp-599 and Trp-721 are located in a more hydrophobic and less accessible environment than Trp-531 and Trp-657. As predicted, the emission maxima of the buried tryptophan residues (Trp-599 and Trp-721) undergo a red-shift (from 332 nm to about 350 nm) during GdnHCl-induced protein unfolding (Fig.1 A), while, under the same conditions, Trp-531 and Trp-657 undergo a large increase in fluorescence intensity (≅100%), which is accompanied by a negligible (≤2 nm) red-shift (Fig. 1 A). As seen in Fig. 1 A, when GdnHCl-induced unfolding was analyzed measuring changes of the fluorescence emission maxima, which monitor the environment of each tryptophan residue, a single transition was observed for both F599W and F721W IF2 C mutants. This is in contrast to the two-step transition observed with wt IF2 C (10.Misselwitz R. Welfle K. Krafft C. Gualerzi C.O. Welfle H. Biochemistry. 1997; 6: 3170-3178Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and with both F721W (Fig. 1 B) and F599W (Fig. 1 C) IF2 C variants when the same process was monitored by the ellipticity changes (at 220 nm), which stem from general modifications of the secondary structure. Comparison of the normalized CD (filled symbols) and fluorescence (open symbols) unfolding transition curves of IF2 C F721W (Fig. 1 B) and of IF2 C F599W (Fig. 1 C) clearly indicates that the transitions monitored by Trp-721 and Trp-599 correspond to the first and to the second transition monitored by the ellipticity changes, respectively. The same conclusion can be reached by comparison of the thermodynamic parameters of the transitions (ΔG H2O), the slope"

Protein phosphatase-1 (PP1),1 a major protein serine/threonine phosphatase, controls numerous physiological processes in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues (1.Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 2.DePaoli-Roach A.A. Park I.K. Cerovsky V. Csortos C. Durbin S.D. Kuntz M.J. Sitikov A. Tang P.M. Verin A. Zolnierowicz S. Adv.

Regulation of specific PP1 pools has been implicated in neuronal plasticity changes linked to simple forms of learning and memory. For example, PP1 bound to plasma membranes controls the serotonin-sensitive K+ channel that regulates neurotransmitter release from sensory neurons and short term sensitization of tail and siphon withdrawal reflexes in Aplysia californica (4.Endo S. Critz S.D. Byrne J.H. Shenolikar S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1833-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the mammalian brain, PP1 is concentrated in dendritic spines where it dephosphorylates phosphoproteins like CaMKII (5.Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J.

Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which PP1 is localized to specific neuronal compartments and the significance of PP1 localization for neuronal signaling remains largely unknown. Studies of cellular and molecular mechanisms that control PP1 activity in all eukaryotic cells have emphasized a recurrent regulatory paradigm, whereby the PP1 catalytic subunit is associated with distinct regulatory subunits that define its subcellular distribution and modify its biochemical properties. In this manner, the regulatory subunits dictate the diverse functions of PP1 in the eukaryotic cell (16.Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Biochemical isolation of PP1 complexes (17.Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol.

Parker L. Hawcroft G. Guo Y. Kaiser K. Morgan G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 395-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have identified more than 40 putative PP1-targeting subunits. Although the precise mechanisms regulating PP1 activity in the mammalian nervous system have not been fully investigated, a number of candidate PP1 regulators have been identified. Efforts to identify PP1 regulators using a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat brain cDNA library yielded spinophilin, a protein that is localized to dendritic spines (22.Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Physiological studies indicate that disrupting the PP1·spinophilin complex modifies ion gating by the AMPA receptor (12.Yan Z. Hsieh-Wilson L. Feng J. Tomizawa K. Allen P.B. Fienberg A.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), a known PP1 substrate (13.Wang L.-Y. Salter M.W. MacDonald J.F. Science. 1991; 253: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). PP1 was also immunoprecipitated from rat brain extracts with yotiao, a PKA-anchoring protein (11.Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D.C. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that yotiao, which also associates with the NR1A subunit of the NMDA receptor (11.Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D.C. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), assembles a PKA-PP1 signaling module that regulates synaptic transmission mediated by the NMDA receptor. These two examples emphasized the importance of PP1 targeting for neuronal signaling. In this study, we utilized affinity chromatography combined with a far Western assay to identify and isolate PP1-binding proteins in different subcellular compartments in the mammalian brain. A major 70-kDa PP1-binding protein seen in particulate fractions from cortex and hippocampus in rat, bovine, and human brain was extensively purified and identified by peptide sequencing as neurofilament light chain (NF-L), a component of the intermediate filament network that defines axonal caliber (23.Hirokawa N. Takeda S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of purified bovine neurofilaments and recombinant human NF-L established that NF-L possessed many, if not all, of the properties of a bona fidePP1-targeting subunit. The role of NF-L in PP1 targeting to neuronal membranes and cytoskeleton and its potential for regulating the dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins implicated in synaptic plasticity are discussed.

The sample was overlaid with a small volume of 0.25 m STM and centrifuged at 82,000 × g for 1 h. The interface was resuspended in 0.25 m STM and centrifuged at 1,500 ×g for 10 min. The final pellet (representing purified plasma membranes) was resuspended in 0.25 m STM and stored at −80 °C. PP1-binding proteins were identified by a far Western procedure (29.Jagiello I.

Protein samples, containing PP1 binding proteins, were separated by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 4% (w/v) skim milk dissolved in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl, and PP1-binding proteins were detected by incubating the membrane with digoxigenin-conjugated PP1α followed by an anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).

The transferred proteins were visualized with Amido Black (1 mg/ml in 5% acetic acid and 10% methanol) for approximately 1 min, washed with 5% acetic acid and 10% methanol, and then with several changes of water. The membrane was air-dried, and individual stained bands were excised and placed into microcentrifuge tubes. The membrane slice was washed 3 times with water and then methanol. CNBr (100 μl, 500 mg/ml in 70% formic acid) was added, and partial peptide digestion was performed for 90 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by removing the membrane and washing 3 times with water and once with methanol. The pieces were placed into an Applied Biosystems 494 automated sequenator. A single run of Edman sequencing (8–18 cycles of pulsed liquid chemistry) was carried out, and the mixed peptide sequences were sorted and matched to the available data bases with the FASTF or TFASTF algorithms. Native neurofilaments were prepared by combining two existing protocols (31.Scott D. Smith K.E. O'Brien B.J. Angelides K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10736-10747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32.Wible B.A. Smith K.E. Angelides K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bovine spinal cord was homogenized in 2 volumes of 1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The pellet was treated in 2 m urea at 4 °C for 1 h and recentrifuged at 100,000 ×g. The supernatant was adjusted to a final concentration of 6 m urea in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. The sample was then applied to a DEAE-cellulose column and the neurofilaments eluted with a gradient of 25–200 mm NaCl. Fractions containing neurofilaments, determined by their electrophoretic migration and immunoreactivity with anti-NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H antibodies, were pooled and dialyzed into 10 mmPIPES, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The neurofilament preparation was heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min to destroy endogenous kinase and phosphatase activity (32.Wible B.A. Smith K.E. Angelides K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. Protein phosphatase activity was assayed as described by Shenolikar and Ingebritsen (33.Shenolikar S. Ingebritsen T.S. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 102-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, using 20 μm32P-labeled phosphorylase a as substrate. The phosphatase was preincubated with potential regulators at 37 °C for 10 min prior to the addition of substrate. The assay was performed for 10 min at 37 °C. Reaction was stopped by addition of 200 μl of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 50 μl of BSA (10 mg/ml). 32P released into the supernatant (200 μl) was monitored by liquid scintillation counting. The assay was restricted to a maximum of 20% release of total phosphate to ensure linearity. Analysis of the 100,000 × g pellet and supernatant from rat hippocampus and cortex was undertaken using far Westerns (overlays) with digoxigenin-coupled human PP1α as ligand detected 10–12 polypeptides in both fractions. Essentially similar results were obtained by Strack and co-workers (34.Colbran R.J. Bass M.A. McNeill R.B. Bollen M. Zhao S. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using PP1γ1 as the ligand. Two polypeptides of apparent molecular mass of 70 and 140 kDa represented the major PP1-binding proteins in the particulate fraction from both hippocampus and cortex (Fig.1 A). By comparison, two closely migrating PP1-binding proteins of approximately 35 and 40 kDa represented the major polypeptides overlaid with the digoxigenin-conjugated PP1 in the soluble fraction or supernatants from both rat brain regions. Analysis of freshly isolated bovine and human brain hippocampus and cortex yielded essentially similar results (data not shown). However, in bovine brain cortex, the 70-kDa polypeptide was the most predominant PP1-binding protein in overlays of particulate and soluble fractions (Fig. 1 B). Plasma membranes represented a major subcellular component in the 100,000 × g pellet from bovine brain cortex. The particulate fraction from bovine cortex was extensively purified using a sucrose density gradient. The interface between 0.25 and 1.42m sucrose represented highly purified plasma membranes. PP1 overlay of plasma membranes indicated that the 70-kDa polypeptide was the major PP1-binding protein in this subcellular compartment (Fig.2). A significant portion (approximately 20%) of 70-kDa PP1-binding protein was extracted from membranes by buffers containing 0.5 m NaCl, often used to extract PP1 from particulate fractions (35.Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The remainder of the 70-kDa protein resisted extraction in buffers containing the non-ionic detergent, Triton X-100. Homogenization of this fraction in buffers containing 1% SDS solubilized the remaining 70-kDa PP1-binding protein. Affinity chromatography on the immobilized phosphatase inhibitor, microcystin-LR, has been used to isolate PP1 complexes from many different tissue extracts (17.Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, the 0.5 m NaCl extract of the neuronal plasma membranes was dialyzed and subjected to chromatography on microcystin-LR-Sepharose (Fig.3). All PP1-binding proteins present in the salt extract bound tightly to microcystin-LR-Sepharose and were not eluted by buffers containing either 0.1 or 0.5 m NaCl. However, all the PP1-binding proteins were quantitatively released in buffer containing 3 m sodium thiocyanate, which elutes all microcystin-LR-bound phosphatases (17.Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The eluted proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, freeze-dried, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoretic transfer to PVDF, the region of the membrane containing the 70-kDa PP1-binding peptide was excised and sequenced. Repeated failure to obtain an amino acid sequence indicated that the 70-kDa protein was blocked at its N terminus (30.Damer C.K. Partridge J. Pearson W.R. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24396-24405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, the peptide was partially digested with CNBr and subjected to mixed peptide sequencing (30.Damer C.K. Partridge J. Pearson W.R. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24396-24405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The three sequences identified the 70-kDa PP1-binding protein as bovine neurofilament-L (Table I). The 70-kDa PP1-binding protein in the 1% SDS extract was also sequenced following CNBr digestion on PVDF membrane. We obtained four peptide sequences that also identified this protein as bovine neurofilament-L (data not shown). The less abundant 140- and 190-kDa PP1-binding proteins that co-eluted with NF-L from microcystin-Sepharose were identified by microsequencing as the recently identified PP1-binding proteins, neurabin I (36.Nakanishi H.

Regions of identity between the observed sequence and that present in the proposed protein target (with GenBank™ number) are underlined. Immunoblotting the microcystin-LR-Sepharose eluate with anti-PP1c and anti-NF-L monoclonal antibodies established the presence of both PP1 catalytic subunit and NF-L (Fig. 3). NF-L exists in neurons as a triplet complex with NF-M and NF-H (38.Lee M.K. Xu Z. Wong P.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). These two proteins were also present in the eluate from microcystin-Sepharose as determined by immunoblotting with anti-NF-M and anti-NF-H antibodies (data not shown). This suggested that PP1 existed as a complex containing all three triplet proteins. The 100,000 × g supernatant also contained a major 70-kDa PP1-binding protein. To investigate whether this also represented NF-L, we purified this protein by fractionating the 100,000 × g supernatant with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate, followed by two sequential ion exchange chromatography steps on DEAE-cellulose (data not shown). The soluble 70-kDa PP1-binding protein was eluted from the final DEAE-cellulose column with a gradient of 0 to 1.0 m NaCl, and its elution was monitored using the PP1 far Western assay. The protein was then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, freeze-dried, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Following its transfer to PVDF membrane, the 70-kDa polypeptide was excised, digested with CNBr, and subjected to mixed peptide sequencing as described above. All four peptides were present in a single target protein in the data base that was not neurofilament-L. The four sequences totaled 44 amino acids that showed 86% sequence identity with the bovine heat-shock related protein, hsc70 (Table I). Earlier studies had shown that PP1 and PP2A were both associated with purified neurofilaments. However, the molecular basis for the association of these enzymes with the neuronal intermediate filament proteins was not determined (39.Saito T. Shima H. Osawa Y. Nagao M. Hemmings B.A. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7376-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 40.Strack S. Westphal R.S. Colbran R.J. Ebner F.F. Wadzinski B.E. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 49: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To establish PP1 binding to neurofilaments, we isolated bovine spinal cord neurofilaments and analyzed their binding to the PP1 catalytic subunit in the far Western assay. Purified neurofilaments contained the neurofilament triplet proteins, NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H, and GFAP, the glial fibrillary acidic protein (Fig.4 A). By using a range of protein concentrations, PP1 binding was demonstrated with NF-L (Fig.4 B). At the highest concentrations of neurofilaments analyzed, PP1 binding was also seen with GFAP. However, NF-L showed approximately 50–100-fold higher PP1 binding than GFAP, and no PP1 was bound to NF-M or NF-H. Immunoblotting with anti-PP1c antibodies showed that as purified, the bovine neurofilaments contained no PP1 catalytic subunit (Fig. 3) and failed to bind microcystin-LR-Sepharose (data not shown). This lent support to the idea that association of the triplet proteins with"

Northern analysis demonstrated that CYP2N1 transcripts are most abundant in liver and intestine, whereas CYP2N2 mRNAs are most abundant in heart and brain. CYP2N1 and CYP2N2 proteins were co-expressed with NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase in Sf9insect cells, and their ability to metabolize arachidonic acid and xenobiotic substrates was examined. Both CYP2N1 and CYP2N2 metabolize arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Epoxidation is highly regio- and enantioselective with preferential formation of (8R,9S)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (optical purities are 91 and 90% for CYP2N1 and CYP2N2, respectively) and (11R,12S)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (optical purities are 92 and 70% for CYP2N1 and CYP2N2, respectively). CYP2N1 and CYP2N2 also catalyze the formation of a variety of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids. Both P450s have benzphetamineN-demethylase activities but show minimal alkoxyresorufinO-dealkylase activities. To investigate factors affecting CYP2N expression in vivo, CYP2N transcripts were examined following starvation and/or treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate. Intestinal CYP2N1 mRNAs decrease in starved and/or phorbol ester-treated fish, whereas intestinal CYP2N2 transcripts decrease only following phorbol ester treatment. Interestingly, cardiac CYP2N2 expression decreases following phorbol ester treatment but increases following starvation. These results demonstrate that members of this novel P450 subfamily encode early vertebrate forms of arachidonic acid catalysts that are widely expressed and are regulated by environmental factors. Given the wealth of information on the functional role of P450-derived arachidonate metabolites in mammals, we postulate that CYP2N1 and CYP2N2 products have similar biological functions in early vertebrates.

The P450 enzymes catalyze the metabolism of a wide variety of xenobiotics and are responsible for the bioactivation of numerous endogenous compounds including steroids, bile acids, and fatty acids (1.Nelson D.R.

All vertebrate P450s require NADPH and NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase, which transports electrons from NADPH to the heme-thiolate protein. Since it was suggested in 1961 (3.Wakabayashi K. Shimazono N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 48: 615-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that ω-oxidation of fatty acids might occur via the mixed function oxidase system, growing attention has focused on the role of P450s in the metabolism of fatty acids. The observation that P450 inhibitors block arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and the formation of aggregation factors from arachidonic acid by platelet microsomal enzymes (4.Cinti D.L. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 73: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) first suggested that P450-derived eicosanoids may have important biological functions. Subsequent studies have described the diversity of arachidonate metabolites formed by P450s (5.Oliw E.H. Guengerich F.P. Oates J.A. J. Biol.

Products of P450-mediated metabolism of arachidonic acid include four regioisomeric epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (14,15-, 11,12-, 8,9-, and 5,6-EETs), six mid-chain cis-trans-conjugated dienols (5-, 8-, 9-, 11-, 12-, and 15-HETEs), and five ω-terminal hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (16-, 17-, 18-, 19- and 20-HETEs) (10.Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Estabrook R.W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The EETs can be hydrated to their corresponding vicinal diols (DHETs) by epoxide hydrolases (10.Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Estabrook R.W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In particular, the P450 epoxygenase reactions have been extensively investigated because the EETs are endogenous constituents of and have potent biological effects in numerous mammalian tissues (8.McGiff J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 31: 339-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 9.Fitzpatrick F.A. Murphy R.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 40: 229-241Google Scholar, 10.Capdevila J.H.

Most studies that have identified P450s involved in fatty acid metabolism have focused on mammalian systems, although some have identified arachidonic acid catalysts in birds (11.Gilday D. Gannon M. Yutzey K. Bader D. Rifkind A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33054-33059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Importantly, few studies have addressed P450-dependent arachidonic acid metabolism or the identity of the specific P450 arachidonate catalysts in other vertebrate groups. Knowledge of P450 functions in early vertebrates may be useful in unraveling the endogenous roles of these genes in mammals since critical functions are likely to be maintained throughout evolution. In particular, comparisons between early vertebrate and mammalian systems are necessary to address questions of functional conservation and divergence. Herein, we report the cDNA cloning of two novel P450s from the teleost Fundulus heteroclitus. 2The new sequences reported in this paper have been submitted to the Committee on Standardized Cytochrome P450 Nomenclature and have been designed CYP2N1 and CYP2N2. 2The new sequences reported in this paper have been submitted to the Committee on Standardized Cytochrome P450 Nomenclature and have been designed CYP2N1 and CYP2N2. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences encoded by these cDNAs with those of other P450s shows that the extent of similarity is limited; hence, these two enzymes represent a new P450 subfamily, the CYP2Ns. We also demonstrate that the recombinant CYP2N proteins are active arachidonic acid epoxygenases and hydroxylases, that CYP2N transcripts are abundantly expressed in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues including the heart, brain, and intestine, and that expression is regulated by environmental factors.

Oligo(dT)-primed Uni-ZAP cDNA libraries were constructed from F. heteroclitus liver and heart poly(A)+ mRNA using a Lamda ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A Fundulus λgt10 liver cDNA library was obtained from Dr. D. Crawford (University of Missouri, Kansas City, MO). Approximately 5 × 105phage from the λgt10 liver cDNA library were screened with two degenerate oligonucleotide probes end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP as described (12.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

The probe sequences were 5′-CTGCAGCTCGAGGAGCGVATYCAGGASGARGC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTCTAGATSACBGCVTCNGTGTAKGGCA-3′, with restriction enzyme sites at the 5′ ends. They correspond to amino acid residues 144–160 and 349–355 of rat CYP2A1, respectively. Where appropriate, codon usage tables for teleosts were used to eliminate degeneracies (16.Fitzgerald L.M. Rodrigues A. Smutzer G. Mol. Mar. Biol. Biotechnol. 1993; 2: 112-119PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridizations were done in 6× SSPE, 0.05× Blotto, and 20% formamide at 42 °C overnight. Approximately 90 positive clones were identified, 35 of which were rescued into pBluescript SK(+) and the inserts cycle sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (17.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar) using DNA polymerase (Epicentre Technologies) and infrared labeled primers (LI-COR, Inc.). Approximately 6 × 105phage from each of the Uni-ZAP liver and heart cDNA libraries were screened with cDNA fragments isolated from the λgt10 library. These fragments were random primer-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Rediprime (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were done in 6× SSPE, 0.05× Blotto, and 50% (liver) or 20% (heart) formamide at 42 °C overnight. Positive clones were isolated from each library, rescued into pBluescript SK(+), and sequenced as above. Seven clones isolated from the liver Uni-ZAP library contained identical sequences that were most similar to CYP2 family P450s. One of these clones (clone LMO-64, 2.2 kb) was completely sequenced using oligonucleotide primers that spanned the entire length of the sense and antisense cDNA strands. Similarly, four clones isolated from the heart Uni-ZAP library contained identical sequences that shared some homology with CYP2 family P450s. One of these clones (clone HMO-11, 2.4 kb) was completely sequenced as described above. Phylogenetic comparisons were done with a representative member of each CYP2 subfamily using the majority of the sequence (>94%) or using only the six putative substrate recognition sites. The topologies of the trees were constructed using the minimum evolution criterion or Neighbor-joining Algorithm (18.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). Bootstrap analysis was performed using the method of Felsenstein (19.Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to assess relative confidence in the topologies. Clustal alignments were done using GCG software (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). Conserved sequences were analyzed by searching GenBankTM, EMBL, and SwissProt data bases. The proteins encoded by the LMO-64 (CYP2N1) and HMO-11 (CYP2N2) cDNAs were co-expressed with human CYPOR inSf9 insect cells using the pAcUW51-CYPOR shuttle vector (kindly provided by Dr. Cosette Serabjit-Singh, Glaxo Wellcome) (20.Lee C. Kadwell S.H. Kost T.A. Serabjit-Singh C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and the BaculoGold Baculovirus Expression System (PharMingen). The respective cDNAs were subcloned into the BamHI site in the polylinker region of pAcUW51-CYPOR, and the identity and orientation of the resulting expression vectors (pAcUW51-CYPOR-CYP2N1 and pAcUW51-CYPOR-CYP2N2) were confirmed by sequence analysis and restriction enzyme digestion. In both constructs, the p10 promoter controlled expression of CYPOR and the polyhedrin promoter independently controlled expression of the CYP2Ns. CulturedSf9 insect cells were then co-transfected with each of the expression vectors and linearized wild-type BaculoGold viral DNA in a CaCl2 solution as described (20.Lee C. Kadwell S.H. Kost T.A. Serabjit-Singh C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21.Wu S. Weina C. Murphy E. Gabel S. Tomer K.B. Foley J. Steenbergen C. Falck J.R. Moomaw C.R. Zeldin D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12551-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Recombinant viruses were purified, and the presence of the CYP2N1 and CYP2N2 cDNAs was corroborated by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cultured Sf9 cells, grown in spinner flasks at a density of 1.5–2.0 × 106 cells/ml, were infected with high titer viral stocks in the presence of 5 μmhemin or 100 μm δ-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride. Cells co-expressing recombinant CYP2N1 and CYPOR or recombinant CYP2N2 and CYPOR were harvested 72 h after infection, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and used to prepare microsomal fractions by differential centrifugation at 4 °C as described previously (22.Zeldin D.C. Plitman J.D. Kobayashi J. Miller R.F. Snapper J.R. Falck J.R. Szarek J.L. Philpot R.M. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2150-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The P450 content of the microsomes was determined spectrally according to the method of Omura and Sato (23.Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a Shimadzu UV-3000 dual wavelength/double-beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific, Columbia, MD). Microsomes were resuspended to a final reaction volume (0.2–0.5 ml) in 0.05 m Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 m KCl, 0.01 mMgCl2, 8 mm sodium isocitrate, and 0.5 IU of isocitrate dehydrogenase/ml. Reactions were equilibrated at 37 °C with constant mixing for 2 min before the addition of [1-14C]arachidonic acid (25–55 μCi/μmol, 50–100 μm final concentration). Reactions were initiated by the addition of NADPH (1 mm final concentration) and continued at 37 °C with constant mixing. After 30–60 min, lipid-soluble products were extracted into ethyl ether, dried under a nitrogen stream, resolved by reverse-phase HPLC, and quantified by on-line liquid scintillation using a Radiomatic Flo-One β-detector (Radiomatic Instruments, Tampa, FL) as described (24.Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Products were identified by comparing their reverse- and normal-phase HPLC properties with those of authentic standards and by GC/MS (24.Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25.Clare R.A. Huang S. Doig M.V. Gibson G.G. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 562: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26.Falck J.R. Lumin S. Blair I. Dishman E. Martin M.V. Waxman D.J. Guengerich F.P. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10244-10249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For rate determinations, the reactions were terminated after only 5–10 min to ensure that the quantitative assessment of the rates of product formation accurately reflect initial rates. For chiral analysis, the EETs were collected batchwise from the HPLC eluent, derivatized to the corresponding EET-PFB or EET-methyl esters, purified by normal-phase HPLC, resolved into the corresponding antipodes by chiral-phase HPLC, and quantified by liquid scintillation as described previously (24.Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,27.Hammonds T.D. Blair I. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Uninfected Sf9 insect cell microsomes, insect cell microsomes expressing CYPOR but not P450, and reactions without the addition of NADPH were used as negative controls. BenzphetamineN-demethylation activities of the recombinant P450s were assessed using the same microsomal preparations used for arachidonic acid assays under identical reaction conditions but employing benzphetamine (2 mm, final concentration) as the substrate. The reaction product (formaldehyde) was quantified according to the method of Nash (28.Nash T. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). Similarly, the activities of recombinant CYP2N1 and CYP2N2 toward ethoxyresorufin, benzyloxyresorufin, methoxyresorufin, and pentoxyresorufin were assessed by quantifying the reaction product, resorufin, using a cytofluor as described previously (29.Hahn M.E. Lamb T.M. Schultz M.E. Smolowitz R.M. Stegeman J.J. Aquat. Toxicol. 1993; 26: 185-208Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For the benzphetamine assays, incubations containing microsomes but without NADPH gave background formaldehyde production rates that were always less than 5% of formaldehyde production rates during incubations with NADPH. The low background values were subtracted from the total to obtain the reported rates. Other negative controls included incubations with uninfected Sf9 cell microsomes (i.e. microsomes that did not contain P450) and incubations with boiled microsomes in which the P450 was rendered inactive. In both cases, formaldehyde production rates were low to undetectable. Total RNA was prepared fromFundulus testes, ovaries, eye, heart, gill, kidney, muscle, brain, spleen, intestine (mid-gut), and liver using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test B, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. All tissues except liver were pooled from up to six fish. 10 μg of total RNA was denatured and electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes by downward alkaline capillary as described (30.Chomczynski P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized with either the CYP2N1 or the CYP2N2 cDNAs labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by nick translation. Hybridizations were at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 6× SSPE, 1.0% (w/v) SDS, and 100 μg/ml heat-denatured calf thymus DNA. Loading and transfer of RNA were monitored by ethidium bromide staining of the gels and filters. Correlation between the stain on the filters and the amount of RNA was ascertained by probing the filters with labeled ribosomal RNA. The dose and timing of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was based on published work in mice (31.Uzumaki H. Yamamoto S. Kato R. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32.Wells P.G. Vo H.P.N. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1989; 97: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and by extrapolation from in vitro studies on effects of TPA on P450 gene expression in cultured fish hepatocytes (33.Lee P.C. Dasmahapatra A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 106: 649-653Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We are unaware of prior in vivo studies involving TPA administration to fish. This dose is well below the predicted LD50 for TPA (∼400–500 ng/g based on extrapolation from studies in mammals) and was not toxic to the fish. The fasting regimen was also selected as one that would likely elicit changes in P450 gene expression. There are marked differences between mammals and fish in normal metabolic responses to fasting (34.Senger H. Dolle A. Bohm R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 116: 257-262Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fasting for periods of 2–10 weeks or longer has often been employed in other studies of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in fish (35.Maurente G. Tocher D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 36.Navarro I. Gutierrez J. Planas J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 102: 401-407Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, at lower temperatures, the effects of fasting generally take longer to appear. Forty-eight female fish that had been held in clean water for greater than six months were acclimated from 20 to 14 °C for 1 week, as fish maintained at lower temperatures tolerate fasting well. Twenty-four of the fish were fed excess TetraMin (Tetra Sales, Blacksburg, VA) throughout the experiment; the rest were held without feeding. After ten days of feeding or fasting, six fish from each group were sacrificed, and intestinal (mid-gut), heart, and brain tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA analyses. After 17 days, six fish from each group were dosed intraperitoneally with 0.02 μg TPA/g in 80% normal saline, 19.8% acetone, 0.2% ethanol (vehicle), vehicle alone, or nothing. Fish were sacrificed 3 days later, and tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA analyses. All tissues were analyzed as pooled specimens. The protocol for these studies was approved by the WHOI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The [1-14C]EET internal standards were synthesized from [1-14C]arachidonic acid (55–57 μCi/μmol) by nonselective epoxidation as described (37.Falck J.R. Yagagiri P. Capdevila J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Racemic and enantiomerically pure EETs were prepared by total chemical synthesis according to published procedures (38.Corey E.J. Marfat A. Falck J.R. Albright J.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 1433-1435Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 39.Falck J.R. Manna S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1982; 23: 1755-1756Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 40.Moustakis C.A. Viala J.

Falck J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 231: 511-517Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PFB esters were formed by reaction with α-bromo-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorotoluene as described (43.Karara A. Dishman E. Blair I. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19822-19827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TMS ethers were prepared using 25% (v/v) bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoracetamide in anhydrous pyridine (44.Porter N.A. Logan J. Konotoyianidou V. J. Org. Chem. 1979; 44: 3177-3181Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). HETE standards were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. ω-Terminal alcohols of arachidonic acid were synthesized as described (45.Manna S. Falck J. Chacos N. Capdevila J.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1983; 24: 33-36Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Screening ofFundulus liver and heart cDNA libraries with degenerate oligonucleotide probes to conserved α-helical regions in mammalian CYP2 family P450s resulted in the identification of two cDNAs that are 69% identical and represent a novel P450 subfamily. Clone LMO-64 is 2151 nucleotides long, contains an open reading frame between nucleotides 70 and 1563 flanked by initiation (ATG) and termination (TGA) codons, and contains a 585-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region with a polyadenylation tail (Fig. 1). The cDNA encodes a 497-amino acid protein that has a derived molecular mass of 56,429 Da and contains the putative heme-binding peptide (FSAGKRVCLGEGLA) with the underlined conserved residues and the invariant cysteine at position 444 (Fig. 2). Clone HMO-11 is 2375 nucleotides long, contains an open reading frame between nucleotides 140 and 1633 flanked by initiation (ATG) and termination (TGA) codons, and contains a 739-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region with a polyadenylation tail (Fig. 1). The protein encoded by HMO-11 contains 497 amino acids, has a derived molecular mass of 56,663 Da, and contains the putative heme-binding peptide (FSAGKRACIGESLA) (Fig. 2). Clone HMO-11 also contains a second in-frame initiation codon at position 68 that would be predicted to give rise to a 521-amino acid, 59,131-Da protein; however, this start site was deemed less favorable due to the absence of a 3′ purine nucleotide.Figure 2Deduced amino acid sequence alignment of CYP2N1 and CYP2N2. The asterisk indicates identical amino acids; the dot indicates conservatively replaced amino acids. The putative heme-binding peptides are underlined,and the six putative substrate recognition sites (SRSs) are shown in shaded boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A comparison of the nucleotide sequences of clones LMO-64 and HMO-11 with those of other P450s indicates that the extent of similarity is limited (i.e. less than 45% nucleic acid identity with members of the CYP1, CYP3, and CYP4 families and 45–55% identity with various members of the CYP2 family). Furthermore, the differences are randomly distributed along the entire length of the cDNAs. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences encoded by LMO-64 and HMO-11 with those of other P450s demonstrates the following: (a) 19–30% sequence identity with CYP1, CYP3, and CYP4 family P450s; (b) 37–43% seq"

This process is selective in that the slowly reversible inhibitor N G-nitro-l-arginine did not decrease the levels of nNOS in vivo. To better understand the mechanism for the loss of nNOS protein in vivo, we have investigated the effects of guanabenz andN G-nitro-l-arginine in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with the enzyme. We show here that guanabenz, but not N G-nitro-l-arginine, caused the inactivation and loss of nNOS protein in the HEK 293 cells. In studies with cycloheximide or in pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine, we demonstrate that the loss of nNOS was due in large part to enhanced proteolysis of the protein with the half-life decreasing by one-half from 20 to 10 h. Other metabolism-based irreversible inactivators to nNOS,N G-methyl-l-arginine, andN 5-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine, but not the reversible inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), caused a similar decrease in the half-life of nNOS. Proteasomal inhibitors, lactacystin, Cbz-leucine-leucine-leucinal, andN-acetyl-leucine-leucine-norleucinal, but not the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin, were found to effectively inhibit the proteolytic degradation of nNOS. Thus we have shown for the first time that the irreversible inactivators of nNOS, perhaps through covalent alteration of the enzyme, enhance the proteolytic turnover of the enzyme by a mechanism involving the proteasome.

Nitric oxide is a signaling molecule that is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including neurotransmission, vasorelaxation, platelet aggregation, and penile erection as well as in a variety of pathological conditions including septic shock, reperfusion injury, arthritis, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and graft rejection (5.Moncada S.

It has been noted (9.Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar) that because nitric oxide is not stored, released, or inactivated after synaptic release by conventional regulatory mechanisms the biosynthetic regulation of the enzyme is of great importance. For the neuronal isoform the Ca2+-mediated activation is of prime importance. However, the factors that regulate proteolytic degradation of the enzyme have not been investigated. One approach that has been successfully utilized for the study of the proteolytic turnover of other P450 cytochromes is the use of suicide inactivators (10.Correia M.A. Decker C. Sugiyama K.

Biophys. 1992; 294: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We wished to utilize this approach for the study of NOS turnover.Suicide inactivators are chemically inert molecules that mimic the natural substrate of the enzyme and become metabolized to a highly reactive intermediate that can covalently alter important active site entities, resulting in inactivation of the enzyme (14.Abeles R.H. Chem. Eng. News. 1983; 61: 48-56Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In effect, the compound causes the enzyme to catalyze its own demise. Because the compound must not only have affinity for the active site but also must be metabolized in a manner to generate a reactive intermediate that is in close proximity to an important active site entity, these agents have the potential to be highly specific in vivo. In addition, they react with the form of the enzyme that is engaged in catalysis and thus are useful mechanistic probes into the nature of the bioactivation reaction. In some cases, these agents covalently alter P450 cytochromes in a manner that enhances their proteolysis and turnover (10.Correia M.A. Decker C. Sugiyama K. Caldera P. Bornheim L. Wrighton S.A.

Nakatsuka K. Osawa Y. Drug. Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 497-501PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the treatment of rats with guanabenz was found to cause not only a decrease in activity, but also a concomitant loss of immunodetectable nNOS protein. To further understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the loss of nNOS protein in vivo, we chose to model the effects of guanabenz with the use of HEK 293 cells stably transfected with nNOS. In the current study, we have shown that guanabenz causes the enhanced proteolytic turnover of nNOS. Suicide inactivators of nNOS, such asN G-methyl-l-arginine orN 5-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine, also caused the enhanced proteolytic degradation of the enzyme, whereas the slowly reversible inhibitorN G-nitro-l-arginine or the reversible inhibitor 7-NI did not. Studies with protease inhibitors indicate that the proteasome is responsible, in part, for recognition of the inactivated protein. Thus, the steady state levels of nNOS may be regulated by a selective proteolytic process, which can be studied by the use of metabolism-based inactivators.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe affinity-purified rabbit IgG against brain NOS used for immunoblotting nNOS was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The rabbit antiserum used to immunoprecipitate nNOS was raised against rat neuronal NOS and was the generous gift of Dr. Lance Pohl (NHLBI, Bethesda, MD). The antibody was affinity purified prior to use. Lactacystin, 7-NI,N 5-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine, and Cbz-leucine-leucine-leucinal (MG132) were purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Guanabenz was purchased from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA).N G-nitro-l-arginine,N G-methyl-l-arginine,l-arginine, leupeptin,N-acetyl-leucine-leucine-norleucinal, A23187, and NADPH were purchased from Sigma. (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (tetrahydrobiopterin) was purchased from Dr. Schirk's Laboratory (Jona, Switzerland).MethodsCell Culture and Preparation of Cytosolic FractionHuman embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293) stably transfected with rat nNOS by Bredt et al. (19.Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Bettie Sue Masters (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf serum (HyClone®), 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and G418 (0.5 mg/ml, Geneticin®, Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (3.McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Seventeen hours before harvesting, the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 0.1 mm arginine (low arginine DMEM). HEK cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized with a Tenbroeck ground glass homogenizer in 2 volumes of HS buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.32 m sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm tetrahydrobiopterin, and 1.0 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Homogenates were centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 ×g with the supernatant being the cytosol fraction. The cytosolic fraction was loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 m column (PD-10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated in HS buffer without tetrahydrobiopterin to remove endogenous arginine and excess tetrahydrobiopterin as described previously (18.Nakatsuka M. Nakatsuka K. Osawa Y. Drug. Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 497-501PubMed Google Scholar). The cytosolic fraction was stored at −80 °C until use.NOS Activity AssayFor studies on the time-dependent irreversible inactivation of nNOS, 30–50 μl of HEK cytosol was added to a mixture of 40 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1.0 mm NADPH, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 500 unit/ml superoxide dismutase, 100 unit/ml catalase, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, and guanabenz at various concentrations in a total volume of 150 μl at room temperature. Aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixture were transferred to an oxyhemoglobin oxidation assay mixture containing 200 μmCaCl2, 100 μm NADPH, 100 μml-arginine, 100 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, and 8 μmoxyhemoglobin in a total volume of 200 μl of 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and the rate of nitric oxide-mediated oxidation of oxyhemoglobin was monitored by measuring the absorbance at λ401–411 nm with a microtiter plate reader (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular Devices, Sunnydale, CA) as described previously (20.Feelisch M. Kubitzek D. Werringloer J. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. Wiley, New York1996: 455-488Google Scholar).For studies on the short term inhibition of nNOS caused by guanabenz, 8 μg of HEK 293 cytosolic protein was added to an assay mixture containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NADPH, 100 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, and radiolabeled arginine (320 mCi/mmol, 5.0 μm) in a total volume of 50 μl of 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 min, the conversion of arginine to citrulline was determined by ion exchange purification as described previously (18.Nakatsuka M. Nakatsuka K. Osawa Y. Drug. Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 497-501PubMed Google Scholar). The K m determined for arginine by this method was 4.4 μm, which is consistent with that found by other laboratories (21.Richards M.K. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14723-14732Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22.Babu B.R. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8882-8889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).The oxyhemoglobin assay was monitored over time to ensure linearity of the assay, typically over a 4-min period. The activity was also linear with respect to protein up to 25 μl of HEK cytosol. The14C-labeled arginine assay was linear up to 18 μg of HEK protein and over the initial 3 min of incubation. In both cases the plot of activity versus protein gave a line (r2 > 0.98) that intersects the origin. The assays were performed in the linear range of protein and time in all cases.Nitrite and Nitrate AssayAliquots of medium (200 μl) from flasks (75 cm2) containing HEK 293 cells were taken for assay of nitrite and nitrate as described (23.Schmidt H.H. Warner T.D. Nakane M. Forstermann U. Murad F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 615-624PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrate reductase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to convert the nitrate to nitrite, which was quantified by the use of the Griess reagent. Sodium nitrate in culture medium was used as a standard.SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western BlottingHEK 293 cells stably transfected with nNOS were cultured in 24-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) in low arginine DMEM. After 40 h, the medium was aspirated, and 1 ml of low arginine DMEM was added. The cells were treated with cycloheximide (40 μm), guanabenz (100 μm), or guanabenz (100 μm) and cycloheximide (40 μm) for 24 h. The cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, counted, and collected by centrifugation. The cells were lysed with 45 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 0.5 mm pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was taken as cell lysates and the protein concentration measured by Micro BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples (1 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10 × 8 cm) with the use of the discontinuous buffer system described by Laemmli (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad). The membranes were probed with an anti-nNOS polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Transduction Laboratories). An anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase (1:10,000, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used as a secondary antibody. The bands were visualized by the use of ECL reagent (Super Signal, Pierce) and X-OMAT film (Eastman Kodak Co.) as described by the manufacturer. The intensity of the signals was quantified by laser densitometry (GS-670, Bio-Rad). In some experiments, N G-methyl-l-arginine orN G-nitro-l-arginine was used in place of guanabenz.Metabolic Labeling and ImmunoprecipitationHEK 293 cells stably transfected with nNOS were cultured in 6-well plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well) in low arginine DMEM. Cells were incubated with 1.0 ml of methionine-free medium for 60 min, and then 80 μCi of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products, Expre35S35S Protein labeling mix) was added. Following the labeling period, the medium was changed to 5.0 ml of low arginine DMEM containing 1 mm methionine. At appropriate time intervals, the chase was terminated by solubilization with 100 μl of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g in a microfuge for 10 min. nNOS was immunoadsorbed from the cell lysates with 15 μl of anti-nNOS IgG and 2.0 mg of protein A-Sepharose (25.Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Immune pellets were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and bound antigen was eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer with dithiothreitol (6.0 mg/ml). The purified proteins were resolved on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described above. The radioactivity was quantified with the use of a PhosphorImager (Model 445 SI, Molecular Dynamics).DISCUSSIONAdministration of guanabenz to rats was previously shown to cause the loss of immunodetectable nNOS protein from penile tissue (18.Nakatsuka M. Nakatsuka K. Osawa Y. Drug. Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 497-501PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we show here that the treatment of intact HEK 293 cells with guanabenz caused a decrease in cellular nNOS activity as well as a decrease in the level of immunodetectable nNOS. Moreover, we determined by the use of cycloheximide and immunoblotting as well as by metabolic labeling of the protein with [35S]methionine and subsequent immunoisolation that the loss of nNOS protein in intact HEK 293 cells was due in part to the substantial increase in the turnover of the protein. The half-life of nNOS was decreased by approximately 1/2 to 10 h due to guanabenz treatment. The enhanced degradation of nNOS was also caused by other irreversible inactivators including l-NIO andl-NMA, whereas the slowly reversible inhibitorl-NNA or the reversible inhibitor 7-NI did not have an effect on the turnover of the protein. These results are entirely consistent with the lack of effect on the level of immunodetectable nNOS observed after treatment of rats with l-NNA even though there is inhibition of the enzyme (18.Nakatsuka M. Nakatsuka K. Osawa Y. Drug. Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 497-501PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the enhanced degradation of nNOS is not due to inhibition of the activity alone, but is likely due to some selective action on the enzyme by the suicide inactivators.Although this is the first report of inactivator-mediated enhanced turnover for nNOS, the enhanced degradation of suicide inactivated liver microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are similar to NOS, has been described (11.Tierney D.J. Haas A.L. Koop D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12.Correia M.A. Davoll S.H. Wrighton S.A. Thomas P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13.Correia M.A. Yao K. Wrighton S.A. Waxman D.J. Rettie A.E. Arch. Biochem.

Correia et al. (10.Correia M.A. Decker C. Sugiyama K. Caldera P. Bornheim L. Wrighton S.A. Rettie A.E. Trager W.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 436-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have shown that administration of the suicide inactivator 3,5-dicarbethoxy-2,6-dimethyl-4-ethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine to rats lead to inactivation and loss of immunochemically detectable cytochrome P450 3A from the endoplasmic reticulum. Noguchi et al. (15.Noguchi T. Fong K. Lai E.K. Olson L. McCay P.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) observed that treatment of rats with the suicide inactivator CCl4 caused the selective loss of a protein, which was thought to be a cytochrome P450. More recently, Koop and co-workers (11.Tierney D.J. Haas A.L. Koop D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have definitively shown that administration of CCl4 to rats leads to inactivation and loss of cytochrome P450 2E1. In accord with our current findings, it appears that structural changes and not the functional inactivation per se appear to be the “trigger” for proteolysis (10.Correia M.A. Decker C. Sugiyama K. Caldera P. Bornheim L. Wrighton S.A. Rettie A.E. Trager W.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 436-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11.Tierney D.J. Haas A.L. Koop D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both 3,5-dicarbethoxy-2,6-dimethyl-4-ethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine and CCl4 are known to cause the covalent alteration of the heme to protein-bound adducts (33.Osawa Y. Pohl L.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, it appears that the protein-bound heme adducts play a major role in proteolytic recognition because the inactivation of cytochrome P450 2E1 with 1-aminobenzotriazole, which leads to N-alkylation of the heme (11.Tierney D.J. Haas A.L. Koop D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), “heme stripping” of cytochrome P450 3A after treatment with allylisopropylacetamide (12.Correia M.A. Davoll S.H. Wrighton S.A. Thomas P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34.Bornheim L.M. Underwood M.C. Caldera P. Rettie A.E. Trager W.F. Wrighton S.A. Correia M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 299-308PubMed Google Scholar), which leads to the formation of apoprotein, and secobarbital-mediated inactivation of cytochrome P450 2B1 (35.Lunetta J.M. Sugiyama K. Correia M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 10-17PubMed Google Scholar), which leads to direct covalent alteration of the protein, all fail to enhance the proteolysis of the affected P450 cytochromes. Thus, in accord with the above precedents, it is possible that nNOS is covalently altered, perhaps at the heme prosthetic group, and is subsequently recognized by proteases. In this respect,l-NMA has been shown to modify the heme prosthetic group of NOS during suicide inactivation (36.Olken N.M. Osawa Y. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14784-14791Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).The enhanced degradation of the inducible isoform of nitric-oxide synthase has been described (37.Walker G. Pfeilschifter J. Kunz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mechanism of suppression of inducible NOS by dexamethasone in γ-interferon treated RAW 264.7 cells is due in part to the enhanced turnover of the protein as well as effects on transcription and translation (37.Walker G. Pfeilschifter J. Kunz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Based on the effects of ALLN, the protease responsible for the enhanced degradation of inducible NOS was identified as calpain. Calpain also appears to be responsible for the proteolytic degradation of nNOS in neurotoxin-treated cortical cells (38.Hajimohammadreza I. Raser K.J. Nath R. Nadimpalli R. Scott M. Wang K.K.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) as well as in in vitro systems (39.Laine R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our studies with the use of lactacystin strongly suggest that the proteasome is the major protease responsible for degradation of nNOS in our cellular system. In this respect, the proteasome has also been implicated in the degradation of suicide inactivated liver P450 cytochromes (16.Roberts B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9771-9778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17.Yang M.X. Cederbaum A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The current studies describe for the first time that inactivators of nNOS cause the enhanced degradation of the enzyme, which may explain in part the effects seen on nNOS after administration of guanabenz to rats. Moreover, we implicate the proteasome as the major protease responsible for the enhanced degradation of nNOS. The current studies provide important tools for the study of the mechanism responsible for the enhanced turnover of the protein that may be important in the design and evaluation of inactivators of nNOS. In this respect, the model system developed here may provide a method to screen compounds for the inactivation and degradation of nNOS that may occur in vivo. Nitric-oxide synthases (NOS)1 are cytochrome P450-like hemoprotein enzymes that catalyze the conversion ofl-arginine to citrulline and nitric oxide (1.White K.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6627-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 2.Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol.

Nitric oxide is a signaling molecule that is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including neurotransmission, vasorelaxation, platelet aggregation, and penile erection as well as in a variety of pathological conditions including septic shock, reperfusion injury, arthritis, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and graft rejection (5.Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Burnett A.L. Lowenstein C.J. Bredt D.S. Chang T.S. Snyder S.H.

It has been noted (9.Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar) that because nitric oxide is not stored, released, or inactivated after synaptic release by conventional regulatory mechanisms the biosynthetic regulation of the enzyme is of great importance. For the neuronal isoform the Ca2+-mediated activation is of prime importance. However, the factors that regulate proteolytic degradation of the enzyme have not been investigated. One approach that has been successfully utilized for the study of the proteolytic turnover of other P450 cytochromes is the use of suicide inactivators (10.Correia M.A. Decker C. Sugiyama K. Caldera P. Bornheim L. Wrighton S.A. Rettie A.E. Trager W.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 436-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11.Tierney D.J. Haas A.L. Koop D.R. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1992; 294: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We wished to utilize this approach for the study of NOS turnover. Suicide inactivators are chemically inert molecules that mimic the natural substrate of the enzyme and become metabolized to a highly reactive intermediate that can covalently alter important active site entities, resulting in inactivation of the enzyme (14.Abeles R.H. Chem. Eng. News. 1983; 61: 48-56Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In effect, the compound causes the enzyme to catalyze its own demise. Because the compound must not only have affinity for the active site but also must be metabolized in a manner to generate a reactive intermediate that is in close proximity to an important active site entity, these agents have the potential to be highly specific in vivo. In addition, they react with the form of the enzyme that is engaged in catalysis and thus are useful mechanistic probes into the nature of the bioactivation reaction. In some cases, these agents covalently alter P450 cytochromes in a manner that enhances their proteolysis and turnover (10.Correia M.A. Decker C. Sugiyama K. Caldera P. Bornheim L. Wrighton S.A.

They are being detected increasingly in human tissues, and their physiological roles need to be understood. Two β-carboline carboxylates have been reported to accumulate in the human eye lens. We report here on the identification of another β-carboline, namely 1-methyl-1-vinyl -2,3,4-trihydro-β-carboline-3-carboxylic acid, in the lenses of some cataract patients from India. Analysis of these three lenticular β-carbolines using photodynamic and antioxidant assays shows all of them to be inert as sensitizers and effective as antioxidants; they quench singlet oxygen, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals and inhibit the oxidative formation of higher molecular weight aggregates of the test protein, eye lens γ-crystallin. Such antioxidative ability of β-carbolines is of particular relevance to the lens, which faces continual photic and oxidative stress. The β-carboline diacid IV is also seen to display an unexpected ability of inhibiting the thermal coagulation of γ-crystallin and the dithiothreitol-induced precipitation of insulin. These results offer experimental support to earlier suggestions that one of the roles that the β-carbolines have is to offer protection against oxidative stress to the human tissues where they accumulate. β-Carbolines are tricyclic nitrogen heterocycles formed in plants and animals as Maillard reaction products between amino acids and reducing sugars or aldehydes.

A. 1983; 80: 2912-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar);III has also been identified as the possible causative substance of eosinophilia-myalgic syndrome associated with the ingestion of l-Trp in mammals (8.Adachi J.K.

Some of the β-carbolines have been shown to be phototoxic to bacteria and insects (11.Larson R.A. Marley K.A. Tureson R.W. Berenbaum M.R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and attempts have been made to correlate their phototoxicity with their ability to produce reactive oxygen species upon irradiation,i.e. photodynamic or sensitizer abilities (11.Larson R.A. Marley K.A. Tureson R.W. Berenbaum M.R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12.Chae K.H. Ham H.S. Bull. Korean Chem.

On the other hand, there have been reports (14.Eichner K. Prog. Food Nutr. Sci. 1981; 5: 441-451Google Scholar, 15.Lingnert H. Waller G.R. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1983; 31: 27-30Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16.Yen G.-C. Hsieh P.-P. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1995; 43: 415-420Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar) that some of these Maillard products are antioxidative in nature. β-Carbolines are found ubiquitously in a variety of foods: grain flour, soy sauce and soy protein, milk, beer, and wine, and perhaps as a consequence, in animal fluids and tissues such as blood, milk, urine, kidney, liver, and brain (10.Ogawa Y. Adachi J. Tatsuno Y. Arch. Toxicol. 1993; 67: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17.Nagahara A. Kumagai S. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1991; 29: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Several reports have appeared in recent literature of the presence of β-carbolines in human tissues. It thus becomes important to understand their physiological role in human health. Manabe et al. (18.Manabe S. Yuan J. Takahashi T. Urban Jr., R.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have shown that IIIaccumulates steadily in the eye lens with age and in significantly higher amounts in senile cataract and diabetic cataract lenses. Dillonet al. (19.Dillon J. Spector A. Nakanishi K. Nature. 1976; 259: 422-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have discussed the presence of the β-carboline diacid IV in the lens. In this paper we report on the presence of yet another β-carboline (compound V in Fig. 1) from the water-soluble portion of human cataract lenses. The physiological role of the β-carbolines that accumulate in the human lens is of particular ophthalmological interest; do they play a protective role by filtering the UVA and UVB radiation from the vitreous and retina? Are they benign accumulants, or do they behave as potentially harmful agents through possible photodynamic action that would impose oxidative stress? This question is relevant because many other Trp metabolites and derivatives are also known to accumulate in the lens, some of which seem to be photodynamic, e.g. N-formylkynurenine (20.Krishna C.M. Uppuluri S. Riesz P. Zigler Jr., J.S. Balasubramanian D. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) or 4-hydroxyquinoline carboxylate (21.Luthra M. Ranganathan D. Ranganathan S. Balasubramanian D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas others such as 3-hydroxykynurenine might offer antioxidant protection (22.Luthra M. Balasubramanian D. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 55: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). With this question in mind we have investigated the photobiological and antioxidant properties of a series of β-carboline compounds. Our results suggest that the β-carbolines that accumulate in human tissues, namely III, IV, and V, have little or no photodynamic properties but display a possible antioxidant, protective role. In addition, the β-carboline diacidIV that has been shown to be in the lens, is also seen to display a surprising ability of solubilizing or inhibiting the precipitation of proteins. Human lenses excised through cataract surgery of elderly patients, obtained from the rural eye camps in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India, were homogenized in 80% alcohol and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant solution was collected separately and chromatographed on a C18 reverse phase column (20 × 1.5-cm inner diameter) using a Hewlett-Packard HPLC1system. The mobile phase consisted of a 0–100% gradient system of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, in 1:1 CH3CN:trifluoroacetic acid (0.1% ) run over for 32 min. The flow rate was kept at 0.4 ml/min, and the absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. Several eluates absorbing at 280 nm were detected at retention times of 6.8, 8.6, 9.4, 14.6, 19.0, and 27.3 min. The eluate at 27.3 min was rechromatographed on the same system and purified to homogeneity to get about 2 mg of the compound. Analysis of the other eluates by co-HPLC with authentic standards established them to be kynurenines and xanthurenic acid derivatives. The synthesis followed the procedure described earlier (23.Brossi A. Focella A. Teitel S. J. Med. Chem. 1973; 16: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and is called the Pictet-Spengler reaction between the amino acid and the aldehyde via the Schiff base and cyclization to a tetrahydro-β-carboline. Both the (1S,3S) and (1R,3S) diastereoisomers are obtained in the reaction, which are easily separated and isolated in the pure form. Of the two, the SS isomer has been seen to be present in amounts four times higher than the RS isomer (7.Wakabayashi K. Ochiai M. Saito H. Tsuda M. Suwa Y. Nagao M. Sugimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2912-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18.Manabe S. Yuan J. Takahashi T. Urban Jr., R.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A mixture of 2 g (0.245 mol) of l-Trp, 1.6 ml (0.84 mol) of freshly distilled acetaldehyde, and 1 ml of 0.1 nH2SO4 was dissolved in 30 ml of water and stirred under N2 atmosphere at room temperature (about 25 °C) for 8 h. The precipitated material was filtered and recrystallized from water to yield 1.3 g (75% yield) of pure product, melting at 293 °C. Mass, NMR and optical spectra confirmed its identity as (−)(1S, 3S)-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline-3-carboxylic acid or the SS isomer of III. The mother liquor was evaporated to dryness, 7.8 g (0.157 mol) of acetaldehyde and 10 ml of 0.1 n HCl added, and the mixture was diluted using 10 ml of water and stirred under an N2atmosphere at room temperature overnight. The resultant precipitate was collected and recrystallized from water to yield 2 g (4.5% yield) of the final product, m.p. 242–244 °C. Spectral characterization as above confirmed its identity as (1R,3S)III. We have thus isolated both the SS andRS isomers, studied them, and find that they have essentially the same photobiological and antioxidant properties. In light of the fact that the SS isomer is the major component in biological samples we present the results of this isomer, abbreviated as III in this paper. 2.5 g of l-Trp was dissolved in 20 ml of water with warming. About 4 ml of freshly distilled pyruvic acid was added to the warmed solution, and then the mixture was cooled to 30 °C and kept aside. The condensation product separated as long needles the next day. The yield of crystals after filtration, washing with water, and drying in a desiccator was 1.7 g. After concentration of the mother liquor in vacuum, 0.42 g of the substance separated. To recrystallize, the compound was dissolved in water with slight warming and the solution concentrated under vacuum till the crystallization started (yield 2.12 g). To a boiling solution of III (0.25 g) in 65 ml of water, 12.5 ml of potassium dichromate solution was added followed by 2.5 ml of acetic acid. The solution was boiled for 1 min, cooled, and treated with dilute sodium sulfite solution to remove the excess oxidizing agent, made strongly alkaline with sodium carbonate, and shaken with ether. The ether extract was collected and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure to yield harmane (0.152 g). Recrystallization with alcohol gave yellow needles, m.p. 238 °C. Harmine was prepared following a procedure similar to the method mentioned for the preparation of harmane. Recrystallization was carried out in methanol-water to get a yield of 0.042 g. Optical absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi model U-2000 spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AC 300F (300 MHz) instrument. Mass spectra were recorded using a Va 7070-H EI (Va Micromass, U. K.) and a Hewelett-Packard series 1100 MSD mass spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured using a Nicolet (Impact 400) FTIR spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded in the steady-state mode using a Hitachi model F-4000 spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence quantum yields were determined using the procedures described earlier (24.Chen R.F. Science. 1965; 150: 1593-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), using the relationshipQ x = Q s(F x/F s) (A s/A x) where the subscripts s and x refer to the standard compound (l-Trp,Q s = 0.13) and the sample, respectively.F is the wave number-integrated area of the corrected emission at constant slit openings and A the absorbance at the excitation wavelength (always less than 0.1, so as to avoid the inner filter effect). We calculated the area of the corrected emission spectrum using the built-in computer of the spectrofluorometer. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were done at the CCMB using a Photon Technology instrument and also at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, using a home-built instrument in the laboratory of Professor N. Periasamy (25.Periasamy N. Doraiswamy S. Maiya G.B. Venkataraman B. J. Chem. Phys. 1988; 88: 1638-1651Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whom we thank for help with the measurements. Solutions were freshly prepared in water before use. 1O2 was detected by the method developed by Kraljic and Mohsni (26.Kraljic I. Mohsni S.E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 28: 577-581Crossref Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Each of the test compounds was exposed to light at its absorption maximum (273 nm in the case of III, IV and V and 330 nm in the case of I and II) in the presence of 10 mm imidazole and 50 μm N,N-dimethyl-p-nitrosoaniline, or RNO, in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for a chosen period of time. The light source was the 450-W xenon arc lamp of the Hitachi spectrofluorometer, and the light flux was estimated by actinometry in a separate earlier experiment to be 0.2 mW/cm2, 1014 photons/s. Any 1O2 that is generated by photoexcitation of the molecule reacts with imidazole to form a transannular peroxide that bleaches RNO, and the bleaching is monitored spectrophotometrically at 440 nm. O⨪2 was detected using the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction method (27.McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anthranilic acid (3 mm) was used as the sensitizer to generate O⨪2, and the samples containing 20 μm ferricytochrome c in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were illuminated at 330 nm in the absence and presence of test compounds, in the instrument and under the conditions described above. The reduction of ferricytochrome c was monitored spectrophotometrically at 550 nm, using ε500 = 20,000m−1 cm−1 for the reduced-oxidized cytochrome c (28.Koppenol N.H. Butler J. Israel J. Chem. 1984; 24: 11-16Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The assay was performed following the procedure by Milleret al. (29.Miller N.J. Rice-Evans C. Davies M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 95SCrossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30.Miller N.J. Rice-Evans C. Davies M.J. Gopinathan V. Milner A. Clin. Sci. (Colch.). 1993; 84: 407-412Crossref Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). Briefly, when azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) or ABTS is incubated with a peroxidase (such as metmyoglobin) and hydrogen peroxide, the relatively long lived radical cation, ABTS.+, is formed. When the peroxidase is metmyoglobin, the ABTS.+ radical cation that forms upon intercalation with ferryl myoglobin has absorption maxima at 650, 734, and 820 nm. In the presence of antioxidant reductants or hydrogen donors, the absorption of this radical cation is quenched to an extent that can be related directly to the antioxidant capacity of the added substance. ABTS (30 μl, 5 mm), 50 μl of metmyoglobin (50 μm), and 820 μl of phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) (of which 5 μl, or the desired volume, was replaced when a sample was being investigated) were mixed, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of hydrogen peroxide (1 mm). The absorbance at 734 nm (a beautiful bluish green color) was measured as a function of time at 5-min intervals for 20 min. The test protein, bovine eye lens γ-crystallin, was isolated in the laboratory by the following procedure. Fresh calf lenses were homogenized in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide and centrifuged at 5,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The soluble proteins in the supernatant were fractionated by gel filtration on a column of Bio-Gel A-1.5m (1.8 × 180 cm) at 4 °C. The fractions corresponding to βH-, βL-, and γ-crystallins were pooled and dialyzed against water. Further, the fractions corresponding to γ-crystallin were pooled and concentrated at 4 °C by ultrafiltration using an Amicon ultrafiltration unit and were stored at 4 °C until used for the experiment. γ-Crystallin is known to aggregate and precipitate upon irradiation at 295 nm (photoaggregation) (31.Mandal K. Kono M. Bose S.K. Thomson J. Chakrabarti B. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 47: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as well as upon heating (thermal aggregation) (32.Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the effect of the β-carbolines on the photoaggregation behavior of γ-crystallin, the protein solutions, with or without the additive, were irradiated at 295 nm for fixed time periods with an excitation bandpass of 20 nm using the Hitachi F-4000 spectrofluorometer. After each time period of irradiation, the excitation and emission monochromators were both set to 600 nm with the excitation and emission bandpass 5 and 3 nm, respectively, to measure the relative scattering. The relative scattering was plotted against irradiated time. The concentration of γ-crystallin was 1 mg/ml. As a control, the same scattering test was performed while irradiating the solution at 350 nm (where the protein does not absorb) under similar conditions. No scattering was displayed in this case. γ-Crystallin (1 mg/ml) was irradiated in a quartz cuvette in the presence of riboflavin as externally added sensitizer and the test carboline. The samples were irradiated at 446 nm under constant stirring for 30 min using the 450-W xenon arc lamp in the Hitachi spectrofluorometer. All samples were then reserved for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using 10% acrylamide for setting the gel, and in the presence of 10% SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. The same experiment was done here, except that instead of using a sensitizer and light, the OH⋅radical was produced via the Fenton reaction using FeCl3(10 mm) and ascorbic acid (0.1 m) in the dark at room temperature (33.Zigler Jr., J.S. Jernigan Jr., H.M. Garland D. Reddy V.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The protein solutions were incubated in the Fenton mixture for up to 72 h and then analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol as above. Thermal aggregation of γ-crystallin was monitored by the following procedure. γ-Crystallin (0.5 mg/ml) in 20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was equilibrated at the required temperature for 5 min with constant stirring in the sample holder. Then, the extent of aggregation was measured as a function of time by the scattering of 600 nm light, by setting the excitation and emission bandpasses at 5 and 3 nm, respectively. In other experiments, the buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml γ-crystallin was equilibrated at the required temperature. Different stock solutions containing β-carbolines were then added and aggregation measured as described above. Insulin at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml (in 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl) with or without IV was equilibrated at 42 °C for 5 min with constant stirring in the sample holder using a Julabo thermostatted water bath. The reduction of insulin was initiated by adding 20 μl of 1m dithiothreitol to 1 ml of the sample, and the extent of aggregation of the insulin B chain was measured as a function of time, by monitoring the scattering of 465 nm light in a Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The excitation and emission monochromators were set at 465 nm with bandpasses of 1.5 nm. CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarometer. CD spectra of γ-crystallin at different temperatures were recorded using water-jacketed cuvettes. The required temperatures were maintained using a Julabo circulating water bath. Far UV CD spectra were recorded using a 1-mm path length cell. A concentration of 0.5 mg/ml γ-crystallin was used for CD studies. The molecular orbital energy levels of I,III, IV, and V were computed using the semiempirical method of Dewar et al. (34.Dewar M.J.S. Zoebisch E.G. Healy E.F. Stewart J.J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3902-3909Crossref Scopus (14978) Google Scholar), using the program package MOPAC 93 (Fujitsu Inc.). Optimization was performed using the “Precise” criteria and including configuration interaction scheme; all excitations were within the eight molecular orbitals bracketing the HOMO- LUMO 4900 microstates, in the laboratory of Professor T. P. Radhakrishnan of the University of Hyderabad. Two β-carbolines, namely III and the diacid IV, have been identified earlier as present in the human lens (18.Manabe S. Yuan J. Takahashi T. Urban Jr., R.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19.Dillon J. Spector A. Nakanishi K. Nature. 1976; 259: 422-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we report on the presence of another new member of the β-carboline family from the 80% ethanol extract of human lenses. Because it is extracted in ethanol, it occurs in the lens in the free form and not in the protein-bound form. HPLC separation of the extract yielded fractions with retention times of 6.8, 8.6, 9.4, 14.6, 19.0, and 27.3 min. Analysis of the eluates by co-HPLC using authentic samples led us to identify the first five fractions as the result of kynurenines and xanthurenic acid derivatives. The 27.3-min fraction had optical absorption bands at 227 and 273 nm and a fluorescence band around 340 nm. Its fast atom bombardment high resolution mass spectrum revealed a molecular mass of 256. FTIR spectra of the sample, measured in KBr pellets, showed absorption bands for the −NH (3,360 cm−1), CO (1,690 cm−1), and aromatic moieties (1,578, 1530 cm−1). Fig. 2 shows the 1H and13C NMR spectra of the compound. The proton NMR spectrum is remarkable in its similarity to that of III and of another β-carboline isolated from the root bark of Perriera madagascariensis (35.Krebs H.C. Rakotoarimanga J.V. Rasoanairo P. Frappier F. Martin M.T. J. Nat. Prod. 1997; 60: 1183-1185Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), in its aromatic and alicyclic regions, and suggests that the compound under study is another β-carboline. That it has a vinyl moiety was apparent from the signals at 7.32 ppm (dd) and 5.37 ppm (d), and a methyl group was also clear from the 3-proton strong singlet at 1.6 ppm. The assignments of various proton resonances are listed in Table I, which also shows the numbering of the atoms in the molecule. The 13C NMR spectrum of the compound is also shown in Fig. 2 and is quite similar to that of the β-carboline from P. madagascariensis which has been identified as 4,7-dimethoxy-1-vinyl-β-carboline (35.Krebs H.C. Rakotoarimanga J.V. Rasoanairo P. Frappier F. Martin M.T. J. Nat. Prod. 1997; 60: 1183-1185Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), although the A-ring heterocycle is not totally conjugated in the present case as is in the latter. The assignment of the resonances to the various carbons is also listed in Table I. On the basis of the NMR assignments, the FTIR, and from an analysis of the fast atom bombardment mass (Fig. 3 A) and the positive ion electrospray mass spectral profile (Fig.3 B) of the molecule shown in Fig. 3, we assign to this compound the structure 1-methyl-1-vinyl-2,3,4-trihydro-β-carboline-3-carboxylic acid and illustrate it as compound V in Fig. 1.Table I13 C and 1 H NMR spectral data of VPositionδ13Cδ 1H149.16357.663.72 (dd, 12.0, 4.5)424.92.88 (dd, 12.0, 4.5)3.20 (dd, 12.0, 4.5)4a118.74b111.05136.37.42 (d, 7.0)6121.27.06 (dd, 7.0, 7.0)7118.77.00 (dd, 7.0, 7.0)8106.57.31 (d, 7.0)8a117.79a111.01′131.57.32 (dd, 16.0, 9.0)2′125.95.32 (d, 18.0)COOH169.7CH313.71.6 (s)9-NH10.95 (s)Data were recorded in 1:1 CDCl3:dimethyl sulfoxide-d6at 300 MHz (for 1H) and 75 MHz (for 13C). s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublet.

The photophysical and photochemical properties of some β-carbolines have been studied in the literature (11.Larson R.A. Marley K.A. Tureson R.W. Berenbaum M.R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12.Chae K.H. Ham H.S. Bull. Korean Chem. Soc. 1986; 7: 478-479Google Scholar, 13.Balon M. Carmona C. Guardado P. Munoz M.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 67: 414-419Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Some of these are phototoxic to bacteria and insects; Larson et al. (11.Larson R.A. Marley K.A. Tureson R.W. Berenbaum M.R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have found the ability to kill test organisms to vary in the order I >II > IIa, and IIb to be inactive. This phototoxicity rank order is not in direct consonance with their ability to produce reactive oxygen species such as1O2, O⨪2, and H2O2 upon irradiation; β-carbolines with a partially saturated pyridine ring (A ring) such as IIa andIIb were found to be more efficient generators of reactive oxygen species than the fully aromatized ones (I andII), and yet they do little or no photodamage to target cells. The difficulty encountered in reconciling these two properties might lie in the fact that in a protic environment, particularly water, the fully aromatized compounds can exist in multiple states in equilibrium, namely neutral, cationic, and tautomeric both in the ground and excited states (36.Dias A. Varela A.P. da G. Miguel M. Macanita A.L. Becker R.S. J. Phys. Chem. 1992; 96: 10290-10296Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar); the principal absorbing tautomer may be quite different from the principal emitting or photoactive state. Also, in molecules with reduced conjugation such as IIa, energy level calculations and fluorescence measurements (value of the parameter τo = τ/φF) indicate that the order of electronic energy levels changes, making the1(nπ*) state lower than the 1(ππ*) state, although the former transition is not observed since it is forbidden. Given this background, it appears difficult to predict a priori the photodynamic properties of β-carbolines based on their elec"
https://openalex.org/W2134952190,"Lactococcus lactis contains an operon with the genes (nrdD and nrdG) for a class III ribonucleotide reductase. Strict anaerobic growth depends on the activity of these genes. Both were sequenced, cloned, and overproduced in Escherichia coli. The corresponding proteins, NrdD and NrdG, were purified close to homogeneity. The amino acid sequences of NrdD (747 residues, 84.1 kDa) and NrdG (199 residues, 23.3 kDa) are 53 and 42% identical with the respective E. coli proteins. Together, they catalyze the reduction of ribonucleoside triphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides in the presence ofS-adenosylmethionine, reduced flavodoxin or reduced deazaflavin, potassium ions, dithiothreitol, and formate. EPR experiments demonstrated a [4Fe-4S]+ cluster in reduced NrdG and a glycyl radical in activated NrdD, similar to the E. coli NrdD and NrdG proteins. Different from E. coli, the two polypeptides of NrdD and the proteins in the NrdD-NrdG complex were only loosely associated. Also the FeS cluster was easily lost from NrdG. The substrate specificity and overall activity of the L. lactis enzyme was regulated according to the general rules for ribonucleotide reductases. Allosteric effectors bound to two separate sites on NrdD, one binding dATP, dGTP, and dTTP and the other binding dATP and ATP. The two sites showed an unusually high degree of cooperativity with complex interactions between effectors and a fine-tuning of their physiological effects. The results with theL. lactis class III reductase further support the concept of a common origin for all present day ribonucleotide reductases. Lactococcus lactis contains an operon with the genes (nrdD and nrdG) for a class III ribonucleotide reductase. Strict anaerobic growth depends on the activity of these genes. Both were sequenced, cloned, and overproduced in Escherichia coli. The corresponding proteins, NrdD and NrdG, were purified close to homogeneity. The amino acid sequences of NrdD (747 residues, 84.1 kDa) and NrdG (199 residues, 23.3 kDa) are 53 and 42% identical with the respective E. coli proteins. Together, they catalyze the reduction of ribonucleoside triphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides in the presence ofS-adenosylmethionine, reduced flavodoxin or reduced deazaflavin, potassium ions, dithiothreitol, and formate. EPR experiments demonstrated a [4Fe-4S]+ cluster in reduced NrdG and a glycyl radical in activated NrdD, similar to the E. coli NrdD and NrdG proteins. Different from E. coli, the two polypeptides of NrdD and the proteins in the NrdD-NrdG complex were only loosely associated. Also the FeS cluster was easily lost from NrdG. The substrate specificity and overall activity of the L. lactis enzyme was regulated according to the general rules for ribonucleotide reductases. Allosteric effectors bound to two separate sites on NrdD, one binding dATP, dGTP, and dTTP and the other binding dATP and ATP. The two sites showed an unusually high degree of cooperativity with complex interactions between effectors and a fine-tuning of their physiological effects. The results with theL. lactis class III reductase further support the concept of a common origin for all present day ribonucleotide reductases. isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside S-adenosylmethionine dithiothreitol deazaflavin milliwatts polymerase chain reaction base pair Lactococcus lactis is a member of the family of lactic acid Gram-positive bacteria that grow anaerobically but tolerate low concentrations of oxygen (1.Teuber M. Wood B.J.B. Holtzapfel W.H. The Genus Lactococcus. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1995: 173-234Google Scholar). Similar to all other bacteria it produces the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates required for DNA synthesis by reduction of ribonucleotides (2.Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). In earlier work (3.Jordan A. Pontis E. Åslund F. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8779-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) we isolated fromL. lactis subsp. cremonis a class Ib (nrdEF) ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase (2.Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). This class contains a catalytically active tyrosyl radical whose generation requires molecular oxygen. Its members are not expected to function during anaerobiosis. L. lactis does, however, also containnrdDG genes that code for a ribonucleotide reductase not depending on oxygen. The homologous proteins in Escherichia coli function during anaerobiosis (4.Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8383-8386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, surprisingly, mutants in the L. lactis nrdD gene were still able to grow well under standard anaerobic growth conditions and then overproduced the NrdEF proteins (3.Jordan A. Pontis E. Åslund F. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8779-8785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There are three classes of ribonucleotide reductases that differ in their protein structure (see recent reviews in Refs. 2.Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar and 5.Reichard P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 81-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6.Sjöberg B.-M.

All operate via a free radical mechanism involving protein radicals but differ in the way in which the protein radical is generated. Class I enzymes, coded either by the nrdAB genes (class Ia) ornrdEF genes (class Ib, occur in many microorganisms and all higher eukaryotes. They have an α2β2structure with the larger α2 protein forming the catalytic part, responsible also for the allosteric properties of the enzyme, and the smaller β2 protein harboring the radical-generating system, with an oxygen-linked diiron center and a neighboring free radical on a tyrosyl residue. Class II enzymes consist of only one large polypeptide, usually a dimer. Adenosylcobalamin substitutes for the β2 protein as radical generator. This class occurs only in microorganisms. Class III enzymes consist of two proteins, NrdD and NrdG, with the larger NrdD responsible for catalysis and allosteric effects and the smaller NrdG for radical generation.nrdD and nrdG genes have been found in many different anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria (2.Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Up to now only the class III proteins from E. coli (4.Reichard P. J. Biol.

Class I enzymes require oxygen, and class II enzymes are independent of oxygen, and class III enzymes are poisoned by oxygen. A special aspect of all ribonucleotide reductases concerns the regulation of their substrate specificity (2.Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 5.Reichard P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 81-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6.Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar). Each enzyme, irrespective of class, provides all four dNTPs required for DNA synthesis. The specificity toward the reduction of one or the other substrate is directed by allosteric effectors binding to a “specificity site” on the large protein, distinct from the catalytic site. There, effectors (ATP, dATP, dGTP, or dTTP), one per polypeptide chain, bind and modify by long range interaction the conformation of the catalytic site to adapt it to a given substrate. Some class I enzymes (class Ia) contain an additional “activity site” on the large protein that regulates the overall catalytic activity. There, ATP acts as stimulator and dATP as inhibitor. The E. coli anaerobic reductase has been the prototype of class III reductases (4.Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8383-8386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During anaerobic growth, the bacteria switch on their nrdDG operon and rely on the corresponding NrdD and NrdG proteins for the production of deoxyribonucleotides. The NrdD protein harbors in its active form an oxygen-sensitive glycyl radical located close to the carboxyl terminus of the protein (13.Sun X. Ollagnier S. Schmidt P.P. Atta M. Mulliez E. Lepape L. Eliasson R. Gräslund A. Fontecave M. Reichard P. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6828-6831Google Scholar). Ribonucleotide reduction occurs at the triphosphate level and requires formate as hydrogen donor. The protein was found to contain two classes of allosteric sites, with one class binding dATP, dGTP, or dTTP and the other binding ATP and dATP (14.Eliasson R. Pontis E. Sun X. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26052-26057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NrdG protein contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster that, together withS-adenosylmethionine, and reduced flavodoxin generates the glycyl radical on NrdD (9.Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10.Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P. Eliasson R. Gaillard J.

Early experiments pointed to a stoichiometry of one cluster per NrdG dimer, but more recent evidence suggests that each NrdG polypeptide contains one [4Fe-4S] cluster (15.Tamarit J. Mulliez E. Meier C. Trautwein A. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31291-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In many respects the anaerobic reductase resembles the pyruvate formate lyase system (16.Kessler D. Knappe J. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbanger W.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 199-205Google Scholar), and a recent x-ray crystallographic study (17.Logan D. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) has added structural evidence to the hypothesis that the two enzyme systems may have a common evolutionary origin. Several years ago one of us 1G. Buist, unpublished experiments. discovered by chance that L. lactis subsp.cremonis very likely contains an NrdDG operon coding for an active class III ribonucleotide reductase. L. lactis is a Gram-positive bacterium, far removed in evolution from the Gram-negative E. coli. We were interested to compare the properties of the putative L. lactis class III enzyme with that of E. coli in order to find out to what extent the evolutionary divergence of the two microorganisms has affected the function and properties of their anaerobic reductases. Of particular interest was a comparison of their allosteric regulation. Results obtained now with the pure L. lactis enzyme show that the enzyme in many respects resembles the E. coli enzyme but also contains some distinct features. Its allosteric regulation is similar but not identical to that of the E. colireductase. L. lactis subsp. cremonis MG1363 (18.Gasson M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was grown at 30 °C in M17 medium (Difco, West Molesey, UK) as standing cultures or on M17 agar solidified with 1.5% agar, all supplemented with 0.5% glucose. Erythromycin (5 μg/ml) was added when required. Strict anaerobic growth of L. lactis was obtained after addition of 3.2 mm sodium sulfide to M17 medium as described earlier (19.Garriga X. Eliasson R. Torrents E. Jordan A. Barbé J. Gibert I. Reichard P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). E. coli strains were grown in TY (Difco) or LB medium at 37 °C with vigorous agitation or on TY or LB solidified with 1.5% agar. When required, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50–150 μg/ml kanamycin, 100 μg/ml erythromycin, or 1 mm IPTG2were used. Molecular cloning techniques were by standard procedures (20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used according to the instructions of the supplier. Genomic DNA of L. lactis was isolated according to Leenhouts et al. (21.Leenhouts K. Venema G. Meded. Fac. Landbouwkd. Toegep. Biol. Wet. Univ. Gent. 1992; 57: 2031-2043Google Scholar) with the modification that the resuspended cell pellets were incubated at 55 °C for 15 min (22.Seegers J.F.M.L. Bron S. Franke C.M. Venema G. Kiewiet R. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). E. coli and L. lactiswere transformed (23.Holo H. Nes I.F. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 3119-3123Crossref Google Scholar) by electroporation using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). In previous work (24.Buist G. Kok J. Leenhouts K.J. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Haandrikman A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) concerning the peptidoglycan hydrolase AcmA of L. lactis,the nucleotide sequence of the 1930-bpSau3AA/SspI fragment of the 4137-bp insert of plasmid pAL01, containing acmA, was determined. We now determined the sequence of the 2207-bp Sau3A/SspI fragment of the insert, after subcloning into pUK21 or pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). The 3-prime part of nrdG was sequenced from an overlapping clone, pAL18. Both strands were sequenced with a T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the sequence was completed using synthetic DNA primers, synthesized with an Applied Biosystems 381A DNA Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). DNA nucleotide and amino acid sequences were analyzed with the Clone Manager (version 5.01), the Gapped-Blast program (25.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59920) Google Scholar), and the Wisconsin package, version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI. Protein sequence alignments were performed according the ClustalW program, version 1.7 (26.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55755) Google Scholar). A 3458-bpXmnI/Eco47III fragment of pAL18, containing bothnrdD and nrdG, was subcloned into theEcoRV site of pUK21 under the Plac promotor yielding plasmid pUKDD1. This plasmid was then transformed into theE. coli nrdDG mutant UA6068 (19.Garriga X. Eliasson R. Torrents E. Jordan A. Barbé J. Gibert I. Reichard P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) giving E. coliIG016 and this strain was used for the purification of L. lactis NrdD. For NrdG overexpression, the nrdG coding sequence was amplified from pUKDD1 by PCR using the following primers: forward LlGup, 5′-ACATATGAACAATCCAAAACC-3′ and reverse LlGlow, 5′-ATATGCTCGAGTGTCCATCAG-3′. These primers were designed to generate NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, at the start and the end of the PCR fragment. The amplified product (630 bp) was purified and cloned into plasmid pGEM-T (Promega), giving plasmid pIG021. After digestion with NdeI and XhoI, the nrdG fragment was ligated into pET24a (Novagen), and the resulting plasmid (pIG022) was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The resulting strain IG017 was used for overproduction of NrdG. An internal 478-bp EcoRV-HindIII fragment of nrdDwas cloned into the integration vector pORI19 (27.Law J. Buist G. Haandrikman A.J. Kok J. Venema G. Leenhouts K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7011-7018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the RepA+E. coli helper strain EC1000 (28.Leenhouts K. Buist G. Bolhuis A. ten Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pORIDD, was used to disrupt nrdD in L. lactisMG1363 by the method described earlier (27.Law J. Buist G. Haandrikman A.J. Kok J. Venema G. Leenhouts K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7011-7018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Integrants were obtained by selection with erythromycin and checked by PCR using primers pALA18 (5′-GGCAAGAGCATCATGTG-3′), located in nrdD, and BK03AL (5′-AGCGGTAGCGCTGGAAA-3′), located in the origin of replication of pORI19. The size of the fragment (1596 bp) confirmed the successful disruption. E. coliIG016 was grown microaerophilically in 1.6-liter batches at 37 °C in LB medium containing 2% glucose, 150 μg/ml kanamycin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol with continuous flow-through of 4% CO2 and 96% N2. When the culture had reached mid-log phase (A 550 = 0.6) IPTG was added. After 2–3 h the cells were collected by centrifugation (1.6 g of packed cells) and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen. All further steps were made anaerobically and close to 4 °C. The cells were extracted (29.Eliasson R. Pontis E. Fontecave M. Gerez C. Harder H. Jörnvall H. Krook M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25541-25547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and clear crude extracts were obtained by high speed centrifugation and dialyzed overnight against buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) + 0.5 m KCl. The dialyzed solution was adjusted to 5 mg of protein/ml with the same buffer and added to a 2-ml column of dATP-Sepharose. The column was washed, first with 7 ml buffer A + 0.5 m KCl, followed by 4 ml of buffer A. NrdD was eluted with buffer A containing 0.5 mm ATP. Active fractions were combined and concentrated in Centricon 30 tubes, and dATP was removed by filtration through a Sephadex-G25 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT. E. coliIG017 was grown aerobically at 30 °C in 7 liters of LB medium until an A 550 of 0.5. IPTG was added, and after 4 h the cells were collected by centrifugation. Purification was made in air and at 4 °C. Packed cells (15 g) were extracted after addition of streptomycin sulfate (final concentration 3%) and egg white lysozyme (final concentration 1 mg/ml) (29.Eliasson R. Pontis E. Fontecave M. Gerez C. Harder H. Jörnvall H. Krook M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25541-25547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the clear crude extract (54 ml, 9.9 mg protein/ml) was precipitated with ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in a small volume of buffer B (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl, 10 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), and dialyzed overnight against buffer B with one change of buffer. After dilution to 5 mg/ml, 300 mg of protein was added to a 60-ml column of DE52 (Whatman) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was first washed with 60 ml of buffer B containing 0.1 mKCl and then with buffer B containing 0.2 m KCl. Active fractions were localized, precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation), and dissolved in 6 ml of buffer B containing 0.2m KCl. Two ml (80 mg of protein) were chromatographed in a fast protein liquid chromatography machine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a Superdex-75 26/60 Prep grade column equilibrated with buffer B at a rate of 1.3 ml/min. Each fraction was analyzed enzymatically and by Phastgel electrophoresis, and NrdG was localized from its position on the gels, corresponding to a protein of ≈25 kDa. Pure fractions were pooled, concentrated in a Centriprep-10 tube to 1 ml, and finally freed from KCl by washing with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT. The final yield from 535 mg of protein in the crude extract was 25 mg of NrdG. All solutions were kept strictly anaerobic on a manifold continuously purged with argon. A solution of 5.4 mg (= 0.23 μmol polypeptide) of NrdG (0.150 ml in two tubes) was treated for 6 h in an ice bath with 0.4 μmol of DTT, 1 μmol of Na2S, and 1 μmol of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, added in that order. In some instances 59Fe (20 μCi) was used in this step. After addition of 3 μmol of EDTA, the capped anaerobic tubes were transferred to an anaerobic hood, and the solution was passed through a 7-ml column of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol to remove excess reagents. After overnight dialysis in the anaerobic hood against 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 0.1m KCl, 10% glycerol, the dark brown solution containing reconstituted NrdG was either used directly for EPR experiments or stored in a closed tube under liquid nitrogen for experiments involving catalytic function. For analyses of the FeS cluster, 0.1 ml of the anaerobic reconstituted NrdG solution (0.3 mg of protein) was mixed with an equal volume of the dialysis buffer containing 0.1 mm deazaflavin (DAF), giving a 0.06 mm solution of the NrdG polypeptide, and transferred inside the anaerobic box to an EPR tube. The tube was irradiated from a halogen lamp in a commercial projector for 60 min to reduce the FeS cluster, frozen, and analyzed by EPR. A control sample was treated identically in the absence of DAF. The oxidized form of the iron-sulfur cluster was obtained after exposure of the thawed sample to air at room temperature. For EPR analysis of the glycyl radical, 0.10 mg of NrdG was added on the manifold to a solution of 0.24 mg of NrdD in 1.5 mm S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), 5 mm DTT, 10 mm sodium formate, 30 mm KCl, 0.1 mm DAF, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, final volume 0.2 ml. After irradiation at room temperature with visible light for 60 min, the solution was transferred in the anaerobic hood to an EPR tube and frozen for analysis. EPR first derivative spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer with X-band microwave frequency and 100-kHz field modulation frequency. Temperatures below 77 K were achieved with an Oxford Instruments continuous flow liquid helium cryostat. The 100 K measurements were accomplished by a continuous flow system for cold nitrogen gas. Spin quantitation was performed by double integration of the corresponding spectra recorded under nonsaturating conditions using a Cu-EDTA standard for calibration (30.Liu A. Pötsch S. Davydov A. Barra A.-L. Rubin H. Gräslund A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16369-16377Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The EPR relaxation behavior was studied by recording spectra at different microwave powers. The parameter P 12, the microwave power at half-saturation, was obtained as described previously (31.Sahlin M. Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 135-137Google Scholar). Ribonucleotide reductase activity was routinely measured with CTP as substrate by the procedure used earlier with the E. coli anaerobic reductase (9.Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, the anaerobic mixture of NrdD and NrdG was first irradiated with light in the presence of DAF for 30 min after which time CTP reduction was started by addition of radioactive CTP. During incubation the complete mixture consisted of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm DTT, 20 μm DAF, 0.6 mm AdoMet, 0.8 mm [3H]CTP, 1.5 mm ATP, 12.5 mm sodium formate, 75 mm KCl, and 15 mm MgCl2. After 20 min the reaction was stopped with 0.5 ml of 1 mHClO4, and the amount of dCTP formed was determined. In catalytic experiments concerning the allosteric regulation of the enzyme, [14C]ATP or [14C]GTP was substituted for CTP, and the final work-up was modified accordingly. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 nmol of product formed per min. Specific activity is units per mg of protein. Sucrose gradient centrifugations were done at 20 °C for 15 h at 35,000 rpm on 4.5 ml of 5–20% sucrose in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl as described earlier (9.Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In some experiments 0.2 mm dATP or dGTP, 2 mm ATP or 0.01 mm AdoMet was present in the gradient. Binding experiments were done at close to 0 °C with the previously described rapid filtration method (32.Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Protein was determined according to Bradford (33.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (216391) Google Scholar), with crystalline bovine serum albumin as standard. Iron analyses were as described by Fish (34.Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), and labile sulfide was determined by a scaled down procedure described by King and Morris (35.King T.E. Morris R.O. Methods Enzymol. 1964; 10: 634-641Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). During work at the University of Groningen on the gene encoding the major peptidoglycan hydrolase of L. lactis, one of us (G. B.) cloned and sequenced a stretch of DNA upstream of the hydrolase gene, resulting in the discovery of two open reading frames encoding two putative proteins of 84.2 and 23.3 kDa, respectively, with a high degree of identity to the NrdD and NrdG polypeptides of the E. coli anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase. From here on we will refer to the two genes as nrdD and nrdG, as they indeed code for an active anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase. The complete determined sequence of nrdDG is not detailed here. It is deposited in the GenBankTM under accession number U73336. nrdD (2,244 bp) and nrdG (600 bp) form one operon, with 2 bp separating the two genes. Putative ribosome binding sequences, complementary to the 3′-end of the Lactococcus16 S RNA (36.Chiaruttini C. Milet M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 57-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), were located 7 nucleotides upstream of nrdD(GAGGA) and 6 nucleotides upstream of nrdG (GGAG), the latter within the reading frame of nrdD indicating tight translational coupling of the two genes. Upstream of the ribosome binding sequence of nrdD an extended −10 sequence (TGNTAGAAT) is present. The deduced 747-amino acid-long NrdD protein shows an overall identity of 53% with the NrdD protein of E. coli NrdD. At the carboxyl-terminal end, the glycyl residue in the sequence KRTCGYL, which is homologous to the sequence RRVCGYL in E. coli, can harbor the putative stable free radical involved in catalysis (13.Sun X. Ollagnier S. Schmidt P.P. Atta M. Mulliez E. Lepape L. Eliasson R. Gräslund A. Fontecave M. Reichard P. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6828-6831Google Scholar). The two cysteines of the active site that are conserved in all ribonucleotide reductases (6.Sjöberg B.-M. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 88: 139-173Crossref Google Scholar,17.Logan D. Andersson J. Sjöberg B.-M. Nordlund P. Science. 1999; 283: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) are found at positions 187 and 398. The amino-terminal sequence contains in the appropriate positions the residues required for binding of the allosteric effectors at the activity site (37.Eliasson R. Pontis E. Jordan A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7182-7189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The deduced NrdG protein contains 199 amino acids and shows an overall identity of 42% with the E. coli NrdG protein with a particularly high degree of identity at the amino terminus where three conserved cysteines probably are involved in binding of an FeS center. The nrdD gene of L. lactis was disrupted by insertion of the integration vector pORI19. The bacteria now relied exclusively on the aerobic nrdEF genes. They grew well in the presence of oxygen but also to some extent under microaerophilic conditions, as is the case with nrdD andnrdG mutants of E. coli (19.Garriga X. Eliasson R. Torrents E. Jordan A. Barbé J. Gibert I. Reichard P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, when oxygen was excluded completely by inclusion of sulfide in the medium, the mutant did not grow (Fig. 1), demonstrating the importance of nrdD during strict anaerobiosis. E. coli strain IG016 lacking active nrdDG host genes overproduces both lactococcal NrdD and NrdG proteins. NrdD was purified from this strain. On denaturing gels the final NrdD preparation gave a double band at ≈74 and 84 kDa, similar to E. coli NrdD (4.Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8383-8386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is due to truncation of the proteins at the site of the glycyl radical (38.King D. Reichard P. Biochem. Biophys."

Their erythroid-specific promoters and enhancers all have GATA1, NF-E2, and CACCC elements that bind transcriptional factors to facilitate the high level expression of these transcripts in erythroid cells. Of the remaining five genes in the pathway, each has been shown to be a single gene with a single promoter containing both erythroid-specific binding elements for enhanced erythroid expression and housekeeping elements for constitutive expression in all cells (6.Taketani S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 510-516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme functions as both an isomerase and a cyclase as it catalyzes the intramolecular rearrangement of the pyrrole ring D and tetrapyrrole ring closure of the linear tetrapyrrole, respectively (14.Battersby A.R.

In the absence of URO-synthase activity, hydroxymethylbilane is nonenzymatically cyclized to form the nonphysiologic uroporphyrinogen I isomer, which is then oxidized to uroporphyrin I, a nonmetabolizable and pathogenic compound. URO-synthase has been purified to homogeneity from human erythrocytes, rat liver, Euglena gracilis, andEscherichia coli (16.Tsai S.F. Bishop D.F. Desnick R.J. J. Biol.

The human enzyme has been shown to be a monomeric protein with an apparent molecular mass of 29.5 kDa. Mammalian cDNAs encoding human and mouse URO-synthase have been isolated and expressed in E. coli by our laboratory (21.Tsai S.F. Bishop D.F. Desnick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7049-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,22.Xu W. Kozak C.A. Desnick R.J. Genomics. 1995; 26: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both the mouse and human URO-synthase cDNAs had open reading frames of 798 bp that encoded polypeptides of 265 amino acids. The murine cDNA and predicted amino acid sequences were 81 and 78% identical with the corresponding human sequences, respectively (22.Xu W. Kozak C.A. Desnick R.J. Genomics. 1995; 26: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, URO-synthase cDNAs have been isolated from various bacteria, yeast, and rat (for a review, see Ref. 23.Shoolingin-Jordan P.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and their significant homologies provided further evidence for a single URO-synthase gene in prokaryotes as well as in the animal kingdom.The markedly deficient, but not absent, activity of URO-synthase is the enzymatic defect in congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), an inborn error of heme biosynthesis that occurs in humans and cattle (24.Romeo G. Levin E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 63: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25.Romeo G. Kaback M.M. Levin E.Y. Biochem.

The enzymatic defect results in the erythroid accumulation of uroporphyrinogen I, which leads to the clinical manifestations. In humans, the disease is clinically heterogeneous and ranges from nonimmune hydrops fetalis to a severe transfusion-dependent anemia of childhood to a milder disorder characterized primarily by light-induced cutaneous lesions (for a review, see Ref. 27.Desnick R.J. Glass I.A. Xu W. Solis C. Astrin K.H. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A variety of mutations that cause CEP have been identified in the human URO-synthase gene providing genotype/phenotype correlations for the marked clinical variability (e.g. see Refs. 28.Boulechfar S. Da Silva V. Deybach J.C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. de Verneuil H. Hum. Genet. 1992; 88: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29.Warner C.A. Yoo H.W. Roberts A.G. Desnick R.J. J. Clin.

However, about 15% of the mutant alleles causing this erythropoietic porphyria have not been identified (27.Desnick R.J. Glass I.A. Xu W. Solis C. Astrin K.H. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).To date, no mammalian genomic sequence encoding URO-synthase has been reported. Chromosome mapping studies of human and murine URO-synthase localized the respective genes to a single locus at human chromosome 10q25.2 → q26.3 (31.Astrin K.H. Warner C.A. Yoo H.W. Goodfellow P.J. Tsai S.F. Desnick R.J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 87: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and to a single locus on murine chromosome 7, in a region of conserved synteny with human chromosome 10 (22.Xu W. Kozak C.A. Desnick R.J. Genomics. 1995; 26: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These findings were consistent with a single gene coding for URO-synthase in mice and humans. Thus, an investigation was undertaken to isolate and characterize the murine URO-synthase genomic sequence and to determine if mouse URO-synthase had erythroid-specific regulation. In this paper, we report that the mouse URO-synthase gene has distinct erythroid and housekeeping promoters that generate three different transcripts, one being erythroid-specific. In addition, the genomic organization, promoter sequences, and 5′ transcription start sites of the alternative transcripts were determined, and erythroid-specific expression was demonstrated in MEL and human K562 cells.DISCUSSIONHeme is the essential pigment of life and is the prosthetic group in hemoglobin, myoglobin, the cytochromes, and many other hemoproteins. In mammals, approximately 85% of heme synthesis occurs in erythroid cells, indicating the importance of the erythroid-specific production. The deficient activity of the individual enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway results in a group of disorders known as the porphyrias, which have been classified as hepatic or erythroid based on their clinical manifestations (39.Kappas A. Sassa S. Galbraith R.A. Nordmann Y. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. 2.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7187-7188Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and other laboratories (9.Grandchamp B. De Verneuil H. Beaumont C. Chretien S. Walter O. Nordmann Y. Eur. J.

A. 1988; 85: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the first three enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway have unique erythroid-specific and housekeeping transcripts encoded by a single gene or by different genes. However, recent evidence suggested that each of the remaining five genes in the pathway had a single transcript under the control of a single promoter that contained the canonical binding sites for erythroid expression including GATA1, the CACCC-binding protein, and, usually, NE-F2 (6.Taketani S.

Genet. 1991; 87: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Of these genes, only URO-synthase had not been isolated; nor had its erythroid-specific regulation been investigated.In this paper, we report that the murine URO-synthase gene has distinct housekeeping and erythroid-specific promoters, the latter controlling its erythroid-specific expression. The existence of the mouse URO-synthase erythroid-specific promoter was suggested by 5′-RACE experiments with splenic total RNA, which revealed two 5′-UTRs (1A and 2A) that differed from the previously reported mouse URO-synthase cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession no. U16216; Ref.22.Xu W. Kozak C.A. Desnick R.J. Genomics. 1995; 26: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A computer-assisted BLAST search of the mouse EST data base with the three 5′ sequences identified an exon 1A-containing URO-synthase sequence from mouse mammary gland (GenBankTM accession no.AA980856) and an exon 2A URO-synthase cDNA from mouse fetal tissue (GenBankTM accession no. AA272198). The presence of an exon 1A transcript from mammary gland and an exon 2A transcript from fetal tissue supported the notion of housekeeping and erythroid-specific transcripts encoded by a single URO-synthase gene with alternative 5′-UTRs and promoters.Characterization of the mouse URO-synthase gene from a P1 library revealed an approximately 24-kb sequence containing 10 exons. The exon 1A sequence or the entire exon 1 (1A/1B) was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues studied, and one or the other was alternatively spliced directly to the coding exons, beginning with exon 2B. In contrast, exon 2A was expressed only in erythroid tissues with transcription initiated from a 31-bp 5′ extension of exon 2B, such that the entire erythroid message encoded the same polypeptide as the housekeeping transcript. Thus, the expression of the mouse URO-synthase gene, with unique transcripts resulting from housekeeping and erythroid-specific promoters, was similar to the expression of the human and mouse Δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase (2.Kaya A.H. Plewinska M. Wong D.M. Desnick R.J. Wetmur J.G. Genomics. 1994; 19: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 42.Bishop T.R. Miller M.W. Frelin L.P. Dierks P. Boyer S.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. Suppl. 1991; 49: 425Google Scholar) and hydroxymethylbilane synthase genes (9.Grandchamp B. De Verneuil H. Beaumont C. Chretien S. Walter O. Nordmann Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 41.Chretien S. Dubart A. Beaupain D. Raich N. Grandchamp B. Rosa J. Goossens M. Romeo P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 43.Beaumont C. Porcher C. Picat C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two promoters generate transcripts in all three genes that differ in their 5′-UTRs; their transcripts encode the identical or essentially identical polypeptides, the housekeeping promoters are located upstream of the first exon, and the erythroid-specific promoters are in intron 1, immediately upstream from exon 2 in each gene. Unique to the URO-synthase gene, exon 1 undergoes alternative splicing with either exon 1A or the entire exon 1 (1A/1B), as shown in Figs. 2 A and 4. The functional basis of the two housekeeping transcripts is not known.The functional analysis of the erythroid and housekeeping promoter sequences revealed that the erythroid promoter was active only in erythroid cells, indicating its erythroid specificity (Fig. 7), while the housekeeping promoter was active in erythroid (MEL) and nonerythroid (NIH 3T3) cells. Me2SO-induced erythroid differentiation of the MEL cells increased the activity of both promoters (Fig. 7 B). Nevertheless, the erythroid promoter was more responsive to erythroid differentiation, as the ratio of erythroid to housekeeping activity increased from 0.6 to 1.6 (Fig.7 B). Moreover, the murine erythroid promoter/reporter construct was highly active in uninduced and induced human K562 cells (Table III). Of particular relevance, site-specific mutagenesis of the first GATA1 binding element in the murine erythroid promoter markedly reduced promoter/reporter activity in both uninduced and induced K562 cells. The fact that the wild type construct was highly expressed in these human erythroleukemia cells and the fact that the GATA1 site point mutation essentially eliminated promoter/reporter construct activity indicated that the function of the murine erythroid promoter was highly conserved and that the first GATA1 site was functional in both murine and human erythroid cells.Transcriptional activities of the housekeeping and erythroid promoters during erythroid differentiation also were similar to each other for the 5-aminolevulinate dehydratase and the hydroxymethylbilane synthase genes (43.Beaumont C. Porcher C. Picat C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Bishop T.R. Miller M.W. Beall J. Zon L.I. Dierks P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2511-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Of note, however, the ratio of the URO-synthase erythroid to housekeeping 5′-UTRs in the mouse spleen was 31:1 in the RACE experiments. Since only ∼1.7- and ∼1.6-kb promoter sequences for the housekeeping and erythroid promoter, respectively, were analyzed, and since the in vitro expression of a reporter gene does not necessarily reproduce the in vivo situation, it is likely that other regulatory sequences in the URO-synthase gene regulate the activity of these promoters by either enhancing the activity of the erythroid promoter or inhibiting the activity of the housekeeping promoter. For example, while transcription initiation from the murine hydroxymethylbilane synthase housekeeping promoter was high in MEL cells, it was blocked from elongation (43.Beaumont C. Porcher C. Picat C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Porcher C. Picat C. Daegelen D. Beaumont C. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17368-17374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).The transcription factor consensus binding sites in the erythroid URO-synthase promoter region (Fig. 6) that are significant with respect to erythroid-specific control of transcription include vMYB (nt −27), GATA1 (nt −63, −200, and −383), E47 (nt −146 and −160), a CCAAT box (nt −324), and an NF-E2-like site (nt −400). GATA1 is essential for erythroid development. In chimeric embryos or mice with a GATA1 knockout, erythroid differentiation fails to proceed beyond the proerythroblast stage (46.Pevny L. Lin C.S. D'Agati V. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Costantini F. Development. 1995; 121: 163-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E47 has been shown to be a DNA binding partner of GATA1 and Tal1 in the formation of a transcriptional transactivating complex in erythroid cells (47.Wadman I.A. Osada H. Grutz G.G. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) and may play a supporting role in the erythroid-specific control of URO-synthase expression. CCAAT is an enhancer element bound by a family of ubiquitous and tissue-specific factors (e.g. NF-Y (48.Teerawatanasuk N. Carr L.G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 55: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar)), which enhance the transcription of many eukaryotic genes. It occurs more frequently in TATA-less promoters (49.Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and presumably participates in the activation of erythroid URO-synthase transcription. The coincidence of the multiple Inr sites, also found in other TATA-less promoters (50.Minta J.O. Fung M. Turner S. Eren R. Zemach L. Rits M. Goldberger G. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the clusters of 5′-RACE ends suggest that these are the functional cap sites for the URO-synthase erythroid transcripts. MYB is a protein target for binding by the murine c-Maf protein, and this complex has been shown to inhibit gene expression in myeloid cells (51.Hedge S.P. Kumar A. Kurschner C. Shapiro L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2729-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Interestingly, c-Myb knockout mice die in utero from a severe anemia due to an inability to switch from yolk sac to fetal liver erythropoiesis (52.Lin H.H. Sternfeld D.C. Shinpock S.G. Popp R.A.

Finally, NF-E2 is important in the chromatin remodeling process required to prepare a promoter region for transcription. The NF-E2 element in the β-globin locus control region was shown to direct chromatin remodeling in the promoter region of the epsilon-globin gene in a functional minichromosome, activating it for erythroid-specific transcription (53.Gong Q.H. McDowell J.C. Dean A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6055-6064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, NF-E2 knockout mice were only mildly anemic and hypochromic but had no platelets and died of a bleeding diathesis (54.Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8690-8694Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), indicating the primary role of this transcription factor in megakaryocyte maturation. Functional analyses with promoter-reporter constructs in various cell types coupled with footprint and EMSA analyses would facilitate the delineation of transcription factor binding site occupancy for these putative binding sites and for those discussed below for the housekeeping promoter.Many of the transcription factor binding sites in the URO-synthase housekeeping promoter (Fig. 5) are used by ubiquitously expressed transcription factors (Sp1, NF1, AP1, Oct1, and NRF2), which would provide appropriate basal expression of the housekeeping URO-synthase transcripts in a variety of cell types. For example, NRF2 (nuclear respiratory factor-2) is a ubiquitously expressed activator of various nuclear encoded proteins involved in cellular respiration such as rat cytochrome C (55.Virbasius J.V. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and in the housekeeping 5-aminolevulinate synthase promoter (56.Braidotti G. Borthwick I.A. May B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1109-1117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the URO-synthase housekeeping promoter had several binding sites for factors that might modulate expression for specific tissue needs, including Mzf1, a myeloid-specific transcription factor (57.Hromas R. Davis B. Rauscher III, F.J. Klemsz M. Tenen D. Hoffman S. Xu D. Morris J.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is an Sp1 site immediately 5′ of the Ets site at −253 to −258 (Fig. 5), and this particular arrangement and orientation of the two elements has been associated with transcriptional regulation complexes in viral and cellular genes (59.Gegonne A. Bosselut R. Bailly R.A. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,60.Dupriez V.J. Darville M.I. Antoine I.V. Gegonne A. Ghysdael J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl.

The ability of Ets1 to form ternary complexes with various factors permitting gene activation or repression (e.g. see Ref. 61.Dittmer J. Pise-Masison C.A. Clemens K.E. Choi K.S. Brady J.N. J. Biol.

The use of an alternative erythroid-specific promoter is likely in the human URO-synthase gene, since the gene organization and regulation of the other murine and human heme biosynthetic genes are highly homologous. For example, the first and rate-limiting enzyme, 5-aminolevulinate synthase, is encoded by erythroid-specific and housekeeping transcripts of separate genes (62.Riddle R.D. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D.

Murine and human 5-aminolevulinate dehydratase and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (also known as porphobilinogen deaminase), the second and third enzymes in the pathway, have alternative promoters in both genes in both species controlling the synthesis of erythroid-specific and housekeeping transcripts (2.Kaya A.H.

These domains encompass a putative calmodulin (CaM) binding domain and two protein kinase A phosphorylation sites. Both long and short fusion proteins retained the ability to bind CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner as measured by CaM-Sepharose chromatography or a dansyl-CaM fluorescence assay. Both assays indicated that the short fusion protein bound twice the amount of CaM than the long form at saturating concentrations of CaM. In addition, the binding of the short form to CaM-Sepharose was inhibited by phosphorylation with protein kinase A, whereas the binding of the long form was unaffected. Full-length cDNAs encoding type-I long, type-I short, and type-III IP3R isoforms were expressed in COS cells, and the Ca2+ sensitivity of [3H]IP3binding to permeabilized cells was measured. The type-I long isoform was more sensitive to Ca2+ inhibition (IC50 = 0.55 μm) than the type-I short (IC50 = 5.7 μm) or the type-III isoform (IC50 = 3 μm). In agreement with studies on the fusion proteins, the full-length type-I short bound more CaM-Sepharose, and this binding was inhibited to a greater extent by protein kinase A phosphorylation than the type-I long IP3R. Although type-III IP3Rs did not bind directly to CaM-Sepharose, hetero-oligomers of type-I/III IP3Rs retained the ability to interact with CaM. We conclude that the deletion of the SII splice site in the type-I IP3R results in the differential regulation of the alternatively spliced isoforms by Ca2+, CaM, and protein kinase A.

All 3 isoforms share approximately 70% homology and are organized into three functional domains: an N-terminal ligand binding domain, a central regulatory domain, and a C-terminal channel domain. Functional channels are believed to be tetrameric. Individual cell types can express more than one isoform, which may be present as homo- or heterotetrameric populations (3.Joseph S.K. Lin C.

The functional role of isoform diversity has not been established.The gene encoding the type-I isoform is subject to alternative splicing and gives rise to three splice variants that have been denoted as S1, S2, and S3 (6.Mignery G.A.

Functional studies comparing the S1(−) and S1(+) forms of the type-I IP3R have not revealed any marked differences in ligand binding or channel function (9.Newton C.L. Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. J.

Both short and long forms of S1 and S3 appear to co-exist in the same tissues (7.Nakagawa T. Okano H. Furuichi T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, the expression of the S2 insert is more stringent with the S2 insert being present in neurons and absent from the type-I IP3Rs of peripheral tissues (7.Nakagawa T. Okano H. Furuichi T.

Both serine residues can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (13.Ferris C.D. Cameron A.M. Bredt D.S. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Hence, the presence or absence of the S2 splice site may modify regulation of type-I IP3Rs. For example, there is evidence that the deletion of the S2 region can alter the serine that is preferentially phosphorylated by protein kinase A (12.Danoff S.K. Ferris C.D. Donath C. Fischer G.A. Munemitsu S. Ullrich A. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2951-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). There is also experimental evidence to suggest that the effects of protein kinase A phosphorylation on IP3-gated channels in neuronal and peripheral tissues are different (reviewed in Josephet al. (19.Joseph S.K. Boehning D.B. Lin C. Putney J.W. Methods in Calcium Signaling Research. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1999Google Scholar)). The Ca2+ regulation of [3H]IP3 binding to cerebellum membranes (S2(+)) is also different from that observed in a number of tissues that express high amounts of the S2(−) form of the type-I IP3R, e.g. vas deferens (20.Mourey R.J. Verma A. Supattapone S. Snyder S.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to definitively attribute such differences solely to the presence of the alternatively spliced forms of the type-I IP3R, and the basis for these differences is not well understood. In the present study we have utilized GST fusion proteins encoding IP3R regulatory domains and full-length S2 long and short recombinant IP3Rs expressed in COS-7 cells to compare the Ca2+/CaM and protein kinase A regulation of the S2 alternatively spliced isoforms of the type-I IP3R. The data suggest that the regulatory properties of these two alternatively spliced isoforms may be markedly influenced by differences in their interactions with CaM.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPfu polymerase was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Stabilized acrylamide solution (Protogel) for the preparation of SDS gels was obtained from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc. Polyamine transfection reagent LT-1 was from PanVera Corp. (Madison, WI).

[3H]IP3 and [γ-32P]ATP were from NEN Life Science Products. The type-I IP3R cDNA was kindly given by Dr. Thomas Sudhof (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and was in the expression plasmid pCMVI-9 (6.Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that this plasmid is S1(−), S2(+), and S3(+). The type-III IP3R cDNA was kindly given by Dr. Graeme Bell (University of Chicago, IL) and was in the expression plasmid pCB6 (21.Blondel O. Takeda J. Janssen H. Seino S. Bell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11356-11363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmids used for transfection were purified by CsCl banding (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York1989Google Scholar).Construction of PlasmidspGEX-RDLThe region encoding the SII+ splice site corresponding to amino acids 1314–1906 was PCR-amplified usingPfu polymerase. Full-length rat type-I IP3R cDNA was used as a template. The forward primer (SK-forward) encoded a BamHI site (5′-tttggatccactattgtcaaggccgaa-3′), and the reverse primer (SK-reverse) encoded an EcoRI site (5′-cgggaattctgttgtgggctctttggc-3′). The PCR product was digested withBamHI/EcoRI and ligated intoBamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX-2T plasmid. We refer to the GST fusion protein encoded by this plasmid as regulatory domain long (GST-RDL).pGEX-RDSThe construct from which SII had been deleted was made by ligating two fragments (F1 and F2) made by PCR using rat type-I cDNA as a template. F1 corresponding to amino acids 1314–1692 was made using the SK-forward primer and an F1 reverse primer (5′-cttttctccgtagtcaaggccgaa-3′). F2 corresponding to amino acids 1733–1906 was made using an F2 forward primer (5′-ggtgaggcactacgacaaattttggtc-3′) and the SK-reverse primer. Both F1 and F2 primers were used in the PCR reaction after phosphorylation with T4 polynucleotide kinase. The F1 and F2 PCR products were ligated together, digested with BamHI/EcoRI, and ligated into BamHI/EcoRI pGEX-2T plasmid. We refer to the GST fusion protein encoded by this plasmid as regulatory domain short (GST-RDS).Type-I IP3R (short)Deletion of the SII region from the full-length type-I IP3R was accomplished using the pGEX2T-RDS plasmid. The SII site is flanked by unique restriction sites for SphI and NarI. These enzymes were used to excise the 954-base pair fragment from pGEX2T-RDS. Type-I IP3R DNA was digested with KpnI/NarI, and the 4146-base pair fragment was gel-purified and further digested with SphI. The 3152 base pairKpnI/SphI digestion product was ligated to theSphI/NarI fragment obtained from pGEX2T-RDS. The resulting KpnI/NarI fragment was ligated intoKpnI/NarI-digested type-I IP3R DNA plasmid.Purification of GST Fusion ProteinsBacterial cultures of pGEX-RDL or pGEX-RDS were grown at 37 °C in a volume of 500 ml of Luria broth/ampicillin (100 μg/ml) until an A 600 of 1.0 was reached. Induction of the GST fusion protein was carried out by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm) and incubation for 2 h at 25 °C. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifuging for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 5 μg/ml protease inhibitors (trypsin inhibitor, benzamidine, aprotinin). The bacteria were lysed by incubation with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and Triton X-100 (1%) for 20 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a column of glutathione-agarose (1-ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed extensively with lysis buffer until theA 280 reading reached background. The column was then eluted with 5 × 2 ml of elution buffer (50 mmTris (pH 8.0), 10 mm reduced glutathione). Protein was measured, and the peak fractions were pooled, concentrated using a Biomax-10,000 centrifugal concentration device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and stored at −80 °C. Starting from 600 ml of culture, our average protein yields for RDL and RDS were 1 mg and 0.4 mg, respectively.Cell Culture and TransfectionWB rat liver epithelial cells (23.Tsao M.S. Smith J.D. Nelson K.G. Grisham J.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 154: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) were grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes in Richter's minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were grown to approximately 70% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with TransIT LT-1 reagent (PanVera, Madison, WI) using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Routinely, 20–30 μg of DNA was used for transfecting a single 75-cm2 flask. Unless otherwise stated, lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection using WB solubilization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5× dilution of a commercial mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)).Calmodulin-Sepharose Binding AssayFusion proteins (20 μg of protein) or lysates from transfected cells were incubated with 50 μl of CaM-Sepharose (50% v/v slurry) in a final volume of 500 μl in buffer A (0.2 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mm CaCl2) or buffer B (buffer A in which 0.5 mm CaCl2 was replaced by 0.5 mmEGTA). After 90 min at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged (12,000 × g, 20 s), and the CaM-Sepharose beads were washed once in either buffer A or B. The fusion protein remaining in the supernatant was concentrated by the addition of 30 μl of Strataclean beads (Stratagene). When cell lysates were used, the IP3R remaining in the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with IP3R Ab directed to the C-terminal tail of the type-I IP3R (CT-1 Ab (24.Joseph S. Samanta S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6477-6486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Fusion proteins were detected by immunoblotting with a type I IP3R Ab (ABR-Ab) recognizing an epitope common to both fusion proteins (corresponding to amino acids 1885–1903 in type-I long) (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO). Full-length type-I IP3Rs were detected on immunoblots with CT-1 Ab.The concentration of type-I long and short IP3R isoforms in COS cell lysates was determined as described previously (25.Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates from transfected COS cells were subjected to two consecutive rounds of immunoprecipitation with CT-1 Ab; the first, overnight, and the second, for 2 h. The recombinant IP3Rs in the pooled immunoprecipitates could be easily visualized by Coomassie staining of 5% SDS-PAGE gels. The magnitude of the staining in different amounts of lysate protein was quantitated by densitometry and calibrated with reference to a standard curve of myosin run on the same gel. The concentration of IP3R was calculated after correction for the difference in the molecular weights of myosin and IP3Rs. Values for expression ranged from 24 to 46 fmol of IP3R/μg of lysate protein, which is in the range of values observed in the cerebellum (25.Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol.

The buffer used for these assays (2 ml) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm EGTA.32P IncorporationThe GST-RDL and -RDS were incubated in 50 μl of the phosphorylation reaction buffer (120 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.3 mm MgCl2, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]-ATP) with or without protein kinase A (5 units) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with SDS-PAGE solubilization buffer. The sample was run on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and labeled polypeptides were visualized by autoradiography. In some experiments, the nitrocellulose was immunoblotted with ABR-Ab to locate the fusion proteins.Ca2+ Sensitivity of [3H]IP3Binding to Full-length IP3Rs Expressed in COS CellsCOS-7 cells transfected with type I-long, type I-short, or type III IP3Rs were harvested by trypsinization. The cells were centrifuged (150 × g for 30 s) and resuspended in HRB-HEDTA buffer (120 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-Hepes (pH 7.2), 2 mm HEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor) and permeabilized with saponin (10 μg/mg protein). An aliquot of the permeabilized cells (0.8 ml) was incubated with 0.8 ml of a label medium containing 120 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-Hepes (pH 7.2), 10 nm[3H]IP3, and different amounts of CaCl2. The Ca2+ concentrations required to generate a range of free Ca2+ concentrations were measured with a Ca2+-sensitive mini-electrode calibrated with reference to commercial standards (WPI, Sarasota, FL). After incubation on ice for 5 min, triplicate 0.5-ml samples were vacuum-filtered through A/E glass-fiber filters (Gelman Science, Ann Arbor, MI), and the filters were washed with buffer containing 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The filters were counted in scintillation fluid (Budget Solve, RPI Corp., Mount Prospect, IL). There was no evidence for Ca2+activation of phospholipase C in the permeabilized COS cells under the conditions used for the binding assay as determined using a mass assay kit for IP3 (NEN Life Science Products).DISCUSSIONThe present study is the first to compare the properties of the S2 alternatively spliced forms of the type-I IP3R using the recombinant isoforms expressed in a single cell type. The main findings of the present study were that the S2(−) short form of the type-I IP3R was different in three respects from the long form of the receptor. (a) The short form bound more CaM, (b) ligand binding to the short form was less sensitive to inhibition by Ca2+, and (c) CaM binding to the short form was inhibited by protein kinase A phosphorylation, whereas CaM binding to the long form was insensitive to protein kinase A phosphorylation.The observation that almost twice as much CaM bound to the short than the long form using saturating concentrations of CaM was made using both fusion proteins and full-length IP3Rs. We conclude that deletion of the S2 domain must create an additional binding site for CaM and that this site must lie within the sequences delimited by the fusion protein. One possibility is that the deletion of the S2 region may generate a new CaM binding site from the sequences flanking the splice site, as previously suggested by Islam et. al.(11.Islam M.O. Yoshida Y. Koga T. Kojima M. Kangawa K. Imai S. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequence of the regulatory domain using multiple computer programs that predict tertiary structure indicates that the sequences immediately proximal to the S2 splice site form a helix with hydrophobic residues clustered on one side and positively charged residues clustered on the other (data not shown). Such amphipathic helices have been implicated as CaM binding domains (30.O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biol. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), and it is possible that this proximal helix may be differentially exposed in the short and long isoforms.We have measured the effect of Ca2+ on [3H]IP3 binding to the type-I long and short IP3Rs transiently expressed in COS cells. Under the conditions of these experiments the contribution of endogenous IP3Rs to ligand binding was low. It is well established that ligand binding to the native type-I long IP3R isoform present in cerebellar membranes is markedly inhibited by Ca2+ by a mechanism that involves an accessory protein (2.Taylor C.W. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1998; 1436: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,31.Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Supattapone S. Wilson V.S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12132-12136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Danoff S.K. Supattapone S. Snyder S.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ligand binding by Ca2+ was also observed for both the recombinant type-I long and short IP3Rs expressed in COS cells. However, the inhibition of the type-I short IP3R isoform occurred with a 10-fold lower sensitivity. The lower sensitivity to Ca2+ is unlikely to be due to altered CaM binding sites, since the short isoform actually bound more CaM and with higher affinity than the long isoform. It is also unlikely that the differences arise from depletion of calmodulin or other endogenous accessory proteins, since the differences in IC50 for Ca2+ were maintained over a wide range of expression levels (Fig. 4 C). At least eight45Ca2+ binding sites have been identified in the primary sequence of the type-I IP3R (15.Sienaert I. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25899-25906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), including one in the vicinity of the S2 domain (Fig. 1 A). It is possible that one of these sites is responsible for modulation of ligand binding and that the affinity of this site for Ca2+ is different in the alternatively spliced isoforms. An alternative possibility is raised by the recent finding that the addition of CaM inhibits [3H]IP3 binding to full-length type-I IP3Rs (33.Patel S. Morris S.A. Adkins C.E. O'Beirne G. Taylor C.W.

De Smedt H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12157-12162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The affinity for Ca2+/CaM at an interaction site in the ligand binding domain of the receptor could be different in the two alternatively spliced isoforms. It should be noted that the effect of CaM on ligand binding occurs in the absence of added Ca2+ (33.Patel S. Morris S.A. Adkins C.E. O'Beirne G. Taylor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 34.Cardy T.J. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35.Sipma H. De Smet P.

We observe negligible binding of CaM-Sepharose to IP3Rs in the absence of Ca2+, suggesting that the CaM interaction site in the ligand binding domain is not detected by our assay conditions.We have found that Ca2+ inhibited [3H]IP3 binding to type-III IP3Rs expressed in COS cells with an IC50 intermediate between type-I long and short isoforms. This result is in contrast to the stimulatory (27.Yoneshima H. Miyawaki A. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or biphasic (28.Cardy T.J.A. Traynor D. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) effects of Ca2+ on ligand binding reported in studies using the Sf9 expression system. The reasons for these differences are unclear but may be due to differences in the ancillary regulatory proteins present in the COS and insect cell expression systems. It is apparent that in COS cells, the behavior of the type-III IP3R is qualitatively similar to that observed for the type-I IP3R isoforms. Homo-tetrameric IP3Rs expressed in Sf9 cells do not bind to CaM-Sepharose, presumably because the CaM binding sequence present the regulatory domain of the type-I and type-II isoforms is missing in the type-III IP3R (16.Yamada Y. Miyawaki A. Saito K. Nakajima T. Yamamoto-Hino M. Ryo Y. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This suggests that Ca2+ binding sites or other CaM interaction sites (such as those identified in the ligand binding domain of the type-I isoform) may be responsible for the modulation of the Ca2+sensitivity of the type-III IP3R. In the present study we show that hetero-oligomers of type-I and type-III IP3Rs can bind to CaM-Sepharose in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This suggests that the binding of CaM to the type-I IP3R is a dominant effect and introduces the possibility that the Ca2+ modulation of type-I/III IP3R hybrid channels may be dictated by the Ca2+ regulatory properties of the type-I IP3R isoform.Myosin light chain kinase (36.Lukas T.J.

MST3b was assigned to the long arm of human chromosome 13, D13S159–D13S280, by use of the National Center for Biotechnology Information sequence-tagged sites data base. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis with a probe derived from 5′ distinct sequence of MST3b revealed that the expression of MST3b mRNA is restricted to the brain, in contrast to ubiquitous distribution of MST3 transcript. Western analysis confirmed the brain-specific expression of MST3b protein. In situ hybridization of rat brain sections with a MST3b-specific probe indicated that MST3b is widely expressed in different brain regions, with especially high expression in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. When expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, MST3b effectively phosphorylated myelin basic protein, as well as undergoing autophosphorylation. Interestingly, expression of MST3, but not MST3b, in HEK293 cells was able to activate the endogenous p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) up to 4-fold, whereas neither isoform activated p38 MAPK under the same conditions. Further experiments demonstrated that MST3b, but not MST3, was effectively phosphorylated by activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in both in vivo and in vitro assays. The mutation of Thr-18 into Ala in MST3b (T18A), a putative PKA phosphorylation site that is absent in MST3, abolished its phosphorylation by PKA. Consequently, expression of the T18A mutant in HEK293 cells led to partial activation of p42/44 MAPK, indicating that MST3b is under the regulation of PKA.

Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) and germinal center kinase (GCK) (7.Katz P. Whalen G. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol.

Signal. 1997; 9: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Kinases related to STE20 can be divided into two subfamilies based on their structure and regulation. The first subfamily, termed the PAK subfamily, contains a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain and an amino-terminal regulatory domain with a p21Rac/Cdc42-binding domain and, in some cases, a pleckstrin homology domain as well. Overexpression of PAKs can activate both p38 MAPK and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) but not p42/44 MAPK in a number of cell types (9.Paul A. Wilson S. Belham C.M. Robinson C.J. Scott P.H.

Furthermore, little is known about how STE20-like kinases and their signaling pathways are regulated by other cell signaling pathways, such as cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein kinase C. Recently, considerable convergence as well as cross-talk has been demonstrated between PKA pathway and MAPK pathway. PKA is a mediator of the actions of hormones and neurotransmittters that activate adenylyl cyclase and increase intracellular cyclic AMP via the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (24.Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 25.Walsh D.A. Van Patten S.M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). PKA can phosphorylate a series of specific target proteins and play central roles in the regulation of many fundamentally important physiologic processes (24.Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar,25.Walsh D.A. Van Patten S.M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). PKA down-regulates the activity of Raf-1 kinase by phosphorylation of Ser-621 in Raf (26.Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philip A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), in contrast to the activation of p42/44 MAPK and the transcription factor Elk-1 by PKA through a B-Raf and Rap1-dependent pathway (27.Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported recently that PKA can activate p42/44 MAPK effectively through phosphorylation of Ser-23 in hematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatase (28.Saxena M. Williams S. Tasken K. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether PKA can regulate STE20-like kinases, which are upstream kinases of MAPK pathways. In this report, we have demonstrated that MST3b, a human brain-specific STE20-like kinase, can be negatively regulated by PKA in its functional activation of p42/44 MAPK signaling pathway. The expressed sequence tag data base of GenBankTM was searched with the conservative catalytic domain sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae STE20 (GenBankTM accession number M94719, amino acids 620–876) as probe by BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) at the Web site of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (29.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70747) Google Scholar, 30.Boguski M.S. Tolstoshev C.M. Bassett Jr., D.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1993-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′ RACE) was then performed using human brain Marathon cDNA library (CLONTECH) with two gene-specific primers (5′-GACTGTCACACTGACTCAGCACT-3′ and 5′-GAGCCTCCACCAAGATATTCCA-3′) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) bands obtained were gel-purified and ligated into pGEM-T vector (Promega). After the bands were examined with DNA sequencing using dideoxy-mediated chain-termination and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, two distinct clones of MST3 with different 5′ end were identified. For genome mapping, the entire sequence of the two cDNA clones was used as a query in BLAST search and electronic PCR analysis (31.Schuler G.D. Genome. Res. 1997; 7: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) in the National Center for Biotechnology Information sequence-tagged site (STS) data base. Total RNA from human various tissues was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA was then synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Primers used for RT-PCR were two forward primers (5′-TTACTGACGAAGCCTTATCCT-3′ (base pairs 111–132 in MST3b) and 5′-TGGCCGTCCTGAGCGCCATG-3 (base pairs 61–81 in MST3)) and one common backward primer for both MST3b and MST3 (5′GACTGTCACACTGACTCAGCACT-3′). Two μl of the reverse transcription reaction mixture was amplified for 35 cycles at an annealing temperature 60 °C, and PCR products were then analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and subsequently sequenced. Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously (32.Lou L. Zhou T. Wang P. Pei G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 557-563PubMed Google Scholar). An equal amount of total RNA (20 μg) from various tissues was subjected to Northern blot analysis (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and a fraction of 5 μg was separated and stained by ethidium bromide in 1.0% agarose. The specific MST3b probe derived from its 5′sequence (base pairs 1–220) was prepared by random priming labeling with [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity of 5 × 108 cpm/μg DNA using the Ready to Go DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After prehybridization, hybridization, and highly stringent washing, the membrane was exposed to x-ray (Eastman Kodak Co.) film for 5 days at −80 °C. Frozen rat brains were cut on a Leitz cryostat at 12 μm, thaw-mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides (Sigma), and stored at −80 °C until hybridization. Sections were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde in 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 20 min and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with protease K (10 μg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature. Sections were saturated with hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 5× standard saline citrate, 5× Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm single-strand DNA, 10 × Dextran sulfate, for 2 h. The digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled MST3b-specific probe (30 μg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was then applied over the sections, which were placed in humidified glass chambers for 18 h at 50 °C. Posthybridization and signal detection were conducted as described by Kokaia et al. (33.Kokaia Z. Bengzon J. Metsis M. Kokaia M. Persson H. Lindvall O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6711-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Controls were carried out by omitting the labeled probe from the hybridization buffer and/or incubating the section with a sense riboprobe. The entire coding sequence of MST3b or MST3 was cloned into pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 containing coding sequence of hemagglutinin (HA) epitope betweenHindIII and EcoRI sites. The MST3b mutant (Thr-18 to Ala, T18A) and the kinase-dead form of MST3b (Lys-65 to Arg, MST3b-KR) were made with site-directed mutagenesis by PCR (22.Schinkmann K. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28695-28703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar), and the PCR products were subcloned into the pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 containing HA epitope. All of these clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes at 1 × 106 cells/dish in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum 20 h before transfection. Transfection was performed using indicated plasmid using the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method. The transiently transfected cells were harvested and used 48 h posttransfection. Expression levels of MST3b, MST3, T18A, and MST3b-KR were carefully controlled and monitored by Western blotting analysis. pGEX4T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to construct a glutathione S-transferase fusion to MST3b (from Gly-99 to His-443) for bacterial expression. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in Balb/c mice against the purified MST3b/MST3-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-phospho-specific p42/44 MAPK polyclonal antibodies that recognize tyrosine 204-phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK of both p42 and p44 isoforms and anti-total p42/44 MAPK polyclonal antibodies that recognize phosphorylation state-independent p42/44 MAPK were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. The proteins from various rat tissues were isolated with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lysates from HEK293 cells (48 h posttransfection) were made in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Aliquots containing 50 μg of protein form HEK293 cells or 100 μg of protein from rat tissue were subjected to 8–10% SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with primary and peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies. The immune complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The results were quantified by densitometric scanning and represented as mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation was measured with Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-specific p42/44 MAPK polyclonal antibodies, and quantification of p42 MAPK bands was used to represent p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation. The p42/44 MAPK activity to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (MBP) was measured as described previously (37.Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, HEK293 cells transfected with plasmids indicated were lysed in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 mm NaF, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100). After incubation on ice for 20 min and centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, anti-total p42/44 MAPK antibody was added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The immune complexes formed were captured by protein A-agarose, followed by washing three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (40 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmEGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The captured complexes were then suspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 25 μg of MBP, 50 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. After resolution, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films. After transient transfection, the cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with repeated suction through insulin syringe. The cells were then centrifuged at 13000 × gfor 30 min, and the cell extracts were exposed to anti-HA monoclonal antibody for 3 h. The immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose and washed three times with lysis buffer and another three times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA). MBP phosphorylation by MST3b and MST3b-KR was started by the addition of 500 μg/ml MBP and 100 μm ATP containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the kinase buffer. MST3b phosphorylation by PKA were started by the addition of 100 units/ml purified catalytic unit of PKA (Sigma) and 100 μm ATP containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Following incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE and autophotography, the results were quantified by densitometric scanning of x-ray films. The assay to measure in vivo phosphorylation of MST3b was performed basically as described (38.Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transfected were prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were treated with or without forskolin (10 μm) or pretreated with or without H89 (4.8 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. After stimulation, the cells were lysed by addition of 1 ml of RIPA+ buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1%(w/v) SDS. Then, the supernatant from centrifugation of 80,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C was absorbed through incubation with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and 1 μg of anti-HA antibody. The beads were washed at least three times in RIPA+ buffer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to analysis with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For all kinase assays, an aliquot of the cells (1/10 total cells) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis with the appropriate antibody to ensure equivalent expression of the kinase. Data were analyzed with Student'st test for comparison of independent means, with pooled estimates of common variances. After searching against the nonredudant expressed sequence tag data base of GenBankTM, a group of human expressed sequence tags, the deduced amino acid sequence of which was similar to STE20 catalytic domain, were identified (data not shown). The contig analysis showed that these expressed sequence tags constructed a novel STE20-like kinase, the 5′ sequence of which was unknown. 5′ RACE was then performed to obtain the full-length sequence of this novel kinase transcript, and two PCR bands were obtained (Fig.1 A). Sequencing of multiple independent clones from the two 5′ RACE products revealed that there were two cDNAs coded for two similar human STE20-like kinases with a divergent amino terminus. One of kinases turned out to be MST3 as earlier reported by Schinkmann and Blenis (22.Schinkmann K. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28695-28703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The other was a novel isoform of MST3 kinase, and named by us as MST3b (AF083420) with an identical sequence (Fig. 1 B, underlined) to MST3 after nucleotide 223. Sequencing of the two full-length cDNAs obtained by RT-PCR demonstrated the two isoforms with a divergent 5′ end (data not shown). The analysis of MST3b sequence showed that one ATG translation initiation codon (Fig. 1 B, asterisk) was in the context of Kozak consensus sequence (39.Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and there were three stop codons (nucleotides 8, 32, and 116) 5′ to this ATG in frame. The 3′ untranslated region contained a putative polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, located 15 nucleotides 5′ from the poly(A) tail (data not shown). MST3b exhibited to encode a protein of 443 residues with a molecular mass of approximately 49 kDa. After BLAST analysis of STS data base of GenBankTM with the full-length sequence of MST3b as a query, one STS (WI-12444, GenBankTM accession number G13373) was identified (data not shown). This STS was mapped to human chromosome 13 between D13S159 and D13S280 (81.5–87.5 cM) (40.Deloukas P. Schuler G.D. Gyapay G. Beasley E.M. Soderlund C. Rodriguez-Tome P. Hui L. Matise T.C.

Genomics. 1998; 47: 26-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The electronic PCR analysis also confirmed the result (data not shown). Expression pattern of MST3b in different tissues was investigated using the specific primers or probes designed from the 5′ divergent region, which can distinguish MST3b and MST3. RT-PCR with the specific primers revealed that MST3b transcript was restricted to brain and was not detectable in other tissues such as heart, liver, kidney, spleen, lung, stomach, pancreas, or muscle etc. (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, MST3 transcript appeared in all of tissues detected (Fig.2 A), agreeing well with the results previously reported (22.Schinkmann K. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28695-28703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis using MST3b-specific cDNA probe confirmed that an approximately 2.5-kilobase transcript was present only in brain (Fig. 2 B). Brain-specific expression of MST3b protein was confirmed by Western blotting with the polyclonal antibodies recognizing a peptide sequence conserved in MST3b and MST3 (Fig. 2 C). A level of MST3b protein that was possibly higher than expected in brain may result from the material for Western analysis, which was mainly isolated from cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In situ hybridization experiments with a MST3b-specific and digoxigenin-labeled antisense cRNA probe were performed to study the detailed distribution of MST3b in brain. MST3b transcript was widely expressed in different brain regions, with high levels in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and hypothalamus and moderate levels in geniculate nucleus and thalamic nucleus (Fig. 2 D). MST3b was present generally in neuronal cells (data not shown). MST3b expression in Purkinje cells appeared greatly reduced in the cerebellum as compared those in the forebrain regions. As control, the hybridization with a MST3b sense cRNA probe did not yield detectable signal (data not shown). MST3b was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells and its expression was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-HA monoclonal antibody. The results"

In theXenopus oocyte model, meiotic maturation is triggered by MPF, a complex of p34cdc2-cyclin B, which is activated in response to a progesterone signal by largely unknown mechanisms. We have previously shown that the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family negatively regulates the MPF amplification loop. In this study, we identify the endogenous PAK2 as a key enzyme in this regulation and describe the pathways by which PAK2 is regulated. We show that the small GTPase Cdc42 is required for maintenance of active endogenous X-PAK2 in resting stage VI oocytes, whereas Rac1 is not involved in this regulation. During the process of maturation, X-PAK2 phosphorylation results in its inactivation and allows maturation to proceed to completion. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and cyclin B-p34cdc2 is coincident with X-PAK2 inactivation, and purified active MPF inhibits X-PAK2, demonstrating the existence of a new positive feedback loop. Our results confirm and extend the importance of p21-activated kinases in the control of the G2/M transition. We hypothesize that the X-PAK2/Cdc42 pathway could link p34cdc2 activity to the major cytoskeleton rearrangements leading to spindle migration and anchorage to the animal pole cortex.

In Xenopus, it is widely accepted that the steroid hormone progesterone is the trigger required to turn on the signal transduction pathway leading to maturation. Events that occur during this transition, including the synthesis of the proto-oncogene product c-Mos and the activation of both MAP1 kinase and cyclin B-cdc2 (MPF), have been thoroughly documented (1.Masui Y. Markert C.L. J . Exp. Zool. 1971; 177: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 2.Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Santos E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 467-477PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Faure S. Morin N.

Nature. 1989; 342: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a complete understanding of the many pathways involved is not yet a reality. The identification of several new players is therefore of great importance in piecing together the maturation puzzle. The serine-threonine kinase Eg2 has been reported to be phosphorylated soon after progesterone stimulation. Overexpression in oocytes of the Eg2 kinase stimulates new c-Mos protein synthesis and facilitates entry into metaphase II (5.Andresson T. Ruderman J.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5627-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Positioning of Eg2 in regard to the translational activation of c-Mos mRNA should lead to a better picture of early events occurring after oocyte stimulation by progesterone. Another serine-threonine kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, has been shown to be inactivated in response to progesterone and overproduction of wild type glycogen synthase kinase-3β specifically blocked oocyte maturation (6.Fisher D.L. Morin N. Doree M. Development. 1999; 126: 567-576PubMed Google Scholar). Speedy, another interesting protein with no apparent enzymatic activity, was also identified to activate MAP kinase and induce G2/M transition by a novel pathway that appears to be completely independent of c-Mos (7.Lenormand J.L. Dellinger R.W. Knudsen K.E. Subramani S. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1869-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We have reported the involvement of the p21-activated kinase family (PAK) in the regulation of the G2/M transition by the demonstration that a truncated catalytically active form of X-PAK1 blocks progesterone-induced oocyte maturation, whereas a dominant negative form facilitates the process. More specifically, we showed that PAKs act by preventing the MPF amplification loop from being turned on. Indeed, when X-PAK1 kinase activity is present in progesterone-treated oocytes, we observed that the p34cdc2negative regulatory kinases Wee1/Myt1 are kept active, whereas the Cdc25 activating phosphatase is not activated (8.Faure S. Vigneron S. Doree M. Morin N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9.Faure S. Vigneron S. Galas S. Brassac T. Delsert C. Morin N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3573-3579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PAKs are serine/threonine kinases, of which the prototype Ste20 was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an upstream regulator of the MAP kinase cascade that is turned on during mating (10.Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 11.Wu C. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Ste20 is activated by binding the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 (12.Leberer E. Wu C. Leeuw T. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Segall J.E. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Since this pioneering work, PAKs have emerged as a major kinase family, to which numerous functions have been assigned in the control of MAP kinase cascades and in cytoskeleton rearrangements (13.Zhang S.

Progesterone-induced oocyte maturation involves major morphological changes in the oocyte as the microtubule array moves with the nucleus toward the animal pole and the meiosis I spindle is attached to the cortex through the actin cytoskeleton (18.Gard D.L. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 516-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19.Gard D.L. Cha B.J. Roeder A.D. Zygote. 1995; 3: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which is then completely remodeled. However, few studies have been undertaken to establish a link between these extensive and obligatory morphological changes and MPF activation. In S. cerevisiae, a recent report has demonstrated a direct link between cortical cytoskeleton rearrangement and activation of the mitotic cyclin-Cdk complex Clb2-CDC28. This elegant piece of work demonstrate a coupling between septin function and the activation of Hsl1, a Nim1-related kinase previously identified as a negative regulator of Swe1 (a Wee-1 homolog in S. cerevisiae) during isotopic bud growth (20.Barral Y. Parra M. Bidlingmaier S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Tjandra et al. (21.Tjandra H. Compton J. Kellogg D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 991-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) showed that Gin4, another Nim1-related kinase, is also involved in control of specific mitotic Clb2-dependent events inS. cerevisiae, jointly with other partners, including both the GTPase Cdc42 and Cla4, a PAK homolog. Cdc42, which belongs to the family of Rho GTPases (for review, see Ref. 22.Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), controls the organization of actin filaments in the cell in higher eukaryotes and is directly involved in modulation of cell shape, as well as in the migration/adhesion properties of the cells, and in the formation of the cleavage furrow when the cell divides (23.Drechsel D.N. Hyman A.A. Hall A. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 12-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 24.Hall A.

Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the GDP-bound form of the small GTPase Cdc42 greatly facilitates progesterone-induced maturation, whereas its GTP-bound form completely blocks the process. Interestingly, Rac1-GTP has no effect on this complex pathway. Cdc42 acts in the control of the maturation pathway, at least partly through a Xenopus PAK that we have identified as X-PAK2, an as yet unreported PAK member inXenopus with an almost total identity with human PAK2. We further show that endogenous X-PAK2 activity is indeed negatively regulated during maturation. Inactivation of X-PAK2 occurs late in progesterone signaling and is coincident with the appearance of H1 kinase activity. Finally, we demonstrate that X-PAK2 is inactivated by phosphorylation, which is mediated by the newly activated cyclin B-p34cdc2 kinase. The X-PAK2 kinase domain was amplified from cDNAs prepared from metaphase II-arrested eggs and further used to screen a λgt10 library as described previously (8.Faure S. Vigneron S. Doree M. Morin N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As in all the positive clones isolated the initiation codon was lacking, specific primers were designed according to the Marathon 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocol (CLONTECH) and the 5′-end of X-PAK2 cDNA was cloned (according to the manufacturer's instructions). A complete full-length clone was reconstructed using classical molecular biology techniques. Xenopus females were obtained from the CNRS breeding center located in Montpellier, France. Fully grown oocytes were prepared, free from follicle cells, by collagenase treatment in Ca2+-free OR2 (27.Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then transferred to MMR (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.7), in which all experiments were performed. The usual volume microinjected was 40 nl; injections were performed near the equator of the oocytes. Progesterone was used at a final concentration of 30 μm. Oocytes were homogenized (10 μl per oocyte) in XB buffer (50 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8) and then briefly centrifuged for 2 min at 20,000 × g to remove yolk proteins. Supernatants were then used for Western blots, immunoprecipitations, or in-gel kinase assays. Cytostatic factor activity (CSF)-arrested egg extracts were prepared as described previously (28.Morin N. Abrieu A. Lorca T. Martin F. Doree M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4343-4352Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh eggs were dejellied in 2% cysteine (pH 7.8) and washed in XB buffer in the presence of EGTA (6 mm). Eggs were crushed at 20,000 × g for 15 min, and the cytoplasmic layer was supplemented with an ATP regenerating system, cytochalasin B, and protease inhibitors, before use. Cyclin B-p34cdc2 kinase was prepared from starfish oocytes by affinity chromatography on p13suc1-Sepharose, ion exchange chromatography, and monoS columns as described previously (29.Labbe J.C. Cavadore J.C. Doree M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides X-PAK2N5′ (ggccggatcctctgataacggggagcttg) and X-PAK2N3′ (gcccgtcgactcatcactgtctgtctccagtctt) were used to amplify the N-terminal domain of X-PAK2, and X-PAK2C5′ (ggccggatccgaaaaacttagaactatag) and X-PAK2C3′(gcccgtcgactcatcagcggtttcccttcattgc) were used to amplify the C-terminal domain. Polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into pMal-P2 (New England Biolabs) prokaryotic expression vector. Recombinant MalBP-X-PAK fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Fusion proteins were further used for oocyte microinjection and, for the MBP-X-PAK2 Nter, to raise antibodies in rabbits. All Cdc42 and Rac point mutants (a kind gift of Dr. A. Hall), were expressed in E. coli from the pGEX prokaryotic expression vector as recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and were purified on glutathione-agarose beads essentially as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sea urchin GST-cyclin B construct was kindly donated by Dr J. Gautier (GST is fused to sea urchin type B cyclin from amino acid 13 to 409), and the recombinant protein was expressed in E. coliand affinity purified as described previously (9.Faure S. Vigneron S. Galas S. Brassac T. Delsert C. Morin N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3573-3579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Histone H1 kinase activities were assayed according to the protocol described (29.Labbe J.C. Cavadore J.C. Doree M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, cyclin B-p34cdc2complexes immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the C-terminal peptide of p34cdc2 were incubated for 15 min in 20 μl of kinase buffer (8.Faure S. Vigneron S. Doree M. Morin N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) containing 1 μl of histone H1 at 5 mg/ml, 1 μl of 1 mm ATP, and 0.5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000Ci/mmol) to reach a final [γ-32P]ATP specific activity of 4.5 Ci/mmol). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. X-PAK2 activity was tested from extracts immunoprecipitated with X-PAK2-Nter antibodies, using H2B as a substrate, in the same conditions as for the H1 assays. In-gel MBP kinase assays were performed essentially as described previously (30.Shibuya E.K. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Ruderman J.V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3963-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were run in a 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5 mg/ml MBP. After denaturation and renaturation steps, gels were incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Gels were washed and dried;in-gel MBP kinases were visualized by autoradiography. λ-Phosphatase from New England Biolabs was added to the extracts at 8000 units/per ml in a final reaction volume of 50 μl, reactions were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C, and 2-μl aliquots were used in Western blot assays. Ten microliters of CSF-arrested extracts were treated with increasing quantities of Roscovitin fused with MalBP for 90 min at room temperature. Two microliters of the reactions were further used for Western blot, and for H1 kinase assay of p34cdc2immunoprecipitates. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the active tyrosine-phosphorylated form of MAP kinase was obtained from Santa Cruz, USA (catalog no. sc7383). Polyclonal antibodies prepared against the C-terminal peptide of Xenopus p34cdc2 were prepared in the laboratory. Xenopus X-PAK2 andXenopus X-PAK1 polyclonal antibodies were made in the laboratory by immunizing rabbits against the recombinant N-terminal domain of X-PAK2 (amino acids 2–214) or X-PAK1 (amino acids 2–222) fused with MBP. All immunoprecipitates were performed by incubation of the extracts with the indicated antibodies linked to protein A-Sepharose in modified RIPA buffer for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times in modified RIPA buffer and twice in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm orthovanadate). X-PAK1 and X-PAK2 Western blots and immunoprecipitates were performed with antibodies immunopurified against the corresponding recombinant proteins. In order to assess a potential role of the Rho family GTPases in oocyte maturation, we microinjected exogenous, constitutively GTP- or GDP-bound forms of Cdc42 and Rac1 (Val-12 and Asn-17 point mutants, respectively) 1 h before progesterone treatment and scored the germinal vesicle breakdown, according to the appearance of a white spot on the animal pole (31.Dumont J.N. J. Morphol. 1972; 136: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, in control progesterone-treated oocytes, 50% germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) was attained by 4 h of hormonal treatment. Microinjection of equal amounts of either RacN17 or RacV12 did not affect the kinetics of oocyte maturation by progesterone. In contrast, a complete inhibition of progesterone-induced maturation was observed in the presence of the Cdc42V12 mutant. Consistent with this observation, the Cdc42N17 mutant facilitated the oocyte response to hormone treatment, as GVBD50 occurred reproducibly under these conditions between 1 and 2 h earlier than was observed with progesterone alone. The occurrence of GVBD was corroborated by both the measure of H1 kinase activity of p34cdc2 immunoprecipitates and by the activation of MAP kinase in an in-gel kinase assay using myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate (Fig. 1 B). As expected, a strong H1 kinase activity was associated with the immunoprecipitates of p34cdc2 kinase from oocytes extracts prepared 7 h after progesterone treatment. This level of H1 kinase activity was not modified by microinjection of either GDP- or GTP-bound form of the Rac1 GTPase, whereas H1 kinase activity peaked 1–2 h earlier in the Cdc42N17-microinjected oocytes (data not shown). In contrast, microinjection of the Cdc42V12 mutant prevented H1 kinase activation (Fig. 1 B). In all of the conditions described above, H1 kinase activation systematically correlated with MAP kinase activation, and as expected, only control oocytes (stage VI) and Cdc42V12-microinjected oocytes lack MAP kinase activity (Fig.1 B). Our results thus indicate that Cdc42 but not Rac1 is involved in the control of maturation, as inactivation of the signaling pathway downstream from Cdc42 facilitates oocyte response to the hormone. In order to more clearly define through which effector Cdc42V12 prevents the maturation process, we took advantage of two point mutants that have been previously shown to specifically disrupt the binding of different effectors (32.White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Cdc42L61 is, like Cdc42V12, in a GTP-bound form. The Cdc42L61A37 double mutant can still bind p65PAK, p50RhoGAP, and WASP effectors, whereas Cdc42L61C40 still binds p50RhoGAP but is unable to bind p65PAK (33.Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Expression of the Cdc42L61C40 mutant in progesterone-treated oocytes (Fig. 1 A) resulted, as with the GDP-bound Cdc42N17 mutant, in facilitation of the G2/M transition. Both mutants, although for different reasons, are unable to activate the PAK/WASP pathway, which suggests that silencing the endogenous PAK and/or WASP pathway results in premature activation of MPF and more rapid onset of GVBD. Such a mechanism indeed supports our previous results on the induction of a maturation block by active X-PAK (8.Faure S. Vigneron S. Doree M. Morin N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9.Faure S. Vigneron S. Galas S. Brassac T. Delsert C. Morin N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3573-3579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of the Cdc42L61A37 mutant did not affect progesterone-induced oocyte maturation. These results led us to analyze the state of activation, in the oocyte, of the endogenous PAKs, upon expression of the well characterized Cdc42 point mutants. We looked to see whether a correlation could be made between the ability of Cdc42 GTPase mutants to bind and activate PAK effectors and their effect on the maturation pathway. Because the third Xenopus PAK homolog that we isolated is poorly conserved among the PAK family, we did not examine this kinase further and only tested X-PAK1 and X-PAK2 activation. We first analyzed the endogenous X-PAK2 (Fig.2 A) and X-PAK1 (Fig.2 B) activities present in stage VI oocytes and mature eggs (Pg) (Fig. 2, A and B, left panels). In stage VI oocytes, X-PAK2 activity is at least a factor of 20 above that associated with X-PAK-1. In mature oocytes, endogenous X-PAK2 activity decreased significantly, whereas X-PAK1 associated kinase activity appeared to remain unchanged, and this was indeed confirmed upon longer exposure of the autoradiogram (data not shown). As we previously reported that X-PAK1 is capable of using histone H2B as a substrate (9.Faure S. Vigneron S. Galas S. Brassac T. Delsert C. Morin N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3573-3579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we conclude that endogenous X-PAK2 but not X-PAK1 activity is down-regulated during the maturation process. Next, GTP-bound (V12, L61A37, and L61C40) or GDP-bound (N17) forms of Cdc42 were microinjected into oocytes prior to treatment with progesterone. Oocytes were withdrawn at different times after hormone addition and endogenous X-PAK1 and X-PAK2 kinase activities tested. Injection of GDP-bound Cdc42 (N17 mutant) did not change endogenous X-PAK activities. In contrast, upon Cdc42V12 microinjection, X-PAK2 associated H2 kinase activity increased 5–10-fold, as soon as 30 min after GTPase microinjection (Fig.2 A). This was also true to some degree for activation of X-PAK1(Fig. 2 B), although the H2B associated kinase activity barely reached the basal activity associated with X-PAK2. As both X-PAK1 and X-PAK2 can bind and be activated as efficiently by GTP-bound Cdc42 in vitro(8.Faure S. Vigneron S. Doree M. Morin N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), 2J. Cau, S. Faure, S. Vigneron, J. C. Labbé, C. Delsert, and N. Morin, unpublished results. we thus hypothesize that either X-PAK1 localization or conformation prevents its proper interaction with Cdc42 in stage VI oocytes. These results indicate that Cdc42V12 probably prevents hormone-induced oocyte maturation by acting through its endogenous X-PAK2 effector. Indeed recombinant active X-PAK2 blocks the maturation process (data not shown). This is further confirmed by the expression of the Cdc42L61C40 mutant in progesterone-treated oocytes (Fig. 2 A). Cdc42L61C40 is unable to activate X-PAK2 (Fig. 2 A) and also facilitates progesterone-induced oocyte maturation in a similar manner to the Cdc42N17 mutant (Fig. 1). In contrast, a strong activation of X-PAK2 does occur in the presence of the Cdc42L61A37 mutant but is considerably delayed (Fig. 2 A, compare Cdc42 V12and Cdc42L61A37). It was reported previously that the Cdc42L61A37 mutant is capable of binding and activating p65PAK as well as did the nonmutated versions (33.Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). This is, however, clearly not the case for Xenopus PAK2. X-PAK2 activation could be delayed because we use a heterologous recombinant GTPase, which could potentially have different binding properties from the endogenousXenopus Cdc42 partner of X-PAK2. Nevertheless, Cdc42L61A37 does not interfere with the maturation process. This result raises two possibilities: either X-PAK2 is not the true Cdc42 effector in the G2/M block, or its activation by Cdc42L61A37 occurs too late in the maturation process to interfere with it. To discriminate between these two hypotheses, we microinjected Cdc42L61A37 mutants in oocytes 3 h before further treatment with progesterone. Under these conditions, GVBD did not occur, and maturation was blocked (data not shown). Altogether, these results show that the Cdc42/X-PAK2 pathway negatively regulates hormone-induced oocyte maturation and that the maturation block can be bypassed if the Cdc42/X-PAK2 pathway is activated after 50% GVBD. A full-length X-PAK2 clone was obtained by a combination of library screening and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction; the cDNA sequence information is available in GenBankTM (accession number AJ242726). X-PAK2 is likely to be the true homologue of human PAK2, as both kinases share an overall identity of 87.5%. Fig. 3shows the amino acid sequence comparison of both kinases. The Src homology 3 binding domains and the Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding (CRIB) sequence are closely related, and their kinase domains are almost identical. We analyzed X-PAK2 expression and activity during the course of maturation (Fig.4 A). Progesterone-treated oocytes were harvested every 30 min, and oocyte extracts were subsequently used to correlate X-PAK2 mobility (in Western blot, Fig.4 B) with its activity on immunoprecipitates against H2B as a substrate (Fig. 4 D) and with both MAP kinase activity (Fig.4 C) and cyclin B-p34cdc2 kinase activity (Fig.4 E).Figure 4X-PAK2 mobility decreases and X-PAK2 is inactivated when MAP kinase and MPF are activated in the course of maturation. A, time course of germinal vesicle breakdown of progesterone-treated oocytes. In this experiment, GVBD50 occurred 4 h after progesterone treatment. During the course of the experiment, oocytes were withdrawn every 30 min, homogenized, and briefly centrifuged, and supernatants were further used. X-PAK2 mobility and accumulation were monitored by Western blotting using anti-X-PAK2 immunopurified antibodies (B); MAP kinase activation was monitored by Western blotting using antibodies that specifically recognize the active tyrosine-phosphorylated form (circled P) of MAP kinase (C); X-PAK2 activity was tested on purified X-PAK2 immunoprecipitates using H2B as a substrate (D). Cyclin B-p34cdc2 activation was tested on purified p34cdc2 immunoprecipitates against H1 as a substrate (E). X-PAK2 was active up to 3 h after hormonal treatment (C), and its accumulation did not change (B), whereas neither H1 (E) nor MAP kinase (C) activity was detected. Around GVBD50, X-PAK2 was inactivated (D), and a new X-PAK2 species with a slower mobility was detected by Western blot (B). Coincident with these events, both MAP kinase (C) and MPF (E) activations occurred.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) X-PAK2 mobility decreases during the course of maturation at 3.5 h after progesterone treatment, and a subpopulation of X-PAK2 is shifted to a slower mobility form (Fig. 4 B). The X-PAK2 kinase assay reveals that the fastest species present in oocytes, at the beginning of the maturation time course, is active X-PAK2 (Fig. 4 D). The ratio between the two bands can vary between different batches of eggs, but the appearance of the upper band late in the maturation process is always correlated with a loss of endogenous X-PAK2 activity (compare Fig. 4, B and D, at 3 and 3.5 h). Down-regulation of X-PAK2 is not an early event during the process of maturation, as it appears to be coincident with the activation of both cyclin B-p34cdc2 complexes (Fig. 4 E) and MAP kinase (Fig.4 C), slightly before 50% GVBD (Fig. 4 A). X-PAK2 inactivation is not restricted to progesterone mediated maturation. Indeed, when maturation was induced by either recombinant cyclin B or insulin treatment, a decrease in X-PAK2 mobility was also observed and again correlated with X-PAK2 inactivation (data not shown). Laid eggs are arrested in metaphase of second meiosis, with high MPF and CSF (in which the proto-oncogene encoding c-Mos participates) activities (4.Sagata N. Watanabe N. Vande Woude G.F. Ikawa Y.

Isoeicosanoids are formed initially in situ in the phospholipid domain of cell membranes by a free radical attack on polyunsaturated fatty acids. They are subsequently cleared by phospholipases, enter the general circulation, and are excreted in urine.

Indeed, iPs have been measured in human atherosclerotic plaque and localized to monocytes/macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells (5.Praticò D. Iuliano L. Mauriello A. Spagnoli L. Lawson J.A.

However, the cross-reactivity of these antibodies with most other F2-iPs and their putative metabolites is unknown. Administration of labeled iPF2α-III to primates and one human suggested that close to 20% of administered radioactivity recovered in urine is 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydroisoprostane F2α-III (dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III) (18.Roberts L.J., II Moore K.P. Zackert W.E. Oates J.A. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20617-20620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). More recently, Chiabrandoet al. (19.Chiabrando C. Valagussa A. Rivalta C. Durandi T. Guy A. Zuccato E. Villa P. Rossi J.-C. Fanelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1313-1319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) identified the presence of 2,3-dinor-iPF2α-III, in addition to the 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro metabolite, in human urine. Although this assay did not include use of homologous internal standards, the authors estimated the quantities of both metabolites in human urine as being roughly equivalent to the parent compound, iPF2α-III.There is a substantial rationale for the development of sensitive and specific assays for iP metabolites. Thus, we have previously reported that iPF2α-III, unlike other iPs, may be formed by COX isozymes in vitro or ex vivo (10.Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 20.Praticò D. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8919-8924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although this pathway of formation contributes to an undetectable extent to urinary iPF2α-III excretion, even under conditions of COX activation (14.Reilly M. Delanty N. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 1996; 94: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), it may confound quantitation of iPs in blood samples (11.Praticò D. Barry O.P. Lawson J. Adiyaman M. Hwang S.-W.

FitzGerald G.A Patrono C. Maclouf J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 94-100PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, peroxidation of arachidonate substrate may represent an additional source of ex vivo artifact in blood sampling, although this problem may be circumvented by analysis in urine, where there is considerably less substrate (6.Reilly M. Praticò D. Delanty N. DiMinno G. Tremoli E. Rader D. Kapoor S. Rokach J. Lawson J. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2822-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 11.Praticò D.

Measurement of a metabolite, if not formed in the cells of circulating blood, may bypass these sources of ex vivo artifact (21.Catella F. Healy D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5861-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Morrowet al. (22.Morrow J.D. Zackert W.E. Yang J.P. Kurhts E.H. Callewaert D. Dworski R. Kanai K. Taber D. Moore K. Oates J.A. Roberts L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) have recently reported a GC/MS assay for dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III using an18O2-labeled homologous internal standard. We have independently developed a similar assay and report elevated levels in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. Urinary dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III is further increased during the reperfusion phase following hepatic transplantation. Unlike its parent compound, iPF2α-III, this metabolite is not formed in plasma by activated platelets. However, dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III may also be formed as a primary iP from the autoxidation of an alternative fatty acid substrate, γ-linolenic acid (GLA). Although GLA may be a less prevalent substrate than arachidonic acid in human tissues, the similarity of the array of isomers observed following autoxidation of GLA and those observed in human urine and plasma implies that this may be a significant source of dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III. This confounding duality suggests that interpretation of dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III levels is less than straightforward. However, either as a primary iP derived from GLA or as a metabolite of an arachidonic acid-derived iP, urinary dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III, just like iPF2α-III, reflects alterations in lipid peroxidationin vivo, even in patients with hepatic dysfunction.DISCUSSIONWe report the presence of dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III in human urine and plasma using a highly reproducible, specific, and sensitive GC/MS-based assay. Previously, Roberts et al. (18.Roberts L.J., II Moore K.P. Zackert W.E. Oates J.A. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20617-20620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) reported that intravenous administration of labeled iPF2α-III to non-human primates and to a human volunteer resulted in ∼20% of the radioactivity in urine being accounted for by this compound. Thus, it is likely that endogenous iPF2α-III is a source of endogenous urinary dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III in the present study. Chiabrandoet al. (19.Chiabrando C. Valagussa A. Rivalta C. Durandi T. Guy A. Zuccato E. Villa P. Rossi J.-C. Fanelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1313-1319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have identified the presence of both dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III and 2,3-dinor-iPF2α-III in human urine. They demonstrated that excretion of the metabolites was elevated in smokers and was not depressed in individuals given the COX inhibitor naproxen. Their approach to quantitation is accompanied by several caveats, however. Due to the lack of homologous stable isotope-labeled internal standards, they could not control for the efficiency of the immunoaffinity extraction. Also, the possibility exists for differential efficiency of MS fragmentation between the [2H4]iPF2α-III internal standard and the two metabolites.Urinary dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III, just like iPF2α-III (26.Meagher E.A.

In the present study, there was an additional transient increment in metabolite excretion during the reperfusion phase following orthoptic liver transplantation. We have previously described such an increment in urinary iPF2α-III coincident with coronary reperfusion after ischemia with thrombolytic drugs, cardiopulmonary bypass (31.Delanty N. Reilly M. Lawson J.A. McCarthy J. Wood F. Fitzgerald D.J. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 1997; 95: 2492-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), or angioplasty (32.Reilly M. Delanty N. Roy L. O'Callaghan P. Crean P. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3314-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the present study, urinary excretion of the dinor-dihydro compound fell to levels within the normal range after reperfusion, suggesting correction of the preoperative syndrome of oxidant stress. We are presently exploring the possibility that later increases in metabolite excretion might presage episodes of transplant rejection.Although measurement of parent iPs in urine reflects systemic and not just renal generation of iPs (26.Meagher E.A.

Circulation. 1997; 96: 3314-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), analysis of a metabolite rather than the parent iP may be advantageous in certain circumstances. We have previously demonstrated that iPF2α-III, apparently alone among the F2-iPs, can be formed in a COX-dependent manner by platelets in vitro and in serum ex vivo (10.Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 16.Wang Z. Ciabattoni G. Creminon C. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A Patrono C. Maclouf J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 94-100PubMed Google Scholar). Both COX-1 in platelets (10.Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and COX-2 in monocytes (20.Praticò D. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8919-8924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) have the capacity to form iPF2α-III. Although this enzymatic pathway does not appear to contribute detectably to urinary concentrations of the iP (11.Praticò D. Barry O.P. Lawson J. Adiyaman M. Hwang S.-W. Khanapure H. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3449-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), even in syndromes of COX activation (14.Reilly M. Delanty N. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 1996; 94: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), this may not be the case for plasma-based assays. Thus, COX-1 activation in platelets will occur ex vivo after blood sampling and may confound estimates of iPF2α-III actually circulating in vivo. For example, thromboxane A2, the major COX metabolite formed by platelets (33.Hamberg M. Svensson J. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), is rapidly hydrolyzed to thromboxane B2, which is biologically inactive, but chemically relatively stable and readily measured in biological fluids. However, continuing platelet activation ex vivo, even when samples are harvested into a mixture including a COX inhibitor, results in an uncontrollable source of artifact ex vivo (21.Catella F. Healy D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5861-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In the case of thromboxane, this is readily addressed by measurement of a metabolite (11-dehydro thromboxane B2) that is not formed by cells of the circulating blood (21.Catella F. Healy D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5861-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), but rather in tissues such as liver, lung, and kidney. We now report that the dinor-dihydro metabolite of iPF2α-III, unlike the parent isoprostane, is not formed by aggregated human platelets.In the case of the iPs, a second form of potential artifact is lipid peroxidation ex vivo. This may also be more of a problem for plasma-based assays of parent iPs, where the content of the arachidonic acid substrate is much greater than in urine. Again, this problem may be bypassed by measurement of a metabolite that is not formed in blood. Formation of parent iPs ex vivo in urine has not been detected in carefully collected samples (11.Praticò D. Barry O.P. Lawson J. Adiyaman M. Hwang S.-W. Khanapure H. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3449-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar).In addition to these theoretical advantages of a metabolite assay in plasma, such compounds are sometimes more abundant than the parent compound in urine. In contrast to the findings of Chiabrando et al. (19.Chiabrando C. Valagussa A. Rivalta C. Durandi T. Guy A. Zuccato E. Villa P. Rossi J.-C. Fanelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1313-1319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we report that this is also the case for dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III. The greater abundance of the metabolite renders it a more tractable target for various forms of analysis. In this case, the GC/MS method we describe for the metabolite is more facile than that for the parent compound, iPF2α-III (10.Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Use of the trimethylsilyl derivative allows for a reaction time of 10 min as opposed to 12 h for thetert-butyldimethylsilyl, a GC retention time of 8versus 13 min, and a smaller sample volume of urine (1versus 5 ml). Although lacking the elegant simplicity possible with immunoaffinity extraction, this method takes advantage of reasonably priced, commercially available, single-use SPE cartridges and TLC plates, avoiding the necessity of raising, purifying, characterizing, and coupling antibodies (19.Chiabrando C. Valagussa A. Rivalta C. Durandi T. Guy A. Zuccato E. Villa P. Rossi J.-C. Fanelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1313-1319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The availability of assays for iP metabolites will permit initial studies of iP disposition. Although we do not know the tissues in which this or other metabolites are formed, the liver seems one likely source by analogy with dinor metabolites of prostaglandins and thromboxane. Indeed, the dinor-dihydro metabolite is formed from iPF2α-III by rat hepatocytes in vitro (19.Chiabrando C. Valagussa A. Rivalta C. Durandi T. Guy A. Zuccato E. Villa P. Rossi J.-C. Fanelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1313-1319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Consistent with the likelihood of a hepatic contribution to metabolite biosynthesis in humans, the ratio of metabolite to parent in the urine of patients with cirrhosis is less than that observed in healthy individuals. However, even in liver disease, urinary levels of both the metabolite and the parent iP are elevated compared with controls, suggesting that a change in iP generation predominates over one in iP disposition. Paired analysis of parent plus metabolite will permit further elucidation of alterations in generation versusdisposition of iPs in human disease. Biological effects have been attributed to iPs, including iPF2α-III (2.Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2441-2444Google Scholar). The extent to which metabolic disposition contributes to the inactivation of such effects of parent iPs in vivo is presently unknown. Recently, Basu (34.Basu S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) described an additional compound, 2,3,4,5-tetranor-15-keto-13,14-dihydro-iPF2α-III, as a major metabolite in the rat.Little is known of the effects of substrate modification on iP generation. Peroxidation products of both eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid have been described (35.Nourooz-Zadeh J. Liu E.H. Yhlen B. Anggard E.E. Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Interestingly, aside from its formation as a metabolite of arachidonic acid-derived iP (iPF2α-III), the dinor-dihydro compound may theoretically also be formed as a primary iP from GLA, which itself may be formed as a degradation product of arachidonic acid. Interestingly, iPF2α-III is degraded to dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III by the same peroxisomal mechanism that converts arachidonic acid to GLA (Fig. 6). Dinor isoprostane regioisomers formed from α-linolenic acid in plants have previously been described (36.Parchmann S. Mueller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32650-32655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We present evidence consistent with the identity of dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III in human urine and plasma to a primary autoxidation product of GLA. We cannot discriminate between the two potential sources of the dinor-dihydro compound in the present study. However, the pattern of peaks observed in urine and plasma bears a striking similarity to the pattern obtained from the autoxidation of GLA, suggesting that this may be a significant source of the compound. Indeed, a more appealing nomenclature for the compound would be 2,3-dinor-iPF1α-III (37.Rokach J. Khanapure S.P. Kwang S.-W. Adiyaman M. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Prostaglandins. 1997; 54: 853-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which is unencumbered by the implication of a metabolic derivation from iPF2α-III.In summary, we describe the detection of dinor-dihydro-iPF2α-III (2,3-dinor-iPF1α-III) in human plasma and urine using a homologous standard in a GC/MS assay. Urinary excretion of the compound was elevated in patients with cirrhosis and was increased further during the reperfusion phase of hepatic transplantation. Irrespective of whether it is formed as a metabolite of arachidonic acid-derived iP or directly from GLA, it is not formed by activated platelets and is more abundant and more readily measured than iPF2α-III in urine; and urinary levels reflect lipid peroxidation in vivo. Isoprostanes (iPs)1 are free radical-catalyzed products of arachidonic acid (1.Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar, 2.Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2441-2444Google Scholar). F2-iPs, isomers of prostaglandin F2α, are the most studied species, but analogous isomers (isoeicosanoids) of other prostaglandins as well as of leukotrienes have been described (3.Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Wu A. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Roberts L.J., II J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23185-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 4.Harrison K.A. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17273-17278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Isoeicosanoids are formed initially in situ in the phospholipid domain of cell membranes by a free radical attack on polyunsaturated fatty acids. They are subsequently cleared by phospholipases, enter the general circulation, and are excreted in urine. Given their relative chemical stability, iPs represent attractive indices of oxidant stress in vivo. Indeed, iPs have been measured in human atherosclerotic plaque and localized to monocytes/macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells (5.Praticò D. Iuliano L. Mauriello A. Spagnoli L. Lawson J.A. Rokach J. Maclouf J. Violi F. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2028-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Urinary excretion of discrete F2-iPs is increased in humans and mice with hypercholesterolemia (6.Reilly M. Praticò D. Delanty N. DiMinno G. Tremoli E. Rader D. Kapoor S. Rokach J. Lawson J. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2822-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 7.Praticò D. Tangirala R.K. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Suppression of urinary iP excretion with vitamin E in apoE-deficient mice retards atherogenesis, despite sustained hypercholesterolemia (7.Praticò D. Tangirala R.K. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Despite the emerging evidence supporting the quantitation of iPs as an approach to the study of oxidant stress in vivo (8.Witztum J.L. Berliner J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9.Rokach J. Khanapure S.P. Hwang S.-W. Adiyaman M. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Prostaglandins. 1997; 54: 823-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), little is known about their release from cell membranes or their metabolic disposition prior to excretion. Several analytical approaches to quantitation of F2-iPs have been employed (2.Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2441-2444Google Scholar). Those based on GC/MS have usually measured a heterogeneous GC peak composed of an undetermined number of isomers. We have developed assays that measure a single isomer, which may be more reproducible. To date, we have developed methods for iPF2α-III (formerly 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α) (10.Praticò D. Lawson J.A.

This effect is due, at least in part, to the increased copy number of the three respective penicillin biosynthesis genes: pcbAB,pcbC, and penDE (5.Barredo J.L. Dı́ez B. Alvarez E. Martı́n J.F. Curr.

Nevertheless, it is likely that the level of trans-acting transcriptional activators may also be higher in penicillin overproducing strains (reviewed in Ref. 8.Peñalva M.A. Rowlands R.T. Turner G.

Knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms that control expression of the penicillin biosynthesis in P. chrysogenum is of utmost importance, because biosynthesis of the β-lactams is the best known model (both at the genetic and biochemical levels) to study secondary metabolites. The first two genes of the penicillin pathway in P. chrysogenum are transcribed divergently from a 1.01-kilobase bidirectional promoter region (9.Dı́ez B. Gutiérrez S.

Multiple transcriptional factors appear to bind to this bidirectional promoter region modulating the expression of both genes (reviewed in Refs. 12.Brakhage A.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

In P. chrysogenum, nuclear DNA-binding proteins, which recognize the intergenic promoter region, have been reported by Feng et al. (14.Feng B. Friedlin E. Marzluf G.A. Curr.

Microbiol. 1996; 20: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the nitrogen metabolite repressor NRE1 (18.Haas H. Marzluf G.A. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), bind in vitro to specific sequences of the intergenicpcbAB-pcbC region. In P. chrysogenum, the pcbAB gene has been reported to be repressed by glucose and ammonium (19.Feng B. Friedlin E. Marzluf G.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 4432-4439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the same occurs with the pcbC and penDE genes (20.Gutiérrez S. Marcos A.T. Casqueiro J. Kosalková K. Fernández F.J. Velasco J. Martı́n J.F. Microbiology (Read.). 1999; 145: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). ThepcbAB gene is also under the control of extracellular pH (21.Chu Y.-W. Renno D. Saunders G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1997; 47: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which correlates with the presence of seven PacC consensus binding sites (GCCARG) in the pcbAB-pcbC intergenic region (17.Suárez T. Peñalva M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, in P. chrysogenum the alkaline pH does not reverse the strong glucose repression ofpcbAB, pcbC, and penDE (20.Gutiérrez S. Marcos A.T. Casqueiro J. Kosalková K. Fernández F.J. Velasco J. Martı́n J.F. Microbiology (Read.). 1999; 145: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression analysis in A. nidulans revealed thatpcbC is strongly repressed by glucose, whereaspcbAB is only slightly affected by this carbon source (22.Brakhage A.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 148: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23.Brakhage A.A. Browne P. Turner G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3789-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, P. chrysogenum and A. nidulansappear to be clearly different in the regulatory mechanisms of the penicillin gene cluster (13.Martı́n J.F. Casqueiro J. Kosalková K. Marcos A.T. Gutiérrez S. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 75: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); this fact stresses the need to perform regulation studies in P. chrysogenum itself. Pérez-Esteban et al. (24.Pérez-Esteban B. Orejas M. Gómez-Pardo E. Peñalva M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 881-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) used an approach consisting of sequential and internal deletions of thepcbAB-pcbC intergenic region of A. nidulans to locate regulatory cis-acting regions involved in the expression of a pcbC:lacZ fusion; several regions involved in transcriptional activation and sucrose repression were described. By contrast very little information exists in P. chrysogenum about cis-acting regulatory regions affecting expression of the pcbAB gene. In this article we describe a sequential deletion analysis of theP. chrysogenum pcbAB-pcbC intergenic region to locate cis-acting sequences enhancing the expression of thepcbAB gene, the interaction of these sequences with DNA-binding proteins, and the in vivo effect of mutation or deletion of the main regulatory sequences on expression of thepcbAB gene. P. chrysogenum npe10pyrG, used as receptor strain in transformation experiments, is a derivative of P. chrysogenum npe10, a deletion mutant lacking the complete penicillin gene cluster (25.Cantoral J.M.

Escherichia coli DH5α (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, California) was used as the host strain for high frequency plasmid transformation and plasmid manipulations; single-stranded DNA was obtained from E. coli WK6. Phage M13K07 was used as helper in the infection of strain E. coli WK6. Seed culture medium for penicillin production contained: 20 g/l corn steep solids, 20 g/l sucrose, 5 g/l yeast extract, 5 g/l CaCO3, pH 5.7. Spore suspensions ofP. chrysogenum were inoculated in 100 ml of seed medium in flasks and incubated in a rotary shaker (250 rpm) at 25 °C for 24 h. Penicillin production complex (CP) medium contained: 4 g/l phenylacetic acid, 4 g/l (NH4)2SO4, 5 g/l CaCO3, 20 g/l Pharmamedia, pH 6.1. Lactose or glucose (30 g/l) were added to each flask after autoclaving. CP medium (100 ml in 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks) supplemented with either glucose or lactose was inoculated with 8 ml of seed medium, and cultures were incubated for 12–96 h at 25 °C in an orbital incubator at 250 rpm. β-galactosidase activity was determined in extracts from mycelia grown in CP medium, harvested by filtration through Nytal filters, washed with 0.9% NaCl, cooled rapidly in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −20 °C. The mycelial cake was ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen in a mortar, resuspended in 1.5 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0; 1 mmEDTA; 20 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and kept on ice. The extracts were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were removed to clean tubes, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and stored on ice. β-Galactosidase assays were carried out with 5–200 μl of clear extracts andO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. Protein concentration in the extracts was determined with the Bradford dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Protoplasts were obtained from P. chrysogenum npe10 pyrG by treatment with lysing enzymes (Sigma), and transformation was performed as described previously (27.Cantoral J.M. Dı́ez B. Barredo J.L. Alvarez E. Martı́n J.F. Bio/Technology. 1987; 5: 494-497Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Total DNA from P. chrysogenumtransformants was purified by a small scale procedure, essentially as described by Fierro et al. (28.Fierro F. Kosalková K. Gutiérrez S. Martı́n J.F. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA preparation, restriction enzyme digestions, ligations, Southern blotting, and hybridizations were carried out by standard techniques. Deletions to remove specific stretches of the pcbAB promoter coupled to the E. coli lacZ reporter gene were as follows: Constructions DEL0 - DEL5 were made from pZ2bAB (20.Gutiérrez S. Marcos A.T. Casqueiro J. Kosalková K. Fernández F.J. Velasco J. Martı́n J.F. Microbiology (Read.). 1999; 145: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using the Erase-a-Base System (Promega, Madison, WI). pZ2bAB was digested withHindIII, and the ends were filled with α-phosphothionucleotides. Deletions were initiated at theSmaI site by digestion with exonuclease III followed by S1 nuclease treatment and ligation. Constructions DEL6, DEL7, and DEL8 were made from pZ2bAB by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes (SalI, EcoRI, and BamHI, respectively) and ligation. The precise end points of all the promoter deletion mutants were determined by sequencing the DNA of each construction. Two overlapping 86-bp fragments (designated A1 and A2), covering the 130-bpSacI-TaqI region of the pcbAB promoter (box A), were generated by PCR. A1 was obtained from a PCR reaction using plasmid pBKS+AB (see below) as template DNA and oligonucleotides KA: CATC TGGG CTGC AAGC GT and KB: ACCT GAGC TCTC TTCC TG as primers. Fragment A2 was obtained using the same template, and oligonucleotides KC: GACT TCGA GATA CGGT TA and KD: CTGG AGAC ATTA TACG CT as primers. Mutated probes used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were obtained with KD and KL primers (see below). All the DNA fragments used in binding reactions were filled in with the Klenow fragment to get blunt ends and ligated to an EcoRV-digested pBSK+. The plasmids were digested with BamHI and HindIII, and fragments obtained were radioactively end-labeled by filling in with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I using [α-32P]dCTP. Point mutations and deletions were introduced into the pcbAB promoter by the QuickchangeTM system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's indications. A BamHI DNA fragment from pZ2bAB containing the pcbAB-pcbC intergenic region was ligated to BamHI-digested pBluescriptKS+ to give rise to plasmid pBKS+AB. Plasmid pBKS+AB was used as template for PCR amplification with the primers containing the mutated sequence. Finally, the mutated pcbAB promoter was excised from pBKS+AB by BamHI digestion and reintroduced into theBamHI site of pZ2b (a vector for targeted integration in theP. chrysogenum pyrG locus that contains theE. coli lacZ reporter gene (20.Gutiérrez S. Marcos A.T. Casqueiro J. Kosalková K. Fernández F.J. Velasco J. Martı́n J.F. Microbiology (Read.). 1999; 145: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). P. chrysogenum npe10 was grown for 12–72 h in CP medium with 3% lactose or 3% glucose as a carbon source. The mycelium was harvested by filtration through Nytal filters, washed with 0.9% NaCl, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −75 °C. The mycelium was ground to a fine powder in a mortar cooled with liquid nitrogen and resuspended in 1 volume of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and kept on ice. The suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed to clean tubes and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The clean supernatant (crude extract) was precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 (final concentration 60%) and resuspended in a half volume of sample buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 5 mmMgCl2; 0.1 mm EDTA; 50 mm NaCl; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 10% glycerol). The protein extract was desalted by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration and kept in glycerol (40% final concentration) at −20 °C until used for the binding reaction. The binding reaction mixture (20-μl final volume) contained: 0.1 pg of labeled probe DNA, 2 μg of nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and different amounts of protein extracts in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9; 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 50 mm KCl; 1 mm EDTA; 10% glycerol). Binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. The reactions were then mixed with loading buffer (40% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol) and electrophorized in 5% native polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 40:1) in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were run at 100 V, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The uracil interference assay was performed essentially as described by Ausubel et al. (29.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Thymine was randomly replaced by deoxyuracil in DNA fragments containing the AG1 protein binding site by PCR amplification using the following oligonucleotides as primers: KD, CTGG AGAC ATTA TACG CT (positions −744 to −727 with respect to the pcbAB transcription start point) and KL, AAAT GCCA CGGT GGGC AC (−608 to −625). Two PCR reactions were performed (25 cycles with the following profile: 94 °C, 45 s; 50 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 60 s); each reaction contained a different labeled oligonucleotide in order to label each of the DNA strands separately. The oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. 20 pmol of the labeled and nonlabeled oligonucleotides were mixed in 100 μl of PCR buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton, 0.03 mm MgCl2) with 0.2 mmdNTP, 0.2 mm dUTP, 0.5 μg DNA template (pBKS+AB), and 5 units Taq DNA polymerase. The amplified PCR products were separated electrophoretically in a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, recovered by electroelution, and used as probes (105 cpm) for EMSA as described above; the probes were incubated separately with a protein extract from glucose-grown cells (purified by filtration through an heparine-agarose column, precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 60%, and desalted by passing through a G-25 chromatography column). The binding reactions were loaded in a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel (without drying) was analyzed in a phosphorimager (Instant Imager, Packard) and the protein-bound DNA fragments of each binding reaction were excised from the gel and recovered by electroelution. The eluted DNA and an aliquot of the PCR products (as control) were treated for 1 h with 1 unit of uracil-N-glycosylase (Perkin-Elmer) at 37 °C in 50 μl of PCR buffer, ethanol-precipitated, and cleaved with 1 m piperidine for 30 min at 90 °C. Then, the same amount (in cpm) of the protein-bound and -free DNA fragments was loaded on a 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The gel was run with 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA, dried, and exposed to a x-ray film. Total RNA was obtained by the SDS-phenol method (29.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar) from the mycelia of the different P. chrysogenum npe10 pyrG transformants grown for 48 h in CP medium with 3% lactose. Identification of the transcription start point at the pcbAB promoter in the different constructions coupled to the lacZ gene was carried out by S1 nuclease protection as described by Favaloro et al. (30.Favaloro J. Treisman R. Kamen R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 718Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Protection was performed with a 1.35-kbPvuII-SmaI fragment covering the entirepcbAB-pcbC intergenic region plus 100 bp of thelacZ coding region (up to the PvuII site in this gene). DNA (30 ng) was melted and hybridized with 30 μg of total RNA in 30 μl of hybridization buffer at 54 °C for 12 h and then treated with 100 units of S1 nuclease at 45 °C for 2 h. The reaction product was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer and electrophorized in a 2% agarose gel. After electrophoresis the gel was blotted onto nitrocellulose paper and hybridized with the 1.35-kilobase PvuII-SmaI probe labeled by nick translation. Nick translation labeling was carried out according to the manufacturer's (Promega) indications; gel blotting and hybridization were performed by standard methods. To study the expression of the pcbAB gene in P. chrysogenum, a 1161-bp NcoI fragment containing the intergenic pcbAB-pcbC region was coupled to the complete E. coli lacZ gene (3069 bp) as an in-frame translational fusion that resulted in a hybrid protein with 49 additional amino acids corresponding to the amino-terminal region of thel-α-aminoadipyl-l-cysteinyl-d-valine synthetase protein. This promoter-reporter gene fusion was introduced in a vector designed for targeted integration at the pyrG locus in P. chrysogenum npe10, a mutant that lacks the penicillin gene cluster due to a deletion of the entire penregion (thus avoiding interference by the endogenous copy of thepen cluster) (20.Gutiérrez S. Marcos A.T. Casqueiro J. Kosalková K. Fernández F.J. Velasco J. Martı́n J.F. Microbiology (Read.). 1999; 145: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31.Fierro F. Gutiérrez S. Dı́ez B. Martı́n J.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). P. chrysogenum npe10 transformants that had incorporated a single copy of the vector carrying the pcbAB-lacZ fusion at thepyrG locus were selected by their restriction pattern, and expression from the pcbAB promoter under different metabolic conditions was tested by assaying the reporter β-galactosidase activity in the collected mycelia. Untransformed controls show a very low endogenous β-galactosidase activity that was subtracted from the values determined. As shown in Fig. 1, when 3% lactose was used as carbon source, expression of the reporter gene occurred early during the fermentation. β-Galactosidase activity in transformant cells was high between 24 and 48 h and then decreased sharply at 72 h (Fig. 1 B). This pattern of expression is consistent with the early expression of the pcbAB gene as measured by Northern blot analysis (20.Gutiérrez S. Marcos A.T. Casqueiro J. Kosalková K. Fernández F.J. Velasco J. Martı́n J.F. Microbiology (Read.). 1999; 145: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In medium containing 3% glucose the expression of the reporter gene was much lower than in medium with lactose. In glucose-based medium the glucose content in the broth decreased to 2% in the first 24 h, to 1.5% at 36 h, and to 0.7% at 48 h (Fig. 1 C), and the β-galactosidase activity increased slowly from the beginning of fermentation (Fig. 1 B). Comparatively, the β-Galactosidase activity was 16-fold higher in cells grown in lactose than in cells grown in glucose medium at 24 h and 8-fold higher at 48 h. A small increase of enzyme activity in glucose-supplemented medium occurred after 48 h of cultivation, when the residual glucose decreased to a 0.7% or lower levels; these results suggest that glucose exerts a repression of the pcbAB promoter. The pH in glucose-supplemented cultures ranged between 0.5 and 1.4 units below the pH values in lactose cultures throughout the fermentation (Fig.1 A). To define important regions for regulation ofpcbAB gene expression, progressive deletions of the promoter region of the pcbAB gene were made (Fig.2). Plasmids with the different deleted regions were introduced by transformation into P. chrysogenum npe10 pyrG at the pyrG locus, and single copy transformants were selected as described previously (20.Gutiérrez S. Marcos A.T. Casqueiro J. Kosalková K. Fernández F.J. Velasco J. Martı́n J.F. Microbiology (Read.). 1999; 145: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The transformants were named from DEL0 (no deletion, complete promoter) to DEL8 (intergenic region completely deleted). Transcription initiation of the pcbAB gene occurs at nucleotide 933 of the intergenic region (numbering starting from theNcoI site at the pcbC start codon 2B. Dı́ez, and J. F. Martı́n, unpublished results. ); the transcriptional start point has been labeled +1 in Fig. 2. To establish how the sequential deletions influenced the transcription ability of the pcbAB gene, a S1 nuclease low resolution analysis was performed by hybridizing a 1.35-kilobasePvuII-SmaI probe to the total RNA isolated from the transformants. Results (Fig. 2 D) showed that the size of the DNA fragments resistant to S1 nuclease activity was the same in all transformants from DEL0 to DEL4 (approximately 350 bp) covering the sequence between the transcriptional start point of thepcbAB gene and the restriction site PvuII in thelacZ gene. This indicates that no abnormal transcription start points appear in the deleted promoter regions. In transformants DEL5, DEL6, DEL7, and DEL8 no hybridization signal appears indicating either lack of transcription from those short promoter regions or a level of transcription that is below the detection threshold of the technique (see “Discussion”). Cis-acting sequences involved in regulation of the pcbAB gene expression were studied by growing the eight transformants with the sequentially deleted promoter regions shown in Fig. 2 in the same medium with either glucose or lactose as sole carbon sources. The level of expression was monitored by measuring the β-galactosidase activity of mycelium collected at 48 h of fermentation. Transformant DEL0 represents the activity of the intact promoter. Transformant DEL8 carried a 5′-promoter deletion, which removed sequences up to +239 (including the transcriptional start point ofpcbAB gene); it was therefore used as a control to check the endogenous β-galactosidase activity plus the possible background expression of the fusion (dotted line in Fig.2 C). In all transformants, activities in glucose-grown cells were clearly lower than in lactose-grown mycelia; this effect of glucose repression was also observed on the endogenous activity in an untransformed strain. Four regions appeared to be important in regulation of thepcbAB gene expression. Deletion of the most distal region of the pcbAB promoter (DEL2, position −933 to −789 relative to the transcriptional start point) results in an increase inpcbAB gene expression in lactose medium. Though we cannot exclude the possibility that regulatory sites exist in this region it is also possible that its deletion leads to a reporter activity increase in lactose-grown mycelium simply because this is the region to which basal RNA polymerase factors for expression of thepcbC gene are expected to bind, which might interfere with binding of transcription factors important for pcbAB expression. The results obtained for transformants DEL2 to DEL6 indicate that there are three other important regions (named A, B, and C) that produce a sharp decrease in gene expression when deleted both in cultures with lactose or glucose. A decrease in the reporter activity (about 41%) was observed between transformants DEL2 (−789) and DEL3 (−665) (box A) and also between transformants DEL4 (−543) and DEL5 (−329) (box C) (59% of the activity) in lactose medium. Similar percentages of reduction were observed when the same constructions were grown in glucose-based medium. Transformant DEL5 (deleted up to the position −329) kept a 24% activity with respect to the complete promoter in lactose medium, whereas transformant DEL6 (position −178) lost almost all activity, retaining only 1.7% of the activity of the entire promoter. These observations indicate an important role of box B in pcbAB gene expression. The activity of transformant DEL8 (no promoter) is identical to the endogenous activity found in the untransformed strainP. chrysogenum npe10 (dotted line in Fig.2 C), indicating that no residual expression is produced in this fusion. Therefore, putative transcriptional activators should bind to box A (stretching out from −789 to −665), box C (from −543 to −329), and box B (from −329 to −178). Several EMSA assays were carried out with DNA probes covering each of these regions. No retardation complexes were detected with fragment C, but they were observed with DNA fragments A and B (see below). To identify transcriptional factors that participate in regulation with thepcbAB gene, crude extracts were obtained from P. chrysogenum npe10 pyrG grown either with glucose or lactose as carbon source. These protein extracts were partially purified (see “Experimental Procedures”) and tested in mobility shift assays with a 130-bp SacI-TaqI DNA probe corresponding to box A, and with a 156-bpTaqI-SalI probe corresponding to box B. Using probe A, a single retardation complex (named AG1) was formed with extracts obtained at different times of fermentation from glucose-grown mycelia (Fig. 3 A). The AG1 retardation complex was clearly observed in extracts from glucose-grown cells; it appeared with extracts of cells collected early in the fermentation and showed its higher concentration at 12 and 24 h of cultivation, decreasing at 48 h and was not formed with extracts of cells grown for 72 h. The protein that forms this complex was later named PTA1 (penicillin transcriptional activator 1). Using extracts of lactose-grown cells formation of the complex with box A was distorted perhaps because of a modification of the PTA1 protein. Using probe B, two major complexes of different sizes appear in extracts obtained from glucose-grown mycelium. They were named BG1 and BG2, and both showed a concentration peak at 24 h of fermentation, decreasing at 48 h and were not present at 72 h of cultivation (Fig. 3 B). In extracts from lactose-grown cells, a different complex (named BL1) (specific to box B a"
https://openalex.org/W2092743539,"The RPB9 subunit of RNA polymerase II regulates transcription elongation activity and is required for the action of the transcription elongation factor, TFIIS. RPB9 comprises two zinc ribbon domains joined by a conserved linker region. The C-terminal zinc ribbon is similar in sequence to that found in TFIIS. To elucidate the relationship between the structure and transcription elongation function of RPB9, we initiated a mutagenesis study on theSaccharomyces cerevisiae homologue. The individual zinc ribbon domains, in isolation or in combination, could not stimulate transcription by a polymerase lacking RPB9, pol IIΔ9. Mutations in the N-terminal zinc ribbon had little effect on transcription activity. By contrast, mutations in the acidic loop that connects the second and third β-strands of the C-terminal zinc ribbon were completely inactive for transcription. Interestingly, the analogous residues in TFIIS are also critical for elongation activity.

Both recombinant inteins exhibit endonuclease activity, with an optimal temperature of 70 °C. The Tfu pol-1 intein, which belongs to the Psp KOD pol-1 allelic family, recognizes and cleaves a minimal sequence of 16 base pairs (bp) on supercoiled DNA with either Mn2+ or Mg2+ as cofactor. It cleaves linear DNA only with Mn2+ and requires a 19-bp minimal recognition sequence. The Tfu pol-2 intein, which belongs to the Tli pol-2 allelic family, is a highly active homing endonuclease using Mg2+ as cofactor. Its minimal recognition and cleavage site is 21 bp long either on linear or circular DNA substrates. Its endonuclease activity is strongly inhibited by the 3′ digestion product, which remains bound to the enzyme after the cleavage reaction. According to current nomenclature, these endonucleases were named PI-TfuI and PI-TfuII.

Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6726-6733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), over 80 putative inteins have been identified. 1This information is available via the World Wide Web (S. Pietrokovski's intein site). 1This information is available via the World Wide Web (S. Pietrokovski's intein site). Inteins are widely distributed in a variety of eucarya, eubacteria, and archaea genes and tend to invade highly conserved and functionally important regions of their host genes. More than 30 different host proteins have been reported, including DNA and RNA polymerases, helicases, gyrases, RecA recombinase, ribonucleotide reductase, and metabolic enzymes. Protein splicing is a rapid autocatalytic process occurring at the peptide level. The intein coding sequence is transcribed and translated in the proper reading frame with flanking regions of the extein to produce a large precursor peptide. The intein is then autocatalytically excised while the N and C extein fragments are ligated, yielding a native and functional host protein. The molecular mechanism of splicing has been thoroughly investigated (3.Xu M.-Q. Comb D.G. Paulus H. Noren C.J. Shao Y. Perler F.B.

Current Biology. 1998; 8: 634-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The excised intein is also a stable protein. Like some group I intron open reading frames, some intein genes have been found to encode double-strand DNA endonucleases, which cleave the inteinless allele of the host gene. Moreover, Gimble and Thorner (8.Gimble F.S. Thorner J. Nature. 1992; 357: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the VMA1-derived endonuclease (VDE or PI-SceI) ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae introduces a staggered double-strand break, repair of which results in the invasion of the intein coding sequence in the VMA1 gene in vivo. Thus, even if this homing event still remains to be demonstrated in eubacteria and archaea, it is clear that the endonuclease activity potentially confers highly specific mobility to its own coding sequence (9.Belfort M. Reaban M.E. Coetzee T. Dalgaard J.Z. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3897-3903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of known inteins contain two conserved sequence motifs characteristic of the LAGLIDADG endonuclease family, called the dodecapeptide motifs, in their central region. In addition, two other motifs found in homing endonucleases and four motifs involved in splicing are generally observed in these inteins (10.Mueller, J. E., Bryk, M., Loizos, N., and Belfort, M. (1993) Nucleases 111–143Google Scholar, 11.Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Saira Mian I.

While sequence alignment analyses tend to show that inteins containing dodecapeptide motifs probably exhibit endonuclease activity, only six inteins, Sce VMA, Tli pol-1, Tlipol-2, Psp GBD pol-1, Psp KOD pol-1, andPsp KOD pol-2, have been shown to be specific endonucleases and named PI-Sce I, PI-Tli II, PI-TliI, PI-Psp I, PI-Pko I, and PI-Pko II, respectively, according to the current nomenclature (8.Gimble F.S.

Cambon and J. Quérellou, unpublished data. 2M. Cambon and J. Quérellou, unpublished data. exhibits two in-frame insertions of 1080 and 1167 bp3 at positions 1218 and 2700, respectively (Fig. 1 a), corresponding to expected inteins of 41.4 kDa (Tfu pol-1) and 44.8 kDa (Tfupol-2). While both Tfu polymerase inteins display the conserved motifs determined by sequence alignment of homing endonucleases, there is a marked divergence between their sequences (11.Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Saira Mian I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4626-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The Tfu pol-1 intein belongs to the allelic family ofPsp KOD pol-1, while Tfu pol-2 intein is aTli pol-2 allele. Thus, to compare the splicing and endonuclease activity of both Tfu DNA pol inteins, their coding sequences and the entire gene of the DNA polymerase were cloned in expression vectors. After the production and the purification of recombinant and spliced inteins, their putative endonuclease activities were investigated and characterized. The coding sequences of Tfu pol-1 andTfu pol-2 inteins were amplified by PCR from Tfugenomic DNA with oligonucleotides Tfu pol-1-ATG (5′-ttagattcatatgtgtcatcctgccgacact-3′), Tfu pol-1-TAG (5′-gatgtcgacctaattgtgggtcagtatgcc-3′), Tfu pol-2-ATG (5′-ctgtacgcatatgagtgttacaggggacacag-3′), and Tfu pol-2-TAG (5′-agcgtcgaccatgttgtgaacgagtattccg-3′), respectively. These PCR products were a gift from J. Quérellou (Ifremer). They were digested by NdeI and SalI and cloned into aNdeI-SalI-digested pET26b vector (Novagen). The resulting constructs (pET26-Tfu1 and pET26-Tfu2) were sequenced by Isoprim (Toulouse, France). Escherichia coli BL21(De3)[pLysS] bacteria transformed with pET26-Tfu1 or pET26-Tfu2 were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth culture medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin (Sigma). A 2-h induction with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) was performed, and cells were lysed in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 (measured at 25 °C), by six cycles of freezing-thawing. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was chromatographed on a XK26 Sepharose Q Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature. The proteins were eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl linear gradient in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 5 ml/min.Tfu pol-1 and Tfu pol-2 are eluted at 0.2 and 0.7m NaCl, respectively, and are approximately 80% homogeneous. These fractions were dialyzed against 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm NaCl for storage. The Tfu pol gene was cloned in an expression vector by Appligène-Oncor (France). BL21(De3)[pLysS] bacteria transformed with this plasmid were grown overnight at 25 °C. Extraction and purification procedures for spliced inteins were identical to those described for recombinant inteins, except that the protein extract was treated for 1 h at 70 °C before purification. All the substrates were constructed by PCR as described by Weiner (16.Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene. 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) using pUC19 as DNA matrix and different purified oligonucleotide pairs: S1–5′ (5′-tcgctatatccttcgattatagagtcgacctgcaggcatgc-3′) and S1–3′ (5′-cctaaaatctaaataagctaagaggatccccgggtaccgag-3′), S2–5′ (5′-acagacggctttttcgcaacagagtcgacctgcaggcatgc-3′) and S2–3′ (5′-atccgcgtacagcactttaaagaggatccccgggtaccgag-3′), S3–5′ (5′-agagtcgacctgcaggcatgc-3′) and S3–3′ (5′-caaaagccgtctgtatccgcgtgagaggatccccgggtaccgag-3′), S4–5′ (5′-agagtcgacctgcaggcatgc-3′) and S4–3′ (5′-atatagcgacctaaaaagaggatccccgggtaccgag-3′), and S5–5′ (5′-tcggtatatcagagtcgacctgcaggcatgc-3′) and S5–3′ (5′-cctaaaatcagaggatccccgggtaccgag-3′), for substrates 1–5, respectively (Fig. 1 b). The sequences in bold are necessary for the annealing to the pUC19 matrix at 60 °C. The 41-bp DNA substrate 1 (S1) for Tfu pol-1 consisted of 20 bp of the 5′ end of the homing site plus 21 bp of the 3′ end, inserted in the XbaI site of pUC19. In the same way, a 43-bp substrate for Tfu pol-2 was constructed (substrate 2, S2). Substrates 3 and 4 (S3 and S4) corresponded to the minimal recognition and cleavage sites determined by the primer extension method (see below) for PI-TfuII and PI-TfuI, respectively. Substrate 5 (S5) corresponded to the minimal linear recognition site of PI-TfuI. The resulting plasmids were either linearized by ScaI (Appligène-Oncor) and purified or the supercoiled forms of the DNA substrates were purified from a 1% agarose gel in TBE (0.09m Tris borate, 0.002 m EDTA) buffer. Finally, linear and circular forms of these substrates were diluted in water to a concentration of 100 ng/μl. Endonuclease activity assays were performed in a final volume of 10 μl, in various reaction buffers and temperatures ranging from 37 °C to 80 °C (see “Results”). The reaction mixtures were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer. The amount of undigested substrates and products were quantified with the ImageQUANT program (Molecular Dynamics Inc.). One unit of PI-TfuI or PI-TfuII endonuclease was required to digest 1 μg of ScaI-linearized DNA substrate 1 or 2, respectively, in 1 h at 70 °C, in optimal buffers. Specific activities of PI-TfuI and PI-TfuII were measured by incubating known amounts of linear DNA substrates with known amounts of purified endonucleases. The endonuclease recognition sites were determined by a primer extension method as described by Wenzlau et al.(17.Wenzlau J.M. Saldanha R.J. Butow R.A. Perlman P.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 421-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). NaOH-denatured plasmids S1 and S2 were sequenced in both orientations using the T7 polymerase sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and universal primers SeqPuc (5′-gtaacgccagggttttcc-3′) and M13Rev (5′-ggaaacagctatgaccatg-3′). After chain termination reaction, the samples were split in two. The first half of the sample was overdigested with 100 units of PI-TfuI or PI-TfuII for 1 h at 70 °C, in a 50 mmTris acetate, pH 8, buffer containing 100 mmNH4OAc and 25 mm MnSO4 or 75 mm Mg(OAc)2, respectively. The cleavage reactions and the undigested half of the sequence reactions were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 5 μl of water. 4 μl of stop solution were added, and the samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a standard 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. 4 μg ofScaI-linearized substrate 2 were overdigested by PI-TfuII in optimal conditions by successive additions of enzyme. Both cleavage reaction products (940 and 1790 bp) were separated and purified from each other from a 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer. These two DNA fragments were then used as competitors in standard cleavage assays of substrate 2. A 119-bp DNA probe containing the 43-bp recognition and cleavage site of PI-TfuII was synthesized by PCR. The universal M13Rev oligonucleotide was first phosphorylated with [γ-33P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and then used together with the pUC5′-Xba oligonucleotide (5′-agctcggtacccggggat-3′) and 26 ng of substrate 2 DNA as matrix in a standard PCR amplification reaction. The 119-bp 33P-labeled fragment was purified and diluted in water to a concentration of 25 nm. 7.5 fmol of this DNA probe were incubated in a 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 8, buffer containing 20 mmMg(OAc)2, 20 mm NH4OAc, 0.1%Triton X-100, and 16% glycerol, either with or without PI-TfuII, in a final volume of 20 μl, for 15 min at 37 °C or 70 °C. These reaction mixtures were then submitted to electrophoresis in a 7.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide (30:1) gel in 0.25× TBE buffer at 220 V for 2 h. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and radioactive bands were detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Inc.). The specificity of the DNA-protein interaction was controlled using 7.5 pmol of herring sperm DNA as a nonspecific competitor in the binding reactions (data not shown). The completeTfu polymerase gene was expressed in E. coli, at 25 °C. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation of the crude extract shows two bands of approximately 41 and 45 kDa, which comigrated with Tfu pol inteins (Fig.2). At this temperature, a partial splicing reaction was observed since the DNA polymerase was not detected after staining the gel with Coomassie Blue, and we consistently obtained more Tfu pol-2 intein thanTfu pol-1. Incubating this bacterial extract at 70 °C increased the yield of spliced proteins, the DNA polymerase being detected after heating for 30 min (Fig. 2). Even then, although no protein bands corresponding to the polymerase precursors were detected on the gel, splicing was probably not complete after 1 h of incubation at 70 °C because of the different amounts of each of the spliced products,i.e. the polymerase and both inteins. Purified Tfu DNA pol is active in standard PCR reactions (Appligène-Oncor). Moreover, purified splicedTfu pol-2 has the same specific endonuclease activity as the recombinant protein. In contrast, we could never detect any endonuclease activity for the purified spliced Tfu pol-1, unlike the recombinant protein (see below). We used the recombinant proteins to investigate further the endonuclease activity of both inteins. Inteins with known endonuclease activity recognize and cut a DNA sequence spanning the junction site created when the intein coding region is deleted from the host gene (homing site). We thus constructed substrate 1 forTfu pol-1 and substrate 2 for Tfu pol-2 by cloning synthetic homing sites of 43 and 41 bp, respectively (Fig.1 b). The supercoiled and ScaI-linearized forms of these DNA substrates were purified and used to assay the endonuclease activity of both inteins. Cleavage assays were performed in a wide range of experimental conditions, including Tris-HCl or Tris acetate buffers, pH 7–9 (measured at 25 °C), containing 0–100 mmMg(OAc)2, 0–400 mm NH4OAc, 0–30% glycerol, and 0–100 mm NaCl, KCl, ZnCl2, CaCl2, MnSO4, or MnCl2. The assay temperature was varied from 37 to 80 °C. The supercoiled substrate 1 was cleaved by Tfu pol-1 intein under a large set of conditions, at an optimal temperature of 70 °C. Both Mg2+ and Mn2+ were able to stimulate the cleavage reaction (Fig. 3 a), and optimal digestion was obtained in a 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8, buffer containing 25 mm MnSO4 and 100 mm NH4OAc. Open circular DNA accumulated during the reaction leading to linear DNA product, indicative of a two-step reaction. When MnSO4 was replaced by 50 mmMg(OAc)2, cleavage efficiency dropped approximately 5-fold and the open circular intermediate accumulated (Fig.3 a). In contrast, Tfu pol-1 showed no endonuclease activity on linear substrate 1 under all the conditions assayed, with up to 300 ng of protein/assay, except when manganese or zinc salts were added to the reaction buffer instead of magnesium salt (Fig. 3 b). It turned out that MnSO4 stimulated the reaction much more efficiently than MnCl2 and ZnCl2. Optimal cleavage of linear substrate 1 was obtained, as with circular substrate 1, in a 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8, buffer containing 25 mm MnSO4 and 100 mmNH4OAc. Under these conditions, both linear and supercoiled substrates were cleaved with the same efficiency and specific activity of Tfu pol-1 (PI-TfuI) was 4,800 units/mg. In contrast, Tfu pol-2 exhibited endonuclease activity on substrate 2 under numerous assay conditions. No difference was observed between circular and linear forms of the DNA substrate, which were cleaved with the same optimal efficiency at 70 °C (Fig.3 c), in a 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8, buffer containing 75 mm Mg(OAc)2, 100 mmNH4OAc, and 10% glycerol, with a specific activity ofTfu pol-2 (PI-TfuII) of 748,000 units/mg. The cleavage efficiency was decreased 5–10-fold by replacing Mg2+ by Mn2+. Otherwise, no cleavage was observed during the endonucleasic digestion of the supercoiled DNA (Fig. 3 c). The effects of DNA topology and divalent ions used as cofactor on endonuclease activity of PI-TfuI and PI-TfuII are summarized in TableI.Table ICleavage properties of PI-TfuI and PI-TfuIILinear DNACircular DNAMn2+Mg2+Mn2+Mg2+PI-TfuI Substrate 1 (43 bp)+++−++++ Substrate 4 (16 bp)−−++++PI-TfuII Substrate 2 (41 bp)++++++++ Substrate 3 (21 bp)++++++++Relative activities of PI-TfuI and PI-TfuII on substrates 1 and 4, or 2 and 3, respectively.

A mixture of potential double-strand DNA substrates for PI-TfuI and PI-TfuII were generated by primer extension using circular substrate 1 or substrate 2 as templates, respectively. The extension products including all the bases needed for cleavage were digested and thus disappeared from the sequence reaction, while those lacking one or more bases of the minimal recognition site were not digested. Hence, the comparison of digested and undigested sequence reactions allowed the determination of the bases necessary for cleavage (Fig.4 a). This method yielded a 16-bp non-palindromic site for PI-TfuI and a 21-bp non-palindromic site for PI-TfuII. In both cases, cleavage generated non-identical 3′ overhangs of 4 bases (Fig. 4 b). Both cleaved substrates could be religated with T4 DNA ligase. Thus, cleavage by PI-TfuI or PI-TfuII generated 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl ends. To confirm the results obtained by primer extension, plasmids containing the 21-bp site for PI-TfuII (substrate 3) or the 16-bp site for PI-TfuI (substrate 4, Fig. 1 b) were constructed and submitted to cleavage assays either as linear or supercoiled DNA. Standard cleavage assays on linear and circular DNA substrates 3 and 4, under optimal conditions for each enzyme, highlight the different catalytic behaviors of the endonuclease inteins (Table I). While PI-TfuII cleaved with the same efficiency linear and circular substrates 2 and 3 in the magnesium-containing buffer, PI-TfuI cleaved linear substrate 1 but did not cleave linear substrate 4 even in presence of manganese (Fig.5 a). On the other hand, PI-TfuI cleaved with the same efficiency supercoiled substrates 1 and 4 (Fig. 5 b). Cleavage assays on various linear substrates for PI-TfuI (data not shown), containing synthetic homing sites of different lengths, led to a minimal linear site of 19 bp (Fig. 1 b), which is homologous to the one described for PI-PkoI (15.Nishioka M. Fujiwara S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4409-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, PI-TfuII cleaved its homing site and made no difference between linear and supercoiled DNA containing the minimal or a larger recognition site. In contrast, PI-TfuI cleaved supercoiled DNA harboring its 16-bp recognition sequence but required a longer recognition sequence (≥19 bp) and manganese as cofactor to cleave linear DNA. Moreover, under these conditions, linear DNA was cleaved as efficiently as circular DNA (Table I). While incubation of linear substrate 1 with PI-TfuI led to its complete cleavage, prolonged incubation of substrate 2 with PI-TfuII resulted in only partial cleavage (Fig.6 a). The same results were obtained with circular DNA substrates (data not shown). After 10 min, 80% of the cleavage was performed and the reaction stopped. Addition of fresh PI-TfuII allowed the reaction to proceed, but a loss of activity rapidly followed (data not shown). As the enzyme was stable at 70 °C, this loss of activity could result from an inhibition of PI-TfuII by one of its reaction products. To test this hypothesis, the two DNA fragments resulting from the cleavage of ScaI-linearized substrate 2 were purified and added as potential inhibitors in cleavage reactions. Under the conditions used, 50 ng of substrate 2 were digested by PI-TfuII, when no inhibitor was added to the reaction. Fig. 6 b shows that the 940-bp fragment, which includes the homing site 5′ end, inhibited weakly the cleavage reaction. On the other hand, the 1790-bp fragment, which includes the homing site 3′ end, was an efficient inhibitor of the reaction, a 1:1 ratio between substrate and DNA fragment resulting in 80% inhibition. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays confirmed the strong interaction between the 3′ cleavage fragment and PI-TfuII. Fig. 7 shows that this digestion product remained bound to the enzyme after cleavage was performed at 70 °C. Under these experimental conditions (large excess of enzyme over substrate), cleavage could also be observed at 37 °C but there was surprisingly no mobility shift for the resulting fragment.Figure 7Electrophoretic mobility shift assay.The DNA probe (7.5 fmol) was incubated for 15 min with (+) or without (−) 150 fmol of PI-TfuII at 37 °C, or with (+) or without (−) 75 fmol of PI-TfuII at 70 °C, in a 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 8, buffer containing 20 mmMg(OAc)2, 20 mm NH4OAc, 0.1%Triton X-100, and 16% glycerol.

These inteins are in-frame insertions at precisely the same locations, in the conserved motifs II, III, or I of the class B DNA polymerases (pol α). Thus, three allelic families of inteins have been defined, corresponding to these three different locations (Ref. 12.Perler F.B. Olsen G.J. Adam E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar; available via the World Wide Web from InBase, the New England Biolabs intein data base). Among the seven known intein-harboring polymerases, the Tfu polymerase is the only one that does not have a large intein within the conserved motif III. Its two inteins, Tfu pol-1 in motif II and Tfupol-2 in motif I, belong to the Psp KOD pol-1 andTli pol-2 allelic families, respectively. Both inteins exhibit endonuclease activity with an optimal temperature of 70 °C, which is in line with the thermophilic nature of T. fumicolans. Splicing of the inteins does occur in E. coli, but it is very inefficient. It is greatly enhanced by a prolonged incubation at 70 °C. Thus, unlike the splicing of PI-SceI, splicing of the Tfu pol inteins seems quite temperature-dependent. One puzzling result was the fact that no endonuclease activity could be detected in vitro for the spliced PI-TfuI, while the recombinant protein exhibits enzymatic activity. This suggests that, when produced in E. coli, the precursor protein fold is not fully correct, resulting in hindered splicing as well as inactive PI-TfuI. Indeed, splicing of PI-TfuII is much more efficient that splicing of PI-TfuI and the spliced PI-TfuII is fully active. When produced separately, the recombinant inteins and the DNA polymerase are active. High salt buffers are needed for optimal cleavage activity of both inteins. This feature could be linked to the fact that T. fumicolans is a marine organism, optimal growth of which is obtained with 30–40 g/liter salt (19.Godfroy A. Meunier J.-R. Guezennec J. Lesongeur F.

Indeed, the DNA polymerase activity is also stimulated by salts, while DNA polymerases from freshwater thermophilic bacteria, such as the Taqenzyme, do not need high salt concentrations. Tfu pol-1 (PI-TfuI) is 75.5% identical toPsp KOD pol-1, also known as homing endonuclease PI-PkoI (15.Nishioka M. Fujiwara S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4409-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PI-TfuI cleaves supercoiled DNA with magnesium or manganese as cofactor but requires manganese and a longer recognition site to cleave linear DNA. A difference in size requirement for minimal recognition sequence between linear and circular DNA has already been described for PI-SceI (20.Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The 16-bp minimal recognition sequence for PI-TfuI is 3 bp shorter than the one determined for PI-PkoI (15.Nishioka M. Fujiwara S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4409-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In fact, on linear DNA, PI-TfuI and PI-PkoI both require a 19-bp sequence for binding and cleavage. The main difference between the two enzymes then seems to be metal requirements. Within the conserved sequence motifs that constitute the endonuclease signature, there are few differences between the two inteins PI-TfuI and PI-PkoI. The two acidic residues that are part of the catalytic triad (Glu-125 and Asp-225) are conserved, but the third residue, Lys-203, is replaced by an arginine in PI-TfuI. Such a substitution in PI-SceI (K301R) led to a 15-fold loss of activity and to a larger increase of activity when substituting magnesium with manganese (21.He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The equivalent substitution K92R totally inactivated EcoRV (22.Vipond I.B. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1702-1711Google Scholar). On the other hand, an arginine is also found in the catalytic triad of PI-TliI, which requires Mg2+ as cofactor (12.Perler F.B. Olsen G.J. Adam E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), as does PI-PkoI. This change in residue therefore cannot account for the specific metal requirement of PI-TfuI. Although manganese has been shown to stimulate the activity of magnesium requiring endonucleases, including PI-SceI (8.Gimble F.S. Thorner J. Nature. 1992; 357: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,21.He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4607-4615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it usually results in relaxed specificity, allowing cleavage of non-cognate sites. PI-TfuI is peculiar, for it has no detectable activity with magnesium on linear DNA while its activity with manganese as a cofactor is comparable to that of PI-PkoI. Thus, manganese relaxes the topological specificity of PI-TfuI, but not its requirement for cognate sequence, which is the same with either metal on supercoiled DNA. In this respect, it is reminiscent of the I91L mutant of EcoRV, where a single mutation within the active site of the enzyme results in a total shift in metal requirement while retaining specificity for the cognate sequence (23.Vipond I.B. Moon B.J. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The longer sequence needed for cleavage of linear DNA could translate the requirement of initial DNA bending for efficient substrate binding. On bent DNA, the enzyme takes a conformation that allows either magnesium or manganese to occupy the cofactor site and neutralize the phosphorus to trigger the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond. On linear DNA, the enzyme might take a slightly stretched conformation such that magnesium cannot occupy the cofactor site anymore while manganese, due to its 20% larger bonding radius, can still efficiently bind to its site on the protein and neutralize the phosphorus on DNA. An open circular intermediate accumulates during the reaction with supercoiled DNA, suggesting a two-step mechanism. A slower reaction rate with magnesium translates into more open circular intermediate. In a similar way, an open circular intermediate also accumulates during the magnesium-catalyzed cleavage by EcoRV, but disappears with manganese (either with the wild type EcoRV or with the I91L mutant) due to the enhanced cleavage rate. Tfu pol-2 (PI-TfuII), which is 65% identical toTli pol-2 (PI-TliI), is a very active endonuclease. It recognizes and cuts a 21-bp site on linear or circular DNA, leaving a 4-base 3′-OH overhang. This site is 15 bp shorter than the PI-SceI homing site (24.Gimble F.S. Wang J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and slightly larger than the sites recently determined for the PI-PkoI, PI-PkoII (15.Nishioka M. Fujiwara S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4409-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or PI-TfuI (this work) enzymes. It only differs by 3 bases from the 21-bp sequence central to the PI-TliI recognition site. A more thorough comparison of these two enzymes is needed to determine if they truly have different cleavage sites. Unlike PI-TfuI, PI-TfuII requires Mg2+ as a cofactor and is less active with Mn2+for cleavage of its cognate sequence. PI-TfuII is subject to efficient product inhibition by one of the cleavage fragments. Our gel shift experiments indicate that theKI for the product should be of the same order of magnitude as the K m for the substrate. We also observe that binding of the substrate at 37 °C is still efficient, while cleavage is almost abolished as well as product inhibition. This result is reminiscent of an inhibition mechanism involving the catalytic residues. Similar product inhibition has been reported for other endonucleases, including PI-SceI, although in this latter case inhibition appears more drastic (20.Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, the DNA recognition and cleavage mechanism is probably homologous for both endonucleases, with a strong binding site 3′ to the cleavage site. T. fumicolans DNA polymerase gene harbors two intein genes like many other archaea DNA polymerase genes, but it is the only one that does not have a Tli pol-1 type intein allele. Its two intein genes code for active endonucleases that greatly differ in specific activity, cognate sequence, as well as metal requirement, cleavage site topology, and sensitivity to product inhibition. Such a situation has not been yet described and provides a contrasted model for the study of archaebacterial endonuclease inteins. Site-directed mutagenesis of the active site of PI-TfuI will provide more information on the role of its residues and on its unusual topological and cofactor specificity. We thank Joël Quérellou for providing the PCR products of intein genes and Heı̈dy Eleaume and Emmanuelle Laurine for technical assistance."

The donor (N-[[(iodoacetyl)amino]ethyl]-5-naphthylamine-1-sulfonate) was attached to either the catalytic domain (Cys-707) or the essential light chain (Cys-177) of S1, whereas the acceptor (5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein) was attached to the actin filament (Cys-374). In contrast to the narrow positional distribution (assumed as being Gaussian) of Cys-707 (5 ± 3 Å), the positional distribution of Cys-177 was found to be broad (102 ± 4 Å).

Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) provided a framework for the description of conformational changes associated with the contractile cycle. The atomic models permit the study of proximity relationships between various sites in the acto-myosin complex. An alternative method for studying proximal relationships within a macromolecule is FRET1 spectroscopy. Several interprotein distances within the acto-myosin complex have been already determined with this latter method (10.Bhandari D.G. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11.Takashi R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12.Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The distance between Cys-374 of actin and Cys-707 of S1 under rigor conditions was found to be 60 (11.Takashi R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), 50 (12.Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15.Miki M. Wahl P. Bichim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and 51 Å (14.Xing J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). By the use of scallop myosin hybrid molecules this distance was determined to be 45 Å (16.Park H.-S. Tao T. Chantler P.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3189-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The distance between Cys-374 of actin and Cys-177 in the ELC of S1 in rigor was measured to be 50 (11.Takashi R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and 60 Å (10.Bhandari D.G. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). FRET spectroscopy was applied to determine the radial coordinate, i.e. the distance from the imaginary axis of a labeled side chain within the actin filament, where special symmetry conditions are fulfilled (1.Taylor D.L. Reidler J. Spudich J.A. Stryer L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The radial coordinate of a number of points in the actin filament and proximal relationships in the S1- and heavy meromyosin-decorated actin filament was determined by this approach (1.Taylor D.L. Reidler J. Spudich J.A. Stryer L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17.Miki M. Barden J.A. dos Remedios C.G. Biochim. Biophys.

J. 1997; 73: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Although FRET spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography are significantly different methods, there is usually a good correlation between the distances calculated from the atomic model and the ones obtained by FRET (24.Dos Remedios C.G. Moens P.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 25.Elofsson A. Rigler R. Nilsson L. Roslund J. Krause G. Holmgren A.

Accordingly, most of the FRET data obtained in the case of actin and acto-myosin are in a reasonably good agreement with the distances obtained by using the atomic models (5.Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 6.Milligan R.A. Whittaker M. Safer D.

Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). However, an exception is the distance between Cys-177 on ELC of S1 and Cys-374 on the actin filament, because FRET revealed 50–60 Å (10.Bhandari D.G. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11.Takashi R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), whereas the atomic model resulted in ∼89 Å (9.Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Although this discrepancy may originate from biologically irrelevant factors (e.g. the non-zero size of the FRET probes (24.Dos Remedios C.G. Moens P.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar)), the problem deserves further investigations because of the central role of the light chain-binding domain of S1 in the force generating process (9.Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 27.Holmes K.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 112-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Cooke R. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 21: 53-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In the present work we analyze the proximity relationships in the rigor acto-S1 complex, with a particular focus on the conformational distributions of the light chain-binding domain associated with a donor-acceptor distance distribution. The FRET method, developed originally by Taylor et al. (1.Taylor D.L. Reidler J. Spudich J.A. Stryer L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) for radial coordinate determinations in actin filament, was extended to obtain the positional distribution of points in S1 relative to the axis of the actin filament. The applicability and limitations of the extended method are described for different scenarios, e.g. for various spatial conditions and spectral parameters. The proximity relationships between the axis of the actin filament and either Cys-707, or Cys-177 of S1 were studied in rigor complex at 20 °C. The distance distribution describing the donor position was approximated as Gaussian with a mean value of R c and full width at half-maximum of ς. In the case of donor on Cys-707 (in the catalytic domain)R c was 52 Å, in good agreement with earlier data (11.Takashi R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12.Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14.Xing J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15.Miki M. Wahl P. Bichim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16.Park H.-S. Tao T. Chantler P.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3189-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This distance distribution was substantially narrow, with ς of 5 Å. In case of donor bound to Cys-177 (in the ELC), R c was 73 Å, which is greater than the ones obtained by using FRET technique (50–60 Å) (10.Bhandari D.G. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11.Takashi R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and correlates more with the 89 Å based on the atomic model of the acto-myosin complex (9.Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). The simulated transfer efficiencies fit the experimental data only in the case when a wide positional distribution of the label on the light chain-binding domain was assumed (ς = 102 Å). These results are compatible with earlier observations according to which there might be a direct interaction between the ELC of S1 and the C-terminal region of actin (29.Yamamoto K. Sekine T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 2075-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30.Henry G.D. Winstanley M.A. Dalgarno D.C. Scott G.M. Levine B.A. Trayer I.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 830: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to this our data can support the hypothesis stating that during the power stroke, the light chain-binding domain tilts against the catalytic domain, that is connected to the actin filament in a fixed orientation (9.Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 27.Holmes K.C. Curr.

ATP, ADP, and β-mercaptoethanol were obtained from Merck, and NaN3 was from FLUKA (Switzerland, Buchs). IAF was purchased from Molecular Probes (OR, Eugene). The Bradford protein assay reagent was purchased from Bio-Rad. Actin (31.Feuer G. Molnár F. Pettkó E. Straub F.B. Hung. Acta Physiol. 1948; 1: 150-163PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Spudich J.A. Watt S.

Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle. S1 was prepared by chymotryptic digestion according to Weeds and Taylor (34.Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Labeling of Cys-707 of S1 was carried out as described earlier (14.Xing J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Labeling of Cys-177 in the ELC was performed as published recently (35.Smyczynski C. Kasprzak A.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13201-13207Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 36.Kasprzak A.A. Chaussepied P. Morales M.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9230-9238Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This light chain labeling did not involve the commonly employed light chain exchange procedure, which has been reported to distort its structure (37.Zaager S. Burke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1513-1517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following labeling, S1 was dialyzed overnight against rigor buffer (25 mm TES, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm MgCl2) and were clarified by a 1-h centrifugation at 100,000 × g prior to fluorescence experiments. Actin was labeled on the Cys-374 residue with IAF as described previously (38.Nyitrai M. Hild G. Belágyi J. Somogyi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12996-13001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but the incubation time was extended to 28–30 h. Labeled actin monomer solution was clarified by a 2-h centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The clarified actin was polymerized by the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 and 100 mm KCl for 2 h at room temperature and then dialyzed overnight against rigor buffer to remove free nucleotides (14.Xing J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The absorption measurements were carried out with a Shimadzu UV-2100 spectrophotometer. The following absorption coefficients were used to estimate the labeling stochiometry: S1, ε280 nm1% = 7.5 (39.Wagner P.D. Weeds A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 109: 455-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar); actin monomer, ε290 nm1% = 0.63 (40.Houk W.T. Ue K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 62: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar); IAEDANS, ε336 nm = 6100 m−1cm−1 (41.Hudson E.N. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4154-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar); and IAF, ε496 nm = 77000m−1 cm−1 (11.Takashi R.

The measured optical density of the labeled protein solution was corrected for the contributions of the fluorescence dyes. In these samples the protein concentration was also determined occasionally by the Bradford micro-assay (42.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The following labeling ratios were determined: S1 labeled with IAEDANS on the Cys-707, 0.8–0.9; S1 labeled with IAEDANS on Cys-177, 0.5–0.7; and actin labeled with IAF on Cys-374, 0.75–0.8. Labeled S1 was routinely characterized by measuring the K+/EDTA-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase activity (43.Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The assays were performed at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.6 m KCl, 2.5 mm ATP, and either 10 mm EDTA or 9 mm CaCl2. The ATPase activities measured simultaneously for unlabeled S1 served as reference. Steady-state fluorescence experiments were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer. Prior to the fluorescence measurements, protein solutions were dialyzed overnight against rigor buffer. The concentrations of actin and S1 in the samples were 10 and 2 μm, respectively. Under these conditions the concentration of uncomplexed S1 is negligible (12.Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14.Xing J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The solution of S1 and labeled and unlabeled actin filaments were mixed appropriately to obtain the desired protein concentrations and acceptor molar ratios (ratio of acceptor to actin monomer concentration). The samples were then incubated at room temperature for 4–5 h. Consideration of the tread-milling rate of the actin filament (44.Selve N. Wegner A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 627-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) suggests that this time is long enough to reach an equilibrium state. To test this assumption, the samples were remeasured following overnight incubation, resulting in no deviation from the data obtained after 4–5-h incubation time. To estimate the undesired effect of contaminating nucleotides (ATP or ADP) in control experiments, the FRET measurements were carried out in the presence of apyrase (1 units/ml, 3-h incubation time), an enzyme that can hydrolyze either ATP or ADP. FRET efficiency was determined from the decrease of the donor fluorescence intensity as follows. E=1−(FDA/FD)Equation 1 where F DA and F Dare the donor fluorescence intensities in the presence and the absence of acceptor, respectively. Fluorescence emission of IAEDANS was recorded at excitation and emission wavelengths of 400 and 470 nm, respectively. Excitation and emission slits were set to 5 nm. Under these conditions the contribution of acceptor fluorescence to the measured fluorescence emission was excluded. Fluorescence intensities were corrected for the inner filter effect (45.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, London1983: 43-47Google Scholar). Because the highly reactive cysteine (Cys-707) of S1 becomes labeled up to about 10% (35.Smyczynski C. Kasprzak A.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13201-13207Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) even when Cys-177 of the ELC is targeted, the observed transfer efficiencies were corrected for the heterogeneous donor labeling as follows. ECys­177corr=(Eobserved−γECys­707)/(1−γ)Equation 2 where E observed is the measured transfer efficiency, E cys-707 is the transfer efficiency between the donor on the Cys-707 and acceptors on the actin filament, and γ is the ratio of Cys-707-bound donor concentration to S1 concentration (35.Smyczynski C. Kasprzak A.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13201-13207Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The actual value of γ was obtained from the results of ATPase activity experiments. The distance between donor and acceptor was calculated by using the transfer efficiency and Förster's critical distance (R o). R o is defined as the donor-acceptor distance at which the FRET efficiency is 50%. The values of R o for the IAEDANS-IAF pair between the Cys-374 on actin and Cys-707 on S1 were found previously to be 52 (11.Takashi R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and 48–49 Å (12.Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For the same pair labeling Cys-707 of ELC and Cys-374 of actin R o was found to be 47 Å (10.Bhandari D.G. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we used a consensus value of 50Å. From the transfer efficiency (E) and Förster's critical distance (R o), the distance between the donor and acceptor molecules (R) for a single donor-single acceptor system can be calculated from the following. E=Ro6/(Ro6+R6)Equation 3 The calculation becomes more complicated if a single donor may transfer energy to more than one acceptor. In this case Equation 3transforms to (46.Bay Z. Pearlstein R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 47.Gennis R.B. Cantor C.R. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) the following. E=∑i(Ro/Ri) 6/1+∑i(Ro/Ri) 6Equation 4 where R i denotes the individual donor-acceptor distances. For the analysis of experimental data we assumed that the donor molecule in S1 might transfer energy to acceptors located on the five nearest actin monomers. We defined a three-dimensional Descartean coordinate system fixed to the actin filament (see Fig. 1). The z axis was defined as the imaginary longitudinal axis of the filament, and the x axis was defined as a line perpendicular to the z axis and crossing the acceptor on the closest actin monomer. The yaxis was adjusted appropriately to the defined x andz axes (see Fig. 1). The simulation needs to consider the geometry of the actin filament as well. The radial coordinate of Cys-374 was previously found to be 35 (1.Taylor D.L. Reidler J. Spudich J.A. Stryer L. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), 20–22 or 25 (20.Kasprzak A.A. Takashi R. Morales M.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4512-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and 12–23 Å (21.Moens P.D.J. Yee D.J. dos Remedios C.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (12108): 13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) under different experimental conditions. The radial coordinate of the Sγ atom of Cys-374 was found with x-ray crystallography to be 27 Å (7.Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Here we used 25 Å for the Cys-374 radial coordinate. The pitch of the actin monomer in the actin filament, and the relative rotation of the neighboring monomer along the genetic helix were taken to be 55 Å and 166°, respectively (5.Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The coordinates (x, y, and z) of the Cys-374 residues on the five actin monomers considered were then calculated by using the following equations. xi=r cos((3−i)166°)Equation 5 yi=r sin((3−i)166°)Equation 6 zi=(3−i)27.5ÅEquation 7 where i takes the integer value from 1 to 5 and refers to individual actin monomers, and r is the radial coordinate of Cys-374. If the acceptor molar ratio (f) is known, the probability (p k) of the individual arrangements could be obtained from the binomial distribution as follows. pk=∑i=15fi(1−f) 5−iEquation 8 Knowing the positions of the potential acceptor labeling sites on the five actin monomers, the cumulative transfer efficiency (E f) at a given acceptor molar ratio (f) can be calculated using Equations 4 and 6 as follows. Ef=∑kpkEkEquation 9 where E k is the FRET efficiency between the donor and the acceptors in the k th arrangement of actin monomers (Equation 4), whereas p k is the probability of the k th arrangement (Equation 6). By applying these equations, one can simulate the transfer efficiency over a range of virtual donor positions as a function of acceptor molar ratio. These simulations were carried out in MATLAB 5.2 (MathWorks Inc., MA). Comparison of the simulated curves with the experimental data allows the determination of the physically veritable position of the donor. The set of coordinates that best describes the donor position was determined by minimizing the value of the error parameter (d 2) defined as follows. d2=∑i(αi−βi) 2/nEquation 10 where αi and βi are the measured and simulated transfer efficiencies, and n is the number of experimental data. To minimize the value of d 2, the surface of errors (d2) was generated over a wide range of Descartean coordinates, and the global minimum of this surface was determined. The proper set of coordinates was determined with initial parameters in the vicinity of the global minimum using a fitting algorithm provided by the software (MATLAB 5.2). This two-step analysis allowed the best parameter set to be found even if local minimums were present on the d 2 surface. It should be noted that the errors presented here for the distance parameters were given by the software used for analyzing the data and calculated by neglecting the experimental errors attributed to the determination of transfer efficiency values (see Table I). Therefore, these values provide an underestimation for the real errors.Table IThe efficiency (E) of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the donor (IAEDANS) on either Cys-707 or Cys-177 of S1 and the acceptors (IAF) on actin (Cys-374) as a function of acceptor molar ratioAcceptor molar ratioFRET efficiencyE Cys-707E Cys-1770.126.84 (0.17)9.74 (4.97)0.2512.03 (1.46)17.21 (4.62)0.3718.56 (0.17)22.89 (2.24)0.5023.52 (1.72)27.68 (3.72)0.6229.23 (1.88)30.69 (1.35)0.7536.07 (0.78)33.33 (2.55)The experiments were carried out under rigor conditions at 20 °C.

The mathematical treatment described above was unable to account for the distance distribution related to the conformational heterogeneity of the protein matrix. To accommodate conformational distribution as well, the donor-acceptor distance distributions must also be taken into account. We have assumed in the analysis that the transitions between the conformational states are slow on a nanosecond time scale. To describe the distance distribution characteristic for a donor-acceptor system, it is necessary to approximate its actual shape by a mathematical function. The complexity of the conformational and dynamic events occurring within a protein did not allow us to use the exact form for the distribution, and therefore, the application of a simple model was required. Among the simple models, which might serve as good approximation of the donor-acceptor distance distribution, the Gaussian model seemed to be appropriate in earlier studies (48.Lillo M.P. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11261-11272Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the distribution of the donor-acceptor distances (ω(R)) was approximated here with a Gaussian function, with a mean ofR c and the full width at half-maximum of ς. ω(R)=1ς2πexp−(R−Rc) 22ς2Equation 11 Although this model very likely allows the proper determination of the mean donor-acceptor distance (Rc), the width of the distribution (ς) may only be interpreted qualitatively. Because the sensitivity of the method along the y orz axis proved to be rather small (see “Results and Discussion”), only the distribution of the x coordinate was involved in the simulations. In these simulations the summation of the individual transfer efficiencies (see Equation 7) was carried out as follows. Ef=∑jkpkω(Rj)EjkEquation 12 where ω(R j) is the probability that the donor-acceptor distance is R j (at thej th position of the distance distribution). In the simulations the position of the donor was allowed to probe all the locations around the equilibrium position between (R c − 3ς) and (R c+ 3ς). Labeling of Cys-707 of S1 with IAEDANS inhibited the K+/EDTA ATPase activity by 80–90% and increased the Ca2+-ATPase activity by a factor of 2–3. These results support previously published observations (14.Xing J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When S1 was labeled with IAEDANS on Cys-177 of the ELC, the K+/EDTA ATPase activity decreased only by 3–12%, which is in agreement with the data obtained by Smyczynski and Ka"

Heart myocyte ischemic damage, caused by insufficient blood supply, is the leading cause of heart infarction. Here we demonstrate that when primary myocyte cultures are subjected to hypoxic stress, ThR mRNA levels are reduced markedly. This takes place also in vivo in a model of ischemic pig heart, exhibiting reduced levels of ThR compared with normal heart sections. Prior activation of ThR however, by either thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) or by α-thrombin resulted in full protection of ThR mRNA levels under hypoxia. The effect appeared specific to ThR because the addition of TRAP did not affect the hypoxic damage as shown by the levels of lactic dehydrogenase release and up-regulated GLUT-1, a glucose transporter gene. This protection effect took place not only in primary myocytes but also in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. ThR protection occurs via specific cell signaling events because activation of the receptor by TRAP, following interruption of the signaling cascade by calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor, resulted in loss of ThR mRNA protection. Because Ras and Src are part of the ThR signaling cascade, the introduction of either dominant ras or src oncogenes to NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts gave rise to similar protection of ThR mRNA levels under hypoxic conditions without the exogenous addition of TRAP. Likewise, ThR mRNA protection was obtained after transfection with proto-oncogene vav. The 95-kDa protein Vav undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation after ThR activation, serving thus as part of the receptor machinery cascade. We therefore conclude that the initiation of the signaling cascades either exogenously by TRAP or within the cell via src or ras, as well as viavav oncogene interconnecting G-binding protein to the tyrosine kinase pathway, ultimately results in ThR protection under hypoxia. We present hereby, a novel concept of activated receptors, which under minimal oxygen tension protect their otherwise decaying mRNA.

The molecular mechanism of hypoxia-regulated gene expression essential for the physiological maintenance of the cardiovascular system is poorly understood. A number of oxygen-regulated and glucose-regulated proteins have been characterized. Among these are the up-regulation of the glucose transporter GLUT-1, which acts to improve uptake of available glucose (5.Wertheimer E. Sasson S. Cerasi E. Ben-Neriah Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unlike most cellular growth factor receptors, the activation of this receptor does not require the traditional ligand-receptor complex formation. Instead, the receptor serves as a substrate for proteolytic digestion, yielding an irreversible form of receptor to convey further cell signaling (16.Vu T.-K. Hung H.D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

Cleavage of the Arg41-Ser42residues of the NH2-terminal extracellular portion unmasks an internal ligand that binds intramolecularly to the second transmembrane loop in the receptor. ThR can thus be viewed as a polypeptide receptor that contains its own internal ligand (SFLLRN), providing the first example of a prototype PAR family being established. More recently, three other members of the family (PAR2–PAR4; see Refs. 20.Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Larsson A.-K. Strombeck B. Sundelin J. Eur. J.

Receptor activation sets in motion G-protein-coupled signaling pathways, protein kinase cascades, and mitogen-activated protein kinase downstream (24.Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol.

J. 1993; 289: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It has been shown that activation of ThR activates Src and Fyn tyrosine kinases as agonist synthetic peptides of the receptor cause the tyrosine phosphorylation effect (26.Chen Y.-H. Pouyssegur J. Coutrridge S.A. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27372-27377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that nonreceptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family may represent a novel effector system linking G-protein-coupled receptors to activated Ras and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade downstream (26.Chen Y.-H. Pouyssegur J. Coutrridge S.A. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27372-27377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unlikely that Src-related kinases interact directly with Ras. Rather, one or more kinases or adapter proteins are presumed to be located between the Src kinases and Ras. Ras activation is an important early event in growth promoting signal transduction by G-protein-coupled receptors (27.Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F.

Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative form of Ras has been shown to inhibit thrombin-stimulated gene induction and DNA synthesis reinitiation in astrocytoma cells (29.La Morte V.J. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. Meinkoth J.L. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol.

Commun. 1994; 202: 1252-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ThR activation leads to phosphorylation of an immediate upstream cellular target, the Vav protein (31.Cichowski K. Brugge J.S. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7544-7550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Vav protein plays a key role as a cytoplasmic signal transducer. This proto-oncogene encodes for a product that contains different modular domains known to function in tyrosine signal transduction events such as: PH, SH2, and SH3. Some of these domains were shown to be involved in protein-protein interactions. An additional domain that is characteristic of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors is also present in Vav (32.Katzav S. Packham G. Sutherland M. Aroca P. Santos G. Cleavland J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1079-1088PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Katzav S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1757-1763PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, Vav could potentially serve to link tyrosine signaling to the G-binding family by specific interactions with different proteins and through its activity as a GDP/GTP exchange factor (33.Katzav S. Crit. Rev. Oncogen. 1995; 6: 87-97PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we propose a novel myocardial ThR regulation under hypoxia. We show that after hypoxia, the otherwise decaying ThR mRNA is maintained at its normal level upon initiation of the signaling cascade regardless of whether activated exogenously or in an “inside-on” manner. Maintaining the level of ThR, a cell surface receptor that takes an active part in normal myocyte function, may provide a significant repair mechanism for ischemic tissue, assisting in regaining normal myocyte function. Whether protection of ThR mRNA results from an induced stability or from an induced rate of transcription remains to be determined. Neonatal rat ventricular heart muscle cells were prepared and plated as described previously (35.Pinson A. Padieu P. Harari I. Pinson A. The Heart Cell in Culture. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 7-21Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricles of 1-day-old rats were minced and treated with trypsin, and the combined fractions were resuspended in growth medium into a sterile flask (Nunc; Nuclon Delta Herlev, Denmark) through a sterile mesh to exclude explants. The pooled cells were suspended in growth medium to a density of 9 × 105 to 1 × 106cells/ml and seeded into a 35-mm-diameter Petri dish (Falcon 3001; Falcon Labware, Oxnard, CA). This concentration yielded, after 24–36 h, a near confluent layer of beating heart cells at a final density of about 2 × 106 cells. Cultures were kept at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Experiments were performed at 5 days of culture when more than 80% of the cells exhibited myocardial cells. The NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts included NIH3T3 cells that express thevav proto-oncogene (K62, 35); NIH3T3 cells that express the vavSH3 mutant protein P832L 2E. Landau, R. Tirosh, A. Pinson, S. Banai, S. Even-Ram, M. Maoz, S. Katzav, and and R. Bar-Shavit, unpublished data. ; NIH3T3 cells that express the vavSH2 mutant R695L (34.Katzav S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1757-1763PubMed Google Scholar); NIH3T3 cells that express the ras oncogene (H-rasLys12; 32), and NIH3T3 cells transfected with v-src. Single transformed foci were used in these experiments. These cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. Tissue culture media were supplemented with penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the cells were dissociated with a 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, 0.01m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, solution and subcultured at a split ratio of 1:5. RNA was prepared using TRI-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA (20 μg of total RNA) was separated by electrophoresis through a 1.1% agarose gel containing 2 m formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized either to cDNA probes or to polymerase chain reaction product radiolabeled by random primer extension with [α-32P]dCTP (37.Feinberg V. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 132: 6-13Crossref Scopus (16651) Google Scholar) for 24 h at 42 °C. The membrane was washed twice for 30 min at room temperature with 2 × SSC containing 2% SDS and 15 min at 50 °C with 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. The blots were exposed for 2–4 days at −70 °C, and the relative amounts of mRNA transcripts were analyzed by laser densitometry using an Ultroscan XL enhanced laser densitometer and normalized relative to internal β-actin controls. Hypoxic conditions may be induced in cultures incubated with oxygen- and glucose-deprived medium preequilibrated with 95% N2 and 5% CO2. A special incubation device is used in which the gas mixture of 95% N2and 5% CO2 is saturated with water (36.Vemuri R. Yogev S. Heller M. Pinson A. In Vitro. 1985; 21: 521-525Google Scholar). Prior to subjecting the cells to hypoxia, the medium was replaced by fresh Ham's F-10 serum-free medium preequilibrated for 30 min with 95% N2 and 5% CO2 and incubated for 2–4 h in a special incubation device. Alternatively, after replacement of medium deficient in glucose and pyruvate, tissue culture plates were subjected to hypoxia in anaerobic jars (BBLGASPACK, Anerobic Systems, San Francisco) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and less than 0.2% oxygen for 12 h, as demonstrated by relevant catalyzer. Cell damage under hypoxic conditions was measured by LDH assay of the medium using a diagnostic kit according the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Total LDH activity was determined in culture medium plus LDH released from the cells after treatment with 0.5% Triton X-100. All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of triplicate samples. A full-length mouse thrombin receptor cDNA fragment of 2 kilobases cloned onto the EcoRI sites of pBluescript plasmid. GLUT-1 cDNA fragment of 1.9 kilobases in size was cloned from a rat brain cDNA library (kindly provided by E. Keshet, Dept. of Molecular Biology, Hebrew-University Medical School). As a housekeeping control gene we have used α-actin. cDNA fragments were labeled with 32P by randomly primed DNA synthesis (37.Feinberg V. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 132: 6-13Crossref Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). Cells were dissolved in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were transferred, and the protein content was measured. Lysates (50 μg) were loaded and resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, MA). Membranes were blocked and probed with anti-ThR antibodies (1:4,000) in 1% bovine serum albumin in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. After washes, blots were incubated with the appropriate second antibodies and conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent using luminol and p-cumaric acid (Sigma). Anti-Vav antibodies were raised in rabbits against a specific peptide of Vav, residues 528–541 (38.Katzav S. Cleavland J.L. Heslop H.E. Pulido D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY-20, Signal Transduction, Lexington KY). Ischemia was induced as described previously (39.Banai S. Shweiki D. Pinson A. Chandra M. Lazarovici G. Keshet E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Briefly, pigs (15–30 kg, of either sex) were anesthetized, and thoracotomy was performed. The pericardium was opened, and the left anterior descending coronary artery was carefully dissected. Using an arterial bulldog clamp the artery was occluded for 2 min followed by 20 min of reperfusion. The artery was then reoccluded for 3, 5, and 7 min, each occlusion being followed by 20 min of reperfusion. Thereafter, repeated occlusions of 10 min each were performed, each followed by a 20-min reperfusion, for a total period of 6 h. A 5-mm-thick slice was cut from the left ventricle distal to the coronary occlusion site, and the slice was divided into circumferential wedges. Each wedge was subdivided into an endocardial and epicardial segment. Tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and RNA was extracted and analyzed as described above. Primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were subjected to hypoxic conditions (0% oxygen, 20 torr), and the level of ThR transcripts was compared with the level of transcripts under normal oxygen conditions (21% oxygen). As shown in Fig.1, mRNA levels of ThR decreased markedly, in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A,lanes b–d), with complete disappearance after 4 h of hypoxia (Fig. 1 A, lane d compared with lane a). The effect observed is specific because, during this time frame, the total RNA level was not affected, as shown by the β-actin RNA (Fig. 1 A, lower section). The decrease in mRNA levels is reversible because cells that were subjected to 4 h of hypoxia (Fig. 1 B, lane b) and then reexposed to normal oxygen levels (i.e. 18 h at 21% oxygen) regained their normal ThR transcript levels (Fig.1 B, lane c compared with lane a). In an in vivo experiment, myocardial ischemia in pig hearts was induced by repeated 2–10-min left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, separated by 20 min of reperfusion (39.Banai S. Shweiki D. Pinson A. Chandra M. Lazarovici G. Keshet E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Slices of heart were retrieved after 6 h of intermittent ischemia, and RNA was isolated. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the levels of ThR mRNA were analyzed in either nonischemic myocardial tissue (Fig.1 C, lane a), partially ischemic tissue (lane b), or fully ischemic myocardium (lanes cand d). Complete disappearance of ThR was observed in the ischemic myocardium (lanes c and d) compared with normal levels in the nonischemic healthy myocardium (lane a). The specific reduced levels of ThR in the ischemic pig modelin vivo thus adequately confirm the data obtained for ThR mRNA under hypoxic conditions. Because thrombin is generated rapidly at sites of vascular injury or heart muscle ischemia, we have examined the effect of receptor activation on the ThR transcript levels under hypoxia. For this purpose, rat ventricular myocytes were subjected to serum-free conditions, and either the receptor internal ligand TRAP (thrombin receptor-activating peptide, Fig.2 A) or α-thrombin (5 × 10−8m, 48 h, data not shown) was added. When TRAP was added to the cells (at concentrations of either 1 μm or 20 μm) and then subjected to hypoxia, the ThR mRNA levels remained unaltered (Fig. 2 A,lanes g, h, and j), whereas the level of ThR mRNA disappeared completely under hypoxia (Fig.2 A, lanes b and c). TRAP, at these concentrations, did not affect the normal level of ThR mRNA (Fig.2 A, lanes f and i). When an irrelevant ligand (i.e. basic fibroblast growth factor, 100 ng) was added to the cells prior to subjecting them to hypoxia no effect was observed, regardless of whether they were maintained under normal (Fig.2 A, lane d) or hypoxic (Fig. 2 A,lane e) conditions. The effects on ThR mRNA levels were specific because no effect was observed on the total RNA level (as observed for 18 S, lower band in the figure). Furthermore, the addition of TRAP did not affect the stressed hypoxic condition, as observed by the released LDH, an enzyme normally present in granules of the endoplasmic reticulum and released upon hypoxic stress to the medium (Fig. 2 B). When measured in the medium under normal conditions, regardless of whether the cells were activated by TRAP (1 or 20 μm, Fig. 2 B, lanes b andc, respectively), no release of LDH was obtained (Fig.2 B, lanes a–c). Under hypoxic stress, however, significant amounts of LDH were released into the medium also in the presence of TRAP (1 or 20 μm, Fig. 2 B,lanes e and f, respectively). Similar data were obtained when α-thrombin was used to activate the cells (data not shown). It appeared that at least 48 h of activation by TRAP is required to obtain the full protection as shown in Fig. 2 C,lane e. Shorter periods of activation such as 6 h (lane c) or 12 h (lane d) were not sufficient to achieve normal ThR levels under hypoxia. The protection effect was not specific only to primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes but was also observed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts that were subjected to hypoxia following prior treatment of TRAP (Fig.3, lanes D and F, 1 μm and 20 μm, respectively). No induction of ThR mRNA was observed under normal conditions after the addition of TRAP (Fig. 3, lanes C and E, 1 μm and 20 μm, respectively) compared with the normal TR transcript level (Fig. 3, lane A) or hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3, lane B). Activation of ThR did not affect hypoxic conditions as also observed by the induced levels of GLUT-1 transcript, a glucose-regulated protein that has been characterized as a glucose transporter and which is known to be up-regulated under hypoxia (Fig. 3, lanes B, D, and F). The protection of ThR mRNA level is specific because no induction in a housekeeping control gene (α-actin) level was observed (Fig. 3, bottom panel).Figure 3Northern blot analysis of NIH3T3 fibroblasts under normal and hypoxic conditions. NIH 3T3 mRNA are shown under normal (lanes A, C, and E) and hypoxic (lanes B, D, and F) conditions. Cells were either activated by the addition of 1 μm TRAP (lanes C and D), 20 μm TRAP (lanes E and F), or were not treated (lanes A and B). The top panel shows levels. The blots were probed with32P-labeled full-length rat ThR cDNA. Middle panel, level of GLUT-1, a hypoxia-regulated gene, under normal (lanes A, C, and E) and hypoxic (lanes B, D, and F) conditions. TRAP activation was at 1 μm (for 48 h) (lanes C and D) or 20 μm (lanes E andF). The blots were probed with 32P-labeled GLUT-1 cDNA. Bottom panel, 32P-labeled α-actin for control housekeeping gene.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activation of ThR initiates a cell signaling cascade involving the G-protein system, PKC activation, and members of the tyrosine kinase family such as Src and mitogen-activated protein kinase downstream. The fact that activated receptors are protected suggests that initiation of cell signaling relays a message that ultimately leads to the protection of ThR from decaying under hypoxic conditions. We have therefore analyzed whether interruption of the signaling cascade will inhibit the protective effect. To do this, we have added calphostin C, a PKC inhibitor, during the activation of ThR with TRAP. Both calphostin C (1 nm and 100 nm) and TRAP added under normal conditions did not affect the ThR transcript level (Fig.4 A, lanes f andh). Neither did calphostin C (i.e. 100 nm) alone (Fig. 4 A, lane j). TRAP-activated ThR, however, no longer showed the protection obtained under hypoxia of the activated receptor in the presence of calphostin C (Fig. 4 A, lanes g and i). In the presence of calphostin C (Fig. 4 A, lanes g andi), however, TRAP-activated ThR no longer showed the protection of the activated receptor obtained under hypoxia. TRAP alone under hypoxia protects the levels of ThR (Fig. 4 A,lane e) compared with normal conditions (Fig. 4 A,lanes a and d) or hypoxic ones (Fig.4 A, lanes b and c). The interruption in the ThR-protected transcript levels in the presence of calphostin C was specific and did not result in changes in RNA levels (Fig.4 A, lower section). Likewise, the addition of calphostin C in the presence or absence of TRAP did not affect the stressed hypoxic conditions as was observed by released LDH activity (Fig. 4 B). Similar data were obtained by using two other PKC inhibitors: a bisindolylmaleimide GF109203X, a potent membrane-permeable and specific inhibitor; and the Go 6976 inhibitor (specific for Ca2+-dependent PKCα and PKCβI isozyme; Boehringer Mannheim) In the presence of GF109203X, a dose-dependent loss of ThR protection after receptor activation was obtained, whereas in the presence of Go 6976, a somewhat lesser extent of loss was obtained (data not shown). The concentration range of the GF109203X inhibitor used (25–100 nm) effectively inhibited the PKC-dependent phosphorylation (as previously shown by Albert and Ford (40.Albert C.J. Ford D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H642-H650PubMed Google Scholar)) of the substrate myelin basic peptide (EKRPSQRSKYL), determined by the colorimetric PKC assay (signal transduction) (data not shown). For this purpose, we have utilized NIH3T3 cells transfected with dominant ras or src oncogenes compared with NIH3T3 mock transfectants. It is important to point out that the myocyte system used by us refers to primary cultures, which are resistant to transformation. Therefore, it was impossible to transfect these cells stably with cDNAs for signaling molecules. To be able to follow the signal transduction processes after ThR activation, we had to use another cell line. When NIH3T3 fibroblasts were subjected to hypoxia, the same pattern of decaying levels in ThR mRNA after hypoxic stress was observed. Complete abolishment, however, was obtained after 8 h of hypoxia compared with 4 h of hypoxia in cardiac cells (data not shown). NIH3T3 overexpressing either src or ras oncogenes exhibit “on” signals in the cells, similar to exogenously TRAP-activated ThR. We have subjected these cells to hypoxia and analyzed the levels of ThR (Fig. 5, top panel) and GLUT-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 5) compared with the housekeeping gene α-actin levels (Fig. 5, bottom panel). As one can see, Fig. 5indicates that although in the mock transfectants ThR mRNA level was not protected under hypoxia (lane B), this is not the case in either Ras (lane D) or Src (lane F) transfected cells, which exhibit unaltered ThR mRNA compared with normal ThR transcript levels (lanes A, C, andE). Similarly, transfection of NIH3T3 cells with either Ras or Src did not affect the stressed hypoxic conditions as shown by the induced level of GLUT-1 (lanes B, D, andF, middle panel) indicative of the stressed conditions. The RNA levels remained unchanged under the various conditions (bottom panel, for α-actin levels, as a control housekeeping gene). Thus, we conclude that when the signaling cascade is “turned on” as part of the ThR relay signaling events, the level of ThR mRNA is protected under hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2144846858,"U4 small nuclear RNA is essential fortrans-splicing. Here we report the cloning of U4 snRNA gene from Leptomonas collosoma and analysis of elements controlling its expression. The trypanosome U4 RNA is the smallest known, it carries an Sm-like site, and has the potential for extensive intermolecular base pairing with the U6 RNA. Sequence analysis of the U4 locus indicates the presence of a tRNA-like element 86 base pairs upstream of the gene that is divergently transcribed to yield a stable small tRNA-like RNA. Two additional tRNA genes, tRNAPro and tRNAGly, were found upstream of this element. By stable expression of a tagged U4 RNA, we demonstrate that the tRNA-like gene, but not the upstream tRNA genes, is essential for U4 expression and that the B box but not the A Box of the tRNA-like gene is crucial for expression in vivo. Mapping the 2′-O-methyl groups on U4 and U6 small nuclear RNAs suggests the presence of modifications in canonical positions. However, the number of modified nucleotides is fewer than in mammalian homologues. The U4 genomic organization including both tRNA-like and tRNA genes may represent a relic whereby trypanosomatids “hired” tRNA genes to provide extragenic promoter elements. The close proximity of tRNA genes to the tRNA-like molecule in the U4 locus further suggests that the tRNA-like gene may have evolved from a tRNA member of this cluster.

In this process a common short spliced leader (SL)1 derived from a small RNA, the SL RNA, is added to each mRNA.trans-splicing is mechanistically related tocis-splicing (1.Agabian N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1157-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). As in cis-splicing, U snRNAs are required. Trypanosome counterparts to U2, U4, and U6 have been characterized and shown to function in trans-splicing (2.Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3.Tschudi C. Ullu E. Cell. 1990; 61: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Trypanosome snRNAs are generally smaller than their cis-splicing counterparts. Only recently was the trypanosome U5 homologue identified and its gene cloned and sequenced (4.Dungan J.D. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4016-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5.Xu Y.-X. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Evidence supports the presence of a trypanosome tri-snRNP complex carrying the U4/U6·U5 snRNAs (5.Xu Y.-X. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the trypanosome U5 snRNA may have a unique role intrans-splicing based on its potential to interact with the SL RNA intron region by base pairing, as supported by in vivo cross-linking experiments (4.Dungan J.D. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4016-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and phylogenetic conservation (5.Xu Y.-X. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The majority of trypanosome snRNAs carry a divergent Sm site. The Sm site was shown in other eukaryotes to bind core proteins that are common to all snRNPs and are recognized by sera from autoimmunue patients (6.Lerner E.A. Lerner M.R. Janeway C.A.J. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2737-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The trypanosome snRNPs are the only ones so far that are not recognized by anti-Sm sera that recognize Sm proteins from yeast to man. Surprisingly, however, trypanosomes do possess Sm proteins, because recently an SmE homologue was identified among the core proteins that bind the SL RNA (7.Goncharov I. Palfi Z. Bindereif A. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12217-12221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In mammals and yeast, U snRNA genes, except U6, are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (8.Hernandez N. McKnight S. Yamamoto K.R. Transcription Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Labaratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 281-313Google Scholar). The promoters of these genes include distal and proximal elements and TATA boxes. In trypanosomes, in contrast, all small RNAs including U2, U3, U6, and 7SL RNA are transcribed by polymerase III (9.Nakaar V. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 11: 225-228Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the last three cases, A and B box elements located upstream of the gene were shown to be essential for transcription in vivo. These control elements are part of the internal control regions of divergently oriented tRNA genes or in the case of the U2 snRNA, of a tRNA-like gene (10.Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To study further the assembly of trypanosome U snRNAs in vivo, we have cloned and sequenced the U4 gene from the monogenetic trypanosomatid Leptomonas collosoma. This completes the set of spliceosomal RNAs from this trypanosomatid species. The U4 gene locus represents a new mode of genomic organization, harboring both tRNA-like and tRNA genes upstream of the coding region. Like U2 snRNA, but unlike U6 snRNA, the B box sequence of the tRNA-like molecule plays a major role in the expression of the gene.

L. collosoma DNA (10 μg) was digested to completion withSau3AI, and the digest was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel. Fragments between 0.5 and 1.2 kilobases were excised and electroeluted. The eluted DNA was extracted with phenolchloroform and precipitated in ethanol. The concentrated DNA (0.25 μg) was ligated in 500 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 10 mg/ml gelatin, and 1 unit/ml ligase (New England Biolabs) at a DNA concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. The ligation mixture was further extracted with phenolchloroform, precipitated in ethanol, and used as inverse PCR template. The PCR was performed with the primers, 424 and 425, at 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles. The PCR product (600 bp) was gel-purified and then cloned in pCRTMII cloning vector (Invitrogen). The clone termed as U4–1 was sequenced by SP6 and T7 primers and was found containing the U4 coding region and only 157 bp upstream sequence. To obtain the full sequence of the upstream regulatory region, a λEMBL3 library was screened with an RNA probe synthesized with T7 polymerase (Promega) using the U4–1 plasmid as a template. Three positive plaques were obtained and digested withAluI. A fragment of 1.2 kilobase was cloned into pBluescript and sequenced with T3, T7, and the internal primer 25001. Tagging of the U4 gene and site-directed mutagenesis were generated by PCR using primers carrying the mutation and oligonucleotides from the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene (indicated above). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The mutated genes were cloned to the pX vector (11.Goldring A. Zimmer Y. Ben-Yehuda E. Goncharov I. Michaeli S. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 84: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). L. collosoma cells were transformed with the constructs, and cell lines were selected in the presence of G418 as described previously (11.Goldring A. Zimmer Y. Ben-Yehuda E. Goncharov I. Michaeli S. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 84: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RNA samples were fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide-7 m urea gel and electroblotted onto a Nytran membrane (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization with labeled oligonucleotides was performed at 42 °C in 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Primer extension was performed using end-labeled oligonucleotide (100,000 cpm/pmol). Reactions were performed as described previously (12.Patzelt E. Perry K.L. Agabian N. Mol. Cell.

Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). By inverse PCR using primers derived from the Trypanosoma brucei U4 snRNA sequence (2.Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a Sau3AI 600-bp genomic fragment was cloned and sequenced. An RNA probe synthesized from this clone was used to screen a genomic library. A 1.2-kilobaseAluI fragment carrying the gene was subcloned and sequenced. The sequence contains the U4 coding region 432 bp upstream and 253 bp downstream of sequences (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis indicated the presence of two tRNA genes, tRNAPro and tRNAGly, located at positions −223 and −372, respectively. The tRNAPro is 90% identical to the tRNAPro of humans, mice, and Caenorhabditis elegans. Positions 4–53 of tRNAGly are identical to the tRNAGly of humans, C. elegans, and mice. The tRNAPro is transcribed in the same direction as the U4 gene, whereas the tRNAGly is divergently transcribed. The A boxes of tRNAPro and tRNAGly (5′-TAGTCTAGTGG-3′ and 5′-TGGTCTAGTGG-3′, respectively) conform to the consensus box A sequence 5′-TRRYNNAGTGG-3′ (the most conserved positions are underlined). The B boxes of these tRNAs (5′-GTTCAATTCC-3′ and 5′-GTTCGATTCC-3′, respectively) are consistent with the box B consensus 5′-GTTCRANNCC-3′. Both tRNAs can fold into the canonical tRNA cloverleaf structure. The genomic arrangement of the L. collosoma U4 locus does not resemble the loci of T. brucei U3 (15.Mottram J.C. Bell S.D. Nelson R.G. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18313-18317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), L. collosoma U5 (5.Xu Y.-X. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and L. collosoma U6 (11.Goldring A. Zimmer Y. Ben-Yehuda E. Goncharov I. Michaeli S. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 84: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16.Nakaar V. Dare A.O. Hong D. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6736-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17.Xu G.-L. Wieland B. Bindereif A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4565-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); each of which has a divergently transcribed tRNA gene located 95–98 bp upstream of the U snRNA sequences (Fig.2). We therefore examined a tRNA-like element upstream of the U4 gene, analogous to that described for U2 snRNA (10.Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Indeed, bona fide A and B boxes were found (5′-TCGCGGAGTGGG-3′ and 5′-GGTTCGATCCC-3′, respectively), both of which agree with the consensus sequences (underlined). In comparing the consensus sequences with the corresponding boxes in the U2 locus (10.Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the A box of U2 is located at position −104 whereas the U4 A box is located at position −107. The U2 A box sequence (5′-TGGCCCGGGTGT-3′) deviates more from the consensus sequence than the U4 A box. The U4 box A contains all the highly conserved positions (underlined), whereas the U2 A box contains two deviations at positions 8 and 12 with G and T instead of A and G. The B box in the U2 locus (5′-GGTTCGAGCCT-3′) is located at position −155 and that of U4 is located at position −153; both the U2 and U4 B boxes agree well with the consensus. Thus, the tRNA-like boxes of U2 and U4 are positioned similarly with respect to the snRNA coding regions. The U4 gene organization is unique when compared with other U snRNAs (Fig. 2), because it not only contains a tRNA-like element like theT. brucei U2 locus, but also carries two additional upstream tRNA genes, similar to U3, 7SL RNA, U6, and U5 snRNA gene loci. However, the companion tRNA located 95–98 bp upstream of the snRNAs is always divergently transcribed, whereas the tRNA gene adjacent to the tRNA-like sequence is transcribed from the same strand as the U4 gene. The presence of tRNA-like and tRNA sequences suggests that the former may have originated from a bona fide tRNA gene that had accumulated major changes and lost its identity. This tRNA may have been part of a tRNA cluster because most tRNA genes in trypanosomatids are clustered. In the case of 7SL, U5, U6, and U3, the identity of tRNA gene was kept, whereas in the case of U2 and U4, tRNA gene mutations accumulated but the identity of the A and B boxes was preserved including their proper spacing (Fig. 3 A). Because the tRNAs upstream of small RNA genes are transcribed (16.Nakaar V. Dare A.O. Hong D. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6736-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18.Goldring A. Michaeli S. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), it was of interest to examine whether the tRNA-like gene is also transcribed. Primer extension analysis was performed using an oligonucleotide (26264), and a discrete extension product was obtained, suggesting the presence of tRNA-like RNA transcript (Fig.3 B). Comparison of the tRNA-like structure to the tRNAPro secondary structure is presented in Fig.3 A. Deviations of the tRNA-like structure from the canonical are mainly in the D stem and TψC stem-loops. The acceptor stem is extended at the 5′-end and the anti-codon loop is composed of 5 instead of 7 nt. However, the RNA can still be folded into the cloverleaf structure, and the A and B boxes are located in their conserved positions. To examine the genomic organization of the U4 gene, L. collosoma DNA was subjected to Southern blot analysis. A single hybridization band was observed after digesting the DNA using restriction enzymes with 4-bp and 6-bp recognition sites, suggesting that the U4 gene, like all other U snRNA genes in trypanosomatids (2.Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), is a single copy gene (Fig.4 A). Northern blot analysis indicates a single transcript of 114 nt (Fig. 4 B). The U4 coding sequence is highly conserved among trypanosomatid species: 87% identity with T. brucei (2.Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and 89% with Leishmania ternatolae (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank Accession no. X97621) U4 RNA (Fig. 5). The RNA is shorter (114 nt) compared with metazoans (142–145 nt) (20.Krol A. Branlant C. Lazar E. Gallinaro H. Jacob M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2699-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), higher plants (150–154 nt) (21.Myslinski E. Branlant C. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and budding yeast (160 nt) (22.Siliciano P.G. Brow D.A. Roiha H. Guthrie C. Cell. 1987; 50: 585-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The predicted secondary structure of U4 snRNA contains four stem-loop structures (I-IV) similar to higher eukaryotic U4 snRNAs. Unlike other unicellular organisms such as Physarum polycephalum,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the trypanosomatid U4 snRNAs possess a full stem-loop (IV) at the 3′-end (Fig. 5) (21.Myslinski E. Branlant C. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The U4 secondary structure is conserved among the three trypanosomatids. High sequence conservation exists in the 5′-region (Fig. 5), whereas variability occurs in the loops and the single-stranded region between stem-loops II and III. The potential for base pair interactions between L. collosoma U4 and U6 is presented in Fig.6. The first interacting domain (Stem II) is composed of 17 perfect base pairs as in T. brucei (2.Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This stem is more stable than in yeast, where 11 perfect base pairs are disrupted by a bulged C and followed by a perfect 5 base-paired duplex (23.Brow D.A. Guthrie C. Nature. 1988; 334: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Stem I is composed of a 9-bp duplex disrupted by two bulged nt in both L. collosoma and T. brucei. The position of the bulged A in U4 snRNA is conserved in both trypanosomatid species, whereas the position of the bulged nt in the U6 duplex is different (the bulged A in T. brucei is located between positions 4 and 5 of the duplex, whereas the bulged U in L. collosoma is located between positions 6 and 7, Fig. 6). In yeast, stem I is composed of 8 perfect base-paired nt (23.Brow D.A. Guthrie C. Nature. 1988; 334: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the single sequence difference (U at position 57) between T. brucei andL. collosoma U4 RNAs is compensated for by the A at position 51, which is bulged in the T. brucei U4-U6 duplex. The majority of changes between the trypanosomatid U4 RNAs are in the central domain and central loop (Fig. 6). The central domain and 3′-stem-loop in the yeast U4 RNA is quite tolerant to mutation (24.Hu J. Xu D. Schappert K. Xu Y. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1274-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, when the T. brucei stem-loop structure, which is homologous to the 3′-stem-loop of the yeast RNA was used to replace this homologous domain in yeast, the chimeric RNA could not complement a null allele of the yeast U4 snRNA (25.Bordonne R. Banroques J. Abelson J. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This chimeric U4 RNA did not associate well with the U6 snRNA, suggesting that in addition to base pair interactions in stem I and II, other interactions are required to promote U4/U6 complex formation. It was found that only a single mutation in the 3′-stem-loop in yeast resulted in a cold-sensitive phenotype (24.Hu J. Xu D. Schappert K. Xu Y. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1274-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the overall structure of the 3′-stem-loop, rather than its particular sequence, may be important for the U4 function. A third potential for base pair interactions between U4 and U6 exists in the Sm-like site of U4 positions 90–95 (Fig. 6), similar to a more stable potential interaction for the T. brucei U4 snRNA at positions 86–91 (also in the Sm-like site) (2.Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The significance of this potential is currently unknown. Recently, a phylogentically conserved stem structure (Stem III) was discovered, which has a counterpart in the highly diverged U4atac and U6atac snRNAs (26.Jakab G. Mougin A. Kis M. Pollak T. Antal M. Branlant C. Solymosy F. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). InT. brucei this domain involves nt 22–27 of U6 and 86–91 of U4 snRNA; the L. collosoma duplex would be formed by nt 90–95 of the U4 and 24–30 of the U6. It was suggested that at a particular stage of splicing stem III could sequester a specific stretch of the U6 before it base pairs with U2. The potential for interaction between the U6 and U2 (helix III) also exists for the trypanosome snRNAs (27.Hartshorne T. Agabian N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2121-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the U6 sequence block involved in the formation of the stem III between U6 and U4 is also involved in the formation of the helix III between U6 and U2. So far no genetic evidence exists to support these phylogentically conserved stem III interactions. The central domain is the most variable region in the U4 molecule. Indeed, deletion of almost the entire region in yeast yielded only a mild cold-sensitive phenotype (24.Hu J. Xu D. Schappert K. Xu Y. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1274-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the sequence of this domain may not be important except to serve as spacer that separates the 5′- and 3′-domains of the U4 RNA. It has long been debated whether trypanosome snRNAs carry a bona fide Sm binding site. The L. collosoma U4 Sm-like site (positions 87–93) deviates from the canonical sequence, because the U stretch is disrupted by an A. Many trypanosomatid SL and snRNA Sm-like sites deviate from the canonical consensus. In L. collosoma U2 snRNA, the U stretch is disrupted by a C (27.Hartshorne T. Agabian N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2121-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas the U6 Sm site is very divergent with only a single U (18.Goldring A. Michaeli S. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The only two RNAs that carry canonical Sm sites are the SL RNA (28.Goldring A. Karchi M. Michaeli S. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 80: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the U5 snRNA (5.Xu Y.-X. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, this property is not shared with other trypanosomatids, for instance the T. brucei SL RNA and U5 Sm sites (4.Dungan J.D. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4016-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29.Milhausen M. Nelson R.G. Sather S. Selkirk M. Agabian N. Cell. 1984; 38: 721-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30.Campbell D.A. Thornton D.A. Boothroyd J.C. Nature. 1984; 311: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). By compiling all the Sm-like sites a consensus trypanosome Sm site can be derived: AAAN4G (where in 71% cases N is a U). Based on the strong deviation of these sites from the consensus Sm-like sequence and the finding that trypanosome proteins are not recognized by anti-Sm sera, it was proposed that trypanosome core proteins and their corresponding binding site may differ significantly from those in mammals. Affinity selection using antisense biotinylated oligonucleotides to T. brucei snRNP and SL RNP RNAs suggests that core proteins are shared among all these particles (31.Palfi Z. Günzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, antibodies raised against these proteins immunoprecipitate all the spliceosomal RNAs including U6 and SL RNA (32.Palfi Z. Bindereif A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 262: 20159-20163Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The recent finding of an SmE homologue in trypanosomes, which carries both Sm motifs 1 and 2, suggests that Sm proteins do exist in trypanosomes (7.Goncharov I. Palfi Z. Bindereif A. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12217-12221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Yet, the lack of recognition of these proteins by anti-Sm sera is intriguing. Changes in both the Sm-like site and the core proteins may have co-evolved. These deviations may stem from the need of these snRNAs to interact with different capping enzymes, because SL RNA has a unique cap structure and U5 unlike U2 and U4 does not possess a trimethylguanosine cap (5.Xu Y.-X. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas the U6 most probably possesses an inverted cap, like in all other eukaryotes (2.Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Lührmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To investigate the elements that control expression of the U4 gene, the coding region was tagged in the internal loop III by inserting 6 bp between position 82 and 83 (Figs. 5 and7). The marked gene carrying 210 bp of upstream sequence carrying the tRNA-like coding region and 91 bp of downstream sequence was cloned into the pX expression vector (Fig.7 A). RNA prepared from transfected cell lines was analyzed by primer extension using oligonucleotide (25000) complementary to the 3′-end of the U4 snRNA. The results indicate that the tagged gene was expressed efficiently (Fig. 7 B, lane 2), suggesting that the tRNA-like element, but not the tRNAProand tRNAGly, is important for the U4 expression. To further explore elements essential for the expression, we mutated the A and B boxes separately and established cell lines. Analysis of U4 expression (Fig. 7 B) demonstrated that mutation of the A box had no effect, whereas mutation of the B box completely inactivated the gene. To control for gene dosage (plasmid copy number), the level of theneo mRNA encoded by the pX vector was examined by primer extension and found to be almost identical in all cell lines (Fig.7 B, bottom). This pattern of dependence on the tRNA-like extragenic A and B box elements is identical to that obtained for the U2 gene, except that mutation in the T. brucei box A also had a slight effect on expression (10.Fantoni A. Dare A.O. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2021-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The T. bruceiU2 B box was identified as a binding site for a nuclear protein (33.Tschudi C. Williams S. Ullu E. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein might be involved in chromatin organization. Indeed, a B box located downstream to the yeast U6 coding region was shown to affect chromatin organization (34.Eschenlauer J.B. Kaiser M.W. Gerlach V.L. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3015-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). An important characteristic of U snRNAs is their specific modification in regions highly conserved in evolution. In the vertebrate U4 and U6, modifications are clustered in the 5′-terminal region of U4 and the central region of U6 (35.Massenet S. Mougin A. Branlant C. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washinton, D. C.1998: 201-227Google Scholar). Modifications are less numerous in yeast (36.Gu J. Patton J.R. Shimba S. Reddy R. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 909-918PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the modifications of snRNAs from trypanosomes, which diverged much earlier than yeast from the eukaryotic lineage. The position of the 2′-O-methyl groups was determined by primer extension in the presence of low dNTP concentration (14.Maden B.E.H. Corbett M.E. Heeney P.A. Pugh K. Ajuh P.M. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), which causes the reverse transcriptase to pause one nt before the methylated site (13.Lowe T.M. Eddy S.R. Science. 1999; 283: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The presence of specific stops in low (0.02 mm) but not high (5 mm) dNTP concentrations (Fig. 8) suggests 2′-O-methylation at positions A63 and A72 of U4. The A63 position is conserved in vertebrates and is the nearest nt to the potential stem I of the U4/U6 duplex. A72 is in the vicinity of U4/U6 stem III (see Fig. 6), but this position is not modified in verterbrates (35.Massenet S. Mougin A. Branlant C. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washinton, D. C.1998: 201-227Google Scholar). In U6 snRNA 2′-O-methyls can be assigned to positions G42, G47, U50, C53, and U56, located in stem I and stem II of the U4/U6 duplex (Figs. 6 and 8). The modified nt of trypanosome U6 RNA agree well with their positions in vertebrate U6 (35.Massenet S. Mougin A. Branlant C. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. ASM Press, Washinton, D. C.1998: 201-227Google Scholar), where they appear in regions involved in intramolecular base pairing and are expected to be at or near the spliceosome catalytic center. Interestingly, U5 is modified (Fig. 8) in position A19 of the invariant loop, which is the one position that deviates from the canonical U5 invariant loop sequence (5.Xu Y.-X. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have suggested that this position interacts with the SL RNA +2 position by base pairing (4.Dungan J.D. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4016-4029Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5.Xu Y.-X. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Another U5 modification appears in position A28, which seems to be specific to trypanosome, because no modified nt were found in other eukaryotes downstream of the invariant loop. Recent study has shown that 2′-O-methylation of vertebrate U6 snRNA is guided by box C+D snoRNAs (37.Tycowski K.T. You Z.H. Graham P.J. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), suggesting that modification may take place in nucleolar or coiled bodies that have a close relationship with the nucleoli. Indeed the modification of U6 position U47 was shown to be guided by a guide RNA that also guides the methylation of 28 S rRNA. So far, no snoRNAs that have potential to guide modification of trypanosome U4 or U6 snRNAs have been discovered, although a guide that directs modification of 5.8 S rRNA has been described (19.Levitan A. Xu Y.-X. Ben-Dov C. Ben-Shlomo H. Zhang Y. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We thank Joan A. Steitz for her interest in the study and critical comments on the manuscript. We acknowledge Maile Ray for performing inverse PCR to initially identify and characterize the L. collosoma U4 snRNA gene and Albrecht Bindereif for communicating unpublished results."
https://openalex.org/W2410326943,"W e humans sense old age through feeling those creaky joints or observing those graying hairs but, according to Apfeld and Kenyon reporting in a recent issue of Nature ([1][1]), the nematode worm senses its age by smelling and tasting the environment. These investigators show that worms with defective olfactory organs (that would normally detect odor molecules in the environment) live longer than their comrades with a keener sense of smell. By comparing these worms with other mutant nematodes that live an unusually long time, the researchers found clues to how a reduced ability to “smell the roses” might lengthen life-span.

The worm's olfactory sense organs—amphids on the head and phasmids on the tail—are composed of a cluster of nerve cells, the ends of which are modified into cilia. The cilia are encircled by a sheath and a socket cell that form a pore in the worm's skin through which the tips of the cilia protrude (see photograph). Odor molecules and soluble compounds bind to G protein-coupled receptors (similar to the olfactory and taste receptors of mammals) located at the tip of each cilium. Worms with a poor sense of smell—because their olfactory organs have defective or absent cilia, blocked pores, or damaged sheaths—live much longer, yet are otherwise normal (for example, their feeding and reproductive behaviors are unchanged). Mutations in TAX-4—a channel regulated by cyclic GMP that sits under the G protein-coupled receptor and transduces the sensory signals into electrical impulses—also imbue the worm with a longer life.

But mutations in the worm's olfactory machinery are not the only defects that extend its life-span. In an earlier study, Kenyon's group found that defects in the reproductive system could prolong life by decreasing the activity of DAF-2 (a receptor for an insulin-like molecule) and increasing the activity of DAF-16 (a transcription factor). By looking at worms defective in both sensory perception and reproduction, Apfeld and Kenyon worked out a putative pathway through which smell might influence a worm's longevity.

An environmental signal, perhaps produced by bacteria (the worm's favorite food), binds to G protein-coupled olfactory receptors on sensory cilia activating TAX-4, which then incites electrical activity in the sensory neurons. This activity triggers secretory vesicles in the neurons to release insulin-like molecules, which bind to DAF-2 and activate the insulin-like signaling pathway. This then switches on genes that will ensure the worm dies at the usual age (2 weeks). A reduced ability to sense olfactory cues would result in a decrease in DAF-2 activation and an increase in life-span.

This chain of events is not proven, but insulin-like molecules that might bind to DAF-2 have been identified in the nematode. Such a pathway would also make physiological sense. After all, if food is scarce it may behoove the worm to live longer to ensure that it has the chance to produce its full quota of offspring. A scarcity of food also promotes longevity in rodents and primates (and perhaps people). But so far it seems that in these more complicated creatures a poor sense of smell is not a harbinger of a ripe old age.

https://openalex.org/W2013381801,"Previous studies revealed that human fat cell plasma membranes contain a multireceptor-linked H2O2-generating system that is under antagonistic control by hormones and cytokines and is stimulated by insulin via Gαi2. In this report, it is shown that the inhibitory action of the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol is mediated by G protein βγ-subunits, based on observations that its action was specifically reversed by anti-Gβ antibodies or a C-terminal β-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 fragment containing the Gβγ-binding site of the enzyme, and was mimicked by exogenously supplied G protein βγ-subunits. Isoproterenol signals through a prototypical Gs-coupled receptor. Consistent with these results, direct activation of Gs by cholera toxin or by an anti-Gαs antibody exhibiting β-adrenergic receptor-mimetic properties (K-20) resulted in an isoproterenol-like inhibition of NADPH-dependent H2O2generation. In addition, a peptide corresponding to the target sequence of K-20 blocked the action of the catecholamine, apparently by competition between the peptide and Gs for activated β-adrenergic receptors, indicating that the G protein βγ-subunits mediating the inhibitory effects of the catecholamine were in fact derived from Gs.

Ligand-induced changes in cellular redox status modulate tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent pathways of signal transduction; alter DNA binding and transactivation activities of many transcriptional activators; and may influence key steps in the synthesis, degradation, and action of cAMP and cGMP as well (2.Suzuki G.H.

Previous work showed that human fat cells possess a plasma membrane-bound H2O2-generating system that is under antagonistic control by a large and diverse group of hormones and cytokines, including insulin, the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, and different isoforms of fibroblast and platelet-derived growth factors (4.Krieger-Brauer H.I.

The mechanisms by which hormones and cytokines regulated NADPH-dependent H2O2generation were confined to the plasma membrane, operated in the absence of ATP, and were independent of soluble second messengers, indicating that established pathways of signal transduction were not involved. These findings placed human fat cell oxidase in a position comparable with adenylyl cyclase and suggested a physical interaction between receptors and NADPH oxidase or receptor-effector coupling via signal-transducing protein(s). Indeed, recent work revealed that the stimulatory effect of insulin on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation is transduced via Gαi2 (7.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10135-10143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated whether the effects of the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol are also mediated by heterotrimeric G protein(s). Using specific antibodies against the α- and β-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins and a peptide that specifically binds Gβγ, it is shown that the inhibitory effects of isoproterenol on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation are mediated by βγ-subunits. Taking advantage of the unique properties of a commercially available antibody directed against residues 100–119 within the α-helical domain of Gαs (K-20) and of the peptide corresponding to its target sequence, which are summarized in a recent publication (8.Krieger-Brauer H.I.

Briefly, adipose tissue was from nondiabetic subjects undergoing elective abdominal or cosmetic breast surgery. The specimens were cut into small pieces, and fat cells were isolated by the method of Rodbell (11.Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a HEPES-buffered Krebs-Henseleit solution, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm HEPES, 10 mmNaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, 20 g/liter albumin, and 1 mg/ml collagenase (CLS, Worthington). After 30 min, fat cells were washed and resuspended in 10 volumes of an ice-cold lysing medium containing 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmKCl, and 100 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cell lysis was completed by mechanical shaking, and fat cell ghosts were collected by low speed centrifugation (1000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min) and washed with lysing medium. These crude fat cell plasma membranes (fat cell ghosts) contained <10% of total cellular NADPH:cytochrome P430 reductase and <2% of NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (4.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A two-step procedure was used, as reported elsewhere (4.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 5.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6.Krieger-Brauer H.I.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10135-10143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Plasma membranes from untreated or insulin-treated cells were first exposed to hormones and growth factors and were then assayed for NADPH oxidase activity. The activation step was carried out in 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 120 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaHCO3, and 0.1% human albumin. Membranes were first incubated with various concentrations of hormones and growth factors for 5 min to allow receptor occupation. Thereafter, guanine nucleotides were added. After 20 min, ghosts were collected by centrifugation; washed; and then resuspended in 30 mm MES, pH 5.8, containing 120 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmNaN3, 250 μm NADPH, and 10 μmFAD for determination of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation. Reactions were stopped with 0.1 n HCl. H2O2 was assayed using oxidation of luminol in the presence of peroxidase as the indicator reaction (5.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of anti-G protein antibodies and peptides corresponding to their target sequences on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation, membranes were exposed to both types of agents at 0 °C for 45 min, as indicated in the figure and table legends, and were then subjected to the two-step procedure described above. For cholera toxin labeling, membranes (200 μg) were preincubated for 45 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of 30 mmMOPS, pH 7.5, containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm thymidine, 10 mm arginine, 10 μm GTPγS, 10 μm NAD or 10 μm [32P]NAD (12.5 μCi/assay), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and various concentrations of cholera toxin subunit A, as indicated (7.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10135-10143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity of human fat cell plasma membranes was determined in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 10 μm GTP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg of creatine kinase, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 100 μl (12.Katada T. Amano T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3739-3746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by addition of 3–5 μg of membrane protein and were continued for 15 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of isoproterenol, as indicated. Reactions were terminated by 100 μl of ice-cold perchloric acid (5%). cAMP was determined by radioimmunoassay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after neutralization. To assess the effect of anti-Gαs C terminus antibody or a peptide corresponding to its antigenic site on adenylyl cyclase activity, membranes were pretreated with the antibody (RM/1) or peptide as described above. Previous work has shown that isoproterenol causes an inhibition of NADPH-dependent H2O2generation in human fat cell plasma membranes that can be overcome by the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, indicating that it is mediated by a β-adrenergic receptor (5.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Initial studies suggested that the regulatory effects of hormones and cytokines on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation may be critically dependent on supraphysiological concentrations of manganese (4.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 5.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, as pointed out previously (7.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10135-10143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), divalent cations such as Mn2+ may obscure an involvement of G proteins in receptor signaling. Indeed, manganese, which is active at millimolar concentrations, can be replaced by micromolar concentrations of GTPγS. Fig. 1 illustrates the mutual interrelationship of the effects of isoproterenol and GTPγS. In the absence of exogenously supplied GTPγS, isoproterenol caused a small decrease in NADPH-dependent H2O2production of ∼3 nmol × (mg protein × min)−1, which probably reflected the presence of trace amounts of endogenous GTP (data not shown). The synergistic effect of GTPγS became apparent at ∼0.3 μm and was half-maximal at 3 μm (Fig. 1 A). At a maximal concentration of GTPγS (50 μm), insulin-stimulated rates of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation were suppressed by two-thirds in the presence of 1 μmisoproterenol. Fig. 1 B shows a concentration-response curve for isoproterenol in the presence of a maximal concentration of GTPγS (50 μm). The isoproterenol-induced inhibition of insulin-stimulated H2O2 generation was half-maximal at ∼0.3 μm and maximal at ∼2 μm. Thus, it appeared that the inhibitory effects of isoproterenol on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation may be transduced by a G protein. The inhibitory action of isoproterenol was dose-dependently reversed by an antibody directed against an internal sequence of β1/β2-subunits that had no influence on basal or insulin-stimulated rates of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation (Fig. 2 A). Maximal effects were observed at an antibody dilution of 1:100 in the presence of 10 μm isoproterenol. The inhibitory effects of isoproterenol could also be reversed by βARK1-CT (10.Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a β-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 fragment that includes the Gβγ-binding region of this kinase (Fig.2 B). At a concentration of 10 μm, the peptide reversed the inhibition seen in the presence of 0.5 μmisoproterenol completely, whereas the GST protein alone had no effect. Consistent with the results summarized above, addition of Gβγ purified from bovine brain caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of insulin-stimulated NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation that was maximal at 200 nm Gβγ (Fig.3 A). Addition of 300 nm GDP-liganded α-subunits from bovine brain or recombinant Gαs resulted in complete reversal of the inhibition induced by Gβγ (Fig. 3 B). Boiled Gβγ (200 nm) had no effect on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation. Thus, three independent lines of evidence indicated that the inhibitory effects of isoproterenol on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation were transmitted by βγ-subunits. Mammalian β-adrenergic receptors are prototypical examples of G protein-coupled receptors that are highly selective for Gs, the G protein stimulatory with respect to adenylyl cyclase (13.Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting that the βγ-subunits mediating the inhibitory effects of isoproterenol on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation might have been derived from Gs. Antibodies directed against the C termini of Gα subunits and peptides corresponding to their target sequences are thought to block receptor-G protein recognition and activation and are therefore widely used in functional studies for assessing receptor-G protein coupling (14.Stehno-Bittel L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23458-23463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Anti-Gαs C terminus antibody and the peptide corresponding to its antigenic site were highly efficient in suppressing the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol on adenylyl cyclase, which is transduced through Gαs (8.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Hebling U. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28308-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, we previously showed that both compounds failed to reverse the suppression of NADPH-dependent H2O2generation seen in the presence of isoproterenol over the whole range of concentrations tested (8.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Hebling U. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28308-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One possibility to explain this unexpected finding would be that activation of Gs may not yield enough, or inappropriately composed, βγ-subunits to inhibit NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation, as has been proposed for the regulation of type II adenylyl cyclase (18.Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19.Bayewitch M.L. Avidor-Reiss T. Levy R. Pfeuffer T. Nevo I. Simonds W.F. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2273-2276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The latter contention implies that isoproterenol may be able to activate multiple G proteins, which seems in fact to be the case under certain conditions (20.Daaka Y. Lutrell M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). However, as pointed out elsewhere (8.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Hebling U. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28308-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the effects of anti-Gα C terminus antibodies on Gβγ-mediated responses are variable and may depend on receptors, G proteins, and cell types studied (14.Stehno-Bittel L. Krapivinsky P. Krapivinsky L. Perez-Terzic C. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30068-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15.Macrez N. Morel J.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23458-23463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, the lack of effects of anti-Gαs antibody (and of the peptide corresponding to its target sequence) does not necessarily indicate that the βγ-subunits transmitting the inhibitory effect of isoproterenol were derived from G proteins other than Gs. Considering the variability in antibody action, the effects of cholera toxin, which directly activates Gs (21.Vaughan M. Moss J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1978; 8: 473-474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were explored next. Indeed, a direct activation of Gs by cholera toxin resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation. At the concentration employed in previous studies (50 μg/ml), the bacterial toxin caused a rightward shift of the dose-response curve for insulin by 2 orders of magnitude, but did not suppress the maximal response seen at 10 nm insulin (data not shown). At higher concentrations, the toxin also inhibited the response seen in the presence of 10 nm insulin (Fig.4 A). The latter effect was dose-dependent and was paralleled by a corresponding increase in Gs labeling (Fig. 4 B). At the highest toxin concentration used (200 μg/ml), insulin-stimulated H2O2 production was suppressed by approximately two-thirds, suggesting that trimeric Gs contained enough appropriately composed G protein βγ-subunits to transduce a pronounced inhibition of human fat cell oxidase. To provide definitive proof that the isoproterenol-induced inhibition of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation was mediated by functionally specific Gβγ derived from Gs, we used a novel approach circumventing the shortcomings of anti-Gα C terminus antibodies. As shown recently (8.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Hebling U. Kather H. J. Biol.

This receptor-mimetic antibody was as efficacious as isoproterenol in suppressing NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation, indicating that Gscan in fact provide sufficient amounts of appropriately composed βγ-subunits to account for the inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity seen in the presence of isoproterenol (8.Krieger-Brauer H.I.

More important, a peptide corresponding to the target sequence of K-20 effectively antagonized the β-adrenergic inhibition of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation, apparently through competition between the peptide and Gs for binding to activated β-adrenergic receptors (8.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Hebling U. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28308-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). At a concentration of 2.5 μm, the peptide reduced the inhibitory action of a maximally effective concentration of isoproterenol by ∼80%, whereas the homologous sequence of Gt had no effect at all (data not shown). Considering the specificity of K-20 and its target sequence, the latter finding provided definitive proof that the βγ-subunits mediating the β-adrenergic inhibition of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation were in fact mainly, if not completely, derived from Gs. Consistent with these results, activation of Gs-coupled receptors has been shown to produce sufficient amounts of βγ-subunits to provide membrane anchorage of G protein-coupled receptor kinase (22.Koch W.J.

The mechanisms by which H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species such as superoxide are generated has been extensively studied in neutrophils and macrophages (26.Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J.

The phagocyte system, which is critical to the inflammatory response, is a multicomponent enzyme that is activated by assembling four cytosolic components (p40 phox, p47 phox, p67 phox, and the small GTPase Rac) with the transmembrane electron carrier flavocytochromeb 558 (26.Knaus U.G.

Human fat cell oxidase differs from neutrophil oxidase in that all components required for H2O2 generation are membrane-bound. In addition, the system produces nontoxic amounts of H2O2, consistent with its potential role in signaling by hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. Despite these differences, human fat cell plasma membranes contain a spectrally detectable cytochrome b 558 (4.Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), suggesting that some of the components of human fat cell oxidase may be similar or identical to those of phagocyte oxidase, as has also been proposed for stimulus-sensitive redox activities of other non-phagocytic cells such as endothelia (29.Jones S.A.
