https://openalex.org/W3047207835,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put considerable physical and emotional strain on frontline healthcare workers. Among frontline healthcare workers, physician trainees represent a unique group—functioning simultaneously as both learners and caregivers and experiencing considerable challenges during the pandemic. However, we have a limited understanding regarding the emotional effects and vulnerability experienced by trainees during the pandemic. We investigated the effects of trainee exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 on their depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment. All physician trainees at an academic medical center (n = 1375) were invited to participate in an online survey. We compared the measures of depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment among trainees who were exposed to patients being tested for COVID-19 and those that were not, using univariable and multivariable models. We also evaluated perceived life stressors such as childcare, home schooling, personal finances and work-family balance among both groups. 393 trainees completed the survey (29% response rate). Compared to the non-exposed group, the exposed group had a higher prevalence of stress (29.4% vs. 18.9%), and burnout (46.3% vs. 33.7%). The exposed group also experienced moderate to extremely high perceived stress regarding childcare and had a lower work-family balance. Multivariable models indicated that trainees who were exposed to COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher stress (10.96 [95% CI, 9.65 to 12.46] vs 8.44 [95% CI, 7.3 to 9.76]; P = 0.043) and were more likely to be burned out (1.31 [95% CI, 1.21 to1.41] vs 1.07 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.19]; P = 0.002]. We also found that female trainees were more likely to be stressed (P = 0.043); while unmarried trainees were more likely to be depressed (P = 0.009), and marginally more likely to have anxiety (P = 0.051). To address these challenges, wellness programs should focus on sustaining current programs, develop new and targeted mental health resources that are widely accessible and devise strategies for creating awareness regarding these resources."

Balanced regulation of cell death and inflammatory immune responses is essential to promote protection against coronavirus infection; however, the underlying mechanisms that control these processes remain to be resolved. Here we demonstrate that infection with the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and inflammatory cell death in the form of PANoptosis. Deleting NLRP3 inflammasome components or the downstream cell death executioner gasdermin D (GSDMD) led to an initial reduction in cell death followed by a robust increase in the incidence of caspase-8– and receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)–mediated inflammatory cell deathafter coronavirus infection. Additionally, loss of GSDMD promoted robust NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, the amounts of some cytokines released during coronavirus infection were significantly altered in the absence of GSDMD. Altogether, our findings show that inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, is induced by coronavirus infection and that impaired NLRP3 inflammasome function or pyroptosis can lead to negative consequences for the host. These findings may have important implications for studies of coronavirus-induced disease.

Dubovi E.J. Chapter 24 Coronaviridae.Fenner's Veterinary Virology. 5E. Academic Press, Boston2017: 435-46110.1016/B978-0-12-800946-8.00024-6Google Scholar). Four coronavirus genera (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) have been identified based on their genetic and serologic properties. Two members of the betacoronavirus genera, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have caused zoonotic events in the recent past (2Chan J.F.W. Lau S.K.P. To K.K.W. Cheng V.C.C. Woo P.C.Y. Yuen K.-Y. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: another zoonotic betacoronavirus causing SARS-like disease.Clin. Microbiol.

Now, a new member of the betacoronavirus genera, SARS-CoV-2, which was first isolated in Wuhan, China in 2019, has emerged and is causing a pandemic (3Jaimes J.A. André N.M. Chappie J.S. Millet J.K.

SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is most often a mild to moderate respiratory illness with symptoms including fever, fatigue, and dry cough (4Zhou M. Zhang X.

Despite these findings, little is known about what cellular and molecular mechanisms contribute to the lung damage and determine the onset of cytokine storm in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. With other infectious respiratory RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) and MERS, studies have shown that aberrant programmed cell death may be a critical driver of organ failure and overt cytokine release in severe cases (13Fujikura D.

Sporadic studies have demonstrated that betacoronavirus proteins or infection with full virus can induce apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis in specific cell types.

Microbial biofilms are ubiquitous in natural and engineered contexts, spanning plant roots to chronic human infections to anaerobic digestors (Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004Hall-Stoodley L.

As biofilms develop, metabolic stratification occurs, driven by steep concentration gradients of substrates, such as oxygen, that are consumed by cells at the biofilm periphery faster than the substrates can diffuse into the biofilm interior (Stewart, 2003Stewart P.S.

Indeed, oxidant limitation is a generic challenge for cells that inhabit biofilm microenvironments where electron donors are abundant, yet electron acceptors are not. One widespread strategy microbes employ to overcome this challenge is to channel electrons derived from intracellular metabolism to extracellular oxidants at a distance (Shi et al., 2016Shi L. Dong H. Reguera G. Beyenal H. Lu A. Liu J. Yu H.Q. Fredrickson J.K. Extracellular electron transfer mechanisms between microorganisms and minerals.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Known as “extracellular electron transfer” (EET), this process requires electron carriers to bridge the gap, be they outer membrane-associated or extracellular cytochromes (Richter et al., 2009Richter H.

Although the putative molecular components underpinning different EET processes have been described in a variety of organisms, a detailed understanding of how these components achieve EET remains an important research goal across diverse systems. In contrast to the rapid progress in understanding the molecular basis by which cytochromes and nanowires facilitate EET, less progress has been made on how soluble (physically diffusive) electron shuttles facilitate EET beyond interactions at the cell surface (Light et al., 2018Light S.H.

Shewanella secretes flavins that mediate extracellular electron transfer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 3968-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). In part, this is due to the challenges involved in identifying and studying small molecule metabolites within a complex extracellular matrix. Accordingly, to study extracellular electron shuttling, we have chosen to work with a model system that employs a relatively well studied and tractable set of shuttles called phenazines. Phenazines are colorful redox-active molecules produced by numerous microbial species including the bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Turner and Messenger, 1986Turner J.M. Messenger A.J.

Physiol. 1986; 27: 211-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar; Chincholkar and Thomashow, 2013Chincholkar S. Thomashow L. Microbial Phenazines: Biosynthesis, Agriculture and Health. Springer Science & Business Media, 2013Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa strains are ubiquitous yet perhaps most well-known for their roles in chronic infections where their growth as biofilms renders them antibiotic tolerant and contributes to patient morbidity and mortality (Costerton et al., 1999Costerton J.W. Stewart P.S. Greenberg E.P. Bacterial biofilms: a common cause of persistent infections.Science. 1999; 284: 1318-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (8124) Google Scholar); importantly, phenazines support the development of anoxic, antibiotic tolerant biofilm regions. Two dimensional mapping of phenazine production in the agar underlying colony biofilms has revealed that different phenazines localize to distinct zones (Bellin et al., 2014Bellin D.L. Sakhtah H. Rosenstein J.K. Levine P.M. Thimot J. Emmett K. Dietrich L.E. Shepard K.L.

Here, we set out to better understand how phenazines facilitate EET within the P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix. Intriguingly, although the P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix comprises a heterogeneous group of polymers (Colvin et al., 2012Colvin K.M. Irie Y. Tart C.S. Urbano R. Whitney J.C. Ryder C. Howell P.L. Wozniak D.J. Parsek M.R. The Pel and Psl polysaccharides provide Pseudomonas aeruginosa structural redundancy within the biofilm matrix.Environ. Microbiol. 2012; 14: 1913-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), extracellular DNA (eDNA) from dead cells is a significant contributor (Allesen-Holm et al., 2006Allesen-Holm M. Barken K.B.

Putative exopolysaccharide synthesis genes influence Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4449-4456Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Phenazines have long been known to intercalate into double stranded DNA in vitro (Hollstein and Van Gemert, 1971Hollstein U. Van Gemert Jr., R.J. Interaction of phenazines with polydeoxyribonucleotides.Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, it was suggested that the phenazine pyocyanin (PYO) can participate in DNA-mediated charge transfer in vitro (Das et al., 2015Das T. Kutty S.K. Tavallaie R. Ibugo A.I. Panchompoo J. Sehar S. Aldous L. Yeung A.W. Thomas S.R. Kumar N. Phenazine virulence factor binding to extracellular DNA is important for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and phenazine-eDNA interactions might facilitate biofilm EET (Das et al., 2015Das T. Kutty S.K. Tavallaie R. Ibugo A.I. Panchompoo J.

Rep. 2015; 5: 8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Notably, the ability of PYO to stimulate cell lysis (Das and Manefield, 2012Das T. Manefield M. Pyocyanin promotes extracellular DNA release in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e46718Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) changes according to the environment: when cells are oxidatively stressed (i.e., oxidant replete but reductant limited) and ATP limited, PYO is toxic; whereas when they are reductively stressed (i.e., reductant replete but oxidant limited), PYO promotes viability and biofilm aggregate expansion (Meirelles and Newman, 2018Meirelles L.A.

This observation raises the intriguing possibility that cell lysis by a small percentage of the population early on might later promote EET once biofilms have developed anoxic zones where extracellular electron shuttles support metabolism. Although a variety of roles for eDNA in biofilms have been proposed, including serving as a structural support, nutrient, and/or genetic reservoir (Flemming and Wingender, 2010Flemming H.-C. Wingender J. The biofilm matrix.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (4704) Google Scholar), to our knowledge, that biofilm eDNA may facilitate EET has not been demonstrated. The current model of phenazine redox cycling in biofilms can be broadly defined (Figure 1A). In anoxic regions, oxidized phenazines are reduced intracellularly by metabolic reactions that support these cells (Jo et al., 2017Jo J. Cortez K.L. Cornell W.C. Price-Whelan A. Dietrich L.E.

Endogenous phenazine antibiotics promote anaerobic survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa via extracellular electron transfer.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These reduced phenazines are thought to physically diffuse through the extracellular matrix toward the oxic region where they react abiotically with molecular oxygen. The oxidized phenazines then return to the anoxic region of the biofilm to complete the redox cycle. Although studies have begun to characterize the reactions on either side of the redox cycle, very little is known about how phenazines operate in the intervening extracellular matrix. Theoretical studies suggest that physical diffusion of oxidized phenazine toward the biofilm interior and reduced phenazine toward the biofilm periphery may be fast enough to support the metabolism of the oxidant limited cells (Glasser et al., 2017aGlasser N.R.

USA. 2014; 111: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but these models have assumed the biofilm is a closed system in which freely diffusing phenazines are not lost to the outer environment. It is well established, however, that phenazines can escape P. aeruginosa biofilms (Ramos et al., 2010Ramos I. Dietrich L.E. Price-Whelan A. Newman D.K. Phenazines affect biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in similar ways at various scales.Res. Microbiol. 2010; 161: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which, if left unchecked, would greatly reduce the efficiency of phenazine redox cycling. This is a key challenge these biofilms must solve. This study investigates how phenazine electron transfer may be reconciled with phenazine retention. Specifically, we ask: are phenazines retained and if so to what extent? What mechanisms of electron transfer are compatible with phenazine retention? Our motivation to answer these questions arises not only from a desire to constrain the model of phenazine redox cycling within P. aeruginosa biofilms, but more broadly, to identify a potentially generalizable strategy for how diverse electron shuttles enable EET. We studied three major phenazine derivatives made by P. aeruginosa strain UCBPP-PA14 (Schroth et al., 2018Schroth M.N. Cho J.J. Green S.K. Kominos S.D. Microbiology Society PublishingEpidemiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in agricultural areas.J. Med. Microbiol. 2018; 67: 1191-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar): phenazine carboxylate (PCA), phenazine carboxamide (PCN), and pyocyanin (PYO); at the pH relevant for our experiments, the dominant form of PCA is negatively charged whereas PCN and PYO are uncharged (Figure 1B). Beyond studying wild-type (WT)-produced phenazines, we also determine the effects of individual synthetic phenazines on a mutant that does not produce phenazines, Δphz (ΔphzA1-G1, ΔphzA2-G2), or on a mutant that is also incapable of modifying PCA to make PCN and PYO, Δphz∗ (Δphz, ΔphzMS, ΔphzH). Experiments were performed with two different types of biofilms: macroscopic colony biofilms grown on nutrient agar surfaces (Figures 1C and S1A) and microscopic biofilms attached to the surfaces of an interdigitated microelectrode array (IDA) suspended in liquid medium. Phenazine-dependent biofilm phenotypes operate similarly at both scales (Ramos et al., 2010Ramos I. Dietrich L.E. Price-Whelan A. Newman D.K. Phenazines affect biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in similar ways at various scales.Res. Microbiol. 2010; 161: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), so we selected the biofilm cultivation method for any given experiment based on which was best suited to answering our specific research question. First, we sought to quantify phenazine retention by colony biofilms (Figures 1C and 1D). We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to quantify extracted endogenous phenazines from the biofilms and compared their concentrations to that in the underlying agar (Figures 1D–1F). Colony biofilms could be cleanly separated from the agar, because they were separated by a 0.2 μm membrane filter, which did not affect the results (Figures S1B and S1C). Overall, PCA, PCN, and PYO concentrations varied by more than 10-fold in the biofilms reaching concentrations of ∼15 μM PCA, ∼400 μM PCN, and ∼80 μM PYO. Comparing biofilm to agar concentrations showed that PCN and PYO were enriched in the biofilm 10-fold and 30-fold, respectively, while PCA reached similar concentrations in the biofilm and the agar (Figures 1E and 1F). This suggested that PCN and PYO were strongly retained by the biofilm and PCA was not. Lysing resuspended biofilm cells by sonication prior to phenazine quantification did not strongly affect the results (Figure S1D), indicating that the measured pools of phenazines were predominantly retained extracellularly rather than intracellularly. To test if differential phenazine retention requires endogenous phenazines, we grew Δphz∗ colony biofilms with synthetic phenazines in the agar and quantified phenazines taken up by the biofilm. Incubation with ≥50 μM PYO resulted in >200 μM PYO accumulation in the biofilm (Figure 1G). PCN accumulated to a lesser extent, and PCA biofilm uptake was minimal (<50 μM) even with 200 μM added to the agar (Figure 1G). Δphz∗ colonies transferred from phenazine agar to fresh agar after 3 days of growth retained phenazines in the same pattern as the WT over 24 h (Figure 1H), demonstrating that the observed phenazine retention does not depend on endogenous phenazine production. WT colony biofilms exhibit relatively thick and smooth morphologies that contain deep anoxic regions that are thought to be supported by phenazine EET. Δphz∗ colony biofilms exhibit different colony morphologies that are thin and highly wrinkled, which is thought to be a physiological adaptation to maximize surface area and oxygen penetration in the absence of phenazines as shown for Δphz (Dietrich et al., 2013Dietrich L.E.P. Okegbe C. Price-Whelan A. Sakhtah H. Hunter R.C. Newman D.K. Bacterial community morphogenesis is intimately linked to the intracellular redox state.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 1371-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Notably, only incubation of Δphz∗ colonies with exogenous PYO appreciably complemented the colony wrinkling phenotype (Figure S1A), demonstrating that retained PYO is used by the colony biofilm for phenazine EET metabolism in vivo. P. aeruginosa colony biofilms thus appear able to take up and use significant amounts of exogenous PYO, and PCN to a lesser extent. These results predict that colony biofilms contain an extracellular component that binds and effectively retains PYO and PCN, but not PCA. Because we measured considerable biofilm-retained PYO and PCN that was insensitive to cell lysis by sonication, we hypothesized these phenazines might bind an abundant component of the biofilm extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix in P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilms is known to be composed primarily of two polymers: DNA from dead cells (eDNA) and the polysaccharide, Pel (Colvin et al., 2011Colvin K.M. Gordon V.D. Murakami K. Borlee B.R. Wozniak D.J. Wong G.C. Parsek M.R. The pel polysaccharide can serve a structural and protective role in the biofilm matrix of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1001264Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar; Das and Manefield, 2012Das T. Manefield M. Pyocyanin promotes extracellular DNA release in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e46718Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and recent work suggested that PYO intercalates into DNA in vitro (Das et al., 2015Das T. Kutty S.K. Tavallaie R. Ibugo A.I. Panchompoo J. Sehar S. Aldous L. Yeung A.W. Thomas S.R. Kumar N. Phenazine virulence factor binding to extracellular DNA is important for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that eDNA in the biofilm matrix was responsible for binding phenazines, we quantified the binding affinity of oxidized PCA, PCN, and PYO for a 29 base pair double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule in vitro using isothermal titration calorimetry (Figure 2A). As expected, oxidized PCA showed no detectable binding because it is negatively charged, as is the phosphate backbone of DNA at pH 7. In contrast, oxidized PCN (KD = 194 μM; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 148–305 μM) and PYO (KD = 13 μM; 95% CI = 6.5–49 μM) both bind dsDNA, and their dominant forms are neutral at pH 7 (Costa et al., 2017Costa K.C. Glasser N.R. Conway S.J. Newman D.K. Pyocyanin degradation by a tautomerizing demethylase inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.Science. 2017; 355: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with ethidium bromide displacement and microscale thermophoresis binding assays (Figures S2A and S2B) (Das et al., 2015Das T. Kutty S.K. Tavallaie R. Ibugo A.I. Panchompoo J. Sehar S. Aldous L. Yeung A.W. Thomas S.R. Kumar N. Phenazine virulence factor binding to extracellular DNA is important for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Notably, these in vitro phenazine-DNA binding affinities correlate with their in vivo retention ratio ([biofilm]/[agar]), where PYO is retained in the biofilm significantly more than PCN, and PCA is not retained. Reduced PYO showed no change in endogenous fluorescence upon addition of calf thymus DNA (Figure S2C), suggesting that the DNA binding affinity of PYO is redox dependent.Figure S2Phenazine-DNA Binding Assays, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A-B) Dotted lines show best fit Hill equations with shaded regions showing curves from the 95% confidence intervals for IC50 or KD.

To determine whether phenazine-eDNA binding occurs in vivo, we treated 3-day-old WT biofilms with DNase I for 24 h. These experiments were performed with DNase I spotted on tryptone agar medium rather than its optimal buffer, as controls showed that buffer alone significantly disturbed the biofilm (Figures S3A–S3C). A previous study also observed that mature P. aeruginosa biofilms were minimally affected by DNase and suggested that extracellular proteases may inactivate DNase (Whitchurch et al., 2002Whitchurch C.B.

However, it is still unclear why only ZIKV from the flavivirus family is linked to microcephaly and other birth defects, which calls for a better understanding of its immune evasion and pathogenesis. Like other flaviviruses, the RNA genome of ZIKV encodes one polyprotein that is cleaved into three structure proteins and seven nonstructural proteins (Figure S1A; Garcia-Blanco et al., 2016Garcia-Blanco M.A. Vasudevan S.G. Bradrick S.S. Nicchitta C. Flavivirus RNA transactions from viral entry to genome replication.Antiviral Res. 2016; 134: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, host molecular targets of ZIKV proteins in NSCs remain largely unknown. RNA interference (RNAi) is an important biological process in many eukaryotes during which small RNA molecules neutralize targeted mRNA molecules to inhibit the translation or gene expression (Wilson and Doudna, 2013Wilson R.C. Doudna J.A. Molecular mechanisms of RNA interference.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2013; 42: 217-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Dicer, a fundamental microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis enzyme, initiates the RNAi pathway by cleaving double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) or stem-loop structure of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) into short dsRNAs, and one strand of dsRNAs is directly loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Jinek and Doudna, 2009Jinek M. Doudna J.A. A three-dimensional view of the molecular machinery of RNA interference.Nature. 2009; 457: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The mature miRNA perfectly or partially pairs with complementary sites on target mRNAs, leading to the inhibition of mRNA stability or translation. miRNAs are involved in almost every cellular process and are essential for cell differentiation, development, and homeostasis. Deregulation of miRNA is associated with numerous diseases in human. For example, Dicer deficiency leads to microcephaly in animal models (Davis et al., 2008Davis T.H. Cuellar T.L. Koch S.M. Barker A.J. Harfe B.D. McManus M.T. Ullian E.M. Conditional loss of Dicer disrupts cellular and tissue morphogenesis in the cortex and hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4322-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and several miRNAs (e.g., let-7a, miR-9, miR-17, miR-19a) play crucial roles during fetal brain development (Rajman and Schratt, 2017Rajman M. Schratt G. MicroRNAs in neural development: from master regulators to fine-tuners.Development. 2017; 144: 2310-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, dysregulation of host miRNA after ZIKV infection has been recently documented in NSCs (Dang et al., 2019Dang J.W. Tiwari S.K. Qin Y. Rana T.M.

Dis. 2017; 11: e0005760Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, whether there is a direct link between Dicer-dependent miRNA system and ZIKV-induced microcephaly is still unknown. Although great progress has been made toward infectious model establishment (Caine et al., 2018Caine E.A. Jagger B.W. Diamond M.S. Animal models of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.Viruses. 2018; 10: 598Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar; Dong and Liang, 2018Dong S. Liang Q. Recent advances in animal models of Zika virus infection.Virol. Sin. 2018; 33: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and vaccine development (Diamond et al., 2019Diamond M.S. Ledgerwood J.E. Pierson T.C. Zika virus vaccine development: progress in the face of new challenges.Annu. Rev. Med. 2019; 70: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), two important questions regarding ZIKV are yet to be addressed: (1) What determines the unique pathogenesis of ZIKV on fetal brain development? and (2) What mechanisms contribute to ZIKV evolution from a low-pathogenic virus to high-pathogenic virus? By establishing ZIKV-host interactome in NSCs, we identified Dicer as a restriction factor for ZIKV infection and a specific binding partner for ZIKV capsid. ZIKV capsid but not its H41R mutant antagonizes Dicer enzymatic activity and disrupts miRNA biogenesis, leading to impaired neurogenesis of NSCs in vitro and corticogenesis in vivo. Interestingly, the capsid from epidemic ZIKV strain has a higher binding affinity to Dicer than African-strain capsid and thereby is more capable of inhibiting Dicer function and causing developmental impairment in embryonic brain. To fully understand the roles of these viral proteins during the ZIKV life cycle, we first established the ZIKV-host interactome in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NSCs. Briefly, we overexpressed each individual ZIKV protein carrying N-terminal 3xFLAG-epitope in these cells, purified each ZIKV protein complex, and analyzed the co-purified cellular proteins using mass spectrometry in two independent biological repeats. With statistical analysis using the SAINT algorithm (Choi et al., 2011Choi H. Larsen B. Lin Z.-Y. Breitkreutz A. Mellacheruvu D. Fermin D. Qin Z.S. Tyers M. Gingras A.-C. Nesvizhskii A.I.

It is worth noting that cell type-specific ZIKV viral protein targets exist, as ZIKV-host interactomes in SK-N-BE2 (Scaturro et al., 2018Scaturro P. Stukalov A. Haas D.A. Cortese M. Draganova K.

An orthogonal proteomic survey uncovers novel Zika virus host factors.Nature. 2018; 561: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and HEK293T (Shah et al., 2018Shah P.S. Link N. Jang G.M. Sharp P.P. Zhu T. Swaney D.L. Johnson J.R. Von Dollen J. Ramage H.R. Satkamp L. et al.Comparative flavivirus-host protein interaction mapping reveals mechanisms of dengue and Zika virus pathogenesis.Cell. 2018; 175: 1931-1945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) cell lines share only ∼7% overlap; similarly, our ZIKV-host interactome in NSCs only shares 18 or 13 common binding partners with these two reports, respectively (Figure S1L; Table S2). Host cellular pathways that are most likely affected by ZIKV are translation, mRNA processing, RNA splicing, mRNA transport, and viral process pathways (Figure 1B). Several protein-protein interactions with greater interest were further validated by co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) in HEK293T cells (Figure S2A). Within this ZIKV-host interactome, ribonuclease (RNase) III-like enzyme Dicer is the top hit, with 73 peptides (Table S3) covering more than 38% of Dicer amino acid sequence (Figure S2B). This interaction was confirmed at the endogenous level in infected cells with coIP using antibodies specific to human Dicer (Figure 1C). To examine the role of Dicer in ZIKV infection, we infected wild-type (WT) or Dicer-knockout (Dicer1-KO) mouse NSCs with ZIKV Brazilian strain SPH2015 (Cunha et al., 2016Cunha M.S. Esposito D.L.A. Rocco I.M. Maeda A.Y. Vasami F.G.S. Nogueira J.S. de Souza R.P. Suzuki A. Addas-Carvalho M. Barjas-Castro M. de L. et al.First complete genome sequence of Zika virus (Flaviviridae, flavivirus) from an autochthonous transmission in Brazil.Genome Announc. 2016; 4: e00032-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Dicer deficiency led to much higher ZIKV viral load in mouse NSCs, as shown by levels of viral proteins at 5 days post-infection (dpi) (Figure 1D), viral titers between 1 and 7 dpi (Figure 1E), and viral transcripts on the basis of quantitative RT-PCR (Figure S2C). This was successfully rescued by re-expressing Dicer in Dicer1-KO mouse NSCs with a lentiviral construct (Figures 1F and 1G), indicating that the Dicer-dependent RNAi machinery restricts ZIKV. As the capsids of flaviviruses share structural similarities (Figure 2A; Li et al., 2018Li T. Zhao Q. Yang X. Chen C. Yang K. Wu C. Zhang T. Duan Y. Xue X. Mi K. et al.Structural insight into the Zika virus capsid encapsulating the viral genome.Cell Res. 2018; 28: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; Shang et al., 2018Shang Z. Song H. Shi Y. Qi J. Gao G.F. Crystal structure of the capsid protein from Zika virus.J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430: 948-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we investigated whether this interaction is a common signature for flavivirus family. To our surprise, among all the capsids cloned, only ZIKV capsid bound strongly to Dicer (Figure 2B). As alignment comparison analysis demonstrated that ZIKV capsid has distinct amino acids compared with DENV type 2 (DENV2), West Nile virus (WNV), or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), we generated ten ZIKV capsid mutants by replacing these ZIKV unique sequences with corresponding DENV2 or WNV sequences (Figure 2C) and found that a single mutation of histidine to arginine (H41R) completely abolished capsid-Dicer interaction (Figure 2D). More important, ZIKV capsid can directly bind to Dicer, as recombinant GST-tagged ZIKV capsid and human Dicer protein readily interacted with each other in vitro, while the GST-H41R capsid mutant lost its affinity to Dicer (Figure 2E). Detailed molecular mapping showed that the linker domain between these two RNase III domains of Dicer (aa 1403–1665) is responsible for ZIKV capsid interaction (Figures S2D and S2F). Structural modeling on the basis of ZIKV capsid (PDB: 5YGH) (Li et al., 2018Li T. Zhao Q. Yang X. Chen C. Yang K. Wu C. Zhang T. Duan Y. Xue X. Mi K. et al.Structural insight into the Zika virus capsid encapsulating the viral genome.Cell Res. 2018; 28: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; Shang et al., 2018Shang Z. Song H.

Cryo-EM structure of human Dicer and its complexes with a pre-miRNA substrate.Cell. 2018; 173: 1191-1203.e12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed that H41 located on the interface between two proteins (Figure S2E), supporting the critical role of this unique residue. Dicer cleaves dsRNA or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) into short dsRNAs (Jinek and Doudna, 2009Jinek M. Doudna J.A. A three-dimensional view of the molecular machinery of RNA interference.Nature. 2009; 457: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). As ZIKV capsid targets the linker domain between the two functional RNase III domains, ZIKV may modulate Dicer’s functions to facilitate virus replication and pathogenesis. To determine whether ZIKV capsid affects Dicer’s activity (Figure 2F), we first used a reversal-of-silencing assay to examine shRNA-mediated silencing (Paddison et al., 2002Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) induce sequence-specific silencing in mammalian cells.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar), by co-transfecting HEK293T cells with plasmids encoding GFP, GFP-specific shRNA (shGFP), and vector or flavivirus capsid plasmids (Figures 2G and 2H). ZIKV capsid, but not H41R mutant or vector control, efficiently attenuated Dicer-dependent shGFP processing and reduced the shGFP activity by nearly 3-fold (Figure 2H). In addition, capsids from other flaviviruses failed to block shGFP function (Figures 2G, 2H, S3A, and S3B). On the other hand, in a siRNA-mediated knockdown assay that bypasses Dicer (Figure S3C), ZIKV capsid, its H41R mutant, and the capsids from other flaviviruses all failed to alter GFP-specific siRNA knockdown efficiency (Figures S3D and S3E), suggesting that ZIKV capsid’s target is Dicer but not the downstream RISC. This finding was further confirmed by a transient let-7a reporter assay (Hutvágner et al., 2001Hutvágner G. McLachlan J. Pasquinelli A.E. Bálint E. Tuschl T. Zamore P.D. A cellular function for the RNA-interference enzyme Dicer in the maturation of the let-7 small temporal RNA.Science. 2001; 293: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar), in which only ZIKV capsid inhibited Dicer-dependent let-7a production, instead of H41R mutant or the capsids from DENV2 or WNV (Figure 2I). More important, when tested in vitro to cleave long dsRNAs (∼600 nt) into small dsRNA fragments (Figures S3F and S3G), Dicer’s RNase activity was impaired in the presence of GST-capsid in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2J), which was not observed in the presence of GST-capsid H41R mutant or control GST (Figures 2J and 2K). As a direct comparison, in a similar in vitro cleavage assay using E. coli RNase III, neither GST-capsid nor GST-capsid H41R mutant affected its enzymatic activity on dsRNA cleavage (Figure S3H), indicating that ZIKV capsid specifically targets host Dicer-dependent RNAi machinery. Both capsid and Dicer are RNA-binding proteins, so capsid might inhibit Dicer through a competitive mechanism, which is least likely as capsid can directly bind to Dicer, and other RNA-binding capsids from the flavivirus family had no obvious effect in our functional assays (Figures 2G–2I). To further rule out this possibility, we performed RNase A treatment before coIP and found that the ZIKV capsid-Dicer association occurred in the absence of RNAs (Figure S3I). In addition, purified recombinant capsid-WT and capsid-H41R mutant had very similar binding affinities to dsRNAs in vitro (Figures S3J and S3K). Therefore, these results indicate that ZIKV capsid-mediated inhibition of Dicer is through direct interaction. To determine the role of Dicer modulatory activity of capsid during ZIKV infection, we introduced H41R mutation into a ZIKV infectious clone based on strain SPH2015 using reverse genetic (Zhao et al., 2018Zhao F. Xu Y. Lavillette D. Zhong J. Zou G. Long G. Negligible contribution of M2634V substitution to ZIKV pathogenesis in AG6 mice revealed by a bacterial promoter activity reduced infectious clone.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 10491Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and produced both ZIKV-WT and ZIKV-H41R mutant viruses from Vero cells (STAR Methods). In Vero cells, ZIKV-H41R replicated with less efficiency than ZIKV-WT on the basis of viral loads (Figure 3A), although the differences were indistinguishable at early stages (Figures S4A and S4B). Importantly, ZIKV-H41R replicated as efficiently as ZIKV-WT in mouse Dicer1-KO NSCs (Figure 3B), suggesting that loss of inhibition on host Dicer as a direct consequence of this point mutation can substantially reduce ZIKV virulence. Immunostaining also showed that ZIKV capsid colocalized well with endogenous Dicer in human fetal NSCs (fNSCs) at 24 h after infected with ZIKV-WT, which was dramatically reduced in case of ZIKV-H41R infection (Figures S4C–S4E). Consistently, ZIKV-WT led to 51% of cell death at 5 dpi (Liang et al., 2016Liang Q. Luo Z. Zeng J. Chen W. Foo S.-S. Lee S.-A. Ge J. Wang S. Goldman S.A. Zlokovic B.V. et al.Zika virus NS4A and NS4B proteins deregulate Akt-mTOR signaling in human fetal neural stem cells to inhibit neurogenesis and induce autophagy.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 663-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), which was reduced nearly by half in fNSCs infected with ZIKV-H41R (Figures 3C and 3D). In addition, ectopic expression of capsidWT facilitated ZIKV infection in fNSCs and normalized the replicative difference between ZIKV-WT and ZIKV-H41R, which was not observed following capsidH41R expression (Figures 3E and 3F), further suggesting modulation of Dicer by capsid is key to ZIKV’s virulence in fNSCs. Using an in utero injection protocol (Li et al., 2016aLi C. Xu D. Ye Q. Hong S. Jiang Y. Liu X. Zhang N. Shi L. Qin C.-F. Xu Z.

Li C. et al.A single mutation in the prM protein of Zika virus contributes to fetal microcephaly.Science. 2017; 358: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and combined with small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery in the cerebroventricular space/lateral ventricle at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) (Figure 3G), we were able to determine the role of Dicer on ZIKV virulence in vivo. Different viral replication profiles between ZIKV-WT and ZIKV-H41R were also observed in mouse embryonic brains at E18.5 (Figures 3H and 3I). More specifically, ZIKV-H41R infection resulted in much lower levels of viral burden than ZIKV-WT in the presence of scramble siRNA, which were normalized after Dicer knockdown (Figure S4F), as shown by both immunoblotting (Figures 3H and S4G) and in situ hybridization using ZIKV-specific RNAscope probes (Figures 3I and S4H). These results indicate that capsid-mediated Dicer inhibition is also a determinant of ZIKV virulence in vivo, and ZIKV-H41R is still under the surveillance of host Dicer’s antiviral functions (Xu et al., 2019Xu Y.-P. Qiu Y. Zhang B. Chen G. Chen Q. Wang M. Mo F. Xu J. Wu J.

Cuellar T.L. Koch S.M. Barker A.J. Harfe B.D. McManus M.T. Ullian E.M. Conditional loss of Dicer disrupts cellular and tissue morphogenesis in the cortex and hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4322-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) can cause microcephaly in mice. Using the same in utero infection model (Figure 3G), we found that consistent with previous reports (Li et al., 2016aLi C. Xu D. Ye Q. Hong S. Jiang Y. Liu X. Zhang N. Shi L. Qin C.-F. Xu Z.

Li C. et al.A single mutation in the prM protein of Zika virus contributes to fetal microcephaly.Science. 2017; 358: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), ZIKV-WT-infected embryos exhibited smaller brain on the basis of measurements of brain width and cortical area at E18.5 (Figures 4A and S4I) compared with embryos injected with vehicle (mock). This is in line with the elevated levels of apoptotic cell death in the cortical area (Figures S4J and S4K). However, ZIKV-H41R mutant virus had a very marginal effect on brain sizes (Figures 4A and S4I), which is correlated with reduced levels of viral burden (Figure 4B). Furthermore, ZIKV-WT infection caused severe defects in corticogenesis, as indicated by a substantial reduction (33.6%) in the thickness of cortical plate (CP) 5 days after in utero injection (Figures 4C, 4D, and S4L). More important, immunohistological analyses demonstrated significant reductions in SATB2+ upper-layer neurons (21.1%; Figure 4E), CTIP2+ deep-layer neurons (32.0%; Figure 4F), and TBR1+ subplate neurons (39.2%; Figure 4G; Leone et al., 2008Leone D.P. Srinivasan K. Chen B. Alcamo E. McConnell S.K. The determination of projection neuron identity in the developing cerebral cortex.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), indicating impaired corticogenesis. More important, release of Dicer inhibition as the consequence of H41R mutation remarkably mitigated the corticogenesis defects in embryos infected with ZIKV-H41R (Figures 4C–4G), suggesting that ZIKV-related microcephaly is, at least in part, through capsid and its inhibition of Dicer. To determine how ZIKV affects progenitors and differentiation in vivo, we further quantified the progenitors and newborn neurons at E16.5 after infection (Figure 4H). ZIKV-WT and ZIKV-H41R both effectively infected the SOX2+ and PAX6+ radial glial progenitors (Figures 4I–4L), as well as TBR2+ intermediate progenitors and DCX+ newborn neurons (Figures 4M, 4N, S4M, and S4N). However, at E16.5 we did not see dramatic changes in the density of SOX2+ and PAX6+ radial glial progenitors in the ventricular zone (VZ) (Figures 4I–4L) or density of TBR2+ intermediate progenitors in subventricular zone (SVZ) (Figures S4M and S4N). Within 3 days of infection, ZIKV had not widely spread to CP yet (Figure 4H), and DCX+ newborn neurons in CP were not much affected either (Figures 4M and 4N). More important, we observed a substantial reduction of P-H3+ cells in VZ at E16.5 (Figures 4O–4Q), indicating inhibition of proliferation in neural progenitors. This effect is likely due to capsid-mediated Dicer dysfunction, as Dicer knockout embryos also exhibit loss of P-H3 in VZ (De Pietri Tonelli et al., 2008De Pietri Tonelli D. Pulvers J.N. Haffner C. Murchison E.P. Hannon G.J. Huttner W.B. miRNAs are essential for survival and differentiation of newborn neurons but not for expansion of neural progenitors during early neurogenesis in the mouse embryonic neocortex.Development. 2008; 135: 3911-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and ZIKV-H41R-infected VZ cells were still dividing (Figures 4P and 4Q). These results demonstrated that ZIKV is able to infect different linages of neural progenitor cells and inhibit progenitor proliferation, which contributes to ZIKV pathogenesis. We next examined whether knockdown of Dicer further facilitates ZIKV virulence in vivo. Our data showed that siRNA-mediated Dicer knockdown at E13.5 resulted in significant impairment of corticogenesis, as shown by reduced cortical width and cortical area at E18.5 (Figures S4O–S4Q), as well as decreased thickness of both CP and VZ/SVZ layers (Figures S4R–S4T). More important, Dicer knockdown abolished the difference between the ZIKV-WT and ZIKV-H41R in compromising corticogenesis (Figures S4P, S4Q, S4S, and S4T), which is consistent with our finding on ZIKV viral load in the presence of si.Dicer. As Dicer knockdown and ZIKV-WT together did not result in an additive impact on corticogenesis, our results indicate that ZIKV capsid-mediated Dicer dysfunction is key to its pathogenesis in the fetal brain. Next, we determined whether ZIKV capsid itself is sufficient to affect the proliferation and differentiation of human fNSCs in vitro. Unlike ZIKV NS4A and NS4B as we previously reported (Liang et al., 2016Liang Q. Luo Z. Zeng J. Chen W. Foo S.-S. Lee S.-A. Ge J. Wang S. Goldman S.A. Zlokovic B.V. et al.Zika virus NS4A and NS4B proteins deregulate Akt-mTOR signaling in human fetal neural stem cells to inhibit neurogenesis and induce autophagy.Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 19: 663-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), expression of ZIKV capsidWT or capsidH41R (Figu"
https://openalex.org/W3047649865,"Introduction Despite the desire of adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to use contraceptives, the majority of them have challenges with access to contraceptive services. This is more evident in high fertility countries in SSA. The purpose of this study was to examine the predictors of unmet need for contraception among AGYW in selected high fertility countries in SSA. Materials and methods Data from current Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) carried out between 2010 and 2018 in 10 countries in SSA were analysed. A sample size of 24,898 AGYW who were either married or cohabiting was used. Unmet need for contraception was the outcome variable in this study. The explanatory variables were age, marital status, occupation, educational level, frequency of reading newspaper/magazine, frequency of listening to radio, frequency of watching television and parity (individual level variables) and wealth quintile, sex of household head, place of residence and decision-maker in healthcare (household/community level variables). Descriptive and multilevel logistic regression analyses were carried out. The results of the multilevel logistic regression analyses were reported using adjusted odds ratios at 95% confidence interval. Results The prevalence of unmet need for contraception in all the countries considered in this study was 24.9%, with Angola, recording the highest prevalence of 42.6% while Niger had the lowest prevalence of 17.8%. In terms of the individual level predictors, the likelihood of unmet need for contraception was low among AGYW aged 20–24 [aOR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.76–0.88], those with primary [aOR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.13–1.31] and secondary/higher levels of formal education [aOR = 1.18; 95% CI = 1.08–1.28, p < 0.001], cohabiting AGYW [aOR = 1.52; 95% CI = 1.42–1.63] and AGYW with three or more births [aOR = 3.41; 95% CI = 3.02–3.85]. At the household/community level, the odds of unmet need for contraception was highest among poorer AGYW [aOR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.21–1.53], AGYW in female-headed households [aOR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.13–1.33], urban AGYW [aOR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.11–1.32] and AGYW who took healthcare decisions alone [aOR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.01–1.21]. Conclusion This study has identified disparities in unmet need for contraception among AGYW in high fertility countries in SSA, with AGYW in Angola having the highest prevalence. Both individual and household/community level factors predicted unmet need for contraception among AGYW in this study. However, based on the ICC values, household/community level factors prevailed the individual level factors. Enhancing access to contraception among poorer AGYW, those in female-headed households, those in urban areas and those who take healthcare decisions alone by both governmental and non-governmental organisations in high fertility countries is recommended."

From insects to mammals, the neural substrates encoding this behavior, which has evolved repeatedly across vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, are under strong evolutionary pressure (Mcnamara and Wolf, 2015Mcnamara J.M.

This has shaped the expression of parental behavior based on its adaptive value in each species, ranging from egg-laying site selection or brooding to provisioning, nursing, and teaching of skills. Many mammalian species are maternally uniparental, but there are exceptions (Feldman, 2015Feldman R.

Classic examples of the biparental approach are the prairie vole (Oliveras and Novak, 1986Oliveras D. Novak M. A Comparison of Paternal Behavior in the Meadow Vole Microtus-Pennsylvanicus, the Pine Vole Microtus-Pinetorum and the Prairie Vole Microtus-Ochrogaster.Anim.

Interestingly, closely related species can fall at opposite ends of the biparental spectrum (Oliveras and Novak, 1986Oliveras D. Novak M.

The genetic basis of parental care evolution in monogamous mice.Nature. 2017; 544: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), indicative of the dynamic range of the neural and endocrine mechanisms underlying this behavior across the phylogenetic tree. Maternal behavior is strongly influenced by hormones. A seminal study by Terkel and Rosenblatt, 1968Terkel J. Rosenblatt J.S. Maternal behavior induced by maternal blood plasma injected into virgin rats.J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1968; 65: 479-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar revealed that transfusion of blood plasma from a lactating dam can induce maternal behavior in virgin female rats. Subsequent work identified that a triad of hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin [Prl]), whose levels rise and remain elevated in the rodent female throughout pregnancy, postpartum, and during raising of the young, are responsible for induction of maternal behavior (Moltz et al., 1970Moltz H. Lubin M. Leon M. Numan M. Hormonal induction of maternal behavior in the ovariectomized nulliparous rat.Physiol. Behav. 1970; 5: 1373-1377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Along with these hormones, oxytocin has been found to play a crucial role in induction and regulation of maternal behavior (Pedersen and Prange, 1979Pedersen C.A. Prange Jr., A.J. Induction of maternal behavior in virgin rats after intracerebroventricular administration of oxytocin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1979; 76: 6661-6665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Keverne et al., 1988Keverne E.B. Kendrick K.M. Poindron P. Oxytocin and Maternal-Behavior.Psychopharmacology. 1988; 96: S30Google Scholar). An imposing catalog of later studies has further fortified the association between maternal hormones and maternal behavior (Zarrow et al., 1971Zarrow M.X. Denenberg V.H. Gandelman R. Prolactin - Is It an Essential Hormone for Maternal Behavior in Mammal.Horm. Behav. 1971; 2: 343Crossref Google Scholar; Gonzalez and Deis, 1986Gonzalez D.E. Deis R.P. Maternal behavior in cyclic and androgenized female rats: role of ovarian hormones.Physiol. Behav. 1986; 38: 789-793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hormone most strongly and specifically implicated in maternal functions is Prl, whose secretion from the anterior pituitary is primarily controlled by tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons located in the dorsomedial arcuate nucleus (dmArc) of the hypothalamus, which exert a powerful inhibitory influence under most physiological conditions in males and virgin females (Gudelsky, 1981Gudelsky G.A. Tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons and the regulation of prolactin secretion.Psychoneuroendocrinology. 1981; 6: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar; Demarest et al., 1986Demarest K.T. Riegle G.D. Moore K.E.

This dopamine-mediated inhibition of Prl release operates via activation of the D2 dopamine receptor on Prl-producing lactotroph cells (Gonzalez-Iglesias et al., 2008Gonzalez-Iglesias A.E. Murano T. Li S. Tomić M. Stojilkovic S.S. Dopamine inhibits basal prolactin release in pituitary lactotrophs through pertussis toxin-sensitive and -insensitive signaling pathways.Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 1470-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Plastic changes in the lactotropic axis are believed to cause the dopaminergic “brake” to lift, resulting in the surge of serum Prl occurring during the late stages of pregnancy and postpartum (Wang et al., 1993Wang H.J. Hoffman G.E. Smith M.S.

Biochemical indices of tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neuronal activity during lactation: a lack of response to prolactin.Neuroendocrinology. 1983; 36: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This sustained elevation of Prl in the lactating dam is widely recognized to facilitate the expression of lactation and maternal behaviors necessary for raising the offspring (Bridges et al., 1974Bridges R.S.

Behav. 1974; 5: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar; Korányi et al., 1977Korányi L. Phelps C.P. Sawyer C.H.

USA. 2017; 114: 10779-10784Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, although a rich and growing literature has shed light on neural and hormonal regulation of maternal behavior, the mechanisms underlying paternal care for offspring in biparental species remain obscure. It is further not known whether the prerequisites for paternal behavior are in place by default or induced by the process of fathering offspring, as is the case for infanticidal instincts, which are present in the virgin male but largely disappear after mating (vom Saal, 1985vom Saal F.S. Time-contingent change in infanticide and parental behavior induced by ejaculation in male mice.Physiol. Behav. 1985; 34: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Curiously, the male sire in a biparental species is less prone to somatosensory signals from the young and does not respond by increasing serum Prl to levels found in the lactating dam (Fleming et al., 2002Fleming A.S. Corter C. Stallings J. Steiner M. Testosterone and prolactin are associated with emotional responses to infant cries in new fathers.Horm. Behav. 2002; 42: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar; Guillou et al., 2015Guillou A. Romanò N. Steyn F. Abitbol K. Le Tissier P. Bonnefont X. Chen C. Mollard P. Martin A.O.

Sex differences in prolactin secretion in parental male and female rats.Psychoneuroendocrinology. 1983; 8: 109-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations raise the question of whether paternal behavior is a predisposed state rather than induced via somatosensory input. The current study was motivated by the recent demonstration of differential activity of TIDA neurons in the males of two commonly used animal models, the rat and the mouse (Stagkourakis et al., 2018Stagkourakis S. Pérez C.T. Hellysaz A. Ammari R. Broberger C. Network oscillation rules imposed by species-specific electrical coupling.eLife. 2018; 7: e33144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular mechanism of this discrepancy was identified as the presence of strong gap junction coupling between male rat TIDA neurons, contrasting with the complete absence of electrical connectivity in male mice (Stagkourakis et al., 2018Stagkourakis S. Pérez C.T. Hellysaz A. Ammari R. Broberger C. Network oscillation rules imposed by species-specific electrical coupling.eLife. 2018; 7: e33144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations at the network level beg the question of the potential functional effect of species differences in TIDA oscillation frequency. The role of Prl, the downstream target of TIDA activity, is poorly understood in males, in particular how it pertains to behavior and parenting. Curiously, mating experience allows the behavioral transition from infanticide to paternal behavior, although only in biparental species (McCarthy and Vom Saal, 1986McCarthy M.M. Vom Saal F.S. Inhibition of infanticide after mating by wild male house mice.Physiol. Behav. 1986; 36: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar; Voloschin et al., 1998Voloschin L.M. Gallardo M.G.P. Tramezzani J.H. Suckling-induced serum prolactin levels are modified by interference with milk ejection in lactating rats.Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Thus, filling this gap in knowledge requires not only identifying the effect of Prl on male action patterns but also determining under which conditions Prl may affect male behavior toward offspring: is it necessary, sufficient, and/or permissive? We hypothesized that the species difference in TIDA circuit configuration may affect one of the characteristics most strongly associated with Prl in the female: care for offspring. We explored this hypothesis, providing a link between the individual components of the lactotropic axis and the central circuits associated with parental behavior. The correlations we found were then evaluated for causality by manipulating the system in mice with optogenetics and conditional deletion of the Prl receptor (Prl-R) and in rats through pharmacology. The results demonstrate that the distinct oscillatory activity of TIDA neurons establishes the level of serum Prl throughout adulthood, regulating the activity of neural networks implicated in parental behavior and ultimately enabling (or not) the expression of paternal care. This work provides a mechanistic and conceptual understanding of the role of the lactotropic axis in male parental behavior. It further suggests that pre-set hypothalamic neuron activity at the level of network oscillation frequency and serum Prl levels, prime the conditional expression of a behavioral repertoire that can be elicited in the presence of a sire’s own pups. Recent studies have described a striking species difference in the rhythmic electrical activity of Prl-inhibiting TIDA neurons in the male rat and mouse (Lyons et al., 2010Lyons D.J. Horjales-Araujo E. Broberger C.

Network oscillation rules imposed by species-specific electrical coupling.eLife. 2018; 7: e33144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, male rat TIDA neurons were observed to discharge in robust slow oscillations (typically 0.17 Hz; Figures 1A, 1C, 1E). In contrast, male mouse TIDA neurons exhibit significantly faster oscillation frequencies (typically 0.45 Hz; Figures 1B, 1D, and 1E). Notably, male rat TIDA neurons are synchronized and oscillate at the same frequency across cells, slices, and animals, whereas male mouse TIDA neurons are not coordinated and occupy a wide spectrum of faster rhythms (Figures 1F–1H; Stagkourakis et al., 2018Stagkourakis S. Pérez C.T. Hellysaz A. Ammari R. Broberger C. Network oscillation rules imposed by species-specific electrical coupling.eLife. 2018; 7: e33144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The difference between male rat versus mouse TIDA neuron rhythms prompted the question of whether and how differences in oscillation frequency are reflected in TIDA output. We addressed this issue by using optogenetic stimulation to impose a range of electrical frequencies on TIDA neurons and recorded the resultant dopamine concentrations at the release site in the median eminence (ME) by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV; Figure 2A). Stimulation of axon terminals rather than cell somata was performed because of concerns that the axonal connection may be lost during preparation of the mediobasal hypothalamus slice due to the complex three-dimensional nature of the dmArc and its projections (Voloschin et al., 1998Voloschin L.M. Gallardo M.G.P. Tramezzani J.H. Suckling-induced serum prolactin levels are modified by interference with milk ejection in lactating rats.Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Dopamine Transporter (DAT)-Cre mice were injected with Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in the dmArc (Figure 2B), and frequencies spanning 0.1–0.8 Hz were applied. Optogenetic stimulation yielded dose-dependent patterns of dopamine release patterns in the ME. Notably, 0.2 Hz (“rat-like”) and 0.4 Hz (“mouse-like”) stimulation resulted in distinct dopamine release patterns in the ME. When 0.2-Hz stimulation was applied, the dopamine signal in the ME peaked quickly and remained high until light stimulation was terminated (Figures 2C and 2D). In contrast, when the 0.4-Hz protocol was applied, [dopamine] rose with similar kinetics but decayed quickly after the initial peak (Figures 2E and 2F). Comparisons of different stimulation protocols revealed an inverted U-shaped frequency-response relationship peaking at 0.2 Hz (Figures 2G and 2H). The FSCV experiments suggest that the different electrophysiology patterns found in rat and mouse TIDA neurons lead to sustainable versus non-sustainable dopamine release, respectively, at the TIDA terminals. These findings, in conjunction with the inverse relationship between neuroendocrine dopamine and pituitary Prl, raise the possibility that rat and mouse males may have different serum Prl concentrations. To test whether this is the case, we collected tail blood samples in male rats and mice and quantified serum [Prl] by ELISA. Each sample was also tested for corticosterone (CORT; Figures 3A, 3B, and 3E ) because acute stress brought about by the sampling procedure can influence serum Prl levels (Neill, 1970Neill J.D. Effect of “stress” on serum prolactin and luteinizing hormone levels during the estrous cycle of the rat.Endocrinology. 1970; 87: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Seggie and Brown, 1975Seggie J.A. Brown G.M. Stress response patterns of plasma corticosterone, prolactin, and growth hormone in the rat, following handling or exposure to novel environment.Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1975; 53: 629-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although rare (n = 5 of 45), samples with [CORT] exceeding 300 × 10−3 mg/kg were excluded from serum Prl measurements and further analysis. Standard curves using standardized ELISA protocols for CORT and Prl were used to calculate the absolute levels of these hormones in the serum (Figures 3A and 3C). Rat serum [Prl] was 0.3889 ± 0.0129 × 10−3 mg/kg in the virgin male and 0.4150 ± 0.0121 × 10−3 mg/kg in the sire (Figures 3D and 3E). In contrast, serum [Prl] in the male mouse was found to be severalfold higher than in the rat (1.784 ± 0.1136 × 10−3 mg/kg in virgins and 1.8120 ± 0.1121 × 10−3 mg/kg in sires). Importantly, serum [Prl] did not differ between physiological states in the rat or mouse, with virgins and sires having comparable serum Prl concentrations (Figures 3D and 3E). Having established a difference in serum Prl in rats and mice, we next addressed whether this discrepancy is reflected in the degree of Prl signaling in the brain. We focused on the medial preoptic area (MPOA; Figure 4A), a region that has been strongly implicated in regulation of parental behavior (Lee and Brown, 2007Lee A.W. Brown R.E.

Medial preoptic area and onset of maternal behavior in the rat.J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1977; 91: 146-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the Prl-R in the MPOA in lactating dams is necessary for the expression of maternal behavior and survival of the offspring (Brown et al., 2017Brown R.S.E. Aoki M. Ladyman S.R. Phillipps H.R. Wyatt A. Boehm U. Grattan D.R. Prolactin action in the medial preoptic area is necessary for postpartum maternal nursing behavior.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: 10779-10784Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) is a key downstream step of Prl-R activation and provides a reliable readout of Prl signal transduction (Gouilleux et al., 1994Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B.

In the male virgin rat, only occasional pSTAT5-immunoreactive cells were observed in the MPOA (Figures 4B, 4D, and 4E), whereas there was intense staining for this activity marker in the male virgin mouse MPOA (Figures 4C–4E), suggesting baseline activation of a key nucleus for organization of parental behavior in the murine brain. We next explored whether MPOA neurons can be stimulated directly by Prl. Recent work has revealed that activation of MPOA neurons that express the neuropeptide galanin (Gal+) can drive parental behavior (Wu et al., 2014Wu Z. Autry A.E. Bergan J.F. Watabe-Uchida M. Dulac C.G. Galanin neurons in the medial preoptic area govern parental behaviour.Nature. 2014; 509: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar; Kohl et al., 2018Kohl J. Babayan B.M.

Functional circuit architecture underlying parental behaviour.Nature. 2018; 556: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a finding that was confirmed in the male mouse in the present study (Figures S1A–S1H). To determine the effect of Prl on this parentally implicated MPOA subpopulation, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings using Gal-tdTomato adult male virgin mice (Figure 4F). Application of Prl evoked a reversible depolarization in 11 of 13 recorded MPOA Gal+ neurons, paralleled by induction of action potential firing (Figure 4G). Increased intrinsic excitability was evident in the presence of Prl as augmented firing frequency in response to depolarization (Figure 4H) as well as an increase in the input resistance of these cells (Figure 4I). Parallel to these excitatory actions, application of Prl resulted in presynaptic changes with an increase in spontaneous excitatory input (Figure 4J) and a decrease in spontaneous inhibitory input (Figure 4K), effects reconcilable with overall stimulation of MPOA Gal+ cells. Investigation of the Prl-induced current in MPOA Gal+ neurons by voltage-clamp ramps combined with pharmacological manipulation (Figures"

The entorhinal-cortex-hippocampus network plays a key role in the encoding, processing, and storing spatial information (O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971O’Keefe J. Dostrovsky J.

Dentate gyrus granule cells (GCs) form an integral part of this circuit (Scharfman, 2007Scharfman H.E. The dentate gyrus: A comprehensive guide to structure, function, and clinical implications..

Neural Circuits. 2014; 8: 107Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). They represent the most abundant neurons in the hippocampus, with ∼1 million in rodents and ∼10 million in humans. Furthermore, they provide the main synaptic connection between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal CA3 region. Finally, they are believed to be involved in several higher-order network computations, such as grid-to-place code conversion, pattern separation, and storage of engrams (de Almeida et al., 2009bde Almeida L.

Thus, it is widely assumed that GCs play a critical role in spatial information processing. A hallmark property of GCs is that they fire more sparsely than any other neuron type in the hippocampus (Alme et al., 2010Alme C.B. Buzzetti R.A. Marrone D.F. Leutgeb J.K. Chawla M.K. Schaner M.J.

Within the population of active GCs in the dentate gyrus, only a minor subset shows spatially tuned firing (Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017Senzai Y. Buzsáki G.

In contrast, within the CA1 pyramidal cell population, a major fraction shows spatially tuned activity (Thompson and Best, 1989Thompson L.T. Best P.J.

Lin B.J. Lee A.K. Hippocampal place fields emerge upon single-cell manipulation of excitability during behavior.Science. 2012; 337: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Why only a small subset of GCs fires APs in a spatially tuned manner is unclear. Although early studies suggested that GCs show multiple place fields (Jung and McNaughton, 1993Jung M.W. McNaughton B.L. Spatial selectivity of unit activity in the hippocampal granular layer.Hippocampus. 1993; 3: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), recent work indicated that GCs often exhibit a single place field (Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017Senzai Y.

The dentate gyrus: A comprehensive guide to structure, function, and clinical implications.. Elsevier Science, 2007Google Scholar). How GCs integrate these diverse synaptic inputs to form a unified place field remains to be determined. Based on their unique connectivity, it is widely assumed that GCs play a critical role in grid-to-place code conversion (de Almeida et al., 2009bde Almeida L. Idiart M. Lisman J.E. The input-output transformation of the hippocampal granule cells: from grid cells to place fields.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7504-7512Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, experimental work suggested that place and grid activity can be dissociated under various conditions, for example, during development (Langston et al., 2010Langston R.F. Ainge J.A. Couey J.J. Canto C.B. Bjerknes T.L. Witter M.P. Moser E.I. Moser M.B.

Development of the hippocampal cognitive map in preweanling rats.Science. 2010; 328: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and after septal lesions (Brandon et al., 2011Brandon M.P. Bogaard A.R. Libby C.P. Connerney M.A. Gupta K. Hasselmo M.E. Reduction of theta rhythm dissociates grid cell spatial periodicity from directional tuning.Science. 2011; 332: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar; Koenig et al., 2011Koenig J. Linder A.N. Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. The spatial periodicity of grid cells is not sustained during reduced theta oscillations.Science. 2011; 332: 592-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Thus, whether GCs receive place- or grid-tuned synaptic input remains to be determined. Theoretical studies supported the hypothesis that GCs participate in grid-to-place code conversion (de Almeida et al., 2009bde Almeida L. Idiart M. Lisman J.E.

USA. 2015; 112: 4116-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, established models of grid-to-place code transformation rely on various mechanisms, including competitive Hebbian synaptic plasticity (Rolls et al., 2006Rolls E.T. Stringer S.M. Elliot T. Entorhinal cortex grid cells can map to hippocampal place cells by competitive learning.Network. 2006; 17: 447-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), superposition of grid input with different spatial frequencies (Solstad et al., 2006Solstad T.

USA. 2015; 112: 4116-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and network competition via a winner-takes-all mechanism (de Almeida et al., 2009bde Almeida L. Idiart M. Lisman J.E. The input-output transformation of the hippocampal granule cells: from grid cells to place fields.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7504-7512Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Whether any of these mechanisms contributes to grid-to-place code conversion remains to be tested. To experimentally address these questions, we performed intracellular, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from morphologically identified GCs in awake mice during spatial navigation. This approach allowed us to study subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) input, suprathreshold AP output, and mechanisms of input-output conversion in GCs at the single-cell level. Our results showed that a major fraction of GCs receive spatially tuned input, but only a minority is selected to convey spatial information to the output. Furthermore, intrinsic excitability of GCs gates the flow of spatial information at the single-cell level. Previous studies using extracellular recording and Ca2+ imaging reported a range of activity rates in hippocampal GCs (Jung and McNaughton, 1993Jung M.W. McNaughton B.L.

Frey M. Berens P. Preston-Ferrer P. Burgalossi A. Sparse activity of identified dentate granule cells during spatial exploration.eLife. 2016; 5: e20252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain ground-truth data on the activity of GCs during spatial navigation, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in head-fixed running mice (Figure 1A; Royer et al., 2012Royer S. Zemelman B.V. Losonczy A. Kim J. Chance F. Magee J.C. Buzsáki G. Control of timing, rate and bursts of hippocampal place cells by dendritic and somatic inhibition.Nat.

Conjunctive input processing drives feature selectivity in hippocampal CA1 neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To achieve rigorous GC identification, cells were filled with biocytin during recording and scrutinized by post hoc morphological analysis. In total, we recorded from 73 morphologically identified GCs in the dorsal hippocampus. Somata of recorded GCs were located in both upper and lower blades and distributed over the entire inner-outer GC layer axis (Figure 1B). In 46 GCs, it was possible to fully reconstruct soma and dendrites and to perform a detailed morphometric analysis (Figures 1C and 1D; Tables S1–S3). To characterize the activity of GCs, we first analyzed the spiking of the neurons during the entire recording time. 53% (39/73) of identified GCs were active, generating APs during the 5–30 min recording period (Figures 1C and 1F; Table S4). In contrast, 47% (34/73) of cells were silent during the recording period (Figures 1D and 1F). In agreement with previous observations (Diamantaki et al., 2016aDiamantaki M. Frey M. Berens P. Preston-Ferrer P. Burgalossi A. Sparse activity of identified dentate granule cells during spatial exploration.eLife. 2016; 5: e20252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), active GCs had more complex dendritic trees than silent cells. In particular, active GCs showed a significantly larger maximum dendritic branch order (6 versus 5, n = 26/20, p = 0.0004; Mann-Whitney U test) and a significantly larger number of higher-order branches (12 versus 10, n = 26/20, p = 0.016) than silent GCs (Figure 1E). In the population of active neurons, the AP frequency varied over a wide range (median ± SEM: 0.031 ± 0.096 Hz; coefficient of variation 3.59; Figure 1G), consistent with a log-normal distribution of activity (Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014Buzsáki G. Mizuseki K. The log-dynamic brain: how skewed distributions affect network operations.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 264-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the low AP frequency and the high variability of firing in the GC population arose from our recording conditions, we performed interleaved control experiments in CA1 pyramidal neurons (O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971O’Keefe J.

Conjunctive input processing drives feature selectivity in hippocampal CA1 neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). All 17 CA1 pyramidal neurons were active under our experimental conditions. In comparison to GCs, the mean AP frequency was higher, but the variability was less pronounced (median ± SEM: 2.56 ± 0.52 Hz; coefficient of variation 0.78; Table S4). Thus, both mean activity and variability differed between GCs and CA1 pyramidal neurons. To investigate whether the firing of GCs showed dependence on the network state, we compared the AP frequency between theta and nontheta periods and between running and immobile epochs, and we quantified the phase relation of APs to theta and gamma cycles of the local field potential (LFP) recorded in the molecular layer. The average AP frequency was not significantly different between theta and nontheta periods (p = 0.31; Wilcoxon signed rank test; Figure 1H). Likewise, the mean AP frequency was similar in running and immobile periods (p = 0.09; Figure 1H). However, APs preferentially occurred in the descending phase of theta oscillations and slightly before the peak of gamma oscillations (p < 0.001; Rayleigh test; Figure 1I), consistent with previous observations (Senzai and Buzsáki, 2017Senzai Y. Buzsáki G. Physiological properties and behavioral correlates of hippocampal granule cells and mossy cells.Neuron. 2017; 93: 691-704.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results suggest that a major fraction of GCs is active but that activity is sparse, heterogeneous, and phase locked to rhythmic network activity. To characterize the spatial coding properties of GCs, we next analyzed their activity during running periods (Figure 2). First, we examined whether active GCs showed AP place fields under our experimental conditions. GCs were considered spatially tuned when the spatial information score of the original data was significantly larger than that of surrogate datasets in which the interspike intervals (ISIs) were shuffled and when the score exceeded a threshold of 0.4 bit s−1 (STAR Methods). Using these criteria, 9.7% (3/31) of active GCs (59 GCs total; p < 0.05; Figures 2A, 2D, 2G, and 2M) showed a clear place field. To exclude the possibility that the low proportion of place cells in the GC population was influenced by the simplified nature of the recording system, we performed interleaved control experiments in CA1 pyramidal neurons (O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971O’Keefe J.

https://openalex.org/W3047037639,"Duality of roaming mechanism in H 2 CO The phenomenon of roaming in chemical reactions (that is, bypassing the minimum energy pathway from unlikely geometries) has attracted a great deal of attention in the chemical reaction dynamics community over the past decade and still demonstrates unexpected results. Using velocity-map imaging of state-selected H 2 products of H 2 CO photodissociation, Quinn et al. discovered the bimodal structure of rotational distribution of the other product fragment, CO. Quasiclassical trajectories showed that this bimodality originates from two distinctive reaction pathways that proceed by the trans or cis configuration of O–C–H⋯H, leading to high or low rotational excitations of CO, respectively. Whether such a mechanism is present in the many other chemical reactions for which roaming reaction pathways have been reported is yet to be determined. Science , this issue p. 1592"
https://openalex.org/W3047527803,"Dementia is one of the most pressing health care issues of this century. As no curative treatment for dementia exists, research efforts are growing to identify effective lifestyle interventions to prevent or delay onset. One such promising strategy that promotes cognitive and brain health is engaging in physical exercise. However, current exercise recommendations are imprecise. To advance the potential of exercise as a preventative and treatment strategy, important questions regarding moderators (ie, biological sex and age) are being addressed in the literature. Biological sex is recognized as an important variable to consider in exercise efficacy on brain health, with females showing greater cognitive gains. This may be related to sex differences in underlying mechanisms. Here, we argue to better understand the sex differences in exercise efficacy, the timing of exercise intervention should also be considered. Specifically, we present the hypothesis that midlife in females is a critical window for the implementation of exercise as an early intervention to promote brain health and prevent dementia. Further, we speculate that exercise interventions targeting midlife will be of critical importance for the female brain, as females exit this period of the lifespan at greater risk for cognitive impairment. Given the potential sex differences in dementia risk and prevalence, it is imperative to assess potential sex differences in exercise efficacy as an early intervention during midlife."
https://openalex.org/W3048127232,"Programmed cell death promotes homeostatic cell turnover in the epithelium but is dysregulated in cancer. The glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I is known to block homeostatic apoptosis through α2,6-linked sialylation of the death receptor TNFR1 in many cell types. However, its role has not been investigated in gastric epithelial cells or gastric tumorigenesis. We determined that human gastric antral epithelium rarely expressed ST6Gal-I, but the number of ST6Gal-I–expressing epithelial cells increased significantly with advancing premalignancy leading to cancer. The mRNA expression levels of ST6GAL-I and SOX9 in human gastric epithelial cells correlated positively with one another through the premalignancy cascade, indicating that increased epithelial cell expression of ST6Gal-I is associated with premalignant progression. To determine the functional impact of increased ST6Gal-I, we generated human gastric antral organoids from epithelial stem cells and differentiated epithelial monolayers from gastric organoids. Gastric epithelial stem cells strongly expressed ST6Gal-I, suggesting a novel biomarker of stemness. In contrast, organoid-derived epithelial monolayers expressed markedly reduced ST6Gal-I and underwent TNF-induced, caspase-mediated apoptosis, consistent with homeostasis. Conversely, epithelial monolayers generated from gastric cancer stem cells retained high levels of ST6Gal-I and resisted TNF-induced apoptosis, supporting prolonged survival. Protection from TNF-induced apoptosis depended on ST6Gal-I overexpression, because forced ST6Gal-I overexpression in normal gastric stem cell–differentiated monolayers inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis, and cleavage of α2,6-linked sialic acids from gastric cancer organoid-derived monolayers restored susceptibility to TNF-induced apoptosis. These findings implicate up-regulated ST6Gal-I expression in blocking homeostatic epithelial cell apoptosis in gastric cancer pathogenesis, suggesting a mechanism for prolonged epithelioid tumor cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W3047865660,"We analyzed COVID-19 data through May 6th, 2020 using a partially observed Markov process. Our method uses a hybrid deterministic and stochastic formalism that allows for time variable transmission rates and detection probabilities. The model was fit using iterated particle filtering to case count and death count time series from 55 countries. We found evidence for a shrinking epidemic in 30 of the 55 examined countries. Of those 30 countries, 27 have significant evidence for subcritical transmission rates, although the decline in new cases is relatively slow compared to the initial growth rates. Generally, the transmission rates in Europe were lower than in the Americas and Asia. This suggests that global scale social distancing efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 are effective although they need to be strengthened in many regions and maintained in others to avoid further resurgence of COVID-19. The slow decline also suggests alternative strategies to control the virus are needed before social distancing efforts are partially relaxed."
https://openalex.org/W3048259639,"Spent mushroom substrate is made from the waste remaining after the harvest of mushrooms. Here, we evaluated the potential of five spent edible fungi (Auricularia cornea, Lentinus edodes, Pleurotus eryngii, P. citrinopileatus and P. ostreatus) substrates as feed sources for Tenebrio molitor larvae. Young larvae did not survive on any substrate except the spent L. edodes substrate (36.7%). The survival rates in young larvae were similar among the different diets in which wheat bran or rice bran was replaced with 0, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60% spent L. edodes substrate. The weights of the surviving larvae were decreased only when 70% of wheat bran and > 40% of rice bran was replaced with spent L. edodes substrate. In addition, the middle-aged larvae fed wheat bran only were significantly larger than those fed diets with 30~60% spent L. edodes substrate in dry feed, but the larvae of all treatments failed to pupate. Whereas the green feed was added in dry feed, there were no significant differences in pupal weight, pupation rate, pupal duration, adult emergence, or deformed adults among the three treatments in middle-aged larvae that were fed on diets containing 0, 30, or 40% spent L. edodes substrate. Collectively, these results suggest that spent L. edodes substrate has considerable potential to be used as a partial replacement (< 40%) of conventional feed for T. molitor, and spent mushroom substrate waste may be recycled as feed material for resource insects."
https://openalex.org/W3048331052,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has the highest prevalence in head and neck cancers and is the first and second most common cancer in males and females of Pakistan respectively. Major risk factors include peculiar chewing habits like areca nut, betel quid, and tobacco. The majority of OSCC presents at an advanced stage with poor prognosis. On the face of such a high burden of this preventable cancer, there is a relative lack of recent robust data and its association with known risk factors from Pakistan. The aim of this study was to identify the socioeconomic factors and clinicopathological features that may contribute to the development of OSCC. A total of 186 patients diagnosed and treated at a tertiary care hospital, Karachi Pakistan were recruited. Clinicopathological and socioeconomic information was obtained on a structured questionnaire. Descriptive analysis was done for demographics and socioeconomic status (SES) while regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between SES and chewing habits, tumor site, and tumor stage. The majority of patients were males and the mean age of OSCC patients was 47.62±12.18 years. Most of the patients belonged to low SES (68.3%) and 77.4% were habitual of chewing. Gender (male) and SES were significantly associated with chewing habits (p<0.05). Odds of developing buccal mucosa tumors in chewers (of any type of substance) and gutka users were 2 and 4 times higher than non-chewers respectively. Middle age, chewing habits, and occupation were significantly associated with late stage presentation of OSCC (p<0.05). In conclusion, male patients belonging to low SES in their forties who had chewing habits for years constituted the bulk of OSCC. Buccal mucosa was the most common site in chewers and the majority presented with late stage tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3047955993,"Purpose Cobalt exposure is known to cause adverse effects on health. A major use of cobalt is in the manufacture of hard metal. Exposure can lead to asthma, hard metal lung disease, contact allergy and increased risk of cancer. Cobalt is mainly absorbed from the pulmonary tract, however penetration through skin may occur. The relationships between exposure to inhalable cobalt in air and on skin and the uptake in blood and urine will be investigated, as well as the association between dermal symptoms and dermal exposure. Methods Cobalt exposure in 71 workers in hard metal production facilities was measured as inhalable cobalt in the breathing zone and cobalt found on skin with acid wash. Uptake of cobalt was determined with concentrations in blood and urine. Correlations between exposure and uptake were analysed. Results Inhalable cobalt in air and cobalt in blood and urine showed rank correlations with coefficients 0.40 and 0.25. Cobalt on skin and uptake in blood and urine presented correlation coefficients of 0.36 and 0.17. Multiple linear regression of cobalt in air and on skin with cobalt in blood showed regression coefficients with cobalt in blood (β = 203 p < 0.0010, and β = 0.010, p = 0.0040) and with cobalt in urine (β = 5779, p = 0.0010, and β = 0.10, p = 0.60). Conclusions Our data presents statistically significant correlations between exposure to cobalt in air with uptake of cobalt in blood and urine. Cobalt on skin was statistically significant with cobalt in blood but not with urine."
https://openalex.org/W3047550066,"Influenza is an infectious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. Despite yearly updates, the efficacy of influenza vaccines is significantly curtailed by the virus antigenic drift and antigenic shift. These constant changes to the influenza virus make-up also challenge the development of a universal flu vaccine, which requires conserved antigenic regions shared by influenza viruses of different subtypes. We propose that it is possible to bypass these challenges by the development of an influenza vaccine based on conserved proteins delivered in an adjuvanted nanoparticle system. In this study, we generated influenza nanoparticle constructs using trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (TMC nPs) as the carrier of recombinant influenza hemagglutinin subunit 2 (HA2) and nucleoprotein (NP). The purified HA2 and NP recombinant proteins were encapsulated into TMC nPs to form HA2-TMC nPs and NP-TMC nPs, respectively. Primary human intranasal epithelium cells (HNEpCs) were used as an in vitro model to measure immunity responses. HA2-TMC nPs, NP-TMC nPs, and HA2-NP-TMC nPs (influenza nanoparticle constructs) showed no toxicity in HNEpCs. The loading efficiency of HA2 and NP into the TMC nPs was 97.9% and 98.5%, respectively. HA2-TMC nPs and NP-TMC nPs more efficiently delivered HA2 and NP proteins to HNEpCs than soluble HA2 and NP proteins alone. The induction of various cytokines and chemokines was more evident in influenza nanoparticle construct-treated HNEpCs than in soluble protein-treated HNEpCs. In addition, soluble factors secreted by influenza nanoparticle construct-treated HNEpCs significantly induced MoDCs maturation markers (CD80, CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR), as compared to soluble factors secreted by protein-treated HNEpCs. HNEpCs treated with the influenza nanoparticle constructs significantly reduced influenza virus replication in an in vitro challenge assay. The results indicate that TMC nPs can be used as influenza vaccine adjuvants and carriers capable of delivering HA2 and NP proteins to HNEpCs."
https://openalex.org/W3047943397,"Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion and deletion are responsible for over 40 neurodegenerative diseases and associated with cancer. TNRs can undergo somatic instability that is mediated by DNA damage and repair and gene transcription. Recent studies have pointed toward a role for R-loops in causing TNR expansion and deletion, and it has been shown that base excision repair (BER) can result in CAG repeat deletion from R-loops in yeast. However, it remains unknown how BER in R-loops can mediate TNR instability. In this study, using biochemical approaches, we examined BER enzymatic activities and their influence on TNR R-loops. We found that AP endonuclease 1 incised an abasic site on the nontemplate strand of a TNR R-loop, creating a double-flap intermediate containing an RNA:DNA hybrid that subsequently inhibited polymerase β (pol β) synthesis of TNRs. This stimulated flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) cleavage of TNRs engaged in an R-loop. Moreover, we showed that FEN1 also efficiently cleaved the RNA strand, facilitating pol β loop/hairpin bypass synthesis and the resolution of TNR R-loops through BER. Consequently, this resulted in fewer TNRs synthesized by pol β than those removed by FEN1, thereby leading to repeat deletion. Our results indicate that TNR R-loops preferentially lead to repeat deletion during BER by disrupting the balance between the addition and removal of TNRs. Our discoveries open a new avenue for the treatment and prevention of repeat expansion diseases and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3048078421,"Maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy induces a cytokine storm that alters neurodevelopment and behavior in the progeny. In humans, MIA increases the odds of developing neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In mice, MIA can be induced by injecting the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) to pregnant dams. Although the murine model of MIA has been extensively studied, it is not clear whether MIA results in cytokine changes in the progeny at early postnatal stages. Further, the murine model of MIA suffers from a lack of reproducibility and high inter-individual variability. Multivariable (MV) statistical analysis is widely used in human studies to control for confounders and covariates such as sex, age and exposure to environmental factors. We therefore reasoned that animal studies in general and studies on the MIA model in particular could benefit from MV analyses to account for complex phenotype interactions and high inter-individual variability. Here, we used MV statistical analysis to identify cytokines associated with MIA after adjustment for covariates. Besides confirming the association between previously described variables and MIA, we identified new cytokines that could play a role in behavioural alterations in the progeny during the early postnatal period."
https://openalex.org/W3048281872,"To identify current maternal and infant predictors of infant mortality, including maternal sociodemographic and economic status, maternal perinatal smoking and obesity, mode of delivery, and infant birthweight and gestational age.This retrospective study analyzed data from the linked birth and infant death files (birth cohort) and live births from the Birth Statistical Master files (BSMF) in California compiled by the California Department of Public Health for 2007-2015. The birth cohort study comprised 4,503,197 singleton births including 19,301 infant deaths during the nine-year study period. A subpopulation to study fetal growth consisted of 4,448,300 birth cohort records including 13,891 infant deaths.The infant mortality rate (IMR) for singleton births decreased linearly (p <0.001) from 4.68 in 2007 to 3.90 (per 1,000 live births) in 2015. However, significant disparities in IMR were uncovered in different population groups depending upon maternal sociodemographic and economic characteristics and maternal characteristics during pregnancy. Children of African American women had almost twice the risk of infant mortality when compared with children of White women (AOR 2.12; 95% CI, 1.98-2.27; p<0.001). Infants of women with Bachelor's degrees or higher were 89% less likely to die (AOR 1.89; 95% CI, 1.76-2.04; p<0.001) when compared to infants of women with education less than high school. Infants of maternal smokers were 75% more likely to die (AOR 1.75; 95% CI, 1.58-1.93; p<0.001) than infants of nonsmokers. Infants of women who were overweight and obese during pregnancy accounted for 55% of IMR over all women in the study. More than half of the infant deaths were to children of women with lower socioeconomic status; infants of WIC participants were 59% more likely to die (AOR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.52-1.67; p<0.001) than infants of non-WIC participants. With respect to infant predictors, infants born with LBW or PTB were more than six times (AOR 6.29; 95% CI, 5.90-6.70; p<0.001) and almost four times (AOR 3.95; 95% CI, 3.73-4.19; p<0.001) more likely to die than infants who had normal births, respectively. SGA and LGA infants were more than two times (AOR 2.03; 95% CI, 1.92-2.15; p<0.001) and 41% (AOR 1.41; 95% CI, 1.32-1.52; p<0.001) more likely to die than AGA infants, respectively.While the overall IMR in California is declining, wide disparities in death rates persist in different groups, and these disparities are increasing. Our data indicate that maternal sociodemographic and economic factors, as well as maternal prepregnancy obesity and smoking during pregnancy, have a prominent effect on IMR though no causality can be inferred with the current data. These predictors are not typically addressed by direct medical care. Infant factors with a major effect on IMR are birthweight and gestational age-predictors that are addressed by active medical services. The highest value interventions to reduce IMR may be social and public health initiatives that mitigate disparities in sociodemographic, economic and behavioral risks for mothers."
https://openalex.org/W3048331953,"Listeria monocytogenes is the etiological agent of listeriosis, a major foodborne disease and an important public health concern. Contamination of meat with L. monocytogenes occurs frequently at the slaughterhouse. Our aims were; 1) to investigate the distribution of L. monocytogenes in the processing areas of four swine slaughterhouses; 2) to describe the diversity of L. monocytogenes strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis; 3) to identify persistent L. monocytogenes strains and describe their distribution; 4) to investigate the associations between persistence of strains and their following characteristics: detection in food isolates, detection in human clinical isolates, and the presence of benzalkonium chloride (BAC) resistance genes. Various operation areas within the four swine slaughterhouses were sampled on four occasions. A total of 2496 samples were analyzed, and L. monocytogenes was successfully isolated from 243 samples. The proportion of positive samples ranged from 32 to 58% in each slaughterhouse and from 24 to 68% in each operation area. Fifty-eight different pulsotypes were identified and eight pulsotypes, present in samples collected during 4 visits, were considered persistent. The persistent pulsotypes were significantly more likely to be detected in food (P < 0.01, exact χ²) and human clinical cases (P < 0.01, exact χ²), respectively. Among pulsotypes harboring the BAC bcrABC resistance cassette or the emrE multidrug transporter gene, 42.8% were persistent compared to 4.5% for pulsotypes without these resistance genes (P < 0.01, exact χ²). Our study highlights the importance of persistent L. monocytogenes strains in the environmental contamination of slaughterhouses, which may lead to repeated contamination of meat products. It also shows that the presence of disinfectants resistance genes is an important contributing factor."
https://openalex.org/W3047115727,"The factors that influence the diversity and composition of raw milk and fecal microbiota in healthy commercial dairy herds are not fully understood, partially because the majority of metataxonomic studies involve experimental farms and/or single factors. We analyzed the raw milk and fecal microbiota of 100 healthy cows from 10 commercial alpine farms from the Province of Trento, Italy, using metataxonomics and applied statistical modelling to investigate which extrinsic and intrinsic parameters (e.g. herd, diet and milk characteristics) correlated with microbiota richness and composition in these relatively small traditional farms. We confirmed that Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families dominated the fecal and milk samples of these dairy cows, but in addition, we found an association between the number of observed OTUs and Shannon entropy on each farm that indicates higher microbiota richness is associated with increased microbiota stability. Modelling showed that herd was the most significant factor affecting the variation in both milk and fecal microbiota composition. Furthermore, the most important predictors explaining the variation of microbiota richness were milk characteristics (i.e. percentage fat) and diet for milk and fecal samples, respectively. We discuss how high intra-herd variation could affect the development of treatments based on microbiota manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W3047530815,"Understanding the dynamics of microphytobenthos biomass and photosynthetic performances in intertidal ecosystems will help advance our understanding of how trophic networks function in order to optimize ecological management and restoration projects. The main objective of this study was to investigate microphytobenthic biomass and photosynthetic performances as a function of the sedimentary and environmental variabilities in the range of intertidal habitats in the downstream Seine estuary (Normandy, France). Our results highlight higher biomass associated with more stratified biofilms and better photosynthetic performances in areas characterized by a sand/mud mixture (40–60% of mud) compared to pure sand or pure mud environments. This type of sediment probably offers an efficient trade-off between the favorable characteristics of the two types of sediments (sand and mud) with respect to light penetration and nutrient accessibility. Moreover, the large quantities of exopolysaccharides produced in sand/mud mixtures emphasizes the functional role played by microphytobenthos in promoting sediment stability against erosion. This allows us to show that despite the strong increase in sand content of the downstream Seine estuary, intertidal flats are still productive since microphytobenthic biomass, photosynthetic performances and exopolysaccharides secretion are highest in sand-mud mixtures. This study also underlines the impact of ecosystem modifications due to human disturbance and climate change on the dynamics of key primary producers in estuaries."

For C, N, and P analysis from leaves, stems, roots, and soil to explore their stoichiometric ratio and deriving environmental forces, four dominant plant communities (Vallisneria natans, Zizania latifolia, Trapa natans and Carex schmidtii) were collected. The concentration of C, N, P and C: N: P ratio in leaves, stems, roots, and soil among the plant communities varied significantly. Along the depth gradient high C: N was measured in C.schmidtii soil (7.08±1.504) but not vary significantly (P >0.05). High C: P result was found in T.natans (81.14±43.88) and in V.natans soil (81.40±42.57) respectively with no significant difference (p>0.05). Besides, N: P ratio measured high in V. natans (13.7±4.05) and showed significant variation (P<0.05). High leaf C: N and N: P ratio was measured in C. schmidtii and V. natans respectively. Nevertheless, high leaf C: P ratio was measured in Z. latifolia. From the three studied organs, leaf C: N and N: P ratio showed high values compared to root and stems. The correlation analysis result showed that at 0-10cm depth soil organic carbon (SOC) correlated negatively with stem total phosphorus (STP), and root total nitrogen (RTN) (P<0.05) but positively strongly with leaf total phosphorus (LTP) and leaf total nitrogen (LTN) (P<0.01) respectively. Soil total nitrogen (STN) at 0-10cm strongly positively correlated with leaf total phosphorus (LTP) (P<0.01) and positively with RN: P and leaf total carbon (LTC) (P<0.05). Soil basic properties such as soil moisture content (SMC), bulky density (BD) and pH positively correlated with soil ecological stoichiometric characteristics. Redundancy analysis (RDA) result showed available nitrogen (AN), soil total nitrogen (STN), and available phosphorus (AP) were the potential determinants variables on plants stoichiometric characteristics."

To explore this question, we first demonstrated that YAP1-2γ cannot bind SHP2. Nevertheless, YAP1-2γ exhibits stronger mitogenic and motogenic activities than does YAP1-2α because the YAP1-2α–mediated delivery of SHP2 to the nucleus weakens cytoplasmic RAS–ERK signaling.

YAP1 (yes-associated protein 1, and its paralog TAZ) is a transcriptional co-activator that interacts with a number of sequence-specific transcription factors, most notably TEADs, and thereby transactivates downstream target genes, which stimulates cell proliferation while preventing cell death (1Zhao B.

The Hippo pathway contains two core serine/threonine kinases: MST and LATS. When the Hippo signal is off, nonphosphorylated YAP1 enters the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional co-activator by binding with TEADs (4Ota M. Sasaki H.

Conversely, inclusion of exon 6 results in the generation of γ isoforms, which do not possess a leucine zipper because of insertion of the γ segment. Additionally, an alternative splice donor site in intron 5 makes a variant exon 5 transcript encoding a 4-amino acid (VRPQ) extension, which also disrupts the leucine zipper heptad repeats. Thus, variant exon 5 generates β and δ isoforms in the absence and presence of exon 6, respectively (Fig. 1A) (8Gaffney C.J. Oka T. Mazack V. Hilman D. Gat U. Muramatsu T. Inazawa J. Golden A.

YAP isoforms containing two WW domains exhibit stronger co-activator activity than do those having a single WW domain (10Komuro A. Nagai M. Navin N.E. Sudol M.

Conversely, YAP1 isoforms lacking the canonical leucine zipper exhibit a dramatically reduced co-activator function (11Finch-Edmondson M.L. Strauss R.P. Clayton J.S. Yeoh G.C. Callus B.A. Splice variant insertions in the C-terminus impairs YAP's transactivation domain.Biochem. Biophys. Rep. 2016; 6 (28018981): 24-3110.1016/j.bbrep.2016.02.015PubMed Google Scholar). Of these YAP1 isoforms, YAP1-2α and YAP1-2γ are two well-studied YAP1 splicing isoforms that correspond to the shorter and longer forms of Yap1 (mouse ortholog of human YAP1), respectively (10Komuro A. Nagai M. Navin N.E. Sudol M.

In contrast to YAP1, there has been no report showing the presence of multiple splicing isoforms of human TAZ. SHP2, encoded by the PTPN11 gene, is a ubiquitously expressed non–receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase. Gain-of-function mutations in PTPN11 have been found in a variety of sporadic human malignancies (13Liu X. Qu C.K. Protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (PTPN11) in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.J. Signal Transduct. 2011; 2011 (21799948): 19523910.1155/2011/195239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deregulation of SHP2 by the Helicobacter pylori CagA oncoprotein also plays an important role in the development of gastric cancer (14Hatakeyama M. Helicobacter pylori CagA and gastric cancer: a paradigm for hit-and-run carcinogenesis.Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 15 (24629337): 306-31610.1016/j.chom.2014.02.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, SHP2 is regarded as a pro-oncogenic phosphatase. In the cytoplasm, SHP2 potentiates the magnitude of RAS–ERK signaling (15Chan G. Kalaitzidis D. Neel B.G. The tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 (PTPN11) in cancer.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27 (18286234): 179-19210.1007/s10555-008-9126-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 16Dance M. Montagner A.

Heynen G.J. Ciecielski K.J. Ai J. Berninger A. Kabacaoglu D. Görgülü K. Dantes Z. Wörmann S.M. Diakopoulos K.N. Karpathaki A.F. Kowalska M. Kaya-Aksoy E. Song L. van der Laan E.A.Z. et al.Mutant KRAS-driven cancers depend on PTPN11/SHP2 phosphatase.Nat.

Like YAP1, SHP2 is specifically present in the cytoplasm at a high cell density but is abundantly distributed in the nucleus at a low cell density. The cell density–dependent subcellular localization of SHP2 is primarily regulated by the interaction of SHP2 with YAP1, in which YAP1 acts as a carrier and SHP2 serves as a cargo (18Tsutsumi R. Masoudi M. Takahashi A. Fujii Y. Hayashi T. Kikuchi I. Satou Y. Taira M. Hatakeyama M. YAP and TAZ, Hippo signaling targets, act as a rheostat for nuclear SHP2 function.Dev.

It was also shown that Shp2 (mouse ortholog of human SHP2) interacts with the shorter form of Yap1 (hereinafter referred to as “Yap1-2α”) but not with the longer form of Yap1 (hereinafter referred to as “Yap1-2γ”). Because these YAP1/Yap1 isoforms are generated by differential splicing, YAP1–SHP2 interaction is considered to be regulated by alternative splicing of YAP1 precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) (18Tsutsumi R. Masoudi M. Takahashi A. Fujii Y. Hayashi T. Kikuchi I. Satou Y. Taira M. Hatakeyama M. YAP and TAZ, Hippo signaling targets, act as a rheostat for nuclear SHP2 function.Dev.

In the present study, we focused on YAP1-2α and YAP1-2γ as representative isoforms that harbor an intact leucine zipper and a disrupted leucine zipper, respectively. Contrary to our expectations, cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic pro-oncogenic activities are reversed between the two YAP1 isoforms, caused by the difference in their SHP2-binding capacity. Furthermore, inclusion of exon 6 into YAP1 pre-mRNA is promoted by the SRSF3 (serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 3) splicing factor, the expression of which is suppressed by oncogenic KRAS. The results reveal a complicated interplay between differentially spliced YAP1 isoforms and SHP2 in the regulation of cell-autonomous and non–cell-autonomous YAP1 activities, perturbation of which contributes to the formation of a differential tumor microenvironment. To examine whether splicing variations of YAP1 affect SHP2-binding activity (18Tsutsumi R. Masoudi M. Takahashi A. Fujii Y. Hayashi T. Kikuchi I. Satou Y. Taira M. Hatakeyama M. YAP and TAZ, Hippo signaling targets, act as a rheostat for nuclear SHP2 function.Dev.

A co-immunoprecipitation experiment revealed that SHP2 associated most strongly with YAP1-2α and next-most strongly with YAP1-1α. YAP1-1β and 1-2β also bound SHP2 but much less efficiently. On the other hand, all of the γ and δ isoforms of YAP1, which contain the γ-segment, did not interact with SHP2 (Fig. 1B), indicating a critical role of the leucine zipper-based coiled-coil region in the YAP1–SHP2 interaction. Given that the 16-amino acid γ-segment is inserted into and thereby disrupts the leucine zipper motif in YAP1 (Fig. 1A) (8Gaffney C.J. Oka T. Mazack V. Hilman D. Gat U. Muramatsu T. Inazawa J. Golden A. Carey D.J. Farooq A. Tromp G. Sudol M. Identification, basic characterization and evolutionary analysis of differentially spliced mRNA isoforms of human YAP1 gene.Gene. 2012; 509 (22939869): 215-22210.1016/j.gene.2012.08.025Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the results suggested the importance of the leucine zipper in SHP2 binding. To test this idea, a leucine zipper mutant (LZM) of YAP1-2α (YAP1-2αLZM), in which five heptad repeats of leucines (Leu-311, Leu-318, Leu-325, Leu-332, and Leu-339) were all replaced by alanines, was expressed together with SHP2 in HEK293T cells. In contrast to YAP1-2α, YAP1-2αLZM failed to interact with SHP2 (Fig. 1C). A leucine zipper, which comprises a coiled-coil structure, interacts with another leucine zipper–mediated coiled-coil structure (19Alber T. Structure of the leucine zipper.Curr. Opin. Genet Dev. 1992; 2 (1638114): 205-21010.1016/S0959-437X(05)80275-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Because SHP2 does not possess a leucine zipper, YAP1 was unlikely to bind SHP2 directly through the leucine zipper. In this regard, the YAP homolog TAZ possesses a functional leucine zipper, which is involved in YAP1 binding (20Murakami M. Nakagawa M. Olson E.N. Nakagawa O. A WW domain protein TAZ is a critical coactivator for TBX5, a transcription factor implicated in Holt–Oram syndrome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102 (16332960): 18034-1803910.1073/pnas.0509109102Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To test whether YAP1–SHP2 interaction requires YAP1–TAZ heterodimerization, FLAG-tagged YAP1-2α was co-expressed with HA-tagged YAP1-2α, YAP1-2γ, or TAZ in HEK293T cells. Whereas YAP1-2α formed a complex with TAZ, no YAP1-2α homodimer or YAP1-2α–YAP1-2γ heterodimer was detected in the cells (Fig. 1D). Also, co-expression of YAP1-2α or YAP1-2αLZM and TAZ or a mutant TAZ (TAZLZM), in which four heptad repeats of leucines/isoleucines (Ile-240, Ile-247, Leu-254, and Leu-261) were all replaced by alanines, in HEK293T cells showed YAP1-2α–TAZ interaction but not YAP1-2αLZM-TAZ or YAP1-2α–TAZLZM interaction (Fig. 1E). Hence, YAP1-2α and TAZ underwent heterodimerization through their leucine zippers. Notably, YAP1-2β, made by insertion of the β-segment (VRPQ sequence) into the leucine zipper of YAP1-2α, markedly reduced the ability of YAP1 to interact with TAZ (Fig. 1F). The observation was also supported by the predicted structural model of leucine zipper–mediated YAP1–TAZ interactions (Fig. S1, A and B). Inhibition of endogenous TAZ expression in HEK293T cells by three distinct TAZ-specific shRNAs (#1, #2, and #3) abolished YAP1-2α–SHP2 complex formation (Fig. 1G and Fig. S1C). These results indicated that binding of YAP1 with SHP2 requires heterodimerization between YAP1 and TAZ. As previously reported, SHP2/Shp2 was localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm at a low cell density (6.25 × 103 cells/cm2), whereas it was excluded from the nucleus at a high cell density (6.25 × 104 cells/cm2) (18Tsutsumi R. Masoudi M. Takahashi A. Fujii Y. Hayashi T. Kikuchi I. Satou Y. Taira M. Hatakeyama M. YAP and TAZ, Hippo signaling targets, act as a rheostat for nuclear SHP2 function.Dev.

Because YAP1–SHP2 interaction was regulated by differential splicing of YAP1 pre-mRNA, nuclear translocalization of SHP2 was considered to be specifically mediated by YAP1 isoforms capable of binding with SHP2. To test this idea, constitutively active YAP1 mutants, YAP1-2αS127A and YAP1-2γS127A, both of which are localized to the nucleus independently of cell density (21Kim N.G. Koh E. Chen X. Gumbiner B.M. E-cadherin mediates contact inhibition of proliferation through Hippo signaling-pathway components.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U.S.A. 2011; 108 (21730131): 11930-1193510.1073/pnas.1103345108Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), were co-expressed in AGS human gastric cancer cells and in nontransformed NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts in a high–cell density condition. As a result, SHP2/Shp2 and YAP1-2αS127A were both localized in the nucleus (Fig. 1H, white arrows). On the other hand, SHP2/Shp2 was localized to the cytoplasm in cells expressing YAP1-2γS127A in the nucleus (Fig. 1H, yellow arrows). Accordingly, subcellular localization of SHP2 was determined by the SHP2-binding activity of the YAP1 isoforms. Both SHP2 and YAP1 are known to be pro-oncogenic, positively regulating cell proliferation, as well as cell motility (1Zhao B. Wei X. Li W. Udan R.S. Yang Q. Kim J. Xie J. Ikenoue T. Yu J. Li L. Zheng P. Ye K. Chinnaiyan A. Halder G. Lai Z.C. et al.Inactivation of YAP oncoprotein by the Hippo pathway is involved in cell contact inhibition and tissue growth control.Genes Dev. 2007; 21 (17974916): 2747-276110.1101/gad.1602907Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar, 15Chan G.

We therefore compared the pro-oncogenic potentials of YAP1-2α and YAP1-2γ. To this end, we established two independent YAP1-knockout cell clones from AGS cells (YAP1KO#1 and YAP1KO#2 AGS cells) using two distinct YAP1-sgRNAs (Fig. S2A). Whereas the level of SHP2 in AGS cells was not significantly changed by YAP1 knockout, TAZ expression was slightly elevated in YAP1KO cells as previously reported (Fig. S2B) (22Moroishi T. Park H.W. Qin B. Chen Q. Meng Z. Plouffe S.W. Taniguchi K. Yu F.X. Karin M. Pan D. Guan K.L. A YAP/TAZ-induced feedback mechanism regulates Hippo pathway homeostasis.Genes Dev. 2015; 29 (26109050): 1271-128410.1101/gad.262816.115Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). An expression vector for YAP1-2α or YAP1-2γ was then reintroduced into YAP1KO#1 or YAP1KO#2 AGS cells to establish AGS-derived stable transfectant clones that exclusively express one of the two YAP1 isoforms, referred to as YAP1KO#1/1-2α AGS and YAP1KO#1/1-2γ AGS cells (Fig. 2A) or YAP1KO#2/1-2α AGS and YAP1KO#2/1-2γ AGS cells (Fig. S2C), at comparable levels. In YAP1KO#1 AGS or YAP1KO#1/1-2γ cells, SHP2 was localized to the cytoplasm at a low cell density because of the lack of interaction with YAP1 (Fig. 2B, bottom row). On the other hand, SHP2 was accumulated in the nucleus of YAP1KO#1/1-2α AGS cells even at a low cell density because of the YAP1–SHP2 complex formation (Fig. 2B, middle row). Consistent with the notion that YAP1 is pro-mitogenic, growth of YAP1KO#1 or YAP1KO#2 AGS cells was substantially retarded compared with that of parental AGS cells, and the retarded growth was restored by re-expressing YAP1-2α or YAP1-2γ in YAP1KO#1 or YAP1KO##2 AGS cells (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2D). Notably, YAP1KO#1 or YAP1KO#2 AGS cells reconstituted with YAP1-2γ grew faster than did YAP1KO#1 or YAP1KO#2 AGS cells reconstituted with YAP1-2α (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2D). Because a luciferase reporter assay using AGS or NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts revealed that YAP1-2α exhibits stronger transcriptional co-activator activity toward TEAD than YAP1-2γ does as previously described (Fig. S2E) (10Komuro A.

Because cytoplasmic SHP2 is critically involved in activation of the RAS–ERK signaling pathway (16Dance M. Montagner A. Salles J.P. Yart A. Raynal P. The molecular functions of Shp2 in the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) pathway.Cell.

In fact, the level of RAS–ERK signal activation, determined by the phosphorylated/active form of ERK (pERK) (AGS cell), was reduced in YAP1KO#1 or YAP1KO#1/1-2α AGS cells but was elevated in YAP1KO#1/1-2γ AGS cells compared with that in YAP1KO#1 AGS cells (Fig. 2D). As in the case of YAP1, knockdown of Taz expression in NIH3T3 cells by specific siRNA gave rise to an increase in the level of cytoplasmic Shp2 at a low cell density (Fig. S2F), which was concomitantly associated with the increase in the active form of Erk (pErk) (Fig. S2G). To substantiate this idea, WT SHP2 or an SHP2 mutant that cannot bind YAP1 (SHP2-PA) and thus is retained in the cytoplasm (18Tsutsumi R. Masoudi M. Takahashi A. Fujii Y. Hayashi T. Kikuchi I. Satou Y. Taira M. Hatakeyama M. YAP and TAZ, Hippo signaling targets, act as a rheostat for nuclear SHP2 function.Dev.

The cell growth curve revealed that ectopic expression of SHP2, especially SHP2-PA, gave rise to a substantial increase in cell growth (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2H). A wound-healing assay was also conducted to compare the effects of YAP1-2α and YAP1-2γ on cell motility (24Wang L. Shi S. Guo Z. Zhang X. Han S. Yang A. Wen W. Zhu Q. Overexpression of YAP and TAZ is an independent predictor of prognosis in colorectal cancer and related to the proliferation and metastasis of colon cancer cells.PLoS One. 2013; 8 (23762387): e6553910.1371/journal.pone.0065539Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 25Zhao H.

Both YAP1-2α expression and YAP1-2γ expression enhanced the motility of YAP1KO#1 AGS cells, and again, the motogenic activity of YAP1-2γ was stronger than that of YAP1-2α (Fig. 2F). Next, to investigate the oncogenic potential of the YAP1 splicing isoforms in vitro, a colony formation assay was performed to examine whether these YAP1 isoforms are capable of conferring anchorage-independent growth, the well-recognized neoplastic trait of cells in vitro (5Zhao B.

Cell Biol. 2011; 13 (21336309): 282-29110.1038/ncb2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), using nontransformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts. To do so, NIH3T3 cells were transduced with a lentivirus expressing YAP1-2α or YAP1-2γ and subjected to a soft agar assay. No colonies were developed by NIH3T3 cells, and a few colonies with small sizes were formed by NIH3T3 cells expressing YAP1-2α. In contrast, numerous colonies with large sizes were formed by NIH3T3 cells expressing YAP1-2γ (Fig. 2G). The weak colony-forming activity of YAP1-2α was substantially potentiated by co-expressing SHP2-PA (Fig. S2I), indicating that cytoplasmic SHP2 is critically associated with the colony-forming activity of YAP1. From these observations, we concluded that YAP1-2γ exhibited greater in vitro pro-oncogenic activities than YAP1-2α did, most likely being caused by the differential SHP2-binding activity between YAP1-2α and YAP1-2γ. To consolidate the in vitro observations that YAP1-2γ is more oncogenic than YAP1-2α in an in vivo situation, a tumor formation assay was performed in nude mice again using nontransformed NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Parental NIH3T3 cells are nontumorigenic in nude mice and have long been used to evaluate in vivo oncogenic potential of genes of interest, especially those constituting the RAS signaling pathway. To this end, five pairs of stable NIH3T3 transfectants (pairs 1–5) that express comparable levels of YAP1-2α or YAP1-2γ, as determined by the HA-tag levels, were established (Fig. 3A, upper panels). All of the mice injected with the pairs of NIH3T3 transformants developed palpable tumors, whereas injection of parental NIH3T3 cells did not result in tumor development, indicating that both YAP1-2α and YAP1-2γ conferred in vivo tumorigenicity upon NIH3T3 cells. In striking contrast to the results obtained in in vitro studies, however, the sizes of the tumors induced by YAP1-2α were much larger than those induced by YAP1-2γ in all five pairs (Fig. 3A, bottom panels). Histopathological examination revealed massive infiltration of F4/80- and CD11b-positive macrophages into YAP1-2γ–induced NIH3T3 tumors but not into YAP1-2α–induced NIH3T3 tumors (Fig. 3B). To examine whether the macrophage infiltration was responsible for the reduced in vivo tumorigenicity, nude mice were pretreated with clodronate liposome, which specifically depletes macrophages in vivo (27Van Rooijen N. Sanders A. Liposome mediated depletion of macrophages: mechanism of action, preparation of liposomes and applications.J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174 (8083541): 83-9310.1016/0022-1759(94)90012-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). In mice treated with clodronate, YAP1-2γ–expressing NIH3T3 cells gave rise to tumors with sizes that were comparable with or even larger than those of tumors formed from YAP1-2α–expressing NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3C, upper panel and lower left panel). Reduced macrophage infiltration into YAP1-2γ–induced NIH3T3 tumors in clodronate-treated mice was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 3C, lower right panel). On the other hand, YAP1-2α–induced NIH3T3 tumors consistently grew in vivo without inducing macrophage infiltration regardless of clodronate treatment. To elucidate the mechanism by which YAP1-2γ–expressing NIH3T3 cells recruited macrophages in vivo, total RNAs were extracted from two pairs of NIH3T3 transfectants (pair"
https://openalex.org/W3047147857,"Phospholipase Cβ1 is activated by Gαq to generate calcium signals in response to hormones and neurotransmitters. Besides carrying out this plasma membrane function, PLCβ1 has a cytosolic population that helps to drive the differentiation of PC12 cells by inhibiting a nuclease that promotes RNA-induced silencing (C3PO). Here, we show that down-regulating PLCβ1 or reducing its cytosolic population by activating Gαq to localize it to the plasma membrane returns differentiated PC12 and SK-N-SH cells to an undifferentiated state. In this state, PC12 cells have a spherical morphology, resume proliferation, and express the stem cell transcription factors nanog and Oct4. Similar changes are seen when C3PO is down-regulated. This return to a stem-like state is accompanied by shifts in multiple miR populations. Surprisingly, de-differentiation can be induced by extended stimulation of Gαq where cells return to a spherical morphology and levels of specific miRs return to their undifferentiated values. In complementary studies, we followed the real-time hydrolysis of a fluorescent-tagged miR in cells where PLCβ1 or C3PO were down-regulated in PC12 cells and find substantial differences in miR processing in the undifferentiated and differentiated states.

This study aims to assess the level of HL in patients attending outpatient medical facilities in general medicine located in Naples and Caserta and investigate the association of HL with health behaviours and health status.The study involved patients attending outpatient medical facilities in general medicine. The questionnaire had four sections-the sociodemographic information, the 16-items version of the European Health Literacy Survey questionnaire, the general self-efficacy scale (GSE) and the health status scale (EQ-VAS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the sociodemographic determinants of HL. The Pearson correlation coefficients were determined to compare HL with health behaviours (GSE) and health status (EQ-VAS).The study showed that 61.6% of 503 patients had a low level of HL. After the multivariate analysis, HL was found to be higher among patients with higher education level and general self-efficacy score ≥30. There were no differences in HL between the age groups and people with or without chronic diseases. HL was stronger correlated with GSE than with EQ-VAS (0.53 vs 0.27).This is the first study on HL for Southern Italy. It showed a low level of HL. As the sample was not representative of the reference population, we cannot derive a corresponding conclusion for the general population of Southern Italy. Therefore, more data in Italy are needed to plan actions for improving HL."

Compared with control soybean roots, B. simplex-treated soybean roots contained lower levels of glucose, fructose, sucrose, and trehalose, which reduced the nematodes’ food source. Furthermore, treatment with B. simplex led to higher levels of melibiose, gluconic acid, lactic acid, phytosphingosine, and noradrenaline in soybean roots, which promoted nematocidal activity. The levels of oxoproline, maltose, and galactose were lowered after B. simplex treatment, which improved disease resistance. Collectively, this study provides insight into the metabolic alterations induced by B. simplex treatment, which affects the interactions with soybean cyst nematodes."

A steering group for clinical evidence implementation (EI) was established to conduct pre-implementation baseline surveys, a thorough analysis of the evidence, and an analysis of the survey results. The hindering and enabling factors associated with the clinical implementation of the evidence were analysed based on the three core elements of i-PARIHS, to formulate the clinical implementation plan for VTE nursing evidence. On-site expert reviews and focus group interviews were used to evaluate the feasibility of the draft plan, make adjustments, and finalize the evidence-based practice plan, which was then put into practice and evaluated.A new nursing process, a health education manual and a nursing quality checklist on VTE has been established and proved to be appropriate through the implementation. Compliance with evidence related to VTE nursing increased significantly in the two units, with better compliance in unit B than unit A. The knowledge, attitude and behaviour scores for VTE nursing increased substantially in both nurses and patients.The EI programme of incorporating the ""best"" evidence on VTE nursing into clinical practice using the i-PARIHS framework demonstrated feasibility, appropriateness and effectiveness and could serve as a reference."
https://openalex.org/W3046965735,"There is growing evidence that peer support programs may be effective in supporting breastfeeding mothers. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) (the RUBY study) that tested peer support in the Australian context found that infants of first-time mothers who received proactive telephone peer support were more likely to be receiving breastmilk at six months of age.This qualitative sub-study of the RUBY RCT explores the experiences and views of peer volunteers who delivered the intervention. Focus groups were conducted with 17 peers from the RUBY RCT between November 2015 and March 2016. All had provided peer support to at least one mother.We found that volunteers identified strongly with the mothers' need for support when establishing breastfeeding. Key components of the support were strengthening the mothers' self-belief through affirmation and sharing experiential knowledge. Volunteers found the role rewarding and personally therapeutic although some women reported challenges initiating and maintaining contact with some mothers. Data were analysed using a hybrid approach to thematic analysis combining inductive and deductive techniques.Breastfeeding peer support programs are reliant on recruitment of motivated volunteers who can provide empathetic mother-to-mother support. This study provides important information regarding volunteers' experiences that may support the upscaling of breastfeeding peer support for new mothers.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN 12612001024831."
https://openalex.org/W3047970483,"Objective Adolescent migrants present psychological disorders more frequently than the corresponding host population but their access to care and to follow-up are less effective. The French method of transcultural psychotherapy (TPT) was conceived to respond to these problems. Our objective is to assess how these adolescents and their families perceive the experience and effectiveness of TPT. Method We conducted semistructured interviews with the families of adolescents seen for TPT. The data were analyzed by a qualitative thematic methodology. Results We spoke to 21 participants in 8 families. The families came to TPT with a sense that the teen's current treatment was at an impasse. During the follow-up, they noted that family communication and relationships had improved, as had their connection to their culture of origin. Besides commenting on what they perceived as limitations, families identified specific elements of TPT as therapeutic. Conclusion The pronounced diversity of the group and the use of both multiperspective narration and an interpreter were specific elements driving the construction of a good therapeutic alliance, despite the initial barriers. Pursuit of the evaluation of TPT is essential to advance the psychiatric care of adolescent migrants."
https://openalex.org/W3047990754,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a chromosome instability syndrome of children caused by inherited mutations in one of FA genes, which together constitute a DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair, or the FA pathway. Monoubiquitination of Fanconi anemia group D2 protein (FANCD2) by the multisubunit ubiquitin E3 ligase, the FA core complex, is an obligate step in activation of the FA pathway, and its activity needs to be tightly regulated. FAAP20 is a key structural component of the FA core complex, and regulated proteolysis of FAAP20 mediated by prolyl cis-trans isomerization and phosphorylation at a consensus phosphodegron motif is essential for preserving the integrity of the FA core complex, and thus FANCD2 monoubiquitination. However, how ubiquitin-dependent FAAP20 degradation is modulated to fine-tune FA pathway activation remains largely un-known. Here, we present evidence that FAAP20 is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300/CBP on lysine 152, the key residue that when polyubiquitinated results in the degradation of FAAP20. Acetylation or mutation of the lysine residue stabilizes FAAP20 by preventing its ubiquitination, thereby protecting it from proteasome-dependent FAAP20 degradation. Consequently, disruption of the FAAP20 acetylation pathway impairs FANCD2 activation. Together, our study reveals a competition mechanism between ubiquitination and acetylation of a common lysine residue that controls FAAP20 stability and highlights a complex balancing between different posttranslational modifications as a way to refine the FA pathway signaling required for DNA ICL repair and genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W3047024219,"Objective Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is a severe infectious respiratory disease, the burden of which remains high in China. To provide scientific evidence for developing more targeted prevention and control strategies, this study aimed to determine the incidence trends and explore the epidemiological characteristics of pulmonary TB in Anhui Province, Eastern China between 2013 and 2018. Methods The retrospective study analyzed information regarding pulmonary TB cases reported by the National Infectious Disease Reporting System and census data collected from the Anhui Provincial Bureau of Statistics. Results Overall, 211,892 cases of TB patients were reported in Anhui Province, China between 2013 and 2018, with an average annual reported incidence rate of 57.7 per 100,000 persons. A significant decrease in the incidence rate of pulmonary TB (p < 0.001) was observed during the study period. Men had a higher incidence rate of pulmonary TB than women (p < 0.001). The highest annual average reported incidence rate was 204.2 per 100,000 persons in those aged 70–74 years. The number of farmers with pulmonary TB, i.e., 155,415, accounted for 73.4% of all cases. Moreover, the peak period of reported cases was from January to March. Four cities along the Yangtze River—Anqing, Tongling, Chizhou, and Wuhu—reported significantly higher incidence rates of pulmonary TB than other cities (p < 0.001). Conclusions From 2013 to 2018, there was a significant decline in the incidence rate of pulmonary TB in Anhui Province, with peaks occurring from January to March. Prevention and control strategies targeting men, people aged 70–74 years, farmers, and the four cities along the Yangtze River should be strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W3047452369,"Uromyces appendiculatus is a major pathogen on common bean. Like other rust fungi, it uses effectors to influence its host plant. Effectors are assumed to possess characteristic expression profiles, reflecting their activity during the infection process. In order to determine expression profiles using RT-qPCR, stably expressed reference genes are necessary for normalization. These reference genes need to be tested. Using samples representing seven different developmental stages of the urediospore-based infection process we employed RT-qPCR to measure the expression of 14 candidate reference genes and determined the most suitable ones based on the range of Cq values and comparative calculations using the geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. Among the tested genes RPS14 had the smallest Cq range, followed by Elf1a and Elf3; geNorm rated Tub and UbcE2 best with CytB as a third and NormFinder found UbcE2, Tub and Elf3 as best reference genes. Combining these findings using equal weight for the rankings UbcE2, Elf3 and Tub can be considered the best reference genes. A combination of either two reference genes, UbcE2 and Tub or three reference genes, UbcE2, Tub, and Elf3 is recommended for normalization. However, differences between most genes were relatively small, so all tested genes can be considered suitable for normalization with the exception of RPS9, SDH, Ubc and PDK."
https://openalex.org/W3047935738,"In Trypanosoma brucei and related kinetoplastids, gene expression regulation occurs mostly posttranscriptionally. Consequently, RNA-binding proteins play a critical role in the regulation of mRNA and protein abundance. Yet, the roles of many RNA-binding proteins are not understood. Our previous research identified the RNA-binding protein ZC3H5 as possibly involved in gene repression, but its role in controlling gene expression was unknown. We here show that ZC3H5 is an essential cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein. RNAi targeting ZC3H5 causes accumulation of precytokinetic cells followed by rapid cell death. Affinity purification and pairwise yeast two-hybrid analysis suggest that ZC3H5 forms a complex with three other proteins, encoded by genes Tb927.11.4900, Tb927.8.1500, and Tb927.7.3040. RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that ZC3H5 is preferentially associated with poorly translated, low-stability mRNAs, the 5'-untranslated regions and coding regions of which are enriched in the motif (U/A)UAG(U/A). As previously found in high-throughput analyses, artificial tethering of ZC3H5 to a reporter mRNA or other complex components repressed reporter expression. However, depletion of ZC3H5 in vivo caused only very minor decreases in a few targets, marked increases in the abundances of very stable mRNAs, an increase in monosomes at the expense of large polysomes, and appearance of ""halfmer"" disomes containing two 80S subunits and one 40S subunit. We speculate that the ZC3H5 complex might be implicated in quality control during the translation of suboptimal open reading frames."
https://openalex.org/W3047956791,"Migration has long been used as a strategy for livelihood diversification in rural, subsistence communities. Yet in order for migration to effectively serve as a livelihood diversification strategy, it should meet certain conditions: migration should ease financial burdens, should confer access to economically valuable resources and information, and should broaden social networks. Using qualitative data gathered in 25 interviews with rural migrants to Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, we examine how mobile phone technology has impacted migration as a livelihood diversification strategy. Our results show that while mobile phones facilitate migration, the advantages conferred may benefit migrants at the expense of the home communities. Mobile phones alleviate financial constraints, enable access to broader networks, and facilitate informational and resource support among migrants. Our results show limited evidence of migrants using mobile phone technology to provide resources or information to the home community. Our results highlight the need to reconsider the ways in which migration can be used as a livelihood diversification strategy in light of changing communication technologies to promote the economic success of both migrants and their home communities."
https://openalex.org/W3047963720,"Percutaneous osseointegrated (OI) implants are increasingly viable as an alternative to socket suspension of prosthetic limbs. Upper extremity prostheses have also become more complex to better replicate hand and arm function and attempt to recreate pre-amputation functional levels. With more functionality comes heavier devices that put more stress on the bone-implant interface, which could be an issue for implant stability. This study quantified transhumeral loading at defined amputation levels using four simulated prosthetic limb-types: (1) body powered hook, (2) myoelectric hook, (3) myoelectric hand, and (4) advanced prosthetic limb. Computational models were constructed to replicate the weight distribution of each prosthesis type, then applied to motion capture data collected during Advanced Activities of Daily Living (AADLs). For activities that did not include a handheld weight, the body powered prosthesis bending moments were 13–33% (range of means for each activity across amputation levels) of the intact arm moments (reference 100%), torsional moments were 12–15%, and axial pullout forces were 30–40% of the intact case (p≤0.001). The myoelectric hook and hand bending moments were 60–99%, torsional moments were 44–97%, and axial pullout forces were 62–101% of the intact case. The advanced prosthesis bending moments were 177–201%, torsional moments were 164–326%, and axial pullout forces were 133–185% of the intact case (p≤0.001). The addition of a handheld weight for briefcase carry and jug lift activities reduced the overall impact of the prosthetic model itself, where the body powered forces and moments were much closer to those of the intact model, and more complex prostheses further increased forces and moments beyond the intact arm levels. These results reveal a ranked order in loading magnitude according to complexity of the prosthetic device, and highlight the importance of considering the patient’s desired terminal device when planning post-operative percutaneous OI rehabilitation and training."

Mechanisms of action of abatacept have not been fully investigated. The objective of this study was to provide detailed insight into the mode of action of Abatacept based on gene expression data.In this ancillary study from the APPRAISE trial, we investigated the global molecular effects of Abatacept in whole blood samples collected prospectively in biologic naive rheumatoid arthritis patients (n = 19) at baseline and 6 months after the initiation of Abatacept therapy concomitant with methotrexate. Whole human genome microarrays (4x44K) were performed on both baseline and 6-month samples from responders and non-responders patients categorized according to EULAR criteria. T-test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction was performed to identify significant gene expression changes. Gene Ontology and Single Experiment Analysis tools allowed us to highlight specific biological mechanisms involved in methotrexate/Abatacept.In methotrexate/Abatacept responders, 672 genes were significantly (q<0.05) dysregulated at 6 months compared to baseline. Correlation analysis highlighted 19 genes whose dysregulations were significantly associated with disease activity variation (p<0.05) and whose functions were associated with proliferation, apoptosis of cells and mitochondrial metabolism, suggesting a restoration of oxidative signaling. The other 653 gene expression changes were relative to direct or indirect effects of methotrexate/Abatacept treatment and were significantly (p<0.005) involved in pathways relative to mRNA processing, proteasome, angiogenesis, apoptosis and TCR signaling. This study highlights new mechanisms of action of methotrexate/Abatacept and may provide new therapeutic targets to prevent autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W3047586609,"Introduction The heart rate (HR) method is a promising approach for evaluating oxygen uptake (), energy demands and exercise intensities in different forms of physical activities. It would be valuable if the HR method, established on ergometer cycling, is interchangeable with other regular activities, such as level walking. This study therefore aimed to examine the interchangeability of the HR method when estimating for ergometer cycling and level treadmill walking in submaximal conditions. Methods Two models of regression equations for cycle ergometer exercise (CEE) and treadmill exercise (TE) were established with 34 active commuters. Model 1 consisted of three submaximal intensities of ergometer cycling or level walking, model 2 included also one additional workload of maximal ergometer cycling or running. The regression equations were used for estimating with seven individual HR values based on 25–85% of HR reserve (HRR). The estimations were compared between CEE and TE, within and between each model. Results Only minor, and in most cases non-significant, average differences were observed when comparing the estimated levels between CEE and TE. Model 1 ranged from -0.4 to 4.8% (n.s.) between 25–85%HRR. In model 2, the differences between 25–65%HRR ranged from 1.3 to -2.7% (n.s.). At the two highest intensities, 75 and 85%HRR, was slightly lower (3.7%, 4.4%; P < 0.05), for CEE than TE. The inclusion of maximal exercise in the relationships reduced the individual variations between the two exercise modalities. Conclusion The HR methods, based on submaximal ergometer cycling and level walking, are interchangeable for estimating mean levels between 25–85% of HRR. Essentially, the same applies when adding maximal exercise in the relationships. The inter-individual variation between ergometer cycling and treadmill exercise is reduced when using the HR method based on both submaximal and maximal workloads."

To assess the impact of an educational session given to clinicians on the importance of providing all the relevant information on the request forms.Two retrospective audits, each covering 3 months, were performed to evaluate the completeness of demographic and clinical information on thrombophilia-screen request forms and its impact on the quality of the interpretive comments before and after an educational intervention.One hundred and seventy-one request forms were included in the first audit and 146 in the second audit. The first audit revealed that all 171 thrombophilia-screen request forms had complete patient demographic information but none had clinical information. Haematological pathologists only made generic comments which could not be applied to a specific patient. The second audit, conducted after a physician educational session, did not reveal any improvement in the clinical information provision by the test-ordering physicians. This was reportedly due to the lack of space on the request form. The interpretive comments therefore remained generic and not patient-specific.Physicians' failure to provide relevant clinical information made it impossible for pathologists to make patient-specific interpretation of the results. A single physician education session did not change the practice, reportedly due to the inappropriate design of the test request form.

https://openalex.org/W3047926002,"Contraception can help to meet family planning goals for women living with HIV (WLHIV) as well as to support the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). However, there is little research into the contraceptive practice among sexually active WLHIV in Ethiopia. Therefore, we aimed to examine contraceptive practice among sexually active WLHIV in western Ethiopia and identify the factors that influenced such practice using the Health Belief Model (HBM).A facility-based cross-sectional survey of 360 sexually active WLHIV was conducted from 19th March to 22nd June 2018 in western Ethiopia. The eligible participants were WLHIV aged between 18 and 49 years who reported being fecund and sexually active within the previous six months but were not pregnant and not wanting to have another child within two years. Modified Poisson regression analyses were conducted to identify factors that influenced contraceptive practice among sexually active WLHIV in western Ethiopia.Among sexually active WLHIV (n = 360), 75% used contraception with 25% having unmet needs. Of the contraceptive users, 44.8% used injectables, 37.4% used condoms and 28.5% used implants. Among 152 recorded births in the last five years, 17.8% were reported as mistimed and 25.7% as unwanted. Compared to WLHIV having no child after HIV diagnosis, having two or more children after HIV diagnosis (Adjusted Prevalence Ratio [APR] = 1.31; 95%CI 1.09-1.58) was associated with increased risk of contraceptive practice. However, sexually active unmarried WLHIV (APR = 0.69; 95%CI 0.50-0.95) were less likely to use any contraception compared to their sexually active married counterparts. Importantly, high perceived susceptibility (APR = 1.49; 95%CI 1.20-1.86) and medium perceived susceptibility (APR = 1.55; 95%CI 1.28-1.87) towards unintended pregnancy were associated with higher risk of contraceptive use than WLHIV with low perceived susceptibility.Although contraceptive use amongst sexually active WLHIV was found to be high, our findings highlight the need for strengthening family planning services given the high rate of unintended pregnancies, the high rate of unmet needs for contraception, as well as the lower efficacy with some of the methods. Our findings also suggest that the HBM would be a valuable framework for healthcare providers, programme planners and policymakers to develop guidelines and policies for contraceptive counselling and choices."
https://openalex.org/W3048029308,"The membrane-bound, long form of MGAT4D, termed MGAT4D-L, inhibits MGAT1 activity in transfected cells and reduces the generation of complex N-glycans. MGAT1 is the GlcNAc-transferase that initiates complex and hybrid N-glycan synthesis. We show here that Drosophila MGAT1 was also inhibited by MGAT4D-L in S2 cells. In mammalian cells, expression of MGAT4D-L causes the substrate of MGAT1 (Man5GlcNAc2Asn) to accumulate on glycoproteins, a change that is detected by the lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA). Using GNA binding as an assay for the inhibition of MGAT1 in MGAT4D-L transfectants, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to determine requirements for MGAT1 inhibition. Deletion of 25 amino acids (aa) from the C terminus inactivated MGAT4D-L, but deletion of 20 aa did not. Conversion of the five key amino acids (PSLFQ) to Ala, or deletion of PSLFQ in the context of full-length MGAT4D-L, also inactivated MGAT1 inhibitory activity. Nevertheless, mutant, inactive MGAT4D-L interacted with MGAT1 in co-immuno-precipitation experiments. The PSLFQ sequence also occurs in MGAT4A and MGAT4B GlcNAc-transferases. However, neither inhibited MGAT1 in transfected CHO cells. MGAT4D-L inhibitory activity could be partially transferred by attaching PSLFQ or the 25-aa C terminus of MGAT4D-L to the C terminus of MGAT1. Mutation of each amino acid in PSLFQ to Ala identified both Leu and Phe as independently essential for MGAT4D-L activity. Thus, replacement of either Leu-395 or Phe-396 with Ala led to inactivation of MGAT4D-L inhibitory activity. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of inhibition of MGAT1 by MGAT4D-L, and for the development of small molecule inhibitors of MGAT1."
https://openalex.org/W3048308307,"Disease transmission can be identified in a social network from the structural patterns of contact. However, it is difficult to separate contagious processes from those driven by homophily, and multiple pathways of transmission or inexact information on the timing of infection can obscure the detection of true transmission events. Here, we analyze the dynamic social network of a large, and near-complete population of 16,430 zoo birds tracked daily over 22 years to test a novel ""friends-of-friends"" strategy for detecting contagion in a social network. The results show that cases of avian mycobacteriosis were significantly clustered among pairs of birds that had been in direct contact. However, since these clusters might result due to correlated traits or a shared environment, we also analyzed pairs of birds that had never been in direct contact but were indirectly connected in the network via other birds. The disease was also significantly clustered among these friends of friends and a reverse-time placebo test shows that homophily could not be causing the clustering. These results provide empirical evidence that at least some avian mycobacteriosis infections are transmitted between birds, and provide new methods for detecting contagious processes in large-scale global network structures with indirect contacts, even when transmission pathways, timing of cases, or etiologic agents are unknown."
