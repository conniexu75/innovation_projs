https://openalex.org/W1965294199,"Conspicuous adaptive differentiation in color and size has occurred in the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) in North America and the Hawaiian Islands since its introduction in the middle of the 19th century. Patterns of geographic variation in North America parallel those shown by native polytypic species, in conformity with Gloger's and Bergmann's ecogeographic rules. Racial differentiation of house sparrow populations may require no more than 50 years."

https://openalex.org/W2019993340,"A definite and significant temperature gradient exists over the area of a tomato leaflet and is apparently due to the variation in transpiration across the leaflet. Transpiration is most effective at low velocities of air movement, but when the velocity increases, convection becomes the dominant factor. Leaves in which the stomata are allowed to open naturally in response to light attain temperatures about 5°C lower than leaves in which the stomata are forced to remain closed."

https://openalex.org/W1996383815,Xenon hexafluoride reacts with BF3 and AsF5 to form 1:1 adducts which are white solids with vapor pressures of less than 1 millimeter at room temperature. The XeF6 ⋅ BF3 adduct melts at 90°C to a pale yellow viscous liquid.
https://openalex.org/W2084833808,"Samples of sea water from several oceans and several depths were analyzed for natural cesium by flame photometry with precision of about 3.5 percent. The average of 16 assays of surface water from four oceans was 0.37 microgram per liter, somewhat less than the average previously reported. The average cesium concentration in samples taken between 500 and 1500 meters was about 14 percent higher than the surface average, suggesting that cesium may be transported downward by particulate material. Natural cesiumn is now somewhat easier to study in the ocean than radiocesium from fallout is, and information on one complements the other."

https://openalex.org/W2056149859,"A thin layer of spherical particles resting on the bottom of a round pipe was observed to form into essentially equally spaced clumps or islands at fluid velocities only slightly greater than those required to initiate particle movement. This phenomenon appeared to be similar to dune formation in open channels since the ratio of the square of the stream velocity, U, and the product of the gravitational constant, gL, and the island wavelength, λ, was correlated by the same function of island height and velocity, particle diameter, and fluid depth regardless of whether the flow was through a closed conduit or an open channel."

https://openalex.org/W1974201581,"Myotis lucifugus first learned to catch mealworms mechanically projected into the air in a laboratory flight room, and were then trained to distinguish mealworms from small metal or plastic disks (3.0 × 12.5 mm and 0.5 × 6.3 mm). These three targets were presented singly in a semi-random sequence, traveling along very similar trajectories. The most skillful bats caught 98% of the mealworms while avoiding any contact with 85 to 90% of the two types of disks. Echoes of 100–20 kc pulses (similar to the bats' orientation sounds) were measured from all three targets in almost all possible angular orientations. There was great overlap in intensity both in the peak amplitudes and in each of the ten 8 kc bands from 100–20 kc. These bats thus seem capable of some qualitative discrimination based on the “fine structure” of echoes from small moving targets."

https://openalex.org/W1983144344,"We apply, with a slight modification, the theory proposed earlier [M. Gell-Mann, Phys. Rev. 125, 1067 (1962)] of a higher broken symmetry than the eightfold way. The integrals of the time components of the vector and axial
vector current octets are assumed to generate, under equal time commutation, the algebra of SU(3) x SU(3). The energy density of the strong interactions is assumed to consist of a piece invariant under the algebra, a piece that violates conservation of the axial vector currents only and belongs to the representations (3, 3^*) and (3^*, 3), and a
piece that violates the eightfold way and belongs to (1, 8) and (8, 1). An attempt is made to assign particles approximately to super-supermultiplets."

https://openalex.org/W2009607807,"Measurements that are of limited accuracy, are incomplete, or require a finite time to make do not generally permit one to construct a wave function for describing a physical system. The use of such partial information to predict the results of subsequent measurements is studied here. There are several practical applications of this problem, including the use of the autocorrelation function for a particle counter in a scattering experiment."
