https://openalex.org/W2029815010,"Golgi studies reveal abnormally long, thin spines and the absence of short, thick spines on dendrites of cortical neurons in retarded children with normal karyotypes. The degree of dendritic spine loss and abnormality appears to be related to age and the severity of developmental retardation. Dendritic spine ""dysgenesis"" is a common feature of the microstructural pathology that occurs in profound mental retardation of unknown etiology."

The speed at the transition from trot to gallop can be used as an equivalent speed for comparing animals of different size. This transition point occurs at lower speeds and higher stride frequencies in smaller animals. Plotting stride frequency at the trot-gallop transition point as a function of body mass in logarithmic coordinates yields a straight line."

A method is described for the single-step isolation of 2s and 4s variants resistant to dexamethasone, a synthetic adrenal hormone. The transition from steroid sensitivity to resistance is stochastic and occurs at a rate of 3.5 × 10−6/cell/generation. Several types of mutagens significantly increase this rate. The chromosome number, growth rate, gross morphology, and cloning efficiency of the steroid-resistant variants are not detectably different from those of their steroid-sensitive parents."

https://openalex.org/W2096617228,"Spontaneous mutants of cultured Chinese hamster cells (line CHO) deficient in APRT have been isolated by selection in 8-azaadenine (AA). Loss of APRT activity occurs in two discrete steps. In the first step, about 65% of total activity is lost; in the second step, most or all of the remaining activity is lost. Cells totally deficient in APRT are highly resistant to AA and cannot utilize exogenous adenine as a source of purines for cell growth. Cells partially deficient in the enzyme exhibit resistance to AA intermediate to that of wild type and fully deficient cells. Growth of cells partially deficient in APRT is inhibited in medium containing drug by the presence of large numbers of wild type cells, but cells totally deficient in the enzyme are not inhibited by the presence of either partially deficient or wild type cells. Stepwise loss of APRT activity probably has a genetic origin. The mutants exhibit stable phenotypes, and the frequency of fully deficient cells in a partially deficient population is enhanced by treatment with a mutagen. The rate of spontaneous mutation from partial to total deficiency is 3 ± 0.8 × 10−7 per cell generation, and reversion from full to partial deficiency can occur. Total lack of APRT activity is recessive to its presence, but the specific activity of the enzyme in hybrid cells depends quantitatively upon the specific activities in the two parents."
https://openalex.org/W1551419081,"Abstract During activation, the prothrombin molecule is divided into a COOH-terminal half which gives rise to thrombin and an NH2-terminal activation fragment half (Fragment 1·2) (Esmon, C. T., Owen, W. G., and Jackson, C. M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 606–611). Thrombin-catalyzed proteolysis further divides the activation fragment into 2 parts, Fragment 1 (from the NH2-terminal end) and Fragment 2. The Fragment 1 region of prothrombin has been shown to be responsible for the binding of prothrombin to phospholipid (Gitel, S. N., Owen, W. G., Esmon, C. T., and Jackson, C. M. (1973) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70, 1344–1348). It is shown here that the ability of blood clotting Factor V to accelerate thrombin precursor activation is specifically dependent upon the interaction between the Fragment 2 region of the substrate and Factor V. The evidence supporting the conclusion that the Fragment 2 region is required for Factor V function is as follows: Intermediate 2, a thrombin precursor without a Fragment 2 region, is activated more rapidly by activated Factor X and Ca2+ than either prothrombin or Intermediate 1, whereas when Factor V is present, the situation is reversed and the Fragment 2 region containing substrates, i.e. prothrombin or Intermediate 1, are activated more rapidly than Intermediate 2. Addition of either Fragment 2 or Fragment 1·2 to Intermediate 2 results in the rapid activation of Intermediate 2 by Factor V, activated Factor X, and Ca2+, and Intermediate 2 and Fragment 2 associate to form a product of 1:1 stoichiometry which is electrophoretically indistinguishable from Intermediate 1. In contrast to the situation with Fragment 2, Fragment 1 is completely without effect on the Factor V enhancement of Intermediate 1 and Intermediate 2 plus Fragment 2 activation indicating that Fragment 1 and Fragment 2 are independent in their function in the prothrombin activation process. The course of Intermediate 1 activation by activated Factor X, Factor V, and Ca2+ was investigated by determining the product distributions which can be monitored by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis as a function of time. The results on the activation pathway obtained from these experiments are consistent with the previously demonstrated prothrombin activation pathway (Esmon, C. T., and Jackson, C. M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 7782–7790), i.e. [see PDF for equation] with the added requirement for interaction between Intermediate 2 and Fragment 1·2 or Fragment 2 for Factor V to function."
https://openalex.org/W1977670019,"A high rate of lead fallout around two secondary lead smelters originated mainly from episodal large-particulate emissions from low-level fugitive sources rather than from stack fumes. The lead content of dustfall, and consequently of soil, vegetation, and outdoor dust, decreased exponentially with distance from the two smelters. Between 13 and 30 percent of the children living in the contaminated areas had absorbed excessive amounts of lead (more than 40 micrograms per 100 milliliters of blood and more than 100 micrograms per gram of hair) as compared with less than 1 percent in a control group. A relationship between blood and hair was established which indicated that the absorption was fairly constant for most children examined. It seemed that the ingestion of contaminated dirt and dusts rather than ""paint pica"" was the major route of lead intake. Metabolic changes were found in most of 21 children selected from those with excessive lead absorption; 10 to 15 percent of this group showed subtle neurological dysfunctions and minor psychomotor abnormalities."

https://openalex.org/W2024096406,Rats receiving bilateral stereotaxic injections of 6-hydroxydopamine into the zona compacta of the substantia nigra failed to learn a one-way active avoidance response. Small doses of L-dopa (1.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor reversed this impairment. Animals with lesions which acquired the avoidance response during L-dopa administration retained this response when drug treatment was discontinued. These experiments suggest that the dopaminergic nigro-neostriatal projection serves a critical function in the acquisition of learned instrumental responses.

https://openalex.org/W1543140440,"Abstract The circular dichroism spectra of calsequestrin and the high affinity calcium-binding protein from rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum have been recorded in the presence and absence of Ca2+ and other cations. Calsequestrin Forms I and II show decreases in negativity upon Ca2+ binding from -12 to -6 x 103 and -20 to -10 x 103 deg cm2 dmole-1, respectively, at 200 nm, and increases from -5 to -6 x 103 and -7 to -10 x 103 deg cm2 dmole-1 at 220 nm. Above 250 nm there is little optical activity in the absence of cations, but both forms of calsequestrin show a complex signal with maximum of about 90 deg cm2 dmole-1 between 270 and 285 nm in their presence. The changes in circular dichroism are interpreted as reflecting a large conformational change in the protein upon cation binding. Absorption difference spectra in the 320 to 240 nm range confirm that calcium binding induces perturbation in the absorption bands of tryosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine, probably as a result of greater folding. The circular dichroism and absorption spectra of the high affinity calcium-binding protein do not change upon binding calcium. This protein, even in the absence of calcium, has intense circular dichroism activity in the aromatic region, with a maximum of 250 deg cm2 dmole-1 at about 280 nm."

https://openalex.org/W1999014453,"INTERCELLULAR adhesion is generally believed to be mediated by specific macromolecular components on the surface of the interacting cells. Soluble factors which may play a part in this process have been identified in a number of systems1–8. We have already described a developmentally-regulated9 carbohydrate binding protein10,11 from the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum that appears in differentiating amoebae in close correlation with the development of cohesiveness10. This protein is assayed by its erythrocyte agglutination activity that can be inhibited by specific sugars. We now report the isolation of a similar protein from another cellular slime mould, Polysphondylium pallidum that seems to mediate specific cellular adhesion as judged from the following findings: (1) it is present on the cell surface; (2) it is present when the cells are differentiated to a cohesive state but absent when the cells are not cohesive; (3) addition of the purified protein promotes cell cohesion; (4) sugars which react with the active site of the molecule block cell cohesion produced either by the added purified substance or by the endogenous substance present on cohesive cells; (5) the precise reactivities of the protein from P. pallidum differ from the protein from D. discoideum, which correlates with the segregation of these cells in mixed culture."

https://openalex.org/W1492703699,"Abstract The pyridoxal form of both the supernatant and mitochondrial isoenzymes of aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1) catalyzes α, β elimination of pyruvate from β-chloro-l-alanine with concomitant inactivation. Rates of these reactions were greatly accelerated by formate ion. Acetate and propionate were much less effective and essentially ineffective with the mitochondrial isoenzyme. With both isoenzymes, dependency of rates of α, β elimination as well as inactivation on formate concentration showed sigmoidal curves; the rate enhancement was especially marked at formate concentrations from 1 to 3 m. Michaelis constants for β-chloro-l-alanine were identical in both the α β elimination reaction and the inactivation. These results suggest that both reactions occur via a common intermediate. The presence of formate did not affect the Michaelis constants for β-chloro-l-alanine. Formate increased only the maximal velocities of these reactions. The pH optimum for the inactivation of both isoenzymes was approximately pH 7.5 whereas the rate of the α, β elimination reaction was maximal at pH 7 and remained constant above this pH. Formate induced a considerable change in the absorption and circular dichroism spectra of the pyridoxal form of both isoenzymes in visible regions. Upon reacting with β-chloro-l-alanine in the presence of 3 m formate, the absorption band at 345 nm, which is attributed to the bound pyridoxal phosphate, shifted to 337 nm, which was accompanied by a marked decrease in ellipticity. Prolonged incubation of the inactivated enzymes resulted in the formation of a new spectral species absorbing at 455 nm. Removal of formate produced a drastic change in the spectrum, giving rise to three absorption bands at 333, 375, and 420 nm. Addition of formate to this solution reversed these spectral changes to give a single 455-nm band again. All these observations are consistent with the proposal that formate binds to a discrete subsite within the active site which normally binds the distal carboxyl group of a natural dicarboxylic substrate. Inactivation of both isoenzymes with β-chloro-l-[U-14C]-alanine and reduction with KBH4 resulted in a stoichiometric incorporation of the three-carbon moiety derived from chloroalanine as well as the pyridoxyl moiety into the enzyme protein via stable covalent linkages."
https://openalex.org/W1999144340,"Abstract The rate of synthesis of pre-tRNA has been examined in detergent-treated ghost monolayers of 3T6 cells prepared from cultures undergoing a transition from resting to growing state. For the first 30 min after serum stimulation of resting cells, the rate of pre-tRNA synthesis rises together with the rate of pre-rRNA synthesis; but later, synthesis of pre-tRNA fails to increase in proportion to that of pre-rRNA. After replication of DNA begins, the rate of pre-tRNA synthesis increases more sharply than that of pre-rRNA, and by 24 hr the initial proportion in their rates of synthesis is reestablished. If DNA replication is prevented by cytosine arabinoside, the discrepancy in the rates of pre-rRNA and pre-tRNA synthesis persists. As a result, cells stimulated with serum in the presence of cytosine arabinoside develop a form of unbalanced growth in which there is an increasing deficit in the amount of tRNA relative to other classes of RNA in the cytoplasm. The rate of protein synthesis soon fails to increase, suggesting that it may be limited by the availability of tRNA. These facts may have a bearing on the normal operation of the division cycle. Pre-tRNA synthesis can evidently be regulated only over a narrow range without DNA replication. When ribosomes and mRNA accumulate during the transition from resting to growing state, and the rate of protein synthesis increases, control of the division cycle evidently ensures that DNA replication will begin before cellular tRNA content becomes much reduced relative to its ribosome content. The regulatory range for transcription of pre-tRNA (independent of increase in the number of genes through replication) can also be demonstrated by using inhibitors of protein synthesis. Resting cells respond to such inhibitors by increasing their rate of synthesis of pre-tRNA, whereas cells already stimulated by serum do not respond further."

These cells derive from mice differing at the Fv-1 locus, which controls the replication of all murine RNA leukemia viruses. Studies of early events in the replication of LLV-F were carried out by following the infection of permissive and restrictive mouse embryo cells by 32 P labeled LLV-F. 32 P labeled viral genome RNA rapidly becomes associated with cell nuclei and may be found integrated to the same extent with high molecular weight host DNA of either permissive or restrictive cells. These results suggest that Fv-1 mediated host restriction of LLV-F occurs at a step following integration of viral genome RNA into host DNA. Two other conclusions are suggested by these data. The nucleus appears to be the site of activation and synthesis of DNA of the infecting virus; and the provirus, at least transiently, is represented as an RNA-DNA hybrid molecule covalently integrated with host cell DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1912783338,"The regulation of lipid synthesis from acetate in cultures of L cells in response to changes in exogenous lipid supply has been studied, and the enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase has been investigated in reference to its possible role in the regulation of lipid biosynthesis from acetate. When serum lipid was removed from monolayers of L cells, a relatively rapid stimulation of [14C]acetate incorporation into lipid was observed within 2 hours. This stimulation of incorporation was observed in both sterol and fatty acid fractions. Conversely, an inhibition of [14C]acetate incorporation was observed within 1 to 2 hours when cells cultured in lipid-free medium were transferred to serum-supplemented medium. As with the stimulation, this inhibition was observed both in sterol and fatty acid fractions of the cell lipid. The data indicated a coordination of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism in the cells. Inhibition of [14C]acetate incorporation was observed in sterol as well as free fatty acid and glycerolipid fractions in cultures grown in lipid-free medium and transferred to fatty acid-supplemented medium; and similarly, cultures transferred to medium supplemented with cholesterol showed inhibition not only of acetate incorporation into sterol but also into fatty acid and glycerolipid fractions. Cycloheximide, actinomycin D and mitomycin C seemed to have no influence on the early stimulation or inhibition of [14C]acetate incorporation into total lipid. Acetyl-CoA synthetase activity was assayed in homogenates of L cells cultured in the presence of serum-supplemented or lipid-free medium and a 5-fold decrease in enzyme activity was observed in homogenates of cultures grown in the presence of exogenous lipid. When cells grown in serum-supplemented medium were transferred to serum-free medium, a stimulation of enzyme activity occurred within 2 to 3 hours which reached a maximum by 6 hours. Conversely, when cells were cultured in lipid-free medium and transferred to serum-supplemented medium, inhibition of enzyme activity occurred within the same time course. Cycloheximide, actinomycin D, and mitomycin C had no influence on the stimulation or inhibition of enzyme activity observed in response to changes in exogenous lipids. Inhibition of enzyme activity also was observed in cells cultured in lipid-free medium which were transferred to medium containing either fatty acid or cholesterol, indicating fatty acid and cholesterol might be part of the components of serum lipid that can influence the activity of acetyl-CoA synthetase. However, when various concentrations of serum lipid were added to the reaction mixture in vitro, there was no influence on enzyme activity. The data suggest that the enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase may play a role in the regulation of lipid biosynthesis from acetate in cultured cells."

https://openalex.org/W2050032535,"Abstract Inhibition of protein synthesis in confluent monolayers of chick fibroblasts stimulates selectively the synthesis of 4S RNA, resulting in a net accumulation of 4S RNA in the inhibited cells.

Recovery of cells from inhibition is accompanied by a rapidly increasing rate of protein synthesis that lasts for several hours. The small molecular weight RNA synthesized during inhibition of protein synthesis appears properly methylated, and in the presence of cycloheximide and actinomycin D shows a precursor-product conversion. Radiolabeled RNA synthesized during inhibition of protein synthesis is stable following the recovery of cells from inhibition. Stimulation of uridine incorporation into 4S RNA during arrest of protein synthesis is also demonstrated in high-density cultures of L- and Hep-2 cells, suggesting that this non-coordinate stimulation of 4S RNA may be a general property of eucaryotic cells."

In a 15 min pulse, DNA fragments with a sedimentation coefficient of 30 S tend to accumulate. Our results support the contention that DNA synthesis is discontinuous in myeloma cells. However, a search for RNA associated with nascent DNA in the myeloma system was unsuccessful. Newly synthesized DNA was isolated on a benzoylated naphthoylated DEAE cellulose column. After heat denaturation, this fraction was centrifuged to equilibrium in a Cs 2 SO 4 density gradient. The nascent DNA displays no shift in density greater than the density of the bulk DNA. When cells were pulse labeled with 3 H-uridine and the nascent DNA fraction analyzed on Cs 2 SO 4 density gradients, no 3 H-labeled RNA was found associated with the DNA peak or at intermediate densities that would be indicative of a RNA-DNA molecule, covalently linked. Unless scission of the RNA primers occurs immediately after the initiation of DNA synthesis, our results indicate that DNA synthesis commences without RNA primers in myeloma cells."

https://openalex.org/W2140477087,"Abstract The association of the enzyme cystathionase with the apoprotein of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy at protein concentrations lower than 1 mg per ml. The interaction between cystathionase and the 4-pyridoxic-5'-P-apoaminotransferase complex at pH 7.4 brings about dissociation of the inhibitor 4-pyridoxic-5'-P from the catalytic site of the aminotransferase. The rate of release of 4-pyridoxic-5'-P is easily monitored by measuring its increase in fluorescence at 425 nm as a function of incubation time. The rate of fluorescence enhancement at 425 nm, which is related to the dissociation of 4-pyridoxic-5'-P from the apoaminotransferase, is influenced by the molar ratio of cystathionase to aminotransferase in the reaction mixture. The resolved form of the enzyme cystathionase failed to dissociate the 4-pyridoxic-5'-P-apoaminotransferase complex, while free pyridoxal-5-P is much less efficient than pyridoxal-5-P bound to the cystathionase in promoting dissociation of the inhibitor 4-pyridoxic-5'-P. Polarization of fluorescence measurements on aspartate aminotransferase labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate was used to detect the formation of a complex of this enzyme with cystathionase. The binding of labeled transaminase to cystathionase is accompanied by an increase in the polarization of fluorescence from 0.21 to 0.30 without any change in the fluorescence life-time of the fluorophore (τ = 4.5 ns) covalently bound to the aminotransferase. The binding process is reversible and the results of the polarization titrations indicate a strong affinity of the aminotransferase for cystathionase (Kd = 1 µm)."
