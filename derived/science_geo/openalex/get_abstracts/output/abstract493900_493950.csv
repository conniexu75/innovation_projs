https://openalex.org/W1968850365,"A universal set of logic gates in a superconducting quantum circuit is shown to have gate fidelities at the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computing by the surface code approach, in which the quantum bits are distributed in an array of planar topology and have only nearest-neighbour couplings. Quantum computers can only work in practice if, like conventional computers, they are fault-tolerant. This means that a system has to be in place to detect any errors and correct them. For quantum error correction such a system involves entangling several quantum bits (qubits) with each other. In the so-called surface code error-correction architecture, qubits are placed in a lattice and are entangled with four nearest neighbours. Rami Barends et al. report the construction of such a surface code system with five qubits in a row made from superconducting devices. This system performs with fidelity that is at the threshold for quantum error correction, suggesting that error-free quantum computing should be possible. The platform lends itself to scaling up to larger numbers of qubits and two-dimensional architecture. A quantum computer can solve hard problems, such as prime factoring1,2, database searching3,4 and quantum simulation5, at the cost of needing to protect fragile quantum states from error. Quantum error correction6 provides this protection by distributing a logical state among many physical quantum bits (qubits) by means of quantum entanglement. Superconductivity is a useful phenomenon in this regard, because it allows the construction of large quantum circuits and is compatible with microfabrication. For superconducting qubits, the surface code approach to quantum computing7 is a natural choice for error correction, because it uses only nearest-neighbour coupling and rapidly cycled entangling gates. The gate fidelity requirements are modest: the per-step fidelity threshold is only about 99 per cent. Here we demonstrate a universal set of logic gates in a superconducting multi-qubit processor, achieving an average single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.92 per cent and a two-qubit gate fidelity of up to 99.4 per cent. This places Josephson quantum computing at the fault-tolerance threshold for surface code error correction. Our quantum processor is a first step towards the surface code, using five qubits arranged in a linear array with nearest-neighbour coupling. As a further demonstration, we construct a five-qubit Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state8,9 using the complete circuit and full set of gates. The results demonstrate that Josephson quantum computing is a high-fidelity technology, with a clear path to scaling up to large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum circuits."

The wide-scale availability of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies means that data on genetic variation in human diseases are accumulating rapidly. In this Perspective, Daniel MacArthur and colleagues sound a note of caution, pointing out that up to a quarter of reported disease-linked mutations have been found to either be common polymorphisms or have lacked sufficient evidence for pathogenicity. The authors discuss the key challenges associated with assessing sequence variants in human disease and propose guidelines for the robust differentiation between disease-causing genetic variants and other variants present in the human genome. They highlight several areas where research and resource development are urgently needed if genomic research findings are to be successfully translated into the clinical diagnostic setting. The discovery of rare genetic variants is accelerating, and clear guidelines for distinguishing disease-causing sequence variants from the many potentially functional variants present in any human genome are urgently needed. Without rigorous standards we risk an acceleration of false-positive reports of causality, which would impede the translation of genomic research findings into the clinical diagnostic setting and hinder biological understanding of disease. Here we discuss the key challenges of assessing sequence variants in human disease, integrating both gene-level and variant-level support for causality. We propose guidelines for summarizing confidence in variant pathogenicity and highlight several areas that require further resource development."
https://openalex.org/W2118428599,"Men who develop metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) invariably succumb to the disease. Progression to CRPC after androgen ablation therapy is predominantly driven by deregulated androgen receptor (AR) signalling. Despite the success of recently approved therapies targeting AR signalling, such as abiraterone and second-generation anti-androgens including MDV3100 (also known as enzalutamide), durable responses are limited, presumably owing to acquired resistance. Recently, JQ1 and I-BET762 two selective small-molecule inhibitors that target the amino-terminal bromodomains of BRD4, have been shown to exhibit anti-proliferative effects in a range of malignancies. Here we show that AR-signalling-competent human CRPC cell lines are preferentially sensitive to bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibition. BRD4 physically interacts with the N-terminal domain of AR and can be disrupted by JQ1 (refs 11, 13). Like the direct AR antagonist MDV3100, JQ1 disrupted AR recruitment to target gene loci. By contrast with MDV3100, JQ1 functions downstream of AR, and more potently abrogated BRD4 localization to AR target loci and AR-mediated gene transcription, including induction of the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and its oncogenic activity. In vivo, BET bromodomain inhibition was more efficacious than direct AR antagonism in CRPC xenograft mouse models. Taken together, these studies provide a novel epigenetic approach for the concerted blockade of oncogenic drivers in advanced prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2089920619,"The human X and Y chromosomes evolved from an ordinary pair of autosomes, but millions of years ago genetic decay ravaged the Y chromosome, and only three per cent of its ancestral genes survived. We reconstructed the evolution of the Y chromosome across eight mammals to identify biases in gene content and the selective pressures that preserved the surviving ancestral genes. Our findings indicate that survival was nonrandom, and in two cases, convergent across placental and marsupial mammals. We conclude that the gene content of the Y chromosome became specialized through selection to maintain the ancestral dosage of homologous X–Y gene pairs that function as broadly expressed regulators of transcription, translation and protein stability. We propose that beyond its roles in testis determination and spermatogenesis, the Y chromosome is essential for male viability, and has unappreciated roles in Turner’s syndrome and in phenotypic differences between the sexes in health and disease. A study comparing the Y chromosome across mammalian species reveals that selection to maintain the ancestral dosage of homologous X–Y gene pairs preserved a handful of genes on the Y chromosome while the rest were lost; the survival of broadly expressed dosage-sensitive regulators of gene expression suggest that the human Y chromosome is essential for male viability. Mammalian Y chromosomes, known for their roles in sex determination and male fertility, often contain repetitive sequences that make them harder to assemble than the rest of the genome. To counter this problem Henrik Kaessmann and colleagues have developed a new transcript assembly approach based on male-specific RNA/genomic sequencing data to explore Y evolution across 15 species representing all major mammalian lineages. They find evidence for two independent sex chromosome originations in mammals and one in birds. Their analysis of the Y/W gene repertoires suggests that although some genes evolved novel functions in sex determination/spermatogenesis as a result of temporal/spatial expression changes, most Y genes probably persisted, at least initially, as a result of dosage constraints. In a parallel study, Daniel Bellott and colleagues reconstructed the evolution of the Y chromosome, using a comprehensive comparative analysis of the genomic sequence of X–Y gene pairs from seven placental mammals and one marsupial. They conclude that evolution streamlined the gene content of the human Y chromosome through selection to maintain the ancestral dosage of homologous X–Y gene pairs that regulate gene expression throughout the body. They propose that these genes make the Y chromosome essential for male viability and contribute to differences between the sexes in health and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2022168094,"The skin has a dual function as a barrier and a sensory interface between the body and the environment. To protect against invading pathogens, the skin harbours specialized immune cells, including dermal dendritic cells (DDCs) and interleukin (IL)-17-producing γδ T (γδT17) cells, the aberrant activation of which by IL-23 can provoke psoriasis-like inflammation. The skin is also innervated by a meshwork of peripheral nerves consisting of relatively sparse autonomic and abundant sensory fibres. Interactions between the autonomic nervous system and immune cells in lymphoid organs are known to contribute to systemic immunity, but how peripheral nerves regulate cutaneous immune responses remains unclear. We exposed the skin of mice to imiquimod, which induces IL-23-dependent psoriasis-like inflammation. Here we show that a subset of sensory neurons expressing the ion channels TRPV1 and Nav1.8 is essential to drive this inflammatory response. Imaging of intact skin revealed that a large fraction of DDCs, the principal source of IL-23, is in close contact with these nociceptors. Upon selective pharmacological or genetic ablation of nociceptors, DDCs failed to produce IL-23 in imiquimod-exposed skin. Consequently, the local production of IL-23-dependent inflammatory cytokines by dermal γδT17 cells and the subsequent recruitment of inflammatory cells to the skin were markedly reduced. Intradermal injection of IL-23 bypassed the requirement for nociceptor communication with DDCs and restored the inflammatory response. These findings indicate that TRPV1(+)Nav1.8(+) nociceptors, by interacting with DDCs, regulate the IL-23/IL-17 pathway and control cutaneous immune responses."

https://openalex.org/W2077895679,"The small GTPase protein RAC1 participates in innate immunity by activating a complex program that includes cytoskeleton remodeling, chemotaxis, activation of NADPH oxidase, and modulation of gene expression. However, its role in regulating the transcriptional signatures that in term control the cellular inflammatory profiles are not well defined. Here we investigated the functional and mechanistic connection between RAC1 and the transcription factor NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2), master regulator of the anti-oxidant response. Lipopolysaccharide and constitutively active RAC1Q61L mutant induced the anti-oxidant enzyme heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) through activation of NRF2. The use of KEAP1-insensitive NRF2 mutants indicated that RAC1 regulation of NRF2 is KEAP1-independent. Interestingly, NRF2 overexpression inhibited, whereas a dominant-negative mutant of NRF2 exacerbated RAC1-dependent activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), suggesting that NRF2 has an antagonistic effect on the NF-κB pathway. Moreover, we found that RAC1 acts through NF-κB to induce NRF2 because either expression of a dominant negative mutant of IκBα that leads to NF-κB degradation or the use of p65-NF-κB-deficient cells demonstrated lower NRF2 protein levels and basally impaired NRF2 signature compared with control cells. In contrast, NRF2-deficient cells showed increased p65-NF-κB protein levels, although the mRNA levels remain unchanged, indicating post-translational alterations.

However, it is not known how cells activated by RAC1 ultimately change their gene expression back to a “resting” state or toward a resolution profile. One of the pathways implicated in the control of inflammation is the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2), 2The abbreviations used are:NRF2nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2AREantioxidant response elementHO-1heme oxygenase-1SFNsulforaphaneSODsuperoxide dismutaseDNdominant-negativeROSreactive oxygen speciesMEFmouse embryo fibroblastXIAPX-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosisqRTquantitative real-timeKeap1Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1. which is a master regulator of redox homeostasis (7Bryan H.K.

NRF2 regulates the expression of a battery of cytoprotective genes that share in common a cis-acting enhancer sequence termed antioxidant response element (ARE) (8Innamorato N.G. Lastres-Becker I.

The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of cold buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). After centrifugation in the same conditions indicated above, the nuclei were resuspended in loading buffer containing 0.5% SDS. The cytosolic and nuclear fractions were resolved in SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Total RNA from microglial primary cultures and from BV-2 cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). One microgram of RNA from each experimental condition was treated with DNase (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using 4 μl of High capacity RNA-to-cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Cells were transfected, and after 24 h of recovery from transfection, the cells were incubated with 2′-7′-dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate 100 mm for 1 h. Fluorescence intensity was measured in a Synergy fluorescence microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). The double-stranded oligonucleotide used for the NF-κB probe was 5′-AGTTGAGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (25Pan Q. Bao L.W. Merajver S.D.

Then 250 ng/μl concentrations of each oligonucleotide was annealed by incubation in STE buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) at 80 °C for 2 min. The mixture was cooled down slowly to 4 °C, with a thermal profile of 1 °C/min. Annealed oligonucleotides were diluted to 25 ng/μl in STE buffer. 5′-End labeling was performed with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) using 25 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotide and 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). The labeled probes were purified in a G-25 spin column (Amersham Biosciences). The binding reaction mixture contained 5 μg of nuclear protein extract diluted in a buffer containing, at final concentration, 40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1% dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) in a total volume of 20 μl. Unlabeled competitor probe (25 ng) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Labeled DNA (0.25 ng) was added to the mixture and was submitted to an additional 20 min incubation at 25 °C. Samples were resolved at 4 °C in a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis the gel was dried and autoradiographed. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. One and two-way analysis of variance with post hoc Newman-Keuls test and Bonferroni's test were used as appropriate. Student's t test was used to assess differences between groups. The Prism Version 5.03 software for Windows (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) was used as described in each figure legend. RAC1 activity was analyzed in cell lysates of BV-2 cells treated with LPS in a GST pulldown assay. This assay was based on the use of a chimeric protein made of glutathione S-transferase fused to the RAC1 interactive binding domain of p21-activated kinase 1 (Fig. 1A). We found that LPS (500 ng/ml) increased the levels of active RAC1 within 5 min and lasted for at least 40 min (Fig. 1B), indicating that RAC1 is implicated in LPS signaling. Moreover, LPS induced the expression of the antioxidant enzyme HO-1 in a dose-dependent fashion after 6 h (Fig. 1, C and D) and more markedly after 24 h (Fig. 1, E and D). To control that LPS was inducing an inflammatory response in BV-2 microglial cells, we determined the protein levels of IBA1, which is expressed in microglia and is up-regulated during the activation of these cells. LPS induced a dose-dependent and time-dependent increase of IBA1 protein levels (Fig. 1, C, E, and F), which correlated with the induction of HO-1. We also measured messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by qRT-PCR of two NRF2-regulated genes coding HO-1 and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1(NQO1) and two proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNF (Fig. 1, G–J, respectively) and found that treatment with LPS for 24 h increased the mRNA expression of NRF2-regulated genes and proinflammatory cytokines. These results indicate that RAC1 is activated very shortly after LPS stimulation leading to long term transcriptional modifications that include increased expression of HO-1. LPS stimulation of HEK-TLR4-MD2/CD14 cells (human HEK 293T cells are completely unresponsive to LPS but acquire high LPS sensitivity after transient transfection with CD14, TLR4, and MD-2) induced the expression of protein and mRNA levels of HO-1 (Fig. 2, A–C) after 6 and 24 h. Increased TNF mRNA levels confirmed the induction of inflammation due to LPS treatment (Fig. 2D). Besides, LPS induced nuclear translocation of p65 (Fig. 2, E and F) and NRF2 (Fig. 2, E and G) in a time-dependent manner and reached a maximum after 60 min. As observed in BV2 cells, LPS increased the levels of endogenous active RAC1 (Fig. 2, H and I), indicating that RAC1 activation is an essential effector of LPS inflammatory process. To analyze in depth the relevance of RAC1 activation on the NRF2 and NF-κB pathways, we transfected HEK293T cells with a constitutively active mutant of RAC1 (AU5-tagged RAC1Q61L) and analyzed the endogenous protein levels of HO-1 as a reporter of NRF2 transcriptional activity. Our results showed that RAC1Q61L increased HO-1 levels in a dose-response manner (Fig. 2, J and K), suggesting a direct connection between RAC1 activation and expression of the gene coding HO-1 (HMOX1). To further confirm these data, we analyzed the induction of two firefly luciferase reporters containing either 15 kb of the mouse Hmox1 promoter or three tandem sequences of the NRF2-dependent antioxidant response element (ARE-LUC) derived from the Hmox1 promoter. We found a dose-dependent activation of both reporters (Fig. 2, L and M). These results indicate that NRF2 mediates the RAC1-dependent up-regulation of HO-1 expression. To determine if RAC1Q61L leads to an increase in NRF2 protein levels, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with different concentrations of RAC1Q61L and a constant concentration of a V5-tagged wild type form of NRF2 (NRF2-V5) or a stable mutant of NRF2, NRF2ΔETGE-V5, that lacks four residues (ETGE) essential for recognition by the E3 ligase complex Cul3/Keap1. The results indicated that RAC1Q61L produced a dose-dependent accumulation of both wild type NRF2-V5 and mutant NRF2ΔETGE-V5 (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, we observed by subcellular fractionation that the overexpression of RAC1Q61L induced a very strong increase in NRF2 protein levels in both cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the implication of NRF2 in RAC1-induced HO-1 expression was analyzed with two different strategies. First, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the expression vector for RAC1Q61L, a dominant-negative mutant of NRF2 (DN-NRF2) lacking the transcriptional activation domain and the luciferase reporter HO-1-LUC. We observed that DN-NRF2 abolished the RAC1Q61L-mediated induction of HO-1-LUC reporter (Fig. 3D). Second, we used a one-hybrid assay to study the transactivating activity of NRF2 in the presence of RAC1Q61L. The assay consisted of the use of an expression vector for a fusion protein containing the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and NRF2 (Gal4-NRF2). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with RAC1Q61L, Gal4-NRF2, and the Gal4-LUC reporter plasmid as indicated in Fig. 3E. After 16 h, cells co-transfected with RAC1Q61L and Gal4-NRF2 exhibited a very strong increase in luciferase activity compared with that of cells co-transfected with Gal4-LUC and empty vector. Interestingly, RAC1Q61L highly increased the transactivating activity of NRF2 compared with NRF2 alone (Fig. 3E), indicating that RAC1Q61L activates NRF2 by targeting its transactivation domain. Taken together, all these data showed that active RAC1 led to accumulation of NRF2, resulting in increased ARE gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2076047381,"The urothelium is a sensory structure that contributes to mechanosensation in the urinary bladder. Here, we provide evidence for a critical role for the Piezo1 channel, a newly identified mechanosensory molecule, in the mouse bladder urothelium. We performed a systematic analysis of the molecular and functional expression of Piezo1 channels in the urothelium. Immunofluorescence examination demonstrated abundant expression of Piezo1 in the mouse and human urothelium. Urothelial cells isolated from mice exhibited a Piezo1-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations in response to mechanical stretch stimuli, leading to potent ATP release; this response was suppressed in Piezo1-knockdown cells. In addition, Piezo1 and TRPV4 distinguished different intensities of mechanical stimulus. Moreover, GsMTx4, an inhibitor of stretch-activated channels, attenuated the Ca(2+) influx into urothelial cells and decreased ATP release from them upon stretch stimulation. These results suggest that Piezo1 senses extension of the bladder urothelium, leading to production of an ATP signal. Thus, inhibition of Piezo1 might provide a promising means of treating bladder dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2009974397,"The emerging view of Nε-lysine acetylation in eukaryotes is of a relatively abundant post-translational modification (PTM) that has a major impact on the function, structure, stability and/or location of thousands of proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. This PTM is typically considered to arise by the donation of the acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme A (acCoA) to the ε-amino group of a lysine residue that is reversibly catalyzed by lysine acetyltransferases and deacetylases. Here, we provide genetic, mass spectrometric, biochemical and structural evidence that Nε-lysine acetylation is an equally abundant and important PTM in bacteria. Applying a recently developed, label-free and global mass spectrometric approach to an isogenic set of mutants, we detected acetylation of thousands of lysine residues on hundreds of Escherichia coli proteins that participate in diverse and often essential cellular processes, including translation, transcription and central metabolism. Many of these acetylations were regulated in an acetyl phosphate (acP)-dependent manner, providing compelling evidence for a recently reported mechanism of bacterial Nε-lysine acetylation. These mass spectrometric data, coupled with observations made by crystallography, biochemistry, and additional mass spectrometry showed that this acP-dependent acetylation is both non-enzymatic and specific, with specificity determined by the accessibility, reactivity and three-dimensional microenvironment of the target lysine. Crystallographic evidence shows acP can bind to proteins in active sites and cofactor binding sites, but also potentially anywhere molecules with a phosphate moiety could bind. Finally, we provide evidence that acP-dependent acetylation can impact the function of critical enzymes, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triosephosphate isomerase, and RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1997117513,"Observations of a longer growing season through earlier plant growth in temperate to polar regions have been thought to be a response to climate warming. However, data from experimental warming studies indicate that many species that initiate leaf growth and flowering earlier also reach seed maturation and senesce earlier, shortening their active and reproductive periods. A conceptual model to explain this apparent contradiction, and an analysis of the effect of elevated CO2--which can delay annual life cycle events--on changing season length, have not been tested. Here we show that experimental warming in a temperate grassland led to a longer growing season through earlier leaf emergence by the first species to leaf, often a grass, and constant or delayed senescence by other species that were the last to senesce, supporting the conceptual model. Elevated CO2 further extended growing, but not reproductive, season length in the warmed grassland by conserving water, which enabled most species to remain active longer. Our results suggest that a longer growing season, especially in years or biomes where water is a limiting factor, is not due to warming alone, but also to higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations that extend the active period of plant annual life cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2017741820,"The trade-off between the need to obtain new knowledge and the need to use that knowledge to improve performance is one of the most basic trade-offs in nature, and optimal performance usually requires some balance between exploratory and exploitative behaviors. Researchers in many disciplines have been searching for the optimal solution to this dilemma. Here we present a novel model in which the exploration strategy itself is dynamic and varies with time in order to optimize a definite goal, such as the acquisition of energy, money, or prestige. Our model produced four very distinct phases: Knowledge establishment, Knowledge accumulation, Knowledge maintenance, and Knowledge exploitation, giving rise to a multidisciplinary framework that applies equally to humans, animals, and organizations. The framework can be used to explain a multitude of phenomena in various disciplines, such as the movement of animals in novel landscapes, the most efficient resource allocation for a start-up company, or the effects of old age on knowledge acquisition in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2057540315,"The proliferation of artificial container habitats in urban areas has benefitted urban adaptable mosquito species globally. In areas where mosquitoes transmit viruses and parasites, it can promote vector population productivity and fuel mosquito-borne disease outbreaks. In Britain, storage of water in garden water butts is increasing, potentially expanding mosquito larval habitats and influencing population dynamics and mosquito-human contact. Here we show that the community composition, abundance and phenology of mosquitoes breeding in experimental water butt containers were influenced by urbanisation. Mosquitoes in urban containers were less species-rich but present in significantly higher densities (100.4±21.3) per container than those in rural containers (77.7±15.1). Urban containers were dominated by Culex pipiens (a potential vector of West Nile Virus [WNV]) and appear to be increasingly exploited by Anopheles plumbeus (a human-biting potential WNV and malaria vector). Culex phenology was influenced by urban land use type, with peaks in larval abundances occurring earlier in urban than rural containers. Among other factors, this was associated with an urban heat island effect which raised urban air and water temperatures by 0.9°C and 1.2°C respectively. Further increases in domestic water storage, particularly in urban areas, in combination with climate changes will likely alter mosquito population dynamics in the UK."

An earlier study investigating variation in BSL numeral signs found that younger signers were using a decreasing variety of regionally distinct variants, suggesting that levelling may be taking place. Here, we report findings from a larger investigation looking at regional lexical variants for colours, countries, numbers and UK placenames elicited as part of the BSL Corpus Project. Age, school location and language background were significant predictors of lexical variation, with younger signers using a more levelled variety. This change appears to be happening faster in particular sub-groups of the deaf community (e.g., signers from hearing families). Also, we find that for the names of some UK cities, signers from outside the region use a different sign than those who live in the region."

Cells rely on various mechanisms to either remove lesions or bypass them in a more or less error-prone fashion.

TLS pols generally exhibit lower processivity, catalytic efficiency, and copying fidelity on undamaged DNA than high fidelity pols. However, we observed that the pol κ homolog Dpo4 from Sulfolobus solfataricus bypasses 8-oxoG with high fidelity (19:1 ratio of dCTP:dATP incorporation opposite 8-oxoG) and efficiency (pre-steady-state kinetics revealed faster rates of dCTP incorporation opposite 8-oxoG than G) (30Zang H.

Chem. 2007; 282: 19831-19843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). By comparison, we established that human pol κ (hpol κ) bypasses 8-oxoG in an error-prone fashion, with dATP rather than dCTP preferentially incorporated opposite the lesion (32Irimia A. Eoff R.L. Guengerich F.P. Egli M. Structural and functional elucidation of the mechanism promoting error-prone synthesis by human DNA polymerase κ opposite the 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine adduct.J.

Its proclivity to insert A opposite 8-oxoG resembles the action of replicative polymerases (33Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P.

Bumps in the road: how replicative DNA polymerases see DNA damage.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Among the eukaryotic TLS pols, pol η is considered to play an important role in 8-oxoG bypass, although initial assays using human large-cell carcinoma cell line H1299 and xeroderma pigmentosum variant (defective in pol η) cells showed that the nucleotide inserted opposite 8-oxoG was the correct C at frequencies of 81 and 77%, respectively (35Avkin S. Livneh Z. Efficiency, specificity and DNA polymerase-dependence of translesion replication across the oxidative DNA lesion 8-oxoguanine in human cells.Mutat. Res. 2002; 510: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, mutation frequencies were increased in mammalian GM637 and in xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells in the presence of siRNA targeting pol η (36Lee D.H. Pfeifer G.P. Translesion synthesis of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine by DNA polymerase η in vivo.Mutat. Res. 2008; 641: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the same system knockdown of MMR glycosylase OGG1 also triggered an increase in mutagenesis, providing support for the hypothesis that both the MMR and TLS systems combat mutagenic damage due to 8-oxoG. Overlaps between MMR and TLS were confirmed by a recent in vivo study in yeast. The A residues opposite 8-oxoG were removed by MMR, subsequently triggering re-replication and, in the absence of MMR, by pol η TLS, with an accuracy of insertion of dCTP opposite 8-oxoG of 94% (37Rodriguez G.P. Song J.B. Crouse G.F. In vivo bypass of 8-oxoG.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003682Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Other investigators using yeast-based assays and/or the enzyme from yeast observed accurate and efficient bypass of 8-oxoG by pol η (38Haracska L. Yu S.L. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Efficient and accurate replication in the presence of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine by DNA polymerase η.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), whereby C, A, or G was incorporated opposite 8-oxoG with a relative efficiency of 100:56:14 (39Yuan F. Zhang Y. Rajpal D.K. Wu X.

Moreover, pol η binds dCTP opposite both G and 8-oxoG with similar affinities and inserts the correct nucleotide opposite both G and 8-oxoG with similar rates (40Carlson K.D. Washington M.T. Mechanism of efficient and accurate nucleotide incorporation opposite 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine by Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase η.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2169-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Structural data for the complexes between yeast pol η with 8-oxoG:C (bound at the insertion and extension stages) were in line with the relatively accurate bypass of 8-oxoG by this enzyme but allowed no comparison with insertion of dATP opposite 8-oxoG or extension from 8-oxoG:A (41Silverstein T.D. Jain R. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K.

An investigation entailing six human B-, X-, and Y-family pols established that (relative to dATP) correct incorporation of dCTP opposite 8-oxoG in the presence of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen and replication protein A auxiliary proteins is 1,200- and 68-fold more efficient for pol λ and pol η, respectively (42Maga G. Villani G. Crespan E. Wimmer U. Ferrari E. Bertocci B. Hübscher U. 8-Oxo-guanine bypass by human DNA polymerases in the presence of auxiliary proteins.Nature. 2007; 447: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). An important role of pol λ in combination with pol δ for bypass of 8-oxoG was also established in vitro using mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HeLa cells (43Markkanen E. Castrec B. Villani G. Hübscher U. A switch between polymerases δ and λ promotes error-free bypass of 8-oxo-G lesions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 20401-20406Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The somewhat inconsistent observations regarding the accuracy of 8-oxoG bypass catalyzed by pol η in cells are mirrored by the results from in vitro primer extension experiments probing its ability to correctly insert dCTP instead of dATP. Yung et al. (44Yung C. Suzuki T. Okugawa Y. Kawakami A. Loakes D. Negishi K. Negishi T. Nucleotide incorporation against 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine is influenced by neighboring base sequences in TLS DNA polymerase reaction.Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 2007; 51: 49-50Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) tested the bypass of 8-oxoG by human pol η (hpol η) in vitro in four different sequence contexts and found that the identity of the nucleotide 5′-adjacent to 8-oxoG had a significant effect on the incorporation efficiency and accuracy. Thus, for the sequences 5′-oligo-CGX, -CCX, -CAX, and -CTX (X = 8-oxoG), the dC:dA ratio varied between 1.1 and 2.9 (lowest for CAX and highest for CCX). However, the efficiency was lowest for the CCX and highest for the CAX oligonucleotide. Conversely, the dC:dG ratio was lowest for the CAX (2.0) and highest for the CGX oligonucleotide (7.7). Using a 30-mer oligonucleotide with a single 8-oxoG for in vitro bypass, Zhang et al. (45Zhang Y. Yuan F. Wu X. Wang M. Rechkoblit O. Taylor J.-S. Geacintov N.E. Wang Z. Error-free and error-prone lesion bypass by human DNA polymerase κ in vitro.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4138-4146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed relatively error-prone insertion opposite 8-oxoG by hpol η (dC:dA ≈1:1 based on Vmax/Km) as well as similar efficiencies for extension from either 8-oxoG:C or 8-oxoG:A (5:3). Using oligonucleotides corresponding to a region of the human c-Ha-ras gene and containing either one or two 8-oxoG residues, Jaloszynski et al. (46Jaloszyński P. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Perez A.B. Nishimura S. 8-Hydroxyguanine in a mutational hotspot of the c-Ha-ras gene causes misreplication, ‘action-at-a-distance' mutagenesis and inhibition of replication.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6085-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) found that the ratios between the efficiencies (kcat/Km) of dC and dA incorporation opposite the adduct varied between 8.5 and 2.4 (C > A). The lower ratio is similar to the results obtained by McCulloch et al. (47McCulloch S.D. Kokoska R.J. Garg P. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. The efficiency and fidelity of 8-oxo-guanine bypass by DNA polymerases δ and η.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 2830-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), who reported that the pol η enzymes from mouse and human show error rates for in vitro bypass of 8-oxoG that approach 50%, in line with the data by others that support similar efficiencies for insertion of either dC or dA opposite 8-oxoG as well as for the extension of the resulting pairs by the human enzyme (42Maga G. Villani G. Crespan E. Wimmer U. Ferrari E. Bertocci B. Hübscher U. 8-Oxo-guanine bypass by human DNA polymerases in the presence of auxiliary proteins.Nature. 2007; 447: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 45Zhang Y. Yuan F. Wu X. Wang M.

Clearly, these results are inconsistent with the error-free bypass of 8-oxoG by pol η. Thus, the enzyme appears (based on this literature) to have inherently less fidelity than Dpo4, which synthesizes past the lesion with high accuracy and efficiency. pol η displays an unmatched ability to replicate past UV-induced cyclic pyrimidine dimers (48Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Efficient bypass of a thymine-thymine dimer by yeast DNA polymerase Polη.Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), and a deficiency in the polymerase is the basis for a variant form of the human syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum, characterized by a highly elevated occurrence of skin malignancies (49Masutani C.

Prakash L. hRAD30 mutations in the variant form of xeroderma pigmentosum.Science. 1999; 285: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). pol η also facilitates TLS past cancer drug adducts such as cisplatin (51Vaisman A. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Chaney S.G. Efficient translesion replication past oxaliplatin and cisplatin GpG adducts by human DNA polymerase η.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4575-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and thus lowers the cellular sensitivity to treatment. Structural studies on hpol η have focused on complexes of the catalytic core with DNA template-primer constructs containing cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimers and have disclosed how the polymerase accommodates two nucleotides at the active site (52Biertümpfel C. Zhao Y. Kondo Y. Ramón-Maiques S. Gregory M. Lee J.Y. Masutani C. Lehmann A.R. Hanaoka F. Yang W. Structure and mechanism of human DNA polymerase η.Nature. 2010; 465: 1044-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Elegant work by Yang and co-workers (53Nakamura T. Zhao Y. Yamagata Y. Hua Y.J. Yang W. Watching DNA polymerase η make a phosphodiester bond.Nature. 2012; 487: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) has provided insight into the step-by-step mechanism of pol η bypass and phosphodiester bond formation. Crystal structures of the enzymes from yeast (54Alt A. Lammens K. Chiocchini C. Lammens A. Pieck J.C. Kuch D. Hopfner K.P. Carell T.

Biertümpfel C. Gregory M.T. Hua Y.J. Hanaoka F. Yang W. Structural basis of human polymerase η-mediated chemoresistance to cisplatin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 7269-7274Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), in complex with cisplatin-modified DNA, have also provided a better understanding of the correct insertion of dCTP opposite the distorted cross-linked G dimer and the efficient extension after the lesion. No structures of hpol η in complex with DNA containing the 8-oxoG adduct have been reported to date. To evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of in vitro bypass of 8-oxoG by hpol η, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the bypass activity of the catalytic core of the enzyme, including steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics of primer extension opposite and beyond 8-oxoG and LC-MS/MS assays of full-length extension products. To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of 8-oxoG bypass by hpol η, we determined crystal structures of the native hpol η complex (G:dCTP; reference structure), three insertion-stage complexes with 8-oxoG paired to dCTP, dATP, or dGTP, and two complexes capturing the extension steps following 8-oxoG:C or 8-oxoG:A. Our analysis demonstrates that hpol η inserts almost exclusively dCTP opposite template 8-oxoG, with Arg-61 from the finger domain playing a crucial role in the discrimination against dATP, and that the polymerase achieves error-free bypass of the 8-oxoG lesion at the insertion stage. All unlabeled dNTPs were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All nonhydrolyzable dNMPNPPs were obtained from Jena Bioscience (Jena, Germany). All oligonucleotides used in this work were synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX), TriLink Biotechnologies (San Diego), or Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), and in some cases they were purified using HPLC by the manufacturer, with analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight MS. The hpol η plasmid (pET28a) comprising residues 1–432 was a generous gift from Dr. Wei Yang, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health. The polymerase was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (52Biertümpfel C. Zhao Y. Kondo Y. Ramón-Maiques S. Gregory M. Lee J.Y. Masutani C. Lehmann A.R. Hanaoka F. Yang W. Structure and mechanism of human DNA polymerase η.Nature. 2010; 465: 1044-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The protein solution was concentrated to 5 mg/ml. Steady-state incubation typically included 2.5–10 nm hpol η, 5 μm template-primer oligonucleotide mixture as substrate (the primer was 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled, and template-primer duplexes (1:1 molar ratio) were pre-annealed by heating and slow cooling), 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 5% glycerol (v/v), 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and varying concentrations of a single dNTP (added last to start the reaction). The incubation temperature was 37 °C, and reactions were typically run for 5 min (or less to keep product formation <20% of the oligonucleotide substrate concentration). Reactions were quenched by the addition of a quench reagent containing formamide, EDTA, bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol (56Lowe L.G. Guengerich F.P. Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of dNTP insertion opposite 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine by Escherichia coli polymerases I exo− and II exo−.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9840-9849Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and aliquots were applied to an 18% (w/v) acrylamide, 7.5 m urea gel and separated by electrophoresis. Fluorescence in the substrate and product primer bands was scanned using a Typhoon system (GE Healthcare) and quantified by ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), and the data were fit to hyperbolic plots (Michaelis-Menten equation) using the program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). A KinTek RP-3 instrument was used, utilizing general procedures described previously (56Lowe L.G. Guengerich F.P.

In a typical experiment, 50 nm hpol η was incubated with 500 nm oligonucleotide (5′-32P-primer/unlabeled template) and rapidly mixed with 0.5 mm dNTP in the same buffer system used in the steady-state kinetic studies (see above), incubated for varying lengths of time (10 ms to 5 s), and quenched by the addition of 0.5 mm EDTA (from the quench line). Radioactivity in the substrate and product primer bands was quantified using a phosphorimager system (Bio-Rad), and the data were fit with the log-linear relationship y = Aekpt + kss, where kp is the first-order rate for the first catalytic cycle; kss is the steady-state rate, and A is the extent of t"

A 'think aloud' protocol was applied, whereby participants verbalized their thinking while making choices. Internal validity and acceptability were assessed through a thematic analysis of the decision-making process emerging from the qualitative data and a repeated choice task.A thematic analysis of the decision-making process demonstrated clear evidence of 'trading' between multiple attribute/levels for the DCE, and to a lesser extent for the BWS task. Limited evidence consistent with a sequential decision-making model was observed for the BWS task. For the BWS task, some participants found choosing the worst attribute/level conceptually challenging. A desire to provide a complete ranking from best to worst was observed. The majority (18,75%) of participants indicated a preference for DCE, as they felt this enabled comparison of alternative full profiles. Those preferring BWS were averse to choosing an undesirable characteristic that was part of a 'package', or perceived BWS to be less ethically conflicting or burdensome. In a repeated choice task, more participants were consistent for the DCE (22,92%) than BWS (10,42%) (p = 0.002).This study supports the validity and acceptability of the traditional DCE format. Findings relating to the application of BWS profile methods are less definitive. Research avenues to further clarify the comparative merits of these preference elicitation methods are identified."
https://openalex.org/W1974986886,"Among metal pollutants silver ions are one of the most toxic forms, and have thus been assigned to the highest toxicity class. Its toxicity to a wide range of microorganisms combined with its low toxicity to humans lead to the development of a wealth of silver-based products in many bactericidal applications accounting to more than 1000 nano-technology-based consumer products. Accordingly, silver is a widely distributed metal in the environment originating from its different forms of application as metal, salt and nanoparticle. A realistic assessment of silver nanoparticle toxicity in natural waters is, however, problematic and needs to be linked to experimental approaches. Here we apply metatranscriptome sequencing allowing for elucidating reactions of whole communities present in a water sample to stressors. We compared the toxicity of ionic silver and ligand-free silver nanoparticles by short term exposure on a natural community of aquatic microorganisms. We analyzed the effects of the treatments on metabolic pathways and species composition on the eukaryote metatranscriptome level in order to describe immediate molecular responses of organisms using a community approach. We found significant differences between the samples treated with 5 µg/L AgNO3 compared to the controls, but no significant differences in the samples treated with AgNP compared to the control samples. Statistical analysis yielded 126 genes (KO-IDs) with significant differential expression with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 between the control (KO) and AgNO3 (NO3) groups. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed significant results with a FDR below 0.05 for pathways related to photosynthesis. Our study therefore supports the view that ionic silver rather than silver nanoparticles are responsible for silver toxicity. Nevertheless, our results highlight the strength of metatranscriptome approaches for assessing metal toxicity on aquatic communities."

In this study, we identified SK1 as a target of the canonical FGF2/FGF receptor 1 activation pathway in endothelial cells and sought to identify novel transcriptional pathways that mediate lipid signaling. Studies using the 1.9-kb SK1 promoter and deletion mutants revealed that basal and FGF2-stimulated promoter activity occurred through two GC-rich regions located within 633 bp of the transcription start site. Screening for GC-rich binding transcription factors that could activate this site demonstrated that KLF14, a gene implicated in obesity and the metabolic syndrome, binds to this region. Congruently, overexpression of KLF14 increased basal and FGF2-stimulated SK1 promoter activity by 3-fold, and this effect was abrogated after mutation of the GC-rich sites. In addition, KLF14 siRNA transfection decreased SK1 mRNA and protein levels by 3-fold. Congruently, SK1 mRNA and protein levels were decreased in livers from KLF14 knock-out mice. Combined, luciferase, gel shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that KLF14 couples to p300 to increase the levels of histone marks associated with transcriptional activation (H4K8ac and H3K14ac), while decreasing repressive marks (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3). Collectively, the results demonstrate a novel mechanism whereby SK1 lipid signaling is regulated by epigenetic modifications conferred by KLF14 and p300.

https://openalex.org/W2170630161,"In spite of extensive research, the mechanisms of reproductive disease associated with Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSv) are still poorly understood. The objectives of this large scale study were to evaluate associations between viral load and fetal preservation, determine the impact of type 2 PRRSv on fetal weights, and investigate changes in ORF5 PRRSv genome in dams and fetuses during a 21-day period following challenge. At gestation day 85 (±1), 114 gilts were experimentally infected with type 2 PRRSv, while 19 gilts served as reference controls. At necropsy, fetuses were categorized according to their preservation status and tissue samples were collected. PRRSv RNA concentrations were measured in gilt serum collected on days 0, 2, 6, and 21 post-infection, as well as in gilt and fetal tissues collected at termination. Fetal mortality was 41±22.8% in PRRS infected litters. Dead fetuses appeared to cluster in some litters but appeared solitary or random in others. Nine percent of surviving piglets were meconium-stained. PRRSv RNA concentration in fetal thymus, fetal serum and endometrium differed significantly across preservation category and was greatest in tissues of meconium-stained fetuses. This, together with the virtual absence of meconium staining in non-infected litters indicates it is an early pathological condition of reproductive PRRS. Viral load in fetal thymus and in fetal serum was positively associated with viral load in endometrium, suggesting the virus exploits dynamic linkages between individual maternal-fetal compartments. Point mutations in ORF5 sequences from gilts and fetuses were randomly located in 20 positions in ORF5, but neither nucleotide nor amino acid substitutions were associated with fetal preservation.

The considerable variation in gilt and fetal outcomes provides tremendous opportunity for more detailed investigations of potential mechanisms and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with fetal death."
https://openalex.org/W1992380787,"Biologists routinely use molecular markers to identify conservation units, to quantify genetic connectivity, to estimate population sizes, and to identify targets of selection. Many imperiled eagle populations require such efforts and would benefit from enhanced genomic resources. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the first eagle genome using DNA from a male golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) captured in western North America. We constructed genomic libraries that were sequenced using Illumina technology and assembled the high-quality data to a depth of ∼40x coverage. The genome assembly includes 2,552 scaffolds >10 Kb and 415 scaffolds >1.2 Mb. We annotated 16,571 genes that are involved in myriad biological processes, including such disparate traits as beak formation and color vision. We also identified repetitive regions spanning 92 Mb (∼6% of the assembly), including LINES, SINES, LTR-RTs and DNA transposons. The mitochondrial genome encompasses 17,332 bp and is ∼91% identical to the Mountain Hawk-Eagle (Nisaetus nipalensis). Finally, the data reveal that several anonymous microsatellites commonly used for population studies are embedded within protein-coding genes and thus may not have evolved in a neutral fashion. Because the genome sequence includes ∼800,000 novel polymorphisms, markers can now be chosen based on their proximity to functional genes involved in migration, carnivory, and other biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1972455768,"Alterations of social cognition and dysfunctional interpersonal expectations are thought to play an important role in the etiology of depression and have, thus, become a key target of psychotherapeutic interventions. The underlying neurobiology, however, remains elusive. Based upon the idea of a close link between affective and introspective processes relevant for social interactions and alterations thereof in states of depression, we used a meta-analytically informed network analysis to investigate resting-state functional connectivity in an introspective socio-affective (ISA) network in individuals with and without depression. Results of our analysis demonstrate significant differences between the groups with depressed individuals showing hyperconnectivity of the ISA network. These findings demonstrate that neurofunctional alterations exist in individuals with depression in a neural network relevant for introspection and socio-affective processing, which may contribute to the interpersonal difficulties that are linked to depressive symptomatology."
https://openalex.org/W2016938628,"Regional scale habitat suitability models provide finer scale resolution and more focused predictions of where organisms may occur. Previous modelling approaches have focused primarily on local and/or global scales, while regional scale models have been relatively few. In this study, regional scale predictive habitat models are presented for deep-sea corals for the U.S. West Coast (California, Oregon and Washington). Model results are intended to aid in future research or mapping efforts and to assess potential coral habitat suitability both within and outside existing bottom trawl closures (i.e. Essential Fish Habitat (EFH)) and identify suitable habitat within U.S. National Marine Sanctuaries (NMS). Deep-sea coral habitat suitability was modelled at 500 m×500 m spatial resolution using a range of physical, chemical and environmental variables known or thought to influence the distribution of deep-sea corals. Using a spatial partitioning cross-validation approach, maximum entropy models identified slope, temperature, salinity and depth as important predictors for most deep-sea coral taxa. Large areas of highly suitable deep-sea coral habitat were predicted both within and outside of existing bottom trawl closures and NMS boundaries. Predicted habitat suitability over regional scales are not currently able to identify coral areas with pin point accuracy and probably overpredict actual coral distribution due to model limitations and unincorporated variables (i.e. data on distribution of hard substrate) that are known to limit their distribution. Predicted habitat results should be used in conjunction with multibeam bathymetry, geological mapping and other tools to guide future research efforts to areas with the highest probability of harboring deep-sea corals. Field validation of predicted habitat is needed to quantify model accuracy, particularly in areas that have not been sampled."
https://openalex.org/W2002973590,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying multi-drug resistance (MDR) is one of the major challenges in current cancer research. A phenomenon which is common to both intrinsic and acquired resistance, is the aberrant alteration of gene expression in drug-resistant cancers. Although such dysregulation depends on many possible causes, an epigenetic characterization is considered a main driver. Recent studies have suggested a direct role for epigenetic inactivation of genes in determining tumor chemo-sensitivity. We investigated the effects of the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and hystone deacethylase (HDAC), considered to reverse the epigenetic aberrations and lead to the re-expression of de novo methylated genes in MDR osteosarcoma (OS) cells. Based on our analysis of the HosDXR150 cell line, we found that in order to reduce cell proliferation, co-treatment of MDR OS cells with DNMT (5-Aza-dC, DAC) and HDAC (Trichostatin A, TSA) inhibitors is more effective than relying on each treatment alone. In re-expressing epigenetically silenced genes induced by treatments, a very specific regulation takes place which suggests that methylation and de-acetylation have occurred either separately or simultaneously to determine MDR OS phenotype. In particular, functional relationships have been reported after measuring differential gene expression, indicating that MDR OS cells acquired growth and survival advantage by simultaneous epigenetic inactivation of both multiple p53-independent apoptotic signals and osteoblast differentiation pathways. Furthermore, co-treatment results more efficient in inducing the re-expression of some main pathways according to the computed enrichment, thus emphasizing its potential towards representing an effective therapeutic option for MDR OS."
https://openalex.org/W1996240908,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor coordination and retinal degeneration with no current therapies in the clinic. The causative mutation is an expanded CAG repeat in the ataxin-7 gene whose mutant protein product causes cerebellar and brainstem degeneration and retinal cone-rod dystrophy. Here, we reduced the expression of both mutant and wildtype ataxin-7 in the SCA7 mouse retina by RNA interference and evaluated retinal function 23 weeks post injection. We observed a preservation of normal retinal function and no adverse toxicity with ≥50% reduction of mutant and wildtype ataxin-7 alleles. These studies address an important safety concern regarding non-allele specific silencing of ataxin-7 for SCA7 retinal therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2114731212,"The purpose of this study was to use mismatch responses (MMRs) to explore the dynamic changes of Mandarin speech perception abilities from early to middle childhood. Twenty preschoolers, 18 school-aged children, and 26 adults participated in this study. Two sets of synthesized speech stimuli varying in Mandarin consonant (alveolo-palatal affricate vs. fricative) and lexical tone features (rising vs. contour tone) were used to examine the developmental course of speech perception abilities. The results indicated that only the adult group demonstrated typical early mismatch negativity (MMN) responses, suggesting that the ability to discriminate specific speech cues in Mandarin consonant and lexical tone is a continuing process in preschool- and school-aged children. Additionally, distinct MMR patterns provided evidence indicating diverse developmental courses to different speech characteristics. By incorporating data from the two speech conditions, we propose using MMR profiles consisting of mismatch negativity (MMN), positive mismatch response (p-MMR), and late discriminative negativity (LDN) as possible brain indices to investigate speech perception development."
https://openalex.org/W2085523612,"PR-domain 9 (Prdm9) is the first hybrid sterility gene identified in mammals. The incompatibility between Prdm9 from Mus musculus domesticus (Mmd; the B6 strain) and the Hstx2 region of chromosome (Chr) X from M. m. musculus (Mmm; the PWD strain) participates in the complete meiotic arrest of mouse intersubspecific (PWD×B6)F1 hybrid males. Other studies suggest that also semisterile intersubspecific hybrids are relevant for mouse speciation, but the genes responsible remain unknown. To investigate the causes of this semisterility, we analyzed the role of Prdm9 and Chr X in hybrids resulting from the crosses of PWK, another Mmm-derived inbred strain. We demonstrate that Prdm9 and Chr X control the partial meiotic arrest and reduced sperm count in (PWK×B6)F1 males. Asynapsis of heterosubspecific chromosomes and semisterility were partially suppressed by removal of the B6 allele of Prdm9. Polymorphisms between PWK and PWD on Chr X but not in the Prdm9 region were responsible for the modification of the outcome of Prdm9-Chr X F1 hybrid incompatibility. Furthermore, (PWK×B6)F1 hybrid males displayed delayed fertility dependent on the Prdm9 incompatibility. While the Drosophila hybrid sterility gene Overdrive causes both delayed fertility and increased transmission of its own chromosome to the offspring, the segregation of Chr X and the Prdm9 region from the mouse (PWK×B6)F1 males was normal. Our results indicate extended functional consequences of Prdm9-Chr X intersubspecific incompatibility on the fertility of hybrids and should influence the design of fertility analyses in hybrid zones and of laboratory crosses between Mmm and Mmd strains."

However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we examined the effects of a super-low dose of LPS on low-grade inflammation in macrophages as well as underlying mechanisms. We observed that a super-low dose of LPS induces mitochondrial fission and cell necroptosis in primary murine macrophages, dependent upon interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK-1). Mechanistically, our study reveals that a super-low dose of LPS causes protein ubiquitination and degradation of mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), a molecule required for maintaining proper mitochondrial fusion. A super-low dose of LPS also leads to dephosphorylation and activation of Drp1, a molecule responsible for mitochondrial fission and cell necroptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a super-low dose of LPS activates receptor interacting protein 3 kinase (RIP3), a key molecule critical for the assembly of the necrosome complex, the initiation of Drp1 dephosphorylation, and necroptosis. The effects of a super-low dose of LPS are abolished in macrophages harvested from IRAK-1-deficient mice. Taken together, our study identified a novel molecular pathway that leads to cellular stress and necroptosis in macrophages challenged with a super-low dose of endotoxin.

https://openalex.org/W2036194253,"The use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins in food animals has been suggested to increase the risk of spread of Enterobacteriaceae carrying extended-spectrum β-lactamases to humans. However, evidence that selection of extended-spectrum cephalosporin–resistant bacteria owing to the actual veterinary use of these drugs according to criteria established in cattle has not been demonstrated. In this study, we investigated the natural occurrence of cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli in dairy cattle following clinical application of ceftiofur. E. coli isolates were obtained from rectal samples of treated and untreated cattle (n = 20/group) cultured on deoxycholate-hydrogen sulfide-lactose agar in the presence or absence of ceftiofur. Eleven cefazoline-resistant isolates were obtained from two of the ceftiofur-treated cattle; no cefazoline-resistant isolates were found in untreated cattle. The cefazoline-resistant isolates had mutations in the chromosomal ampC promoter region and remained susceptible to ceftiofur. Eighteen extended-spectrum cephalosporin–resistant isolates from two ceftiofur-treated cows were obtained on ceftiofur-supplemented agar; no extended-spectrum cephalosporin–resistant isolates were obtained from untreated cattle. These extended-spectrum cephalosporin–resistant isolates possessed plasmid-mediated β-lactamase genes, including blaCTX-M-2 (9 isolates), blaCTX-M-14 (8 isolates), or blaCMY-2 (1 isolate); isolates possessing blaCTX-M-2 and blaCTX-M-14 were clonally related. These genes were located on self-transmissible plasmids. Our results suggest that appropriate veterinary use of ceftiofur did not trigger growth extended-spectrum cephalosporin–resistant E. coli in the bovine rectal flora; however, ceftiofur selection in vitro suggested that additional ceftiofur exposure enhanced selection for specific extended-spectrum cephalosporin–resistant β-lactamase-expressing E. coli clones"
https://openalex.org/W2115503868,"Trace elements are vital for the growth and development of all organisms. Little is known about the elemental content and trace metal biology of Red Sea demosponges. This study establishes an initial database of sponge elemental content. It provides the necessary foundation for further research of the mechanisms used by sponges to regulate the uptake, accumulation, and storage of metals. The metal content of 16 common sponge species was determined using ICP measurements. A combination of statistical methods was used to determine the correlations between the metals and detect species with significantly high or low concentrations of these metals. Bioaccumulation factors were calculated to compare sponge metal content to local sediment. Theonella swinhoei contained an extremely high concentration of arsenic and barium, much higher (at least 200 times) than all other species and local sediment. Hyrtios erecta had significantly higher concentration of Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ti and V than all other species. This is due to sediment accumulation and inclusion in the skeleton fibers of this sponge species. Suberites clavatus was found to contain significantly higher concentration of Cd, Co, Ni and Zn than all other species and local sediment, indicating active accumulation of these metals. It also has the second highest Fe concentration, but without the comparably high concentrations of Al, Mn and Ti that are evident in H. erecta and in local sediment. These differences indicate active uptake and accumulation of Fe in S. clavatus, this was also noted in Niphates rowi. A significantly higher B concentration was found in Crella cyatophora compared to all other species. These results indicate specific roles of trace elements in certain sponge species that deserve further analysis.

https://openalex.org/W1979869444,"Ash dieback is a recent widespread disease on ash (Fraxinus sp.) that is causing important economic and ecological losses throughout Europe. The disease is initiated by the ascomycetous fungus Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus (anamorph Chalara fraxinea). The main aim of this study was to investigate seasonal pattern of lesion development associated with ash dieback. We present data on the spread of 324 natural lesions in ash shoots, branches and stems surveyed over a 32 month period. Most lesions were active and showed the greatest rate of growth during the summer; however, lesions were active throughout the year. Tree mortality was high, with more than a third of the surveyed trees dying during the study. Although many lesions permanently ceased to develop, the rate at which new lesions emerged was greater than the rate at which lesions entered a resting phase. The most common cause for a lesion going into a permanent state of rest was that it had encountered a branch-base. Genotype analysis showed that multiple infections can occur in a single tree given that different genotypes were identified in different lesions as well as in single lesions. A weak positive correlation was noted between tree health and tree size and a weak negative correlation was noted between tree overall health and lesion activity. The lower limit for H. pseudoalbidus growth in culture was between 4.0°C and 0.5°C."

Yeast cells lacking the ORF YCL047C/POF1 release considerably more NR compared with wild type, suggesting that POF1 plays an important role in NR/NAD+ metabolism. The amino acid sequence of Pof1 indicates that it is a putative nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT). Unlike other yeast NMNATs, Pof1 exhibits NMN-specific adenylyltransferase activity. Deletion of POF1 significantly lowers NAD+ levels and decreases the efficiency of NR utilization, resistance to oxidative stress, and NR-induced life span extension. We also show that NR is constantly produced by multiple nucleotidases and that the intracellular NR pools are likely to be compartmentalized, which contributes to the regulation of NAD+ homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2055722864,"During chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the role of intra-hepatic (IH) natural killer (NK) cells is still controversial. To clarify their functions, we investigated anti-viral and cytotoxic activity of NK cells in human fresh liver biopsies. We compared the functions of IH-NK cells in HCV-infected and NASH patients in physiological conditions as well as after stimulation using flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analyses. Interestingly, few IH-NK cells produced anti-viral cytokine IFN-γ in HCV-infected patients similarly as in non-infected individuals. Spontaneous degranulation activity was extremely low in peripheral NK cells compared to IH-NK cells, and was significantly higher in IH-NK cells from HCV-infected patients compared to non-infected individuals. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that perforin granules were polarized at the apical pole of IH-NK cells. The presence of CD107a and perforin in IH-NK cells demonstrated that NK cells exerted a cytolytic activity at the site of infection. Importantly, IH-NK cell functions from HCV-infected patients were inducible by specific exogenous stimulations. Upon ex vivo K562 target cell stimulations, the number of degranulating NK cells was significantly increased in the pool of IH-NK cells compared to circulating NK cells. Interestingly, after stimulation, the frequency of IFN-γ-producing IH-NK cells in HCV-infected patients was significantly higher at early stage of inflammation whereas the spontaneous IH-NK cell degranulation activity was significantly impaired in patients with highest inflammation and fibrosis Metavir scores. Our study highlights that some IH-NK cells in HCV-infected patients are able to produce INF-γ and degranulate and that those two activities depend on liver environment including the severity of liver injury. Thus, we conclude that critical roles of IH-NK cells have to be taken into account in the course of the liver pathogenesis associated to chronic HCV infection."

Even if the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) drives angiogenesis before ovulation, the local role exerted by Progesterone (P₄) remains to be clarified, in particular when its concentration rapidly increases before ovulation.This in vivo study was designed to clarify the effect promoted by a P₄ receptor antagonist, RU486, on VEGF expression and follicular angiogenesis before ovulation, in particular, during the transition from pre to periovulatory follicles induced by human Chorionic Gonadotropins (hCG) administration.Preovulatory follicle growth and ovulation were pharmacologically induced in prepubertal gilts by combining equine Chorionic Gonadotropins (eCG) and hCG used in the presence or absence of RU486. The effects on VEGF expression were analyzed using biochemical and immunohistochemical studies, either on granulosa or on theca layers of follicles isolated few hours before ovulation. This angiogenic factor was also correlated to follicular morphology and to blood vessels architecture.VEGF production, blood vessel network and follicle remodeling were impaired by RU486 treatment, even if the cause-effect correlation remains to be clarified. The P₄ antagonist strongly down-regulated theca VEGF expression, thus, preventing most of the angiogenic follicle response induced by hCG. RU486-treated follicles displayed a reduced vascular area, a lower rate of endothelial cell proliferation and a reduced recruitment of perivascular mural cells. These data provide important insights on the biological role of RU486 and, indirectly, on steroid hormones during periovulatory follicular phase. In addition, an in vivo model is proposed to evaluate how periovulatory follicular angiogenesis may affect the functionality of the corpus luteum (CL) and the success of pregnancy."

The diverse T cell repertoire and the extensive human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphism across populations is the evolutionary response to viral mutation. However, the molecular basis underpinning the interplay between HLA polymorphism, the T cell repertoire, and viral escape is unclear. Here we investigate the T cell response to a HLA-B*35:01- and HLA-B*35:08-restricted (407)HPVGEADYFEY(417) epitope from Epstein-Barr virus and naturally occurring variants at positions 4 and 5 thereof. Each viral variant differently impacted on the epitope's flexibility and conformation when bound to HLA-B*35:08 or HLA-B*35:01. We provide a molecular basis for understanding how the single residue polymorphism that discriminates between HLA-B*35:01/08 profoundly impacts on T cell receptor recognition. Surprisingly, one viral variant (P5-Glu to P5-Asp) effectively changed restriction preference from HLA-B*35:01 to HLA-B*35:08. Collectively, our study portrays the interplay between the T cell response, viral escape, and HLA polymorphism, whereby HLA polymorphism enables altered presentation of epitopes from different strains of Epstein-Barr virus."

Four diets: control diet (CD), decanter cake diet (DCD), palm kernel cake diet (PKCD) and CD plus 5% PO diet (CPOD) were fed to rumen cannulated goats and rumen samples were collected at the start of the experimental diets (day 0) and on days 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24 and 30 post dietary treatments. Feeding DCD and PKCD resulted in significantly higher (P<0.05) DNA copy number of total bacteria, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefeciens, and Ruminococcus albus. Rumen methanogenic archaea was significantly lower (P<0.05) in goats fed PKCD and CPOD and the trend showed a severe reduction on days 4 and 6 post experimental diets.

MARF1 is a murine oocyte RNA-binding protein that is associated with maintenance of mRNA homeostasis and genomic stability. In this study, autoantibodies were used to identify Limkain B (LMKB), the human orthologue of MARF1, as a P-body component. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that Ge-1 (a central component of the mammalian core-decapping complex) co-localized with LMKB in P-bodies. Two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to demonstrate interaction between Ge-1 and LMKB. The C-terminal 120 amino acids of LMKB mediated interaction with Ge-1 and the N-terminal 1094 amino acids of Ge-1 were required for interaction with LMKB. LMKB is the first protein identified to date that interacts with this portion of Ge-1. LMKB was expressed in human B and T lymphocyte cell lines; depletion of LMKB increased expression of IFI44L, a gene that has been implicated in the cellular response to Type I interferons. The interaction between LMKB/MARF1, a protein that contains RNA-binding domains, and Ge-1, which interacts with core-decapping proteins, suggests that LMKB has a role in the regulation of mRNA stability. LMKB appears to have different functions in different cell types: maintenance of genomic stability in developing oocytes and possible dampening of the inflammatory response in B and T cells."

Vascular oxidative stress injury and mitochondrial dysfunction have been indicated in this process. To elucidate the mechanism for this condition, we investigated whether mitochondria regulated NADPH oxidase in hindlimb unweighting (HU) rat cerebral and mesenteric arteries. Four-week HU was used to simulate microgravity in rats. Vascular superoxide generation, protein and mRNA levels of Nox2/Nox4, and the activity of NADPH oxidase were examined in the present study. Compared with control rats, the levels of superoxide increased in cerebral (P<0.001) but not in mesenteric vascular smooth muscle cells. The protein and mRNA levels of Nox2 and Nox4 were upregulated significantly (P<0.001 and P<0.001 for Nox2, respectively; P<0.001 and P<0.001 for Nox4, respectively) in HU rat cerebral arteries but not in mesenteric arteries. NADPH oxidases were activated significantly by HU (P<0.001) in cerebral arteries but not in mesenteric arteries. Chronic treatment with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoTEMPO attenuated superoxide levels (P<0.001), decreased the protein and mRNA expression levels of Nox2/Nox4 (P<0.01 and P<0.05 for Nox2, respectively; P<0.001 and P<0.001 for Nox4, respectively) and the activity of NADPH oxidase (P<0.001) in HU rat cerebral arteries, but exerted no effects on HU rat mesenteric arteries.

TRIM30, a tripartite motif (TRIM)-containing protein is one of such inhibitors known to function in macrophages. To define the roles of TRIM30, we generated Trim30 knockout (Trim30−/−) mice. Trim30 deletion caused no major developmental defects in any organs, nor showed any discernable defect in the activation of macrophages. But, Trim30−/− mice showed increased CD4/CD8 ratio when aged and Trim30−/− CD4+ T cells exhibited an abnormal response upon TCR activation, in particular in the absence of a costimulatory signal. Adoptive transfer of wild-type and Trim30−/− CD4+ T cells together into lymphopenic hosts confirmed higher proliferation of the Trim30−/− CD4+ T cells in vivo. Despite the enhanced proliferation, Trim30−/− T cells showed decreased levels of NF-κB activation and IL-2 production compared to wild-type cells. These results indicate a distinct requirement for TRIM30 in modulation of NF-κB activation and cell proliferation induced by TCR stimulation."

Appropriate pain-prevention appears critical since it may influence the outcome and the results obtained with this model. However, there are no proper guidelines for pain management in rats undergoing thoracic surgery. Accordingly, we evaluated three analgesic regimens in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury. This study was strongly focused on 3R’s ethic principles, in particular the principle of Reduction. Methods Rats undergoing surgery were treated with pre-surgical tramadol (45 mg/kg intra-peritoneal), or carprofen (5 mg/kg sub-cutaneous), or with pre-surgical administration of carprofen followed by 2 post-surgery tramadol injections (multi-modal group). We assessed behavioral signs of pain and made a subjective evaluation of stress and suffering one and two hours after surgery. Results Multi-modal treatment significantly reduced the number of signs of pain compared to carprofen alone at both the first hour (61±42 vs 123±47; p<0.05) and the second hour (43±21 vs 74±24; p<0.05) post-surgery. Tramadol alone appeared as effective as multi-modal treatment during the first hour, but signs of pain significantly increased one hour later (from 66±72 to 151±86, p<0.05). Carprofen alone was more effective at the second hour post-surgery when signs of pain reduced to 74±24 from 113±40 in the first hour (p<0.05). Stress behaviors during the second hour were observed in only 20% of rats in the multimodal group compared to 75% and 86% in the carprofen and tramadol groups, respectively (p<0.05). Conclusions Multi-modal treatment with carprofen and tramadol was more effective in preventing pain during the second hour after surgery compared with both tramadol or carprofen. Our results suggest that the combination of carprofen and tramadol represent the best therapy to prevent animal pain after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. We obtained our results accordingly with the ethical principle of Reduction."

The median vitamin D level was 13.5 ng/mL (IQR, 9.0-20.3); 74% were deficient (68% in HIV-infected vs. 76% in HIV-uninfected, p = 0.01). Non-black race, fall/winter season, multivitamin intake, higher serum albumin, HCV seropositivity and HIV-infection were associated with significantly lower odds of vitamin D deficiency.Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among IDUs. Notably, HIV-infected IDUs were less likely to be vitamin D deficient. Higher vitamin D levels were associated with multivitamin intake and with higher albumin levels, suggesting that nutritional status contributes substantially to deficiency. The association between HCV serostatus and vitamin D level remains unclear. Further investigation is needed to define the clinical implications of the heavy burden of vitamin D deficiency in this high-risk, aging population with significant co-morbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2064316699,"The majority of lung cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of disease. This study evaluated the diagnostic value of ThinPrep (TP) bronchial brushing cytology in lung cancer. A total of 595 patients with suspicious lung cancer were enrolled in this study. The bronchial brushing samples were prepared by TP. The data were then compared to histology of lung tissue samples. Histologically, 479 of these 595 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer, including 223 cases of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 77 cases of lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), and 152 cases of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). The TP cytology revealed a total of 460 cases of lung cancer (including 232 SCCs, 91 ADCs, and 108 SCLCs). The TP cytological technique had 87.06% sensitivity and 62.93% specificity in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Specifically, TP cytology confirmed 195 of 223 SCCs, 47 of 77 ADCs, and 94 of 152 SCLCs. The TP cytology showed 87.44% sensitivity and 90.05% specificity for the diagnosis of SCC, with a Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.820; while the sensitivity was reduced to 61.04% and the specificity was 90.93% for the diagnosis of ADC, with a MCC of 0.464. For the diagnosis of SCLC, the sensitivity was 61.84% and the specificity was 96.84%, with a MCC of 0.648. Thus, this study demonstrated the usefulness of TP bronchial brushing cytology in the early diagnosis of lung cancer, especially the early stage of lung SCC. A prospective clinical trial will verify these data before being translated into the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W1970847753,"Campylobacter jejuni carry temperate bacteriophages that can affect the biology or virulence of the host bacterium. Known effects include genomic rearrangements and resistance to DNA transformation. C. jejuni prophage CJIE1 shows sequence variability and variability in the content of morons. Homologs of the CJIE1 prophage enhance both adherence and invasion to cells in culture and increase the expression of a specific subset of bacterial genes. Other C. jejuni temperate phages have so far not been well characterized. In this study we describe investigations into the DNA sequence variability and protein expression in a second prophage, CJIE4. CJIE4 sequences were obtained de novo from DNA sequencing of five C. jejuni isolates, as well as from whole genome sequences submitted to GenBank by other research groups. These CJIE4 DNA sequences were heterogenous, with several different insertions/deletions (indels) in different parts of the prophage genome. Two variants of a 3-4 kb region inserted within CJIE4 had different gene content that distinguished two major conserved CJIE4 prophage families. Additional indels were detected throughout the prophage. Detection of proteins in the five isolates characterized in our laboratory in isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) experiments indicated that prophage proteins within each of the two large indel variants were expressed during growth of the bacteria on Mueller Hinton agar plates. These proteins included the extracellular DNase associated with resistance to DNA transformation and prophage repressor proteins. Other proteins associated with known or suspected roles in prophage biology were also expressed from CJIE4, including capsid protein, the phage integrase, and MazF, a type II toxin-antitoxin system protein. Together with the results previously obtained for the CJIE1 prophage these results demonstrate that sequence variability and expression of moron genes are both general properties of temperate bacteriophages in C. jejuni."
https://openalex.org/W1981149843,"Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) plays a pivotal role in cellular responses to hypoxia. Prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) degrades HIF-1α under normoxic conditions through the hydroxylation of HIF-1α for proteolysis. Inhibiting PHD3 activity is crucial for up-regulating HIF-1α, thereby acting as a potential target for treating hypoxia-related diseases. In this study, two proline analogues (PA1 and PA2) were screened as PHD3 inhibitors with apparent EC50 values of 1.53 and 3.17 µM respectively, indicating good inhibition potency. Nine proteins, significantly regulated by PA1, were identified using 2-DE coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (PKM) and alpha-enolase 1 (ENO1), which are key modulators of glycolysis, are directly regulated by HIF-1α. Moreover, VEGF, a signal protein stimulating angiogenesis, was strongly promoted by PA1. Our findings suggest that PA1 stabilized HIF-1α as well as up-regulated glycolysis and angiogenesis proteins. Herein, for the first time, we systematically studied proline analogue PA1 as a PHD3 inhibitor, which provides innovative evidence for the treatment of HIF-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2093601584,"Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are pacemaker cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and loss of ICC is associated with many GI motility disorders. Previous studies have shown that ICC have the capacity to regenerate or restore, and several growth factors are critical to their growth, maintenance or regeneration. The present study aimed to investigate the roles of interleukin-9 (IL-9) in the growth, maintenance and pacemaker functions of cultured ICC. Here, we report that IL-9 promotes proliferation of ICC, and culturing ICC with IL-9 enhances cholecystokinin-8-induced Ca²⁺ transients, which is probably caused by facilitating maintenance of ICC functions under culture condition. We also show co-localizations of cholecystokinin-1 receptor and IL-9 receptor with c-kit by double-immunohistochemical labeling. In conclusion, IL-9 can promote ICC growth and help maintain ICC functions; IL-9 probably performs its functions via IL-9 receptors on ICC."
https://openalex.org/W2045728713,"Background Several studies suggest that men and women are treated differently for similar disease including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Differences in attitudes and treatment practices towards men and women with obesity are not well recognized. Objective To investigate the attitudes and treatment practices among Danish general practitioners (GPs), in relation to treatment of overweight, while taking gender of both the patients and practitioners into account. Design Questionnaire inventory covertly examining attitudes and practices among Danish general practitioners towards treatment of overweight. All 3.637 general practitioners from the Danish Medical Association register were invited to participate in the survey. In total 1.136 participated. Results The GPs found weight loss to be more important for overweight male than overweight female patients. They also treated complications to overweight more rigorously among male than female patients, and recommended lipid lowering medicine more often to male than female overweight patients. In addition, the younger female GPs and older male GPs more often said that they would treat an overweight patient with lipid lowering medicine. Conclusion Among general practitioners in Denmark, treatment for weight loss is more often practiced for overweight male than overweight female patients presenting with same symptoms. In addition, hyperlipidemia among overweight males is also more often treated with lipid lowering medicine than hyperlipidemia among overweight females."

https://openalex.org/W2045578422,"NAD glycohydrolases (NADases) catalyze the hydrolysis of NAD to ADP-ribose and nicotinamide. Although many members of the NADase family, including ADP-ribosyltransferases, have been cloned and characterized, the structure and function of NADases with pure hydrolytic activity remain to be elucidated. Here, we report the structural and functional characterization of a novel NADase from rabbit reticulocytes. The novel NADase is a glycosylated, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface protein exclusively expressed in reticulocytes. shRNA-mediated knockdown of the NADase in bone marrow cells resulted in a reduction of erythroid colony formation and an increase in NAD level. Furthermore, treatment of bone marrow cells with NAD, nicotinamide, or nicotinamide riboside, which induce an increase in NAD content, resulted in a significant decrease in erythroid progenitors. These results indicate that the novel NADase may play a critical role in regulating erythropoiesis of hematopoietic stem cells by modulating intracellular NAD."
