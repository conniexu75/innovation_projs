https://openalex.org/W1981088384,"Oct4 is a mammalian POU transcription factor expressed by early embryo cells and germ cells. We report that the activity of Oct4 is essential for the identity of the pluripotential founder cell population in the mammalian embryo. Oct4-deficient embryos develop to the blastocyst stage, but the inner cell mass cells are not pluripotent. Instead, they are restricted to differentiation along the extraembryonic trophoblast lineage. Furthermore, in the absence of a true inner cell mass, trophoblast proliferation is not maintained in Oct4-/- embryos. Expansion of trophoblast precursors is restored, however, by an Oct4 target gene product, fibroblast growth factor-4. Therefore, Oct4 also determines paracrine growth factor signaling from stem cells to the trophectoderm."
https://openalex.org/W2080125477,"After DNA damage, many cells appear to enter a sustained arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. It is shown here that this arrest could be sustained only when p53 was present in the cell and capable of transcriptionally activating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. After disruption of either the p53 or the p21 gene, gamma radiated cells progressed into mitosis and exhibited a G2 DNA content only because of a failure of cytokinesis. Thus, p53 and p21 appear to be essential for maintaining the G2 checkpoint in human cells."

https://openalex.org/W2033465062,"A fundamentally different type of optical waveguide structure is demonstrated, in which light is confined to the vicinity of a low-index region by a two-dimensional photonic band gap crystal. The waveguide consists of an extra air hole in an otherwise regular honeycomb pattern of holes running down the length of a fine silica glass fiber. Optical fibers based on this waveguide mechanism support guided modes with extraordinary properties."
https://openalex.org/W2036083275,"Virtually all uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli encode filamentous surface adhesive organelles called type 1 pili. High-resolution electron microscopy of infected mouse bladders revealed that type 1 pilus tips interacted directly with the lumenal surface of the bladder, which is embedded with hexagonal arrays of integral membrane glycoproteins known as uroplakins. Attached pili were shortened and facilitated intimate contact of the bacteria with the uroplakin-coated host cells. Bacterial attachment resulted in exfoliation of host bladder epithelial cells as part of an innate host defense system. Exfoliation occurred through a rapid apoptosis-like mechanism involving caspase activation and host DNA fragmentation. Bacteria resisted clearance in the face of host defenses within the bladder by invading into the epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1993222366,"Sensory experience in early life shapes the mammalian brain. An impairment in the activity-dependent refinement of functional connections within developing visual cortex was identified here in a mouse model. Gene-targeted disruption of one isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase prevented the competitive loss of responsiveness to an eye briefly deprived of vision, without affecting cooperative mechanisms of synapse modification in vitro. Selective, use-dependent enhancement of fast intracortical inhibitory transmission with benzodiazepines restored plasticity in vivo, rescuing the genetic defect. Specific networks of inhibitory interneurons intrinsic to visual cortex may detect perturbations in sensory input to drive experience-dependent plasticity during development."
https://openalex.org/W1981529935,"Circadian clocks are synchronized by environmental cues such as light. Photoreceptor-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana mutants were used to measure the effect of light fluence rate on circadian period in plants. Phytochrome B is the primary high-intensity red light photoreceptor for circadian control, and phytochrome A acts under low-intensity red light. Cryptochrome 1 and phytochrome A both act to transmit low-fluence blue light to the clock. Cryptochrome 1 mediates high-intensity blue light signals for period length control. The presence of cryptochromes in both plants and animals suggests that circadian input pathways have been conserved throughout evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2050039508,"During angiogenesis, endothelial cells penetrate fibrin barriers via undefined proteolytic mechanisms. We demonstrate that the fibrinolytic plasminogen activator (PA)-plasminogen system is not required for this process, since tissues isolated from PA- or plasminogen-deficient mice successfully neovascularize fibrin gels. By contrast, neovessel formation, in vitro and in vivo, is dependent on fibrinolytic, endothelial cell-derived matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). MMPs directly regulate this process as invasion-incompetent cells penetrate fibrin barriers when transfected with the most potent fibrinolytic metalloproteinase identified in endothelium, membrane type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP). Membrane display of MT1-MMP is required, as invasion-incompetent cells expressing a fibrinolytically active, transmembrane-deleted form of MT1-MMP remain noninvasive. These observations identify a PA-independent fibrinolytic pathway wherein tethered MMPs function as pericellular fibrinolysins during the neovascularization process."
https://openalex.org/W1511556906,"Covert attention, the selective processing of visual information at a given location in the absence of eye movements, improves performance in several tasks, such as visual search and detection of luminance and vernier targets1,2,3,4,5,6. An important unsettled issue is whether this improvement is due to a reduction in noise (internal or external)6,7,8,9, a change in decisional criteria10,11, or signal enhancement3,5,12. Here we show that attention can affect performance by signal enhancement. For a texture segregation task in which performance is actually diminished when spatial resolution is too high, we observed that attention improved performance at peripheral locations where spatial resolution was too low, but impaired performance at central locations where spatial resolution was too high4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. The counterintuitive impairment of performance that we found at the central retinal locations appears to have only one possible explanation: attention enhances spatial resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2097331211,"The specificity of many signal transduction pathways relies on the temporal coordination of different second messenger signals. Here we found a molecular mechanism which guarantees that conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms are sequentially activated by calcium and diacylglycerol signals. Receptor stimuli that triggered repetitive calcium spikes induced a parallel repetitive translocation of GFP-tagged PKCγ to the plasma membrane. While calcium acted rapidly, diacylglycerol binding to PKCγ was initially prevented by a pseudosubstrate clamp, which kept the diacylglycerol-binding site inaccessible and delayed calcium- and diacylglycerol-mediated kinase activation. After termination of calcium signals, bound diacylglycerol prolonged kinase activity. The properties of this molecular decoding machine make PKCγ responsive to persistent diacylglycerol increases combined with high- but not low-frequency calcium spikes."
https://openalex.org/W1985323402,"Picosecond optical excitation was used to coherently control the excitation in a single quantum dot on a time scale that is short compared with the time scale for loss of quantum coherence. The excitonic wave function was manipulated by controlling the optical phase of the two-pulse sequence through timing and polarization. Wave function engineering techniques, developed in atomic and molecular systems, were used to monitor and control a nonstationary quantum mechanical state composed of a superposition of eigenstates. The results extend the concept of coherent control in semiconductors to the limit of a single quantum system in a zero-dimensional quantum dot."
https://openalex.org/W2039764581,"Replication arrest leads to the occurrence of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB). We studied the mechanism of DSB formation by direct measure of the amount of in vivo linear DNA in Escherichia coli cells that lack the RecBCD recombination complex and by genetic means. The RuvABC proteins, which catalyze migration and cleavage of Holliday junctions, are responsible for the occurrence of DSBs at arrested replication forks. In cells proficient for RecBC, RuvAB is uncoupled from RuvC and DSBs may be prevented. This may be explained if a Holliday junction forms upon replication fork arrest, by annealing of the two nascent strands. RecBCD may act on the double-stranded tail prior to the cleavage of the RuvAB-bound junction by RuvC to rescue the blocked replication fork without breakage."
https://openalex.org/W2010886990,"The homeodomain is a DNA binding motif that is usually conserved among diverse taxa. Rapidly evolving homeodomains are thus of interest because their divergence may be associated with speciation. The exact site of the Odysseus (Ods) locus of hybrid male sterility in Drosophila contains such a homeobox gene. In the past half million years, this homeodomain has experienced more amino acid substitutions than it did in the preceding 700 million years; during this period, it has also evolved faster than other parts of the protein or even the introns. Such rapid sequence divergence is driven by positive selection and may contribute to reproductive isolation."
https://openalex.org/W2066799534,"Two general models have been proposed for DNA replication. In one model, DNA polymerase moves along the DNA (like a train on a track); in the other model, the polymerase is stationary (like a factory), and DNA is pulled through. To distinguish between these models, we visualized DNA polymerase of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis in living cells by the creation of a fusion protein containing the catalytic subunit (PolC) and green fluorescent protein (GFP). PolC-GFP was localized at discrete intracellular positions, predominantly at or near midcell, rather than being distributed randomly. These results suggest that the polymerase is anchored in place and thus support the model in which the DNA template moves through the polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2132228958,"The membrane fusion potential of influenza HA, like many viral membrane-fusion glycoproteins, is generated by proteolytic cleavage of a biosynthetic precursor. The three-dimensional structure of ectodomain of the precursor HA0 has been determined and compared with that of cleaved HA. The cleavage site is a prominent surface loop adjacent to a novel cavity; cleavage results in structural rearrangements in which the nonpolar amino acids near the new amino terminus bury ionizable residues in the cavity that are implicated in the low-pH-induced conformational change. Amino acid insertions at the cleavage site in HAs of virulent avian viruses and those of viruses isolated from the recent severe outbreak of influenza in humans in Hong Kong would extend this surface loop, facilitating intracellular cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2167234212,"Extracellular growth factors are required for the survival of most animal cells. They often signal through the activation of the Ras pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Ras signaling inhibits the intrinsic cell death machinery are not well understood. Here, we present evidence that in Drosophila, activation of the Ras pathway specifically inhibits the proapoptotic activity of the gene head involution defective (hid). By using transgenic animals and cultured cells, we show that MAPK phosphorylation sites in Hid are critical for this response. These findings define a novel mechanism by which growth factor signaling directly inactivates a critical component of the intrinsic cell death machinery. These studies provide further insights into the function of ras as an oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W2043883458,"Recent advances in computational techniques have allowed the design of precise side-chain packing in proteins with predetermined, naturally occurring backbone structures. Because these methods do not model protein main-chain flexibility, they lack the breadth to explore novel backbone conformations. Here the de novo design of a family of α-helical bundle proteins with a right-handed superhelical twist is described. In the design, the overall protein fold was specified by hydrophobic-polar residue patterning, whereas the bundle oligomerization state, detailed main-chain conformation, and interior side-chain rotamers were engineered by computational enumerations of packing in alternate backbone structures. Main-chain flexibility was incorporated through an algebraic parameterization of the backbone. The designed peptides form α-helical dimers, trimers, and tetramers in accord with the design goals. The crystal structure of the tetramer matches the designed structure in atomic detail."
https://openalex.org/W1970220649,"Strong and sustained electron emission at low electric fields was observed in undoped, nanostructured diamond. Electron emission of 10 milliamperes per square centimeter was observed at applied fields of 3 to 5 volts per micrometer. These are the lowest fields ever reported for any field-emitting material at technologically useful current densities. The emitter consists of a layer of nanometer-size diamond particulates, which is heat-treated in a hydrogen plasma. These emission characteristics are attributed to the particles' high defect density and the low electron affinity of the diamond surface. Such emitters are technologically useful, because they can be easily and economically fabricated on large substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2153382373,"Cryptochromes are photoactive pigments in the eye that have been proposed to function as circadian photopigments. Mice lacking the cryptochrome 2 blue-light photoreceptor gene ( mCry2 ) were tested for circadian clock-related functions. The mutant mice had a lower sensitivity to acute light induction of mPer1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) but exhibited normal circadian oscillations of mPer1 and mCry1 messenger RNA in the SCN. Behaviorally, the mutants had an intrinsic circadian period about 1 hour longer than normal and exhibited high-amplitude phase shifts in response to light pulses administered at circadian time 17. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that CRY2 protein modulates circadian responses in mice and suggest that cryptochromes have a role in circadian photoreception in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2078144681,"Activation of Ras inhibits apoptosis during Drosophila development. Genetic evidence indicates that Ras antiapoptotic activity in the developing eye is regulated by the Drosophila EGF receptor and operates through the Raf/MAPK pathway. Decreased activity of this pathway enhances, and increased activity suppresses, apoptosis induced by ectopic expression of the cell death regulators reaper (rpr) and head involution defective (hid). In addition, ectopic activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway in the developing embryo and in the developing eye suppresses naturally occurring apoptosis and regulates the transcription of the proapoptotic gene hid. Null alleles of hid recapitulate the antiapoptotic activities of Ras/MAPK, providing genetic evidence that downregulation of hid is an important mechanism by which Ras promotes survival."
https://openalex.org/W2010407064,"A continuous seawater sulfate sulfur isotope curve for the Cenozoic with a resolution of ∼1 million years was generated using marine barite. The sulfur isotopic composition decreased from 19 to 17 per mil between 65 and 55 million years ago, increased abruptly from 17 to 22 per mil between 55 and 45 million years ago, remained nearly constant from 35 to ∼2 million years ago, and has decreased by 0.8 per mil during the past 2 million years. A comparison between seawater sulfate and marine carbonate carbon isotope records reveals no clear systematic coupling between the sulfur and carbon cycles over one to several millions of years, indicating that changes in the burial rate of pyrite sulfur and organic carbon did not singularly control the atmospheric oxygen content over short time intervals in the Cenozoic. This finding has implications for the modeling of controls on atmospheric oxygen concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2070533417,"Motor function depends on the formation of selective connections between sensory and motor neurons and their muscle targets. The molecular basis of the specificity inherent in this sensory-motor circuit remains unclear. We show that motor neuron pools and subsets of muscle sensory afferents can be defined by the expression of ETS genes, notably PEA3 and ER81. There is a matching in PEA3 and ER81 expression by functionally interconnected sensory and motor neurons. ETS gene expression by motor and sensory neurons fails to occur after limb ablation, suggesting that their expression is coordinated by signals from the periphery. ETS genes may therefore participate in the development of selective sensory-motor circuits in the spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2083514735,The stable carbon isotope (δ 13 C) compositions of individual fatty acid components of remnant fats preserved in archaeological pottery vessels show that dairying was a component of archaeological economies. Characteristic δ 13 C values arise from biases in the biosynthetic origins of the C 18:0 fatty acids in milk and adipose fat. Milk and adipose fat from animals raised on similar pastures and fodders have distinct isotopic signatures.
https://openalex.org/W2104262655,"Intercellular signaling through the EGF receptor (EGFR) patterns the Drosophila egg. The TGF alpha-like ligand Gurken signals from the oocyte to the receptor in the overlying somatic follicle cells. We show that in the dorsal follicle cells this initial paracrine signaling event triggers an autocrine amplification by two other EGFR ligands, Spitz and Vein. Spitz only becomes an effective ligand in the presence of the multitransmembrane domain protein Rhomboid. Consequent high-level EGFR activation leads to localized expression of the diffusible inhibitor Argos, which alters the profile of signaling. This sequential activation, amplification, and local inhibition of the EGFR forms an autoregulatory cascade that leads to the splitting of an initial single peak of signaling into two, thereby patterning the egg."

https://openalex.org/W1661761832,"The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) is the main calcium(Ca2+) release channel in most tissues. Three isoforms have been identified, but only types I and II InsP3R have been characterized. Here we examine the functional properties of the type III InsP3R because this receptor is restricted to the trigger zone from which Ca2+ waves originate and it has distinctive InsP3-binding properties. We find that type III InsP3R forms Ca2+ channels with single-channel currents that are similar to those of type I InsP3R; however, the open probability of type III InsP3R isoform increases monotonically with increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, whereas the type I isoform has a bell-shaped dependence on cytoplasmic Ca2+. The properties of type III InsP3R provide positive feedback as Ca2+ is released; the lack of negative feedback allows complete Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Thus, activation of type III InsP3R in cells that express only this isoform results in a single transient, but global, increase in the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+. The bell-shaped Ca2+-dependence curve of type I InsP3R is ideal for supporting Ca2+ oscillations, whereas the properties of type III InsP3R are better suited to signal initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1995531673,"Heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate (GTP)–binding proteins (G proteins) determine tissue and cell polarity in a variety of organisms. In yeast, cells orient polarized growth toward the mating partner along a pheromone gradient by a mechanism that requires Far1p and Cdc24p. Far1p bound Gβγ and interacted with polarity establishment proteins, which organize the actin cytoskeleton. Cells containing mutated Far1p unable to bind Gβγ or polarity establishment proteins were defective for orienting growth toward their mating partner. In response to pheromones, Far1p moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Thus, Far1p functions as an adaptor that recruits polarity establishment proteins to the site of extracellular signaling marked by Gβγ to polarize assembly of the cytoskeleton in a morphogenetic gradient."

https://openalex.org/W2118143368,"We present the first three-dimensional reconstruction of a prolate, tailed phage, and its empty prohead precursor by cryo-electron microscopy. The head–tail connector, the central component of the DNA packaging machine, is visualized for the first time in situ within the Bacillus subtilis dsDNA phage φ29. The connector, with 12- or 13-fold symmetry, appears to fit loosely into a pentameric vertex of the head, a symmetry mismatch that may be required to rotate the connector to package DNA. The prolate head of φ29 has 10 hexameric units in its cylindrical equatorial region, and 11 pentameric and 20 hexameric units comprise icosahedral end-caps with T=3 quasi-symmetry. Reconstruction of an emptied phage particle shows that the connector and neck/tail assembly undergo significant conformational changes upon ejection of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1566394066,"The spike glycoproteins of the lipid-enveloped orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses have three functions: to recognize the receptor on the cell surface, to mediate viral fusion with the cell membrane, and to destroy the receptor. In influenza C virus, a single glycoprotein, the haemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) protein, possesses all three functions (reviewed in ref. 1). In influenza A and B, the first two activities are mediated by haemagglutinin and the third by a second glycoprotein, neuraminidase. Here we report the crystal structure of the HEF envelope glycoprotein of influenza C virus. We have identified the receptor-binding site and the receptor-destroying enzyme (9-O -acetylesterase) sites, by using receptor analogues. The receptor-binding domain is structurally similar to the sialic acid-binding domain of influenza A haemagglutinin, but binds 9-O -acetylsialic acid. The esterase domain has a structure similar to the esterase from Streptomyces scabies and a brain acetylhydrolase2,3. The receptor domain is inserted into a surface loop of the esterase domain and the esterase domain is inserted into a surface loop of the stem. The stem domain is similar to that of influenza A haemagglutinin, except that the triple-stranded, α-helical bundle diverges at both of its ends, and the amino terminus of HEF2, the fusion peptide, is partially exposed. The segregation of HEF's three functions into structurally distinct domains suggests that the entire stem region, including sequences at the amino and carboxy termini of HEF1 which precede the post-translational cleavage site between HEF1 and HEF2, forms an independent fusion domain which is probably derived from an ancestral membrane fusion protein."
https://openalex.org/W2001396094,"The hepatic CYP4A enzymes are important fatty acid and prostaglandin ω-hydroxylases that are highly inducible by fibric acid hypolipidemic agents and other peroxisome proliferators. Induction of the CYP4A enzymes by peroxisome proliferators is mediated through the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Fatty acids have recently been identified as endogenous ligands of PPARα, and this receptor has been implicated in the regulation of lipid homeostasis. In the present report we characterized the induction of the hepatic CYP4A genes in rats during the altered lipid metabolism associated with starvation and diabetes. The mRNA levels of CYP4A1, CYP4A2, and CYP4A3 were induced 7–17-fold in the livers of fasted animals and 3–8-fold in the livers of diabetic animals. This was accompanied by corresponding changes in CYP4A protein levels and arachidonic and lauric acid ω-hydroxylase activity. Interestingly, feeding animals after the fasting period caused as much as an 80% suppression of CYP4A mRNA levels, whereas CYP4A protein levels and functional activity returned to control values. A second PPARα-responsive gene, acyl-CoA oxidase, was also induced in rat liver by diabetes and fasting. By using PPARα-deficient mice, we unambiguously demonstrated that PPARα is strictly required for hepatic CYP4A induction by starvation and diabetes. Similarly, induction of hepatic thiolase and bifunctional enzyme also required expression of PPARα. This represents the first evidence for the pathophysiologically induced activation of a nuclear receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2081958168,"Previous studies have suggested that melting processes are responsible for the trace element variability observed in olivine-hosted basaltic melt inclusions. Melt inclusions from three individual lava samples (two from Mangaia, Cook Islands, and one from Tahaa, Society Islands) have heterogeneous Pb isotopic compositions, even though the erupted lavas are isotopically homogeneous. The range of Pb isotopic compositions from individual melt inclusions spans 50 percent of the worldwide range observed for ocean island basalts. The melt inclusion data can be explained by two-component mixing for each island. Our data imply that magmas with different isotopic compositions existed in the volcanic plumbing system before or during melt aggregation."

The human homologue of the lin-10 gene has recently been identified as a member of the X11 gene family. The X11 proteins contain one phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) and two PSD-95·Dlg·ZO-1 (PDZ) domains as well as an extended amino terminus. We have previously shown that the PTB domain of X11α (also known as Mint1) can bind to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in a phosphotyrosine-independent fashion and can markedly inhibit the processing of APP to the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide. Here, we report that X11α directly binds to the mammalian homologue of Lin-2 (mLin-2), also known as CASK. This binding is mediated by direct interaction between the Calmodulin Kinase II (CKII)-like domain of mLin-2 and the amino terminus of X11α. Furthermore, we can detect direct interactions between mLin-2 and mammalian Lin-7 (mLin-7).

In these proteins, this domain binds to Asn-Pro-X-pTyr, a β turn motif found on activated growth factor receptors and other signaling molecules. After binding to growth factor receptors, both Shc and IRS-1 are themselves tyrosine-phosphorylated and coupled to downstream signaling molecules. Despite the name, there is strong evidence that some PTB domains bind to their target proteins in a phosphotyrosine-independent fashion (7Borg J.P. Margolis B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 23-38PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps this binding is best understood for the X11 protein where biochemical studies have demonstrated an interaction between the X11 PTB domain and APP (8Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol.

The finding that PTB domains can bind to their target peptides in a phosphotyrosine-independent fashion indicates that these domains can be involved in diverse cellular functions, not just signaling downstream of tyrosine kinases. PTB domains are often found in combination with other protein-protein interaction domains. For example, Shc has both an SH2 domain and a PTB domain, whereas X11 proteins have two PDZ domains in addition to a PTB domain. PDZ domains have been shown to bind to the carboxyl terminus of proteins by wrapping around the extreme carboxyl-terminal residues (14Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr.

Kaech S.M. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Cell. 1996; 85: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 21Hoskins R. Hajnal A.F. Harp S.A. Kim S.K.

Let-23 is related to mammalian EGF receptors and binds to the lin-3gene product, a protein related to TGF-α (23Hill R.J. Sternberg P.W. Nature. 1992; 358: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 24Kornfeld K. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 55-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Lin-3 is released by the anchor cell of the gonad and induces the epithelium to form a vulva by activating Let-23. Mutations in lin-2, lin-7, or lin-10 impair vulval formation likely because of mislocalization of the Let-23 receptor and its inability to efficiently bind Lin-3 (22Kim S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Originally Lin-10 was felt to be a protein unrelated to previously identified proteins (25Kim S.K. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However recent work has reassigned the product of the lin-10 gene as a homologue of the X11 family of proteins. 2C. V. Whitfield, C. Benard, T. Barnes, S. Hekimi, and S. K. Kim, manuscript submitted. 2C. V. Whitfield, C. Benard, T. Barnes, S. Hekimi, and S. K. Kim, manuscript submitted. In this work, we define a protein complex in mammalian brain that contains X11α, mLin-2, and mLin-7. Thus, these protein interact both biochemically and genetically and likely control protein targeting in an evolutionarily conserved fashion. Anti-Myc 9E10 (Oncogene Research Products) and anti-HA 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim) monoclonal antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Anti-PSD-95 monoclonal antibody is from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-syntaxin-1 monoclonal antibody is from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-mLin-2, anti-X11, and anti-mLin7 antibodies were prepared by injecting rabbits with the following purified proteins: GST-mLin-2-(1–275), GST-mLin-2-(578–898), GST-X11α-(620–837), and GST-mLin-7. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and A-172, a human neuroblastoma cell line, were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 100 units/ml−1 penicillin and 100 μg/ml−1 streptomycin sulfate, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. NT2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium containing 100 units/ml−1penicillin and 100 μg/ml−1 streptomycin sulfate, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Full-length human X11α and X11β cDNAs have been described elsewhere (26Borg J.P. Yang Y. de Taddéo-Borg M. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14761-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We identified a third form of X11 in the data base (EST vh50 g07) and have termed it X11γ. Human lin-2 cDNA was constructed from two human ESTs encompassing the coding sequences from 1 to 612 amino acids (EST yt03b09) and from 578 to 898 amino acids (EST zl68e09) of human Lin-2 protein. These overlapping ESTs were fused by a two-step polymerase chain reaction procedure to produce the full-length humanmlin-2 cDNA. A mouse EST representing mlin-7cDNA (EST vg65d05) was used to generate the mLin-7 constructs. The RK5-myc vector was used to express X11α, mLin-2, and mLin-7 fused to the myc epitope (8Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The RK5-X11α construct produces an untagged X11α protein. The pcDNA-HA vector was used to express mLin-2 fused to the HA epitope. mLin-2 protein (CKII + PDZ) is from residue 1 to 612, mLin-2 (CKII) is from residue 1 to 320, and mLin-2 (SH3 + guanylate kinase (GK)) is from residue 578 to 898. GST-mLin-7 PDZ and amino terminus were created by a polymerase chain reaction procedure. All constructs were sequenced using Sequenase Version 2.0 (United States Biochemical Corp.). Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml−1 aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml−1leupeptin. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min, lysate protein content was normalized using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Mouse brain proteins were extracted following a similar procedure. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was added, and immune complexes bound to beads were recovered after 1 h, washed three times with HNTG buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), boiled in 1× sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Transfer and immunoblotting on nitrocellulose using HRP-protein A or HRP-anti-mouse antibody/chemiluminescence method were performed as described (8Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). For overlay assays, the membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with soluble GST or GST-mLin-2 (CKII) at 1 μg/ml in TBS, 5% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol. After rinsing with TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and TBS buffers, the membrane was incubated with polyclonal anti-GST antibody diluted in TBS, 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. The immune complexes were revealed using HRP-protein A/chemiluminescence method. Cell transfection, metabolic labeling, and GST binding assays were performed as described previously (8Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). For fractionation, brains were homogenized in a 10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 5 mmKCl buffer containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were adjusted to 0.25 m sucrose and 1 mm EDTA, and debris were removed after a 1000 × g centrifugation during 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g during 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants represent the cytosolic fraction. Pellets were lysed in lysis buffer to extract membrane bound proteins. We have identified three members of the X11 protein family. X11α/Mint1 and X11β/Mint2 are primarily expressed in the central nervous system, whereas X11γ/Mint3 is more widely expressed (26Borg J.P. Yang Y. de Taddéo-Borg M. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14761-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). 3J.-P. B., M. D.-B., and B. M., unpublished observations. All X11 family members have conserved PTB and PDZ domains but divergent amino termini. Our previous work has detected an interaction between X11 family members and APP via the X11 PTB domain (8Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). This binding prolongs the half-life of APP and slows its processing to the pro-amyloidogenic Aβ peptide (26Borg J.P. Yang Y. de Taddéo-Borg M. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14761-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 27Sastre M. Turner R.S. Levy E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22351-22357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As X11α has multiple protein-protein interaction domains (Fig. 1 A), we looked for proteins other than APP that could bind to X11α. In [35S]methionine-labeled A-172 cells, we were able to show that X11α coimmunoprecipitates with a 110-kDa protein. X11α binds to this 110-kDa protein via residues 163–436 in its amino terminus (Fig. 1 B). Recent evidence indicates that the X11 proteins have a close homologue in C. elegans encoded by the lin-10gene.2 In worms, the lin-2 gene is linked to thelin-10 gene and encodes a 110-kDa protein (Fig. 1 A), a size compatible with the protein binding to the amino terminus of X11α. A rat homologue of lin-2 encoding a neurexin-binding protein known as CASK has been identified (28Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We identified the human mlin-2/CASK gene from the EST data base and constructed an mLin-2 protein fused to a myc epitope. Antibodies raised against mLin-2 recognized the 110-kDa protein bound to X11α (not shown). When 293 cells were transfected with X11α and myc-tagged mLin-2, we were able to coimmunoprecipitate the proteins. Deletions of mLin-2 show that the SH3 and GK domains are dispensable for this interaction (Fig. 2 A). The binding site for the amino terminus of X11α mapped to the CKII-like domain. This CKII domain, when expressed as a GST fusion protein, could bind X11α in precipitation reactions and in Far Western blotting (Fig. 2, B and C). This domain not only recognized X11α but also the C. elegans X11 homologue, Lin-10. In contrast the mLin-2 CKII domain did not recognize two other isoforms of X11, X11β and X11γ (Fig. 2 D). This is consistent with the finding that, although X11α, X11β, and X11γ have conserved PTB and PDZ domains, they have divergent amino termini. Similarly, in 293 cells we could show that mLin-2 coimmunoprecipitates with X11α but not X11β or X11γ (results not shown). The kinase and calmodulin binding site of calmodulin kinase II α is 45% identical to the CKII domain of mLin-2 but does not bind to X11α (result not shown). The CKII domain of mLin-2 does not appear to encode an active kinase (21Hoskins R. Hajnal A.F. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Development. 1996; 122: 97-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hata Y. Butz S. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but rather appears to function as a protein-protein interaction domain. We examined the interaction of X11α and mLin-2 in mouse brain. We were able to show that antibodies to X11α were able to coimmunoprecipitate mLin-2 from mouse brain (Fig. 3 A). We found both proteins in cytosolic and membrane fractions (Fig. 3 B) where they coimmunoprecipitate (Fig. 3 C). When we immunodepleted brain cytosolic fraction of X11α, we also removed a large amount of mLin-2 from the lysates (Fig. 3 D), indicating that a significant fraction of X11α and mLin-2 are bound together. In worms,lin-7 mutants yield a similar phenotype as is seen withlin-2 and lin-10 mutants (22Kim S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In mouse brain, we were able to show that immunoprecipitation with anti-mLin-7 antibodies coimmunoprecipitated X11α and mLin-2 proteins (Fig. 4 A). GST-mLin-7 can bind mLin-2 but not X11α (results not shown), demonstrating that mLin-7 is bound to mLin-2, whereas mLin-2 is bound to X11α. We have mapped the site of interaction for mLin-7 to the region between the CKII and PDZ domain of mLin-2 (Fig. 4 B). Conversely, we have mapped the binding site for mLin-2 to the amino-terminal half of Lin-7 (Fig. 4 C).Figure 4A heterotrimeric complex of mLin-7·mLin-2·X11α exists in the brain. A,proteins from mouse brain lysate were immunoprecipitated with pre-immune serum (IP control) or anti-mLin-7 antibody (IP anti-mLin-7), and bound proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE. After Western blot, proteins were revealed with anti-X11 (top panel) and anti-mLin-2 (bottom panel) antibodies. B, full-length mLin-7 was expressed as an myc-tagged protein and precipitated with GST proteins. After Western blot, bound mLin-7 was revealed with anti-myc antibody. C,HA-tagged mLin-2 produced in 293 cells was precipitated with GST-mLin-7 proteins and revealed with anti-HA antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In summary, we have identified a heterotrimeric complex in the brain that consists of X11α, mLin-2, and mLin-7. In worms, genetic analysis has shown that homologous proteins play a central role in targeting of the Let-23 receptor to the basolateral surface of epithelial cells (22Kim S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This process is mediated by the binding of the Lin-7 PDZ domain to Let-23 (20Simske J.S. Kaech S.M. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Cell. 1996; 85: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, we have found that none of the mammalian EGF-receptor family members (HER1 through HER4) binds to mLin-7. 4S. Straight, J.-P. Borg, and B. Margolis, unpublished observations. In neurons, the X11α·mLin-2·mLin-7 protein complexes may bind to specific target membranes sites via Munc-18–1, a protein that can bind syntaxins and possibly modulate trafficking and secretion (29Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Once bound to membranes, X11α, mLin-2, and mLin-7 proteins either individually or in a complex may serve to localize or retain proteins at specific membrane sites. Recent studies have detected a fraction of mLin-2/CASK at neuronal synapses (30Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kharazia V. Naisbitt S. Cohen A.R. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) as well as at the basolateral surface of epithelial cells4 (31Cohen A.R. Wood D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Because of the brain-specific expression of X11α, we can exclude a role for X11α in the basolateral localization of mLin-2 in mammalian epithelia. X11γ, the only X11 species that we have detected in epithelium, does not interact with mLin-2. This suggests a possible divergence between worm and mammalian epithelia because, in worm epithelia, the X11α homologue, Lin-10, is crucial for basolateral targeting. The heterotrimeric complex contains several protein-protein interaction domains that would be useful to contact a large number of different proteins (30Hsueh Y.P. Yang F.C. Kharazia V. Naisbitt S. Cohen A.R. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 31Cohen A.R. Wood D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of the PTB domain, a domain that can bind to beta turn motifs, might make X11 proteins particularly suitable for detecting trafficking signals with tyrosine-based motifs (7Borg J.P. Margolis B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 23-38PubMed Google Scholar). An alteration in localization of APP or its retention in a subcellular compartment induced by X11α may explain the effects of X11α on the processing of APP (26Borg J.P. Yang Y. de Taddéo-Borg M. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14761-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Its is presently unknown if mLin-2 and mLin-7 also participate to this effect. Identification of additional proteins that can bind to X11, mLin-2, and mLin-7 family members will be important to further elucidate the role of this protein complex in receptor localization and function. While this manuscript was under review, additional studies of the X11α·mLin-2·mLin-7 complex in worms and mammals were published (Butz, S., Okamoto, M., and Sudhof, T. C. (1998)Cell 94, 773–782, and Kaech, S. M., Whitfield, C. W., and Kim, S. K. (1998) Cell 94,761–771). We thank Drs. K.

The liver has a large capacity for glucose production from gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, thereby providing protection against hypoglycemia. Production of free glucose via these pathways requires hydrolysis of glucose 6-phosphate, a step catalyzed by the glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme complex. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that the complex consists of the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6Pase)1that resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and putative endoplasmic reticulum membrane-localized glucose 6-phosphate, glucose, and inorganic phosphate transporter activities (1Nordlie R.C.

Based on these findings, it has been suggested that perturbation of the balance between glucose phosphorylation and glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis might contribute to the abnormal regulation of hepatic glucose production that is characteristic of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Although the foregoing observations are important, they do not provide direct evidence for a role of altered hepatic G6Pase expression in regulation of fuel homeostasis, for two main reasons. First, it cannot be assumed that altered expression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit alone will be sufficient to increase flux throughout the entire G6Pase complex. To partially test this point, we have recently used recombinant adenovirus technology to overexpress the G6Pase catalytic subunit in INS-1 insulinoma cells or primary rat hepatocytes, resulting in increased glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis in both cell preparations (19Trinh K.

In hepatocytes, overexpression of G6Pase resulted in marked lowering of glucose 6-phosphate levels and attendant decreases in glycogen synthesis and glycolytic flux (20Seoane J. Trinh K.

Whereas these data make it clear that flux through the glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme complex can be altered by manipulation of the expression level of the G6Pase catalytic subunit in vitro, it remains to be determined whether the results achieved in cultured cells can be replicated in vivo. The second major concern is that maneuvers that have been used to modulate G6Pase expression in vivo such as partial pancreatectomy, glucose infusion, or intralipid infusion can be expected to influence expression of a wide spectrum of genes encoding metabolic enzymes or other proteins (21Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), making it difficult to isolate the specific impact of G6Pase overexpression. The purpose of this study was to address these issues and to evaluate the potential role of hepatic overexpression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit in the development of diabetes. In an initial set of experiments, we provide the first demonstration that hepatic G6Pase enzymatic activity is significantly elevated in a genetic model of obesity and diabetes, the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat (fa/fa), relative to lean controls. To assess the potential contribution of up-regulated G6Pase expression to development of diabetes and obesity, we have used a recombinant adenovirus containing the G6Pase cDNA to overexpress the enzyme in liver of normal rats. Metabolic analyses performed on these animals under a variety of conditions demonstrate that they develop glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia, a marked decrease in hepatic glycogen levels and circulating hypolipidemia associated with tissue fat overstorage. These results demonstrate that up-regulated expression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit in liver alters a wide spectrum of metabolic parameters. A recombinant adenovirus containing the cDNA encoding the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase (AdCMV-G6Pase) was prepared as described previously (19Trinh K. Minassian C. Lange A.J. O'Doherty R.M. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24837-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A virus containing the Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase gene (AdCMV-β-Gal; see Ref. 22Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) was used for control experiments. Male Wistar rats (Charles River), Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats (fa/fa), and ZDF lean controls were used in these studies. ZDF obese and lean animals were studied at 9–10 weeks of age. Animals were housed individually and given free access to laboratory chow and water, except where indicated below, and food intake and body weight were recorded on a daily basis. In an initial set of experiments, liver samples were collected from all three rat strains for measurement of hepatic levels of G6Pase protein and enzymatic activity, using methods described below. In a subsequent series of experiments, AdCMV-G6Pase or AdCMV-β-Gal viruses were infused into normal Wistar rats, weighing 250–300 g. To reduce immunologic responses to the infused viruses, animals were treated with 8 mg/kg/day cyclosporin A (Calbiochem) and 2.5 mg/kg/day prednisone (Sigma) 2 days prior to adenovirus administration. The cyclosporin dose was doubled on the day of viral infusion and then changed to a daily maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg/day for 5 more days. Prednisone was discontinued on day 3 after viral infusion. Animals were infused with 1 × 1012 virions of either the AdCMV-G6Pase or AdCMV-β-Gal viruses in 200–250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline via a 22-gauge catheter inserted in the major tail vein. Cyclosporin levels were measured at different time points to ensure appropriate therapeutic levels (Cyclo-Trac I-125 RIA kit, Incstar Corp.), and plasma alkaline phosphatase and creatinine were measured as an index of cyclosporin-related liver or kidney damage, using a kit and methods provided by Sigma. Finally, possible adenovirus-mediated hepatotoxicity was monitored by daily measurement of plasma aspartate aminotransferase (Sigma Diagnostic kit). A normal rate of weight gain was found to be restored within 3 days of viral infusion (data not shown), consistent with previous findings (23Chen G. Koyama K. Yuan X. Lee Y. Zhou Y.-T. O'Doherty R. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14795-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Animals treated in the foregoing manner were subjected to one of the following experimental protocols. For protocol 1, animals were allowed to feed ad libitum for 7 days after viral infusion. During this 7-day interval, blood samples were collected on a daily basis for analysis of metabolic variables (see below). At the end of this period, animals were sacrificed for harvest of tissues. For protocol 2, animals were allowed to feed ad libitum for 5 days after viral infusion and then were subjected to an overnight fast (all food removed but water still available). Fasted animals were then subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), involving administration of 2 g/kg glucose via oral gavage. Blood samples were obtained immediately prior to the glucose gavage (0 time point) and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the glucose load and used for assays of various metabolic parameters (see below). At the end of the 120-min glucose tolerance test, animals were sacrificed for tissue collection. For protocol 3, animals were allowed to feed ad libitum for 4 days and then fasted for 48 h. These animals were subjected to an OGTT identical to that described in protocol 2. At the conclusion of the OGTT, animals were provided with a measured amount of food (20 g) and allowed to refeed for an additional overnight period. At the conclusion of this refeeding period, blood samples were collected, and animals were sacrificed for tissue collection. Fresh liver samples (1 g) were homogenized in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. G6Pase enzymatic activity was assayed in 100,000 × gmicrosomal fractions as described previously (19Trinh K. Minassian C. Lange A.J. O'Doherty R.M. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24837-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using 40 μg of microsomal protein per assay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). Levels of the G6Pase catalytic subunit protein were also measured by immunoblot analysis with a polyclonal antiserum raised against the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase of rat (25Haber B.A. Chin S. Chuang E. Buikhuisen W. Naji A. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), using previously described methods (19Trinh K. Minassian C. Lange A.J. O'Doherty R.M. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24837-24842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Blood samples were collected in tubes or syringes pre-rinsed with 0.1 m EDTA and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Plasma glucose concentrations were measured with a HemoCue glucose analyzer. Insulin radioimmunoassay was carried out with 25 μl of plasma, using the Linco rat insulin kit and rat insulin standards. Plasma triglyceride levels were determined with a Sigma triglyceride-GPO kit, and free fatty acids (FFA) were measured in fresh plasma with the Half-Micro test kit from Boehringer Mannheim. Liver glycogen levels were measured as described (26Newgard C.B. Hirsch L.J. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure muscle triglyceride levels, 1 g of frozen gastrocnemius muscle was homogenized in 2 ml of buffer consisting of 18 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mmmannitol, 50 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After removal of a small aliquot of the homogenate for determination of total protein, 100 μl of the homogenate was mixed with 4 ml of chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1, v/v) for extraction of total lipids. After insoluble materials were filtered from the chloroform/methanol/lipid solution, 0.8 ml of water was added to separate the organic phase containing tissue lipid from the aqueous phase. A portion of the triglyceride-containing solution was dried under nitrogen gas, resuspended in 60 μl of t-butyl alcohol, and then mixed with 40 μl of Triton/methanol (2:1, v/v) to completely dissolve the lipid suspension, and an aliquot of this solution was used for triglyceride assay with the Sigma triglyceride-GPO kit. Defective suppression of hepatic glucose output is a hallmark of human NIDDM. Like human NIDDM subjects, ZDF rats exhibit profound hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia, and impaired control of hepatic glucose production (27Magnusson I. Rothman D.L. Katz L.D.

Med. 1983; 173: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The potential role of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase expression in development of diabetes in ZDF rats has never been investigated, although increased expression of the mRNA encoding the G6Pase catalytic subunit in the islets of Langerhans of these animals has been reported (32Tokuyama Y. Sturis J. DePaoli A.M. Takeda J. Stoffel M. Tang J. Sun X. Polonsky K.S. Bell G.I. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1447-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated expression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit by immunoblot analysis and measurement of enzymatic activity in liver microsomes isolated from obese ZDF diabetic males, lean non-diabetic ZDF males of the same age (9 weeks), and weight-matched Wistar male rats. We observed a 2.4-fold increase in hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase enzymatic activity in ZDF diabetic animals compared with either control group, and this increase was accompanied by a similar increase in the expression of immunodetectable G6Pase catalytic subunit (Fig. 1). Glucose-6-phosphatase enzymatic activity was not detectable in skeletal muscle of ZDF diabetic males, ZDF lean controls, or Wistar rats, providing evidence that expression of G6Pase was not activated in other important homeostatic tissues in diabetic animals. These data suggest that up-regulation of hepatic G6Pase expression could contribute to development of the diabetic phenotype in ZDF rats and led us to investigate the specific metabolic impact of overexpression of the enzyme in liver of normal rats. Normal Wistar rats were infused with AdCMV-G6Pase or AdCMV-β-Gal and allowed access to food and water ad libitum. Seven days after viral infusion, blood samples were collected for measurement of circulating metabolites and hormone levels prior to sacrificing the animals for tissue collection. At this time point, circulating levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine were all within the normal range in both the AdCMV-G6Pase and AdCMV-β-Gal-treated animals, indicating no substantial liver or kidney damage in response to viral infusion (data not shown). Liver microsome samples were used for analysis of levels of the G6Pase catalytic subunit by immunoblotting and measurement of enzymatic activity. A representative immunoblot showing the clear increase in hepatic expression of the G6Pase catalytic subunit protein in AdCMV-G6Pase compared with AdCMV-β-Gal-treated animals is shown in Fig. 2. This increase in protein corresponded to a 2.9-fold increase in G6Pase enzymatic activity measured in freshly isolated microsomes (Table I).Table IMetabolic parameters of rats fed ad libitum after infusion of AdCMV-G6Pase or AdCMV-β-Gal adenovirusesViral treatmentG6Pase activityPlasma glucosePlasma insulinPlasma FFAPlasma triglyceridesLiver glycogenunits/mg proteinmg/dlng/mlmmmg/dlμg/mg proteinAdCMV-G6Pase (n = 6)1.47 ± 0.6184 ± 122.2 ± 0.90.72 ± 0.3124 ± 29240 ± 55AdCMV-β-Gal (n = 6)0.51 ± 0.1161 ± 211.5 ± 0.71.14 ± 0.5174 ± 62563 ± 167Statistical significancep < 0.01p< 0.05p < 0.03p < 0.05p< 0.04p < 0.005Blood and liver samples were collected from rats fed ad libitum for 7 days after virus infusion, as described under “Materials and Methods,” protocol 1.

Results represent the mean ± S.E. for assays performed in duplicate on samples taken from the number of animals shown in parentheses in the left hand column. Previous studies in mouse have demonstrated that systemic administration of recombinant adenovirus results in gene transfer primarily to liver (22Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). To ensure that this was also the case in the current studies performed in rats, we measured glucose-6-phosphatase enzymatic activity in skeletal muscle, abdominal fat, and pancreas samples from the same AdCMV-G6Pase- and AdCMV-β-Gal-treated animals used for the hepatic measurements described above. We found no detectable activity in muscle or pancreas of either AdCMV-G6Pase- or AdCMV-β-Gal-treated animals. G6Pase activity was found at very low levels in abdominal fat but with no significant differences between the two experimental groups (0.107 ± 0.016 units/mg protein compared with 0.096 ± 0.015 units/mg in fat tissues of AdCMV-G6Pase- and AdCMV-β-Gal-infused animals, respectively, n = 6 for both groups). Based on these data, we conclude that the G6Pase gene was not targeted to these important extrahepatic homeostatic tissues by the adenovirus vector. Table I provides a summary of a group of metabolic parameters assayed in the AdCMV-G6Pase and AdCMV-β-Gal animals fed ad libitum. Circulating glucose levels were raised by 14% and insulin levels by 47% in AdCMV-G6Pase-treated animals relative to controls. Despite the mild hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, liver glycogen levels were reduced by 57% in AdCMV-G6Pase-treated animals. In contrast, lipid metabolism was regulated in a manner consistent with the elevated insulin levels. Circulating FFA and triglycerides (TG) were decreased by 37 and 29%, respectively, in AdCMV-G6Pase-treated animals (Table I), whereas triglyceride levels in isolated muscle samples were increased by 59% (Fig. 3). The increases in circulating glucose and insulin levels in AdCMV-G6Pase-treated rats fed ad libitum was suggestive of a state of glucose intolerance. To evaluate this possibility in more detail, animals were infused with AdCMV-G6Pase or AdCMV-β-Gal viruses, allowed free access to food for the ensuing 5 days, and were then fasted overnight. After the fast, both groups were subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test. At the end of this test, animals were sacrificed for tissue collection. AdCMV-G6Pase-infused animals had 2.3-fold more hepatic G6Pase activity than AdCMV-β-Gal-infused controls (Table II). As shown in Fig. 4, circulating glucose levels were not different in AdCMV-G6Pase-treated compared with AdCMV-β-Gal-treated animals after the overnight fast and prior to initiation of the OGTT (0 time point). However, AdCMV-G6Pase-treated animals had significantly increased circulating glucose levels relative to control animals at all time points evaluated after administration of the oral glucose bolus, with a range of increase between 17 and 27%. Other serum parameters were measured only at the 120-min time point after oral glucose. At this time, plasma glucose and insulin levels were increased by 27 and 41%, respectively, in AdCMV-G6Pase- versusAdCMV-β-Gal-infused rats, whereas FFA and TG were decreased by 32 and 24%, respectively, similar to findings in animals fedad libitum. Liver glycogen was decreased by 55% in AdCMV-G6Pase-infused animals, indicating that G6Pase overexpression causes a lowering of these stores in both animals fed ad libitum and in animals synthesizing glycogen in response to glucose infusion after a fast (Tables I and II).Table IIMetabolic parameters in AdCMV-G6Pase and AdCMV-β-GAL-infused rats after an overnight fast and administration of an oral glucose tolerance testViral treatmentG6Pase activityPlasma glucosePlasma insulinPlasma FFAPlasma triglyceridesLiver glycogenunits/mg proteinmg/dlng/mlmmmg/dlμg/mg proteinAdCMV-G6Pase (n = 5)1.50 ± 0.3229 ± 120.93 ± 0.41.9 ± 1.061.7 ± 6.6235 ± 70AdCMV-β-Gal (n = 5)0.66 ± 0.2180 ± 210.66 ± 0.12.8 ± 0.880.4 ± 11.7523 ± 146Statistical significancep < 0.002p < 0.01p < 0.05p< 0.05p < 0.02p < 0.005Blood and liver samples were collected as described under “Materials and Methods,” protocol 2.

In animals fasted overnight, glycogenolysis is likely to make a significant contribution to hepatic glucose production, thus possibly obscuring the full impact of G6Pase overexpression during OGTT. To investigate this more fully, we evaluated the ability of AdCMV-G6Pase overexpressing animals to recover from a more extended period of fasting, and we also evaluated metabolic parameters after refeeding of the fasted animals. Rats were infused with AdCMV-G6Pase or AdCMV-β-Gal and allowed to recover for 4 days with ad libitum access to food. They were then fasted for 48 h, subjected to OGTT, and allowed to refeed on 20 g of chow/day for an overnight period. The amount of food consumed and the measured weight gain was the same for the AdCMV-β-Gal- and AdCMV-G6Pase-infused animals over the final day of the protocol (data not shown). At the end of the complete regimen, liver samples were collected and used immediately for assay of G6Pase enzymatic activity. G6Pase activity was increased by 67% in AdCMV-G6Pase-treated animals compared with AdCMV-β-Gal-treated controls (Table III). AdCMV-G6Pase-treated animals had similarly elevated levels of glucose during OGTT after a 48-h fast as they did after an overnight fast, whereas AdCMV-β-Gal-treated controls had a smaller increase in circulating glucose levels after a 48-h fast, indicating that the difference between groups was more apparent in the 48-h fasted animals (Fig. 5). The range of differences in blood glucose levels between AdCMV-G6Pase- and AdCMV-β-Gal-treated 48-h fasted animals during the glucose tolerance test was 23–52%. In blood samples taken after refeeding of the 48-h fasted animals, glucose and insulin levels were increased by 24 and 91%, respectively, whereas plasma FFA and triglycerides were decreased by 57 and 33%, respectively, in AdCMV-G6Pase-infused animals relative to controls (Table III). Glycogen levels were reduced by 53% in AdCMV-G6Pase-treated animals, similar to the decreases observed in protocols 1 and 2. However, absolute levels of glycogen were approximately 4 times higher in 48-h fasted and refed animals than in overnight fasted or animals fed ad libitum (compare Tables Table I, Table II, Table III). An “overshoot” of glycogen synthesis in animals refed after prolonged fasting has been previously described (33Chang M.L. Johnson M.A. J. Nutr. 1976; 106: 136-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may explain the difference between groups in this study. Nevertheless, significant perturbation of a variety of metabolic parameters remains evident in G6Pase overexpressing compared with control rats even after allow"

A screen for mutations that modify a ksr-dependent phenotype identified a novel gene, connector enhancer of ksr (cnk), that functions upstream or in parallel to RAF in the RAS pathway. cnk encodes a protein containing several protein–protein interaction domains, suggesting that it brings different signaling molecules together. CNK is required in multiple receptor tyrosine kinase pathways where it appears to be a tyrosine phosphorylation target. Finally, CNK physically interacts with RAF and appears to localize to cell–cell contact regions. Together, these findings suggest that CNK is a novel component of a RAS-dependent signaling pathway that regulates RAF function and/or targets RAF to a specific subcellular compartment upon RAS activation."

Nucleotide excision repair (NER)1 in yeast and other eukaryotic organisms is a highly intricate process that requires a large number of protein factors. The NER reaction entails damage recognition in the target DNA, sequential assembly of a number of repair protein complexes at the damage site, and dual incision of the damage-containing DNA strand, resulting in the excision of the damage in the form of a short DNA fragment ∼27–30 nucleotides in length (1Guzder S.N.

Important insights concerning the action mechanism of NER in eukaryotes have been garnered from genetic and biochemical studies in yeast, and the incision phase of NER has been reconstituted using highly purified repair factors. Using UV-damaged DNA as a substrate, we showed previously that the combination of the Rad14 protein, the Rad4-Rad23 complex, the six-subunit RNA polymerase II transcription factor TFIIH, the heterotrimeric replication protein A (RPA), the Rad1-Rad10 complex, and the Rad2 nuclease mediates dual incision of the damaged DNA (1Guzder S.N.

Subsequent studies showed that Rad14 in fact exists as a complex with the Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease in the cell, and the complex consisting of Rad1-Rad10-Rad14 has been named nucleotide excision repair factor 1 (NEF1) (2Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8903-8910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Likewise, Rad2 associates stably with the six-subunit TFIIH to form NEF3 (3Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, we showed that the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins, which genetic studies have implicated in the nucleotide excision repair reaction, also exist in a stoichiometric complex termed NEF4. Consistent with the genetic data, the addition of NEF4 to the reconstituted repair reaction stimulates the incision efficiency markedly (7Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These studies have allowed us to deduce that the yeast nucleotide excision repair machinery comprises NEF1, NEF2, NEF3, NEF4, and RPA (7Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol.

Substantial information concerning the biochemical functions of NEF1, NEF3, and NEF4 has been gleaned from biochemical studies with purified components that constitute these NEFs, with the notable exception of NEF2. For understanding the function of NEF2 in the UV damage-specific incision reaction, we have overproduced NEF2 in yeast and purified it to near homogeneity. Here we report our biochemical studies, which directly link NEF2 to the damage recognition reaction. The Rad4 protein is highly toxic to Escherichia coli, and for this reason, a stuffer DNA fragment has to be inserted into the open reading frame of RAD4 for stable maintenance of RAD4-containing plasmids in E. coli (9Fleer R. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4884-4892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gietz R.D. Prakash S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Rad4 protein coding frame from the ATG initiation codon to 434 bp downstream of the TAG stop codon, and containing a 2.2-kb BglII DNA stuffer fragment, was placed under the control of the constitutively expressed ADC1promoter to yield plasmid pR4.1 (2μ, ADH-RAD4). After removal of the stuffer fragment by BglII digestion, the plasmid was recircularized by ligation and then transformed into the protease-deficient yeast strain YRP11. YRP11 harboring pR4.1 was grown in synthetic medium lacking tryptophan to a density of 5 × 107 cells/ml and then harvested by centrifugation. Yeast paste (500 g) was resuspended in cell breakage buffer and lysed using a French press. The crude lysate was clarified and treated with ammonium sulfate at 0.21 g/ml to precipitate NEF2. The ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in 300 ml of K buffer (20 mmKH2PO4, pH7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) to give conductivity equivalent to 100 mm KCl and then loaded directly on a Q-Sepharose column (1.5 × 14 cm, 25 ml) equilibrated in K buffer with 100 mm KCl. The column was developed with a 250-ml gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in K buffer, and 50 fractions were collected. Fractions containing the peak of NEF2, eluting at 300 mm KCl, were identified by immunoblotting and pooled (Fraction III, 45 ml). The Q-Sepharose pool was dialyzed against K buffer for 2 h to lower the ionic strength to 100 mm KCl before fractionation on an SP-Sepharose column (1 × 5 cm, 4 ml) equilibrated in K buffer with 100 mm KCl and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. The column was developed with a 50-ml gradient from 100 to 450 mm KCl in K buffer, collecting 50 fractions. The pool of NEF2 (fraction IV, 8 ml), eluting at ∼250 mm KCl, was applied onto a 1-ml hydroxyapatite column, which was developed with a 30-ml gradient of 20–300 mm KH2PO4 in K buffer and 0.01% Nonidet P-40, collecting 30 fractions. The NEF2 peak (fraction V, 5 ml), eluting at ∼150 mm KH2PO4, was concentrated to 0.6 ml and then fractionated in a 30-ml Sephacryl S300 column in K buffer with 100 mm KCl and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. The S300 NEF2 pool (fraction VI) was fractionated in a Mono Q column with a 30-ml 100–500 mm KCl gradient in buffer K and 0.01% Nonidet P-40, collecting 30 fractions. NEF2 elutes from Mono Q at ∼300 mm KCl, the pool of which (fraction VII, 2 ml) was diluted with 4 ml of 10% glycerol that also contained 0.01% Nonidet P-40 and then further fractionated in a 2500-μl Mini S column, with a 5-ml gradient of 100–500 mm KCl, collecting 25 fractions. NEF2 elutes from Mini S at ∼250 mm KCl in fractions 10–14, which were individually concentrated to 30 μl in Minicon-30 concentrators. NEF2 from the Mini S column (fraction VIII) was nearly homogeneous (Fig. 1 B) and was used in all of the DNA binding experiments described herein. The entire open reading frame of RAD4 from the initiating ATG to 434 bp downstream of the stop codon and containing a 2.2-kb BglII DNA stuffer fragment was inserted at the BamHI site of the baculovirus vector pVL1393 (Invitrogen) to yield plasmid pR4.4, thus placingRAD4 under the control of the viral polyhedrin promoter.Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were co-transfected with linear wild-type AcMNPV DNA (Invitrogen) and pR4.4 (minus the stuffer fragment), and recombinants were detected by visual screening for the occlusion-negative (polyhedrin-negative) phenotype and then examined for expression of Rad4 protein by comparing the lysate of insect cells infected with the RAD4 recombinant baculovirus with lysate from cells infected with the wild-type virus by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Rad4 protein was easily identified in extract of insect cells harvested from 36 to 72 h after infection with the Rad4 protein expressing recombinant baculovirus, but essentially all of the Rad4 protein is insoluble. The Rad4 protein in the insoluble fraction was solubilized by boiling in SDS buffer, purified by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then injected into rabbits for generating polyclonal antiserum. Rad4 antigen (2 mg) was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose to generate an affinity matrix to purify anti-Rad4 antibodies from the antiserum. The anti-Rad23 affinity-purified antibodies were obtained as described previously (11Watkins J.F. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). A 130-bpHindIII-SalI fragment harboring a stretch of thymines in the middle was isolated from plasmid pTB402, labeled with32P, and irradiated with UV light (254 nm) as described previously (7Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Purified NEF2 was incubated with the32P-labeled, UV-irradiated DNA (2 ng) and 100 ng of unlabeled, unirradiated φ X174 double-stranded DNA (linearized withHaeIII) in 10 μl of reaction buffer (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then run on 3.6% polyacrylamide gels in Tris acetate-EDTA buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mmEDTA) at 30 mA at 4 °C for 1 h. The gels were dried and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. MR films, and the autoradiograms were subjected to image analysis in a Bio-Rad GS670 densitometer to obtain data points for graphical repesentation of the results. Purified NEF2 in 10 μl of DNA mobility shift reaction buffer was preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min with the indicated amounts of affinity-purified anti-Rad4 or anti-Rad6 antibodies added in 1 μl of storage buffer (10 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl). After the addition of the radiolabeled, UV-irradiated DNA substrate (10 kJ/m2) and the cold, unirradiated competitor DNA, the reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then processed for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described above under “DNA Mobility Shift Assay.” UV-irradiated,32P-labeled DNA fragment (500 ng) was mixed with 3 μg of Escherichia coli photolyase (a gift from Aziz Sancar) in 100 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, and 100 μg/ml BSA) and placed under photoreactivating light emitting at ∼360 nm for 20 min at 25 °C. An identical reaction mixture incubated with photolyase in the dark served as control. The reaction mixtures were extracted twice with phenol, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol and redissolved in 20 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer. The complete removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers from the UV-irradiated DNA was verified by incubating the photoreactivated DNA with T4 pyrimidine-dimer endonuclease, as described previously (12Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,13Burns J.L. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11607-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To facilitate the purification of NEF2, we overexpressed the Rad4 protein in yeast. We have found that Rad23 protein is present in considerable molar excess over the Rad4 protein in wild-type yeast cells. Thus, overexpression of Rad4 protein alone was sufficient to obtain NEF2, and there was no advantage of simultaneously overexpressing Rad23 as well (data not shown). A purification procedure, which entails ammonium sulfate precipitation of cell extract, followed by chromatographic fractionation in columns of Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, Sephacryl S300, Mono Q, and Mini S, was devised to purify NEF2 ∼10,000-fold to near homogeneity (Fig. 1, A and B). During purification, the elution of NEF2 from various columns was monitored by immunoblot analyses for the Rad4 and Rad23 proteins. The Rad4 and Rad23 proteins remain quantitatively associated throughout all of the purification steps. When analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue, the Rad4-Rad23 protein complex (NEF2) from the final Mini S column (fraction VIII) showed only the Rad4 and Rad23 protein bands, indicating that the NEF2 preparation was nearly homogeneous. Fraction VIII NEF2 was used in all of the biochemical studies described below. The yield of NEF2 from 500 g of starting yeast paste was ∼50 μg. Genetic studies have implicated the two constitutents of NEF2, Rad4 and Rad23 proteins, in the incision step of nucleotide excision repair (14Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Our in vitro studies with the reconstituted nucleotide excision repair system have indicated an essential function of NEF2 in the incision of UV-damaged DNA (1Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because NEF2 does not appear to possess an enzymatic activity, we examined whether NEF2 was involved in the recognition of UV-induced DNA damage. For examining the DNA binding properties of NEF2, a 130-bp DNA fragment containing a run of thymine residues in the middle was irradiated with a range of UV dose from 1 to 12 kJ/m2 to introduce different levels of UV photoproducts into the DNA. The unirradiated DNA and UV-damaged DNAs were incubated with purified NEF2 at 30 °C in the presence of an excess of cold, unirradiated DNA to titrate out the nonspecific background binding. The reaction mixtures were run out on a native polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C, after which the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray films to detect nucleoprotein species. As shown in Fig. 2 A, incubation of the UV-damaged DNA with NEF2 resulted in the formation of nucleoprotein complexes with a retarded mobility compared with the free probe, whereas little binding (<2%) to the unirradiated DNA fragment occurred. The amount of nucleoprotein complexes increased with the UV dose, and at 10 kJ/m2, >80% of the DNA fragment was converted into nucleoprotein complexes (Fig. 2 B). The amount of UV damage specific nucleoprotein complex formation was proportional to the amount of NEF2 in the reaction, and even at the highest concentration of NEF2, the level of background binding to the unirradiated fragment did not increase significantly (Fig. 3). These experiments (Figs. 2 and 3) showed that purified NEF2 had an associated UV damage-specific DNA binding activity. In other experiments, we found that the damage binding activity of NEF2 was not influenced by 1 mm ATP (data not shown).Figure 3Damage binding as a function of NEF2 concentration. A, unirradiated DNA (lanes 1–3) and DNA irradiated with 10 kJ/m2 UV light (lanes 4–10) were incubated with increasing amounts of NEF2, as indicated. The reaction mixtures were analyzed as described in the Fig. 2 legend. F, free DNA probe; C, nucleoprotein complexes. B, data points obtained from image analysis of the autoradiogram in A were plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In both Figs. 2 and 3, three distinct nucleoprotein complexes were detected. The levels of the slower-migrating species were much more prevalent at higher UV doses and NEF2 concentrations. Because the DNA fragment used contained multiple target sites for UV photoproduct formation, it seems quite possible that different nucleoprotein complexes correspond to increasing number of NEF2 molecules bound to separate UV lesions in the same DNA fragment. The high degree of purity of our NEF2 protein preparations and the known involvement of NEF2 in the incision of UV-damaged DNA bothin vivo (14Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and in vitro (1Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) strongly suggested that the damage-specific binding activity observed was in fact an intrinsic property of NEF2. However, to obtain further corroborating evidence that NEF2 does indeed possess UV damage recognition activity, we examined the co-elution of this activity with NEF2 and also the specific inhibition of this activity by anti-Rad4 antibody. For the co-elution experiment, extract from 500 g of wild-type yeast cells without the Rad4-overexpressing plasmid was subjected to exactly the same chromatographic procedure as used for the purification of NEF2 from Rad4-overproducing cells (Fig. 1 A). Fractions 6–20 from the Mini S step obtained from wild-type cells lacking the Rad4-overproducing plasmid as well as the equivalent fractions from the Mini S column obtained during the purification of NEF2 from 500 g of the Rad4-overproducing yeast strain were subjected to immunoblot analysis to determine their content of NEF2, and these fractions were also used in DNA mobility shift assays with the unirradiated DNA fragment and a DNA fragment irradiated with 10 kJ/m2 of UV light. As shown in Fig. 4 A, because of the low level of NEF2 in wild-type cells, it was barely detectable in the Mini S fractions derived from the extract of wild-type cells, and accordingly, no binding to UV-damaged DNA was detected in these fractions. As expected, the DNA damage binding activity in the Mini S fractions derived from the extract of Rad4-overproducing cells precisely paralleled the NEF2 amounts in these fractions (Fig. 4 A). For the antibody inhibition experiment, NEF2 was preincubated with increasing amounts of affinity-purified antibody against the Rad4 protein and also with control antibody specific for the Rad6 protein. As shown in Fig. 4 B, whereas damage binding was not affected by even the highest amount (1 μg) of the control anti-Rad6 antibody, the addition of anti-Rad4 antibody resulted in strong inhibition of the reaction. Specifically, the level of binding of the UV-damaged DNA fragment by NEF2 was reduced to 80, 50, and 20% of the uninhibited level in the presence of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 μg of the anti-Rad4 antibody, respectively. From the results presented in Fig. 4, A and B, we conclude that NEF2 has the ability to bind specifically to UV-damaged DNA. We have previously described the purification of Rad23 protein from a yeast strain genetically tailored to overproduce this protein (15Guzder S.N. Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8385-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In view of the UV damage binding activity present in NEF2, we examined whether Rad23 protein alone has DNA damage-specific binding activity. As shown in Fig. 5, Rad23 does not bind to the same DNA fragment used in the experiments with NEF2, regardless of whether the DNA was UV-irradiated. The result with Rad23 protein alone (Fig. 5) suggests the possibility that the damage recognition activity may reside in the Rad4 protein. However, we have been unable to purify Rad4 protein to test this hypothesis, because Rad4 protein expressed in yeast cells deleted for the RAD23 gene does not behave well chromatographically, and because Rad4 protein expressed in insect cells is insoluble (data not shown). UV light elicits the formation of two types of photoproducts in DNA, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and the pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts. The kinetics of formation of these two classes of photoproducts differ in that the level of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers reaches photochemical equilibrium at ∼4 kJ/m2, whereas the yield of the pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts continues to increase with the UV dose (16Spivak G. Leadon S.A. Vos J.M. Meade S. Hanawalt P.C. Ganesan A.K. Mutat. Res. 1988; 193: 97-108PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bourre F. Renault G. Sarasin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8861-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the level of nucleoprotein complexes continues to rise beyond 4 kJ/m2, where the content of pyrimidine dimers had already become saturated, indicating that NEF2 can recognize the pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts. We made use of enzymatic photoreactivation to determine whether NEF2 also has an affinity for pyrimidine dimers. To do this, DNA irradiated with a UV dose of 2 or 10 kJ/m2 was treated with E. coli photolyase, which uses light energy to eliminate the pyrimidine dimers by converting the two cross-linked pyrimidine residues back to the monomeric form (18Sancar G.B. Smith F.W. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1849-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The removal of pyrimidine dimers from the UV-irradiated fragments was verified using the T4 UV endonuclease, which nicks DNA at sites of pyrimidine dimers, as we have done before (12Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Burns J.L. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11607-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, the levels of NEF2·DNA nucleoprotein complexes obtained with either UV-irradiated DNA fragment did not diminish after photoreactivation, indicating that NEF2 has little affinity for the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Genetic studies have implicated the Rad4 and Rad23 proteins in the incision step of NER (14Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have indicated that these two proteins exist as a tight stoichiometric complex called NEF2, which is essential for the incision of UV-damaged DNA in our reconstituted nucleotide excision repair system (1Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that NEF2 binds UV-damaged DNA specifically, and photoreactivation of UV-damaged DNA did not diminish the interaction of NEF2 with the target DNA, strongly suggesting that NEF2 specifically recognizes the pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts in the damaged DNA. At 10 kJ/m2, at which we observed a >80-fold preference for binding UV-damaged DNA, there is an average of ∼1.5 pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts/molecule of the 130-bp DNA fragment. From this, it can be estimated that NEF2 shows greater than (80 × 130/1.5) 6000-fold preferential binding to pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproduct sites than to undamaged nucleotides. The damage recognition ability of NEF2 shows no dependence on ATP. We also find that Rad23 protein alone does not bind DNA, suggesting the possibiltities that either the damage binding activity resides in Rad4 or that activation of the damage recognition ability is contingent on complex formation between the Rad4 and Rad23 proteins. We reported previously that Rad23 protein interacts with TFIIH and Rad14 (15Guzder S.N. Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8385-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), consistent with the premise that Rad23 functions to link NEF2 to other components of the incision machinery during UV damage removal. The identification of NEF2 as a damage recognition factor underscores the complexity of the damage recognition reaction during NER in eukaryotes. To date, three other NER protein factors have been shown to have the ability to bind UV-damaged DNA, namely, NEF4, consisting of the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins (7Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the zinc-metalloprotein Rad14 (12Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and the heterotrimeric RPA (13Burns J.L. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11607-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although recognition of DNA damage by Rad14 (12Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), RPA (13Burns J.L. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11607-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and NEF2 (this work) does not show a dependence on a nucleoside triphosphate, damage binding by NEF4 is markedly stimulated by ATP (7Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the presence of a DNA-dependent ATPase activity in NEF4 (8Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our recent results have suggested that although ATP binding alone is sufficient to induce a conformation in NEF4 necessary for damage binding, ATP hydrolysis may in fact fuel the translocation of NEF4 on DNA in search of DNA lesions (8Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These properties of NEF4 suggest that it may be the primary damage sensor that monitors chromatin for the presence of DNA damage in vivo. On encountering a DNA lesion, NEF4 becomes stably bound to the lesion and then recruits the other nucleotide excision repair factors, including NEF2, leading to the assembly of the incision repair complex and the DNA damage-specific incision. XPC, the human homolog of RAD4, is required for the repair of nontranscribed regions of the genome but not for the repair of the transcribed strand of actively transcribed genes (19Venema J. van Hoffen A. Karcagi V. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Also, mouse embryo fibroblasts of XPC−/− mice are completely defective in the removal of pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts from the nontranscribed strand, but they repair significant levels of UV damage from the transcribed strand (20Cheo D.L. Ruven H.J.T. Meira L.B. Hammer R.E. Burns D.K. Tappe N.J. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. Friedberg E.C. Mutat. Res. 1997; 374: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast to XPC, theRAD4 gene of yeast is essential for the repair of both transcribed and nontranscribed regions of the genome. Therad4Δ mutants are as highly sensitive to UV damage as deletions of other incision genes (10Gietz R.D. Prakash S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and no incision of UV-damaged DNA occurs in the rad4 mutant in vivo (21Wilcox D.R. Prakash L. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 618-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the reconstituted system, no incision of UV-damaged DNA occurs in the absence of NEF2 (1Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Even though the absence of RAD23 does not completely inactivate NER (22Miller R.D. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 188: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the repair of both the transcribed and nontranscribed DNAs is decreased in therad23Δ mutant (23Mueller J.P. Smerdon M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2361-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, all the evidence suggests that the yeast Rad4-Rad23 complex functions in the repair of both the transcribed and nontranscribed DNAs. In contrast to yeast, in whichRAD23 is a single-copy gene, humans contain two copies of this gene, hHR23A and hHR23B, and XPC existsin vivo in a complex with hHR23B (24Matsutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). It is possible that like hHR23, XPC also has become duplicated in humans and other mammals, and the other copy of XPC functions withhHR23A in the repair of the transcribed strand. Thus, like the Rad4-Rad23 complex, the XPC-hHR23 complexes may also be critical for the repair of both transcribed and nontranscribed DNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1979823644,"Throughout the developing nervous system, competition between axons causes the permanent removal of some synaptic connections. In mouse neuromuscular junctions at birth, terminal branches of different axons are intermingled. However, during the several weeks after birth, these branches progressively segregated into nonoverlapping compartments before the complete withdrawal of all but one axon. Segregation was caused by selective branch atrophy, detachment, and withdrawal; the axon branches that were nearest to the competitor's branches were removed before the more distant branches were removed. This progression suggests that the signals that mediate the competitive removal of synapses must decrease in potency over short distances."

Underwood W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15443-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Cholesterol made in the ER, as well as that released in the lysosome by lipoprotein catabolism, rapidly moves to the plasma membrane (1Liscum L. Underwood W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15443-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 2Urbani L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

Once the capacity of the plasma membrane to absorb cholesterol is exceeded, cholesterol is transported to the ER, where it is esterified, regulates 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase proteolysis, and inhibits proteolytic processing of sterol-regulatory element-binding proteins required for expression of sterol-regulated genes (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). This distribution of cholesterol between sites of regulation, synthesis, and deposition provides for efficient control of cellular cholesterol levels. Sphingomyelin appears to play an important role in this process as demonstrated by the capacity of exogenous sphingomyelinase to degrade plasma membrane SM and stimulate cholesterol esterification (5Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and sterol-regulatory element-binding protein processing (6Scheek S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11179-11183Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) in the ER. Cholesterol and SM are concentrated in the plasma membrane (7Lange Y.M. Swaisgood M.H. Ramos B.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3786-3793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are associated with caveolar membrane structures (8Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Change in the stoichiometry of cholesterol and SM, either by SM depletion or cholesterol loading, is accompanied by alterations in cholesterol homeostasis. For example, varying the SM content of macrophages altered the stimulation of ACAT activity by acetyl-LDL (9Okwu A.K. Xu X.-X. Shiratori Y. Tabas I. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 644-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SM content of macrophages was also increased by acetyl-LDL cholesterol loading (10Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by oxysterols in CHO cells (11Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1345-1358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While there is evidence that SM and cholesterol levels are coordinately regulated and this is important in cholesterol homeostasis, precise mechanisms remain to be determined (9Okwu A.K. Xu X.-X. Shiratori Y. Tabas I. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 644-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2159-2167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) for cholesterol transport from the plasma membrane in response to SM depletion or influx of cholesterol from the lysosomes is poorly understood. Delivery of β-very low density lipoprotein or LDL cholesterol from the lysosomes to ACAT has energy-dependent and -independent components (1Liscum L. Underwood W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15443-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 14Skiba P.J. Zha X. Maxfield F.R. Schissel S.L. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13392-13400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and could involve a vesicle transport step (14Skiba P.J. Zha X. Maxfield F.R. Schissel S.L. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13392-13400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the majority (>70%) transits through the plasma membrane (15Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Lange Y. Ye J. Chin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17018-17022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Stimulation of cholesterol esterification by SMase is energy-independent and involves vesiculation of the plasma membrane (14Skiba P.J. Zha X. Maxfield F.R. Schissel S.L. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13392-13400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Zha X. Pierini L.M. Leopold P.L. Skiba P.J. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). SMase-stimulated cholesterol esterification is also insensitive to protease inhibitors that blocked β-very low density lipoprotein activation of ACAT (18Schissel S.L. Beatini N. Zha X. Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10463-10473Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These differences could simply reflect the lysosome-plasma membrane transport component for lipoprotein-derived cholesterol delivery to the ER. However, stimulation of cholesterol esterification by lipoproteins and SMase was inhibited by U18666A, suggesting a common component to both pathways (19Harmala A.-S. Porn I. Mattjus P. Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 317-325Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Underwood K.W. Andemaraim B. McWilliams G.L. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1556-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several proteins have been implicated in the regulation of cellular cholesterol trafficking. Caveolin, a scaffold protein found in caveolae, binds cholesterol and facilitates its movement between the plasma membrane and ER (8Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The NPC-1 protein, which is defective in the Niemann-Pick C lysosomal cholesterol storage disorder, plays an undefined role in cholesterol egress from lysosomes (21Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J. Rosenfeld M.A. Paven W.J. Krisman D.B. Nagle J. Polymeropoulos M.H. Sturley S.L. Ioannou Y.A. Higgins M.E. Comly M. Cooney A. Brown A. Kaneski C.R.

Brady R.O. Vanier M.T. Penchev P.G. Tagle D.A. Science. 1997; 277: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Sterol carrier protein 2 has also been implicated in cholesterol transport from the ER to plasma membrane (22Puglielli L. Rigotti A. Greco A.V. Santos M.J. Nervi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Still other unidentified proteins are involved in the delivery of LDL- and SMase-derived cholesterol to the ER (23Jacobs N.L. Andemariam B. Underwood K.W. Panchalingam K. Sternberg D. Kielian M. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1973-1987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another protein that could be involved in cholesterol trafficking and regulation is the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP). OSBP was identified as a high affinity receptor for oxysterols such as 25-hydroxycholesterol (24Dawson P.A. Ridgway N.D. Slaughter C.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16798-16803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that localized to the Golgi apparatus in the presence of its oxysterol ligand (25Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The involvement of OSBP in cholesterol regulation was suggested by the positive correlation between oxysterol affinity for OSBP and suppression of cholesterol synthesis (26Taylor F.R. Saucier S.E. Shown E.P. Parish E.J. Kandutsch A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12382-12387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, overexpression of OSBP in CHO cells was shown to have pleotropic effects on cholesterol synthesis, expression of sterol-regulated gene expression, and ACAT activity (27Lagace T.A. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Deletion of the OSBP pleckstrin homology domain resulted in loss of this phenotype and lack of association with the Golgi apparatus. OSBP is a phosphoprotein that can be identified on SDS-PAGE by a characteristic increase in apparent molecular mass of 2–3 kDa over the dephosphorylated form (28Ridgway N.D. Badiani K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1390: 37-51Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). While it is presently uncertain how OSBP affects cholesterol homeostasis, its position in the Golgi/vesicular compartment is suggestive of a role in cellular sterol or lipid trafficking. In this study, we investigated whether SM hydrolysis at the plasma membrane and perturbation of cholesterol trafficking affected OSBP. As expected, bacterial SMase digested 60–70% of cellular SM and promoted cholesterol esterification. This was accompanied by OSBP dephosphorylation, which was reversible upon SMase removal, and translocation to the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of OSBP was directly linked to SM hydrolysis, but translocation to the Golgi apparatus was mediated by cholesterol depletion at the plasma membrane. Sphingomyelinase (Bacillus cereus), methyl-β-cyclodextrin, sphingosine, and fatty acid-free BSA were purchased from Sigma. Okadaic acid was from LC Laboratories. Phospholipase C (B. cereus) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. [32P]Phosphate, [1-3H]oleate, [G-3H]serine, and [methyl-3H]choline were from NEN Life Science Products. 25-Hydroxycholesterol was purchased from Steraloids (Wilton, NH). U18666A was kindly provided by Dr. M. E. Torkelson (Upjohn). Goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from Bio-Rad. C2- and C6-ceramide were prepared by acylation of sphingosine and complexed with BSA prior to addition to cells (29Ridgway N.D. Merriam D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Enhanced chemiluminescence kits were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Protein was determined with a micro-BCA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). CHO-K1 cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. CHO-K1 cells overexpressing rabbit OSBP by 15–20-fold were prepared and cultured as described previously (27Lagace T.A. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Both control and overexpressing cells were seeded at 250,000 cells/60-mm dish in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 34 μg of proline/ml. Twenty-four hours prior to the start of experiments, cells received fresh DMEM containing either 5% FCS or 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS). Stock solutions of reagents were prepared in the following manner. Cyclodextrin (250 mm) was dissolved in distilled water, U18666A (2 mg/ml) was dissolved in ethanol, okadaic acid (1 mm) was prepared in Me2SO, and SMase and PLC were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to 10 milliunits/μl and 1 unit/μl, respectively. LPDS was prepared by ultracentrifugation at a density of 1.21 g/ml and dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline (30Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Human LDL (1.018–1.063 g/ml) was isolated by ultracentrifugation (30Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Rabbit OSBP overexpressed in CHO-K1 cells was detected by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal antibody 11H9 (25Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 27Lagace T.A. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Since 11H9 is specific for the rabbit OSBP, a polyclonal antibody was prepared that recognized the protein from CHO-K1 cells. Antibody 104 was raised in rabbits against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein expressing amino acids 201–309 of rabbit OSBP. The antibody was subsequently affinity-purified using the glutathione S-transferase-OSBP fusion protein coupled to Sepharose. At the completion of experiments, CHO cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS and collected by centrifugation (2000 × gfor 5 min). Cell pellets were solubilized in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg of aprotinin/ml, 2.5 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 0.3% (w/v) Triton X-100 (buffer B) on ice for 15 min followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant, which contained all immunoreactive OSBP, was collected and analyzed by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation. Triton X-100 extracts of CHO cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 6% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, and OSBP was detected as described previously (27Lagace T.A. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,28Ridgway N.D. Badiani K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1390: 37-51Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Following metabolic labeling of cells with [32P]phosphate (refer to figure legends for specific details), OSBP was immunoprecipitated from Triton X-100 cell extracts by incubation with a 1:100 dilution of antibody 104 (whole serum) at 4 °C for 2 h in 200 μl of buffer B. A 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose was added and incubated at 20 °C for an additional 30 min. Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation; washed 8–10 times with 500 μl of PBS, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100; and separated by SDS-6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunofluorescence detection of endogenous OSBP in CHO-K1 cells was with affinity-purified antibody 104 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Cell manipulations, antibody treatments, and microscopy were essentially as described for detection of overexpressed OSBP (25Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 27Lagace T.A. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cholesterol esterification in cultured cells was measured by the incorporation of [3H]oleate into cholesteryl ester (30Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in medium containing 100 μm [3H]oleate complexed to BSA at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by extraction of cellular lipids with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v), and radiolabeled cholesteryl ester and triglyceride were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. To assess the extent of hydrolysis of plasma membrane SM and PtdCho by exogenous SMase and PLC, cells were incubated in DMEM with 5% FCS and 2 μCi of [methyl-3H]choline/ml for 24 h. Exogenous SMase or PLC was added directly to labeled cells, and at the indicated times medium was removed and cells were rinsed once with cold PBS and scraped in 2 ml of methanol/water (5:4, v/v). Lipids were extracted with 6 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 4 ml of 0.58% (w/v) NaCl and dried under nitrogen (11Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1345-1358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [methyl- 3H]Choline-labeled SM and PtdCho were separated by thin layer chromatography in chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v/v) and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. [3H]Serine incorporation into SM and ceramide was quantitated by harvesting cells in methanol/water (5:4, v/v) and extracting lipids with chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) as described previously (11Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1345-1358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SM and ceramide were resolved by thin layer chromatography in a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v/v), identified by fluorography of the thin layer plate, and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. A well characterized response to the depletion of SM in the plasma membrane is the internalization of cholesterol to the ER, where it is esterified by ACAT (6Scheek S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11179-11183Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), down-regulates 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity (31Gupta A.K. Rudney H. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibits proteolysis of the precursor forms of sterol-regulatory element-binding proteins (7Lange Y.M. Swaisgood M.H. Ramos B.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3786-3793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the sequence of events for delivery of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the ER events following SM depletion is unknown. The localization of OSBP to a Golgi/vesicular compartment and its putative role in sterol and sphingomyelin regulation (11Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1345-1358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lagace T.A. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) prompted an investigation of its role in SMase-mediated cholesterol mobilization. Initially, CHO-K1 cells overexpressing rabbit OSBP were treated with increasing amounts of bacterial SMase for 30 min, and SM hydrolysis, cholesterol esterification, and OSBP expression were examined (Fig. 1). As expected, cholesterol esterification was stimulated 3-fold in parallel with the hydrolysis of 50–70% of cellular SM by SMase concentrations > 5 milliunits/ml (Fig. 1 A). In untreated cells, OSBP migrated as a doublet of 97 and 101 kDa (Fig. 1 B); the higher molecular weight isoform had decreased mobility in SDS-PAGE as the result of extensive phosphorylation of serine residues (29Ridgway N.D. Merriam D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). With increasing SMase, total OSBP expression did not change, but there was a pronounced shift to the lower molecular weight, dephosphorylated form (Fig. 1 B). When the phosphorylation status of OSBP was determined by [32P]phosphate incorporation and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1 C), it was clear that SMase promoted rapid dephosphorylation of OSBP, which coincided with SM hydrolysis and stimulation of cholesterol esterification. Similar experiments were performed to determine the temporal relationship between SMase-mediated dephosphorylation of OSBP, SM hydrolysis, and cholesterol esterification (Fig. 2). SM hydrolysis was complete by 20 min, as was OSBP dephosphorylation, measured by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 B) and [32P]phosphate incorporation (Fig. 2 C). Cholesterol esterification was still increasing by 60 min following SMase addition. In the experiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2, SMase treatment inhibited [32P]phosphate incorporation into total cellular protein by <15% but blocked [32P]phosphate incorporation into OSBP by 70–90%. It could be argued that effects of SMase shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are the result of nonspecific changes in plasma membrane structure due to excessive loss of phospholipid. To rule out this possibility, we tested whether plasma membrane PtdCho hydrolysis by exogenous PLC in overexpressing CHO-K1 cells affected OSBP phosphorylation and cholesterol esterification. At the highest concentration of PLC tested, 60% of cellular PtdCho was hydrolyzed compared with only 15% of cellular SM (Fig. 3 A). However, PtdCho hydrolysis did not increase cholesterol esterification, nor did it stimulate OSBP dephosphorylation (as measured by immunoprecipitation of [32P]phosphate-labeled OSBP; Fig. 3 B). When SMase was removed from cells, restoration of SM to normal levels occurred within 2–6 h (32Slotte J.P. Harmala A.-S. Jansson C. Porn M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and cholesterol distribution was reestablished by 24–48 h (33Porn M.I. Slotte J.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In wild type CHO-K1 cells, we examined whether SMase promoted dephosphorylation of endogenous hamster OSBP and whether rephosphorylation occurred concomitantly with resynthesis of SM and down-regulation of ACAT activity (Fig. 4). After a 30-min SMase treatment (25 milliunits/ml) and removal of enzyme, [3H]serine-labeled ceramide was gradually converted to SM over a 6-h period (Fig. 4 A). Resynthesis of SM was paralleled by a decline in cholesterol esterification that reached a minimum by 4 h (Fig. 4 B). Similar to the overexpressed rabbit protein, endogenous hamster OSBP was converted from the predominant high molecular weight phosphorylated form to the lower molecular weight dephosphorylated form by exogenous SMase (Fig. 4 C). The proportion of phosphorylated OSBP slowly increased following removal of SMase and by 6 h was similar to the pretreatment distribution. OSBP is phosphorylated on at least five distinct sites on serine residues, and approximately 70% of the phosphates at these sites turnover within 20–30 min (28Ridgway N.D. Badiani K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1390: 37-51Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Given this rapid phosphorylation cycle for OSBP, SMase hydrolysis could either be inhibiting an OSBP kinase or stimulating dephosphorylation via an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase (28Ridgway N.D. Badiani K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1390: 37-51Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), thus resulting in net dephosphorylation. Given the previous reports of protein phosphatase 2A activation by ceramide in vitro (34Dobrowsky R.T. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15523-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Dobrowsky R.T. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5048-5051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar), we chose to test whether the okadaic acid-sensitive OSBP phosphatase was stimulated by SMase treatment (Fig. 5). In these experiments, OSBP from overexpressing cells was measured by immunoblotting after SMase treatment and either pre- or post-treatment with okadaic acid. As shown in previous experiments, as little as 10 milliunits/ml SMase promoted dephosphorylation of OSBP, as determined by a shift to the low molecular weight isoform. When cells were pretreated with okadaic acid (500 nm), dephosphorylation was blocked, and OSBP was predominately in the high molecular weight isoform. More importantly, after OSBP was first dephosphorylated with SMase for 60 min, okadaic acid (500 nm) treatment for 30 min was effective in reversing dephosphorylation. We tested if the okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase could be stimulated to dephosphorylate OSBP in response to short chain analogues of ceramide in CHO cells (Fig. 6). In these experiments, SMase (50 milliunits/ml for 60 min) inhibited [32P]phosphate incorporation into OSBP from overexpressing cells by 80%. However, this effect could not be recapitulated with C2- and C6-ceramides, even at concentrations up to 25 μm for 1 h. Phosphorylation of endogenous OSBP in CHO-K1 cells was also unaffected by treatment with these short chain ceramides under similar conditions (results not shown). We previously reported that OSBP overexpressed in CHO-K1 cells translocated to the Golgi apparatus in response to oxysterols but not LDL or other agents that alter cholesterol homeostasis (25Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, this was not confirmed for the endogenous protein due to the lack of a suitable antibody. We developed an affinity-purified antibody (antibody 104) that is capable of detecting endogenous OSBP in CHO-K1 cells and used this antibody to assess changes in localization of OSBP in response to SMase treatment by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 7). These experiments were performed on CHO-K1 cells cultured in DMEM with 5% LPDS and supplemented with human LDL. In untreated cells (NO ADDITION) the distribution of OSBP was diffuse and appeared localized to small vesicles, which in some instances were clustered around the nucleus. Following SMase treatment for 45 min, OSBP was associated with a structure that appeared at one pole of the nucleus. BFA disrupted this staining pattern, confirming it as the Golgi apparatus (Ref. 25Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar; results not shown). Interestingly, when cells were treated with PLC, which did not promote ACAT activation or hydrolyze SM, OSBP strongly localized to the Golgi apparatus. Similarly, the protein kinase C activator TPA (100 nm) caused OSBP localization to the Golgi complex.

To investigate the function of its propeptide, murine proPC1/3 and preproPC1/3 were isolated from the inclusion bodies of recombinant preproPC1/3 baculovirus-infected insect cells, rendered soluble with 6 m guanidine HCl and 20 mmdithiothreitol, and purified by gel filtration and metal-binding affinity chromatography. Two NH2-terminal fragments containing the complete propeptide 1–84 region were obtained after CNBr cleavage, purified, and chemically characterized. Progress curve kinetic analysis with enzymatically active murine 71-kDa PC1/3 or 50-kDa human furin demonstrated that both fragments were potent slow tight-binding inhibitors of either enzyme with K iin the low nanomolar range. Additional cleavages at Trp residues yielded fragment9–71, which no longer represents a potent inhibitor. Upon incubation at pH 5.5 in the presence of excess 71-kDa murine PC1/3, NH2-terminal fragment1–98 is cleaved at two sites, as revealed through Western blotting using NH2-terminal-directed PC1/3 antibodies. Finally, murine PC2 is inhibited by the proPC1/31–98 peptide, albeit at a much lesser extent with a micromolar K i and in a strictly competitive manner.

Many eukaryotic and prokaryotic secretory proteins are synthesized as precursors in the form of preproproteins and include, for example, peptidyl hydrolases, hormones, and growth factors. Whereas the 20–30-amino acid-long presequences usually act as the signal peptide for transport within the endoplasmic reticulum, numerous roles for the following prosequences have been proposed. For many proteins, prosequences have been shown to serve as an intramolecular chaperone that is essential for the correct folding of the protein (for a review, see Refs. 1Inouye M. Enzyme (Basel). 1991; 45: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 2Shinde U. Inouye M. Trends Biochem.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Finally, in the case of many peptidyl hydrolases such as α-lytic protease, carboxypeptidases, cathepsins, papain, and subtilases, this prosegment was shown to be a very potent inhibitor that is highly specific for its associated protease. This latter observation led to the proposal that the prosegment represents an additional strategy to regulate the enzymatic activity of proteases and keep them inactive until they reach their proper destination for action (6Baker D. Silen J.L. Agard D.A. Proteins. 1992; 12: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7Winther J.R. Sorensen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, a new family of subtilisin/kexin-like proteases has emerged (reviewed in Refs. 12Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar and 13Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). So far, all seven known members of this family have been shown to be synthesized as preproproteins. Whereas their catalytic regions are all chemically closely related, there appears to be little similarity between the respective proregion sequences (14Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), hinting that the role, if any, of the proregion might be very specific to its cognate convertase. Because they belong to the subtilisin family, some understanding can be obtained based on the role of the propeptide of subtilisin-BPN′, a prototype model of the eukaryotic convertases. Thus, this proregion was shown to interact intimately and specifically with enzymatically active subtilisin-BPN′ both as a necessary intramolecular chaperone and as a very potent inhibitor (10Hu Z. Haghjoo K. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3375-3384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Zhu X.L. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M. Nature. 1989; 339: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Both aspects were recently illustrated through an elegant crystallography study of the subtilisin-BPN′/proregion complex (16Gallagher T. Gilliland G. Wang L. Bryan P. Structure. 1995; 3: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, the question remains as to whether the conservation of either mode of action has been accomplished through the evolution to the eukaryotic convertases. Thus far, it has been shown that proregion deletion within Kex2, furin, and PC21 leads to a very inefficient activation into enzymatically active enzyme and/or to a failure in transport to the correct compartments (17Gluschankof P. Fuller R.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Creemers J.W.M. Vey M. Schafer W. Ayoubi T.A.Y. Roebroek A.J.M. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. Van de Ven W.J.M. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 321: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that the proregions of furin and PC1/3 are interchangeable, whereas the corresponding region of PC2 is not (20Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Finally, while this study was being completed, both the proregion of furin (21Anderson E.D. Van Slyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and the proregion of kexin (22Powner D. Davey J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 400-408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were shown through molecular biology to be potent autoinhibitors and need to be cleaved to release fully active furin and kexin. Considering that propeptides may represent an important factor in regulating enzymatic activity and ultimately convertase activation and expression, it is necessary to assess their role and mode of action toward their respective convertases. This report describes the purification of murine preproPC1/3 and proPC1/3 from inclusion bodies arising from the expression of recombinant preproPC1/3 in the baculovirus/insect cells expression system. In addition, it demonstrates their use in generating two NH2-terminal fragments that were used after purification and complete chemical characterization to probe their inhibitory activities toward enzymatically active PC1/3, PC2, and furin. In doing so, it shows for the first time that PC1/3 and furin enzymatic activity can be abolished in a very potent manner by proPC1/3-related peptides but not by mPC2, and that the PC1/3 proregion is cleaved at two sites after incubation with an excess of the enzymatically active 71-kDa form of PC1/3. Typically,Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells were infected for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection of 5 with the recombinant murine preproPC1/3 baculovirus. After infection, the medium was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 400 ml of fresh Sf900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml in a 1-liter flask. The cells were incubated under mild agitation at 120 rpm at 28 °C for 40 h. After this period, the medium containing the cells was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pelleted cells were frozen at −20 °C until necessary, whereas the resulting supernatant was decanted and centrifuged again. The soluble and secreted PC1/3 was purified to homogeneity from the infected insect cell supernatant by polyethylene glycol precipitation followed by immobilized lectin, hydroxylapatite, and gel permeation chromatography as described previously (23Boudreault, A., Gauthier, D., Rondeau, N., Savaria, D., Seidah, N. G., Chrétien, M., and Lazure, C. (1998) Protein Expr. Purif., in pressGoogle Scholar). The resulting purified 71-kDa enzyme is homogeneous and is more than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis and exhibits a K m of 8.1 ± 0.6 μm for the pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA substrate and a specific activity of 2.95 m/h/mg of amino-4-methylcoumarin-released (23Boudreault, A., Gauthier, D., Rondeau, N., Savaria, D., Seidah, N. G., Chrétien, M., and Lazure, C. (1998) Protein Expr. Purif., in pressGoogle Scholar). The recombinant soluble form of human furin corresponds to a highly purified baculovirus-expressed COOH terminus-truncated form of furin obtained after the transfer of the previously described vaccinia construct (24Paquet L. Bergeron F. Boudreault A. Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Mbikay M. Lazure C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19279-19285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the baculovirus vector. The homogeneous hfurin preparation was more than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis and had enzymological properties identical to the previously described vaccinia virus recombinant enzyme (25Jean F. Boudreault A. Basak A. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19225-19231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recombinant murine PC2, which was purified from the conditioned medium of Chinese hamster ovary PC2/7B2-expressing cells (26Lamango N.S. Xhu X.R. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Dr. Iris Lindberg (Louisiana State University, New Orleans, LA). The purified mPC2 contains the 71- and 75-kDa proenzyme forms, and to obtain the 66-kDa autoactivated form of this enzyme (26Lamango N.S. Xhu X.R. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the mPC2 was preincubated for 2 h at room temperature in the presence of 0.1% (v/v) Brij-35 and 5 mm CaCl2, pH 5.6, and kept on ice after this activation period. Typically, 10 g of frozen insect cells harvested at 40 h after infection were added to 4 ml of ice-cold buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl (Buffer A). The resulting suspension was homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer with three 60-s pulses before being centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The ensuing pellet was washed four to six times with 20 ml of Buffer A until the supernatant became clear. The remaining insoluble material was washed three times with Buffer A containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and washed three more times with 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. After these washing steps, the material was rendered soluble by adding 4 ml of 6 m guanidine HCl containing 20 mm DTT. To facilitate this process, the solution was slightly heated (up to 45 °C) for about 30 min before centrifuging it at 30,000 × g for 1 h, filtering it through a disposable 0.22-μm filter, and directly loading it onto a Sephacryl S200 (Pharmacia) gel permeation column that was previously equilibrated in 3 m guanidine HCl and 10 mm DTT. The monitoring of the eluate, which was automatically collected in 1.5-ml fractions, was accomplished through the analysis of aliquots by SDS-PAGE, proteins revealed through Coomassie Blue staining, and Western blots. The fractions containing immunoreactive PC1/3 were pooled, and the proteins were precipitated using ice-cold 90% EtOH. After two washes with ice-cold 90% EtOH, the pellet was dissolved in 6 mguanidine HCl and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was filtered through a disposable 0.22-μm filter. The soluble material was applied unto a metal-chelating Sepharose 6B column (9.5 × 1.5 cm; Pharmacia) that had been previously loaded at 80% capacity with copper ions and equilibrated with 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.7, containing 3m guanidine HCl. After application of the material, the column was extensively washed until the absorbance reading measured at 280 nm returned to its initial value. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear histidine gradient obtained by mixing 50 ml of starting buffer and 50 ml of starting buffer containing 50 mmhistidine. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and those containing immunoreactive mPC1/3 were pooled. The preproPC1/3 and proPC1/3 were recovered through precipitation using ice-cold 90% EtOH and kept at −20 °C until needed. The NH2-terminal proPC1/3-related fragments encompassing residues 1–8 and −26–98 were obtained by CNBr chemical cleavage of the purified zymogen forms described above or directly from the zymogen fraction after solubilization but before gel permeation column chromatography. In the latter case, the 6 m guanidine HCl/20 mm DTT soluble material was first precipitated with 10 volumes of ice-cold 95% EtOH for 30 min. The solution was centrifuged at 27,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the pellet was washed twice with ice-cold 95% EtOH. At this stage, this fraction and/or the above-described fraction was dissolved in 2–3 ml of 70% (v/v) formic acid, and the resulting solution was flushed for 10 min with a stream of nitrogen before the addition of solid CNBr (Sigma) at about 50 mg/g of pellet wet weight. After an overnight incubation in the dark at room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold with water and lyophilized. The dried material was dissolved in 6 ml of 6m guanidine HCl, centrifuged, filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and injected onto a semipreparative Vydac-C4RP-HPLC column (214TP510; 25.0 × 1.0 cm; The Separation Group, Hesperia, CA). The adsorbed material was first eluted isocratically for 15 min with a solution containing 5% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and then eluted using a linear gradient of 1%/min from 5 to 60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and dried under a vacuum on a speed vac evaporator. To identify the NH2-terminal fragments, each dried fraction was dissolved in 200 μl of water, and 10 μl were used for screening the inhibitory activity or analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Western blotting with the previously described PC1/3 NH2-terminal antibody (27Basak A. Boudreault A. Chen A. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Inhibitory and immunoreactive fractions were then pooled and purified under the same elution conditions on an analytical Vydac-C4column (214TP54; 25 × 0.46 cm) using a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min until homogeneity. Following the last step of purification, the fractions were dried under a vacuum and reconstituted in 100 μl of double-distilled water, and 10 μl were used for screening the inhibitory activity. The most inhibitory fractions were pooled together; analyzed by IEF, gel electrophoresis, amino acid analysis done in duplicate, Edman degradation, and mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser-desorption time of flight); and kept at −20 °C before use. For the production of the NH2-terminal fragment9–71, the zymogen fraction (5 g of wet weight) was dissolved in 2 ml of 6 m guanidine HCl to which 3 ml of glacial acetic acid together with 40 mg of l-tyrosine and 200 mg of iodosobenzoic acid (Pierce Chemical Co.) were added. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature in the dark for 24 h before centrifuging at 27,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and the peptides were separated by RP-HPLC as described above. After drying under a vacuum, each fraction was reconstituted in 100 μl of double-distilled water, and 10 μl were used to determine the PC1/3 inhibitory activity. The most active fractions were pooled, analyzed as described above, and kept at −20 °C before use. Automated Edman degradation of the intracellular PC1/3 as well as the chemical fragments thereof was performed as described previously (27Basak A. Boudreault A. Chen A. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), using an Applied Biosystems gas-phase sequenator (Model 470A updated to Model 475A specifications) directly coupled to an Applied Biosystems phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Model 120A) and using N-methylpiperidine as coupling buffer. Amino acid analyses were accomplished in duplicate after an 18–24-h hydrolysis in the presence of 5.7 n HCL in vacuo at 110 °C on a Beckman autoanalyzer (Model 6300) with the post-column ninhydrin detection system generously loaned from the Canadian National Research Council and coupled to a Varian DS 604 integrator/plotter. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption time of flight was done on a Tofspec MicroMass instrument using α-cyano 4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix as a pay service by Dr. Gilles Lajoie (Chemistry Department, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada). All gel electrophoreses were carried out on a Mini-PROTEAN II gel apparatus (Bio-Rad) according to the procedure described by Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The analysis of the proPC1/3-related fragments was done on 20% acrylamide gels, whereas the analysis of the zymogen forms was done on 10% gels. Analytical IEF was performed using an Xcell II Mini-cell apparatus (Novex, San Diego, CA) and precasted IEF gel cassettes (pH gradient from 3 to 10). Western blot analysis was performed after electrotransfer to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and the immune complex was detected using either 3,3′-diaminobenzidine staining or the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham) as described previously (29Boudreault A. Castellucci V.F. Chrétien M. Lazure C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2596-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In both cases, the primary antibody used was the previously described NH2-terminal PC1/3 antibody (27Basak A. Boudreault A. Chen A. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas the secondary antibody was a horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:1000; Life Technologies, Inc.). All initial rate enzymatic assays were performed at room temperature in a final volume of 100 μl in 96-well flat-bottomed white plates (Microfluor; Dynatec). For each assay, an equivalent amount of enzymatic activity (12.3 μm/h amino-4-methylcoumarin released) as determined using 100 μm fluorogenic MCA substrate was used. For furin, the final assay conditions were 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, in the presence of 1.0 mmCaCl2, whereas for PC1/3 and PC2, they were 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, with 10 mmCaCl2 and 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.6, with 5 mm CaCl2, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, all assays were done using a final concentration of 100 μm pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA substrate (Peptides International). The amount of the various propeptide fractions used was based on the peptide content determined through amino acid analysis and is indicated in molar concentration in the figures depicting the progress curves. The fluorescence of the released amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured on-line with a Perkin-Elmer model LS50B spectrofluorometer using an excitation and an emission wavelength of 370 (slit width, 5 nm) and 460 nm (slit width, 3 nm), respectively. To demonstrate the cleavage of the proPC1/31–98 peptide by purified enzymatically active 71-kDa PC1/3, conditions were chosen such that the amount of active enzyme was in excess of the amount of inhibitor, resulting throughout the incubation in the presence of measurable enzymatic activity as determined by using the fluorogenic substrate. Thus, purified proPC1/31–98 (12 pmol; 50 nm) was incubated with 37.5 μl of enzyme solution (corresponding to 27.2 μm/h amino-4-methylcoumarin released) in a total volume of 250 μl containing 50 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6, and 10 mm CaCl2. The resulting solution was incubated at room temperature for various amounts of time; for each time point, 25-μl aliquots were taken up, immediately mixed with an equal amount of Laemmli's sample buffer, and kept at −20 °C before electrophoresis. Each aliquot was electrophoresed on a 20% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were subsequently transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane. After Western blotting using the NH2-terminal directed antibodies, the immune complex was detected through enhanced chemiluminescence as described above by exposure to an x-ray film for periods of time ranging from 1 to 12 min. The evaluation of the slow-binding kinetic parameters was done as described previously (30Fox T. de Miguel E. Mort J.S. Storer A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The determination of the individual parameters (V i,V s, and Kobs) for each progress curve was accomplished by nonlinear regression analysis with BMPS statistical software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) that was run on an IBM-compatible computer equipped with an Intel 200-MHz Pentium-Pro processor. TheK m and V max parameters were computed using the Enzfitter program (Elsevier-Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). To obtain large amounts of recombinant enzymatically active PC1/3, we have used the baculovirus/insect cell expression system and found that enzymatically active PC1/3 was secreted into the medium from which it can be purified, yielding 1–2 mg/liter of medium of highly pure 85- or 71-kDa enzyme (23Boudreault, A., Gauthier, D., Rondeau, N., Savaria, D., Seidah, N. G., Chrétien, M., and Lazure, C. (1998) Protein Expr. Purif., in pressGoogle Scholar). Under these expression conditions, enzymatically inactive PC1/3-related proteins also accumulate intracellularly in inclusion bodies as disulfide-linked aggregates at a level of about 10 μg/1 × 106 cells or approximately 50 mg/liter of cell culture (Fig. 1). Considering this sizable amount, intracellular proPC1/3 represents a good source from which various PC1/3-related peptides can be retrieved. Thus, we first purified proPC1/3-related material by taking advantage of its presence within the cells as insoluble proteins that can only be rendered soluble by using 6 m guanidine HCl and 20 mmDTT. This property also facilitates the removal of numerous contaminating proteins as well as cellular debris through simple extensive washings of the insoluble material before dissolving it in the guanidine HCl/DTT mixture. The ensuing soluble material was further purified by gel filtration under reducing and denaturating conditions. The proteins eluting from the gel permeation column no longer require reducing conditions to remain soluble and can be purified further by using a copper-chelating column. After this last step, a highly enriched purified fraction containing the PC1/3 zymogen forms is obtained. Based upon the deduced amino acid sequence of murine proPC1/3 (31Seidah N.G. Marcinkiewicz M. Benjannet S. Gaspar L. Beaubien G. Mattei M.G. Lazure C. Mbikay M. Chrétien M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), numerous sensitive amino acids can be identified as potential targets for enzymatic and/or chemical cleavage to generate a variety of peptides incorporating elements present in the many predicted convertase functional domains such as the proregion, the catalytic region, and the P-domain as well as the COOH-terminal domain. Among the potential peptides produced, we noticed that cleavage at methionyl residues would generate a fragment encompassing residues 1–98, thus containing the complete previously proposed proregion corresponding to position 1–84. Conveniently, the former also contains the epitope recognized by our NH2-terminal PC1/3-directed antibody (27Basak A. Boudreault A. Chen A. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that can serve to follow its purification. In addition, cleaving at tryptophanyl residues could yield a smaller fragment derived from the proregion that corresponds to positions 9–71, as shown in Fig. 2. Both approaches were used and, as shown in Fig. 3,A and B, yielded complex RP-HPLC chromatograms after cleavage by cyanogen bromide and iodosobenzoic acid. Based upon the hypothesis that the prosegment was an inhibitor of PC1/3 enzymatic activity, each separated fraction was individually assayed against the enzymatically active 71-kDa PC1/3 form. In all cases, a unique and single region of the chromatograms was found to contain inhibitory activity. Further analysis of the peptides contained therein, whether by NH2-terminal sequencing, SDS-PAGE, and/or Western analysis, confirmed the presence of peptides exclusively related to the proregion (Fig. 4). From 10 g of cells (wet weight) and further purification by RP-HPLC, the procedure leads to about 0.5–1 mg of the purified NH2-terminal peptide1–98 and the NH2-terminal elongated peptide−26–98 from the CNBr digest, whereas the purified NH2-terminal peptide9–70 can be obtained in a similar yield from the iodosobenzoic digest.

When the enzyme was incubated with the fluorogenic pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA substrate in the presence of the proPC1/3 segment1–98(Fig. 6), representing a COOH-terminal extended form of the complete proPC11–84, it was observed that the inhibition followed a typical slow-binding kinetic based upon the progress curves (30Fox T. de Miguel E.

https://openalex.org/W1985580256,"Many G protein-coupled receptors are phosphorylated and regulated by a distinct family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) that specifically target the activated form of the receptor. Recent studies have revealed that the GRKs are also subject to post-translational regulation. For example, GRK5 activity is strongly inhibited by protein kinase C phosphorylation and by Ca2+-calmodulin binding. Ca2+-calmodulin binding also promotes GRK5 autophosphorylation, which further contributes to kinase inhibition. In this study we identify two important structural domains in GRK5, a phospholipid binding domain (residues 552–562) and an autoinhibitory domain (residues 563–590), that significantly contribute to GRK5 localization and function. We demonstrate that the C-terminal region of GRK5 (residues 563–590) contains residues autophosphorylated in the presence of calmodulin as well as the residues phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Deletion of this domain increases the apparent affinity of GRK5 for receptor substrates 3–4-fold but has no effect on nonreceptor substrates. These findings define residues 563–590 of GRK5 as an autoinhibitory domain with efficacy that is regulated by phosphorylation. Another C-terminal domain in GRK5 that appears to be functionally important is found between residues 552 and 562. Deletion of this region significantly inhibits kinase phosphorylation of membrane-bound receptor substrates but has no effect on soluble substrates. Additional studies reveal that this domain is critical for GRK5 interaction with phospholipids and for the intracellular localization of the kinase. Interestingly, similar regions in GRK4 and GRK6 appear to be palmitoylated (and involved in membrane interaction), suggesting evolutionary conservation of the function of this domain.

G protein-coupled receptor green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphate-buffered saline phosphatidylcholine polymerase chain reaction phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate protein kinase C rod outer segments. A large variety of extracellular stimuli transmit their signals via interaction with cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 (1Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A fundamental process of regulating the responsiveness of a system, termed desensitization, uses numerous mechanisms initiated by phosphorylation of the receptor. Receptor phosphorylation results in uncoupling of receptor and G protein and may also control processes such as GPCR internalization and down-regulation. The phosphorylation of GPCRs can be mediated either by second messenger-dependent kinases, such as protein kinase A and protein kinase C (PKC), or by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). The six mammalian GRKs identified to date can be divided into three subfamilies based on their sequence homology (2Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 3Premont R.T. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar): GRK1 (rhodopsin kinase) forms one group; GRK2 (β-adrenergic receptor kinase) and GRK3 constitute a second; and GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6 constitute the third subfamily. One feature of GRKs that plays a critical role in regulating the interaction of the soluble kinases with integral membrane GPCRs is their ability to associate with the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the various GRKs use distinct mechanisms for membrane interaction, including modification of the C-terminal domain by lipids (GRK1, GRK4 and GRK6) and association with Gβγ subunits and acidic phospholipids (GRK2 and GRK3) (4Stoffel III, R.H. Pitcher J.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The specific determinants of membrane interaction for GRK5 are poorly understood. Although GRK5 does not appear to be modified by lipids, it displays a high level of membrane association, possibly via direct binding of a C-terminal polybasic domain with phospholipids (5Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has been also suggested that GRK5 contains an N-terminal phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding site that can promote membrane association (6Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24907-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Additional mechanisms of GRK regulation have been identified. Of particular interest is the calcium-dependent regulation of GRK activity. Recent studies have demonstrated that GRK2 can be phosphorylated by PKC, resulting in an ∼2–3-fold activation of the kinase, possibly via an increased association of GRK2 with membranes (7Chuang T.T. LeVine III, H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Conversely, GRK5 is significantly inhibited after phosphorylation by PKC because of a decreased activity and decreased affinity for receptor (9Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the visual system, GRK1 has been shown to be inhibited by the Ca2+-binding protein recoverin (10Chen C.-K. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18060-18066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Although regulation by recoverin may be specific for GRK1, a universal mediator of calcium signaling, calmodulin, appears to inhibit all other GRK subtypes, with GRK5 being the most sensitive (11Chuang T.T. Paolucci L. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28691-28696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Haga K. Tsuga H. Haga T Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18273-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated recently that calmodulin stimulates autophosphorylation of GRK5 and that this phosphorylation inhibits GRK5 activity, in a manner similar to the PKC-mediated phosphorylation (13Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18273-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Here we show that the residues autophosphorylated in the presence of calmodulin (as well as the residues phosphorylated by PKC) lie within a C-terminal 28-amino acid region of GRK5 (residues 563–590). This region of GRK5 appears to function as an autoinhibitory domain, because its deletion increases GRK5 affinity for both phospholipids and receptor. We also demonstrate that the sequence immediately upstream (amino acids 552–562) of this region is critical for GRK5 association with phospholipids and for the intracellular localization of the kinase. Thus, our studies reveal two novel structural domains that play an important role in GRK5 function and regulation. Restriction endonucleases, the Expand high fidelity polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system, and other molecular biology reagents were purchased from New England Biolabs or Boehringer Mannheim. SP-Sepharose was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Calmodulin (bovine brain, >98% pure), phosphatidylcholine (PC) (soybean type II-S, contains ∼17% PC), andl-α-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (bovine brain, >98% pure) were from Sigma. Phosphatidylserine (bovine brain, 99% pure) was from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against GRK5 (residues 571–590) and GRK6 (residues 525–544) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and Slowfade mounting medium were from Molecular Probes, Inc. Peptides corresponding to GRK5 residues 547–565 (KKGLLQRLFKRQHQNNSKS) and 556–571 (KRQHQNNSKSSPSSKT) were synthesized by the solid-state Merrifield method on an Applied Biosystems synthesizer and purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. All other materials were from sources previously described (9Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for GRKs were constructed by cloning the coding sequence of human GRK5 (14Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) in the vector pcDNA3. Mutant GRK5 sequences were generated using PCR, and the PCR-derived portions of the constructs were then sequenced in their entirety using the dideoxy chain termination method. COS-1 cells were grown to ∼80–90% confluence in 60-mm dishes and transfected with 4 μg of DNA/dish using LipofectAMINE per the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Forty-eight hours after transfection cells were harvested and GRKs were partially purified by chromatography on SP-Sepharose as described (13Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18273-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Typically, partially purified GRK samples contained 7–20 ng of GRK5/μl. Three-μl aliquots of the partially purified GRK5 were then assayed by incubating with or without 1 μm calmodulin in 25 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol) for 15 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by placing on ice and adding 120 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20) and 5 μl of rabbit polyclonal antiserum generated against GST-GRK5(489–590) (9Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min, after which 20 μl of a 50% protein A-agarose suspension were added, and the samples were incubated an additional 30 min. The resin was washed twice with 1 ml of buffer A, and labeled proteins were eluted with two 35-μl aliquots of SDS sample buffer heated to 70 °C. Supernatants were combined, and 25-μl aliquots of each sample were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The gel was fixed, dried, and autoradiographed, and the 32P-labeled proteins were excised and counted. The activity of GRK5 expressed in COS cells and partially purified was assayed by incubating 1-μl aliquots with either various concentrations of rod outer segment (ROS) membranes (1–12 μm rhodopsin) or phosvitin (10 μg) in 20 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol). The indicated concentrations of calmodulin were included in some reactions. Reactions were incubated for 6 min at 30 °C in room light, stopped with SDS sample buffer, and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to autoradiography film. 32P-Labeled proteins were excised and counted to determine the pmol of phosphate transferred. To adjust for the amount of GRK5 used in a given assay, aliquots of the partially purified GRK5 were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized by immunoblotting with polyclonal GRK5(489–590) antiserum using ECL to determine the level of GRK5 expression. Optical density of developed bands was determined by densitometry. Expression levels of wild-type and mutant GRK5 differed by <2-fold. In studies examining the effect of peptides on phosphorylation of rhodopsin and phosvitin, 20 nm GRK5 expressed and purified from Sf9 cells was incubated in the presence or absence of 0.3 mm peptide with the indicated substrate and processed as described above. Urea-treated ROS membranes containing rhodopsin were prepared from bovine retinas as described previously (16Shichi H. Somers R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7040-7046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles were prepared by sonicating 20 mg of soybean phosphatidylcholine with or without 1 mg of either phosphatidylserine or PIP2 in 1.2 ml of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA on ice four times for 20 s. The ability of GRK5 to associate with phospholipids and rhodopsin was analyzed by incubating 6-μl aliquots of GRK5 (40–120 ng, ∼10–30 nm) (expressed in COS-1 cells and SP-Sepharose-purified) in the presence or absence of indicated concentration of phospholipid vesicles or ROS membranes (400 pmol of rhodopsin) in 60 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl on ice for 10 min. The indicated concentrations of peptides were included in some reactions. The incubations were then pelleted at 200,000 ×g for 15 min, and the pellets were resuspended in 60 μl of reaction buffer. Equal aliquots of the supernatant and pellet fractions were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and visualized by immunoblotting with polyclonal GRK5(489–590) antiserum using ECL. Optical density of developed bands was determined by densitometry, and the amount of GRK5 pelleted was expressed as a percentage of the total. DNA sequences encoding various regions of GRK5 were generated using the PCR and then used to replace aBamHI-SalI fragment in the vector pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PCR-derived portions of the constructs were sequenced in their entirety using the dideoxy chain termination method. The GST-GRK5 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified over glutathione-agarose using standard procedures. The purity of the proteins was >95% as determined by Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentrations were determined by dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To assess the ability of GST-GRK5 fusion proteins to bind phospholipids, 2 μg of the indicated fusion protein were incubated in the presence or absence of 1.7 mg/ml soybean phosphatidylcholine vesicles in 60 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl on ice for 10 min. Reactions were then pelleted and processed by gel electrophoresis as described above. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. COS-1 cells, grown to 75–95% confluence, were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3, pcDNA3-GRK5, pcDNA3-GRK51–551, pcDNA3-GFP, or pcDNA3-GFP-β2-adrenergic receptor/60-mm dish using FuGENE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were trypsinized and plated onto 12-mm glass coverslips in a 24-well plate at 8 h after addition of the DNA/Fugene transfection mix. The cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 24 h after transfection and then fixed with PBS containing 4% formaldehyde at 22 °C for 30 min. Fixed cells were subsequently rinsed three times with PBS and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 22 °C. These cells were blocked for 30 min at 37 °C with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (PBS/Triton) and 5% nonfat dried milk and subsequently incubated with polyclonal GRK5(489–590) antiserum diluted 1:200 in the same buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS/Triton and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocynate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1:100 in PBS/Triton and 5% nonfat dried milk for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed five times with PBS/Triton and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by fixing with PBS containing 4% formaldehyde for 5 min. Cells were rinsed with PBS and mounted on a slide with Slowfade mounting medium. Preparation of cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) or GFP-β2-adrenergic receptor was identical to that described above with the exception that primary and secondary antibodies were not included in the PBS/Triton/nonfat dried milk solutions. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope using a Plan Fluor × 40 objective. Human GRK5 was overexpressed and purified from Sf9 cells as described (5Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified GRK5 was 32P-labeled via autophosphorylation. Autophosphorylation reactions contained 40 pmol (2.7 μg) of GRK5 in 40 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol), and either 0.85 mg/ml soybean phosphatidylcholine or 2 μm calmodulin. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. After phosphorylation GRK5 was purified by batch-wise chromatography on SP-Sepharose as described (9Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Typically, 70–80% of the GRK was recovered by this procedure, whereas calmodulin did not bind to SP-Sepharose. Ten-μl aliquots of 32P-labeled GRK5 (∼0.18 μg of protein) were mixed with 20 μl of buffer A with or without 4 ng of trypsin. The reactions were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C before they were placed on ice, and trypsin inhibitors were added (0.1 mm leupeptin, 0.02 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). The reactions were then added to 70 μl of Tris-buffered saline with 1.5 μg of polyclonal antibodies against either GRK5 residues 571–590 or GRK6 residues 525–544. Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min, 20 μl of a 50% protein A-agarose suspension were added, and the samples were incubated an additional 30 min. The resin was washed twice with 0.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline. The amount of 32P bound was determined by counting the final washed pellets. Previous studies have implicated the C-terminal region of GRKs in membrane association (4Stoffel III, R.H. Pitcher J.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although lipid modifications and phospholipid binding domains have been identified in most of the GRKs, specific regions of GRK5 involved in membrane interaction have not been defined. A polybasic domain within the C terminus of GRK5 has been proposed to play a role in phospholipid association (5Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the C-terminal region of GRK5 has also been identified as the major site of phosphorylation by protein kinase C, a modification that results in significant inhibition of GRK5 activity (9Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To further define the role of the C-terminal region of GRK5 in phospholipid binding and substrate interaction, we generated a series of C-terminal truncation mutants of GRK5. GRK5 mutants with 5, 12, 28, 39, or 50 residues deleted from the C terminus were readily expressed in COS-1 cells and had detectable activity (Fig. 1), whereas deletion of ≥76 residues resulted in poorly expressed proteins that were inactive (data not shown). Interestingly, the various deletions had a differential effect on the ability of GRK5 to phosphorylate different substrates. Phosphorylation of the soluble protein phosvitin was unaffected by deletion of up to 50 residues of GRK5 (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, phosphorylation of light-activated rhodopsin was very dependent on the length of the C-terminal sequence deleted. Rhodopsin phosphorylation was increased 30–70% when 5–28 residues were deleted from the C terminus (GRK51–585, GRK51–578, and GRK51–562), whereas the deletion of 11 or 22 additional residues (GRK51–551 and GRK51–540) resulted in significant inhibition of rhodopsin phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B). A more detailed kinetic analysis of rhodopsin phosphorylation revealed that deletion of only 5 C-terminal residues increased the affinity of GRK5 for rhodopsin ∼3-fold (K m decreased from 3.2 μm for wild-type GRK5 to 1.0 μm for GRK51–585) and had no effect on theV max, whereas deletion of 38 residues (GRK51–562) resulted in no additional change in K m and an ∼25% increase in V max (Fig. 1 C). The deletion of 11 additional residues (GRK51–551) caused an ∼6-fold loss in affinity for rhodopsin (K m of 5.8 μm) and ∼2.5-fold lower V maxcompared with GRK51–562. The increased affinity of the GRK5 C-terminal truncation mutants for rhodopsin was also evident when we tested their ability to directly bind to ROS membranes. Under conditions in which only ∼25% of wild-type GRK5 co-sedimented with ROS, ∼75% of GRK51–585 (Fig. 1 D) and GRK51–562(data not shown) was pelleted. In contrast, deletion of 11 additional residues (GRK51–551) caused a significant decrease in kinase binding to ROS (down to ∼25% bound; Fig. 1 D). Because deletion of the C-terminal domain of GRK5 had a significant effect on phosphorylation of the membrane-bound substrate rhodopsin but had no effect on phosphorylation of the soluble substrate phosvitin, we assessed whether the various deletions affected GRK5 interaction with phospholipids. We and others have shown that GRK5 can directly associate and co-sediment with phospholipid vesicles (5Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,17Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our initial experiments we used liposomes generated from crude soybean PC, a preparation that contains ∼17% PC as well as numerous other phospholipids. We found that the amount of GRK5 that was sedimented was dependent on the quantity of phospholipid in the incubation; we were thus able to determine EC50 values for GRK5 binding by varying the phospholipid concentration. The binding of wild-type GRK5 was half-maximal (EC50) at ∼0.06 mg/ml phospholipids, whereas GRK51–585 (data not shown) and GRK51–562 (EC50, ∼0.017 mg/ml) had an ∼3.5-fold higher affinity (Fig. 2,A and B). The removal of residues 552–562 resulted in an ∼100-fold loss of phospholipid binding affinity, with an EC50 of ∼1.7 mg/ml phospholipid (Fig. 2 B), whereas deletion of residues 540–551 had no additional effect (data not shown). Because previous studies have suggested an important role of an N-terminal binding domain in GRK5 interaction with PIP2(6Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24907-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we next investigated the effects of PIP2 on GRK5 binding to crude PC vesicles. The addition of 5% PIP2 to the crude PC enhanced the affinity of wild-type GRK5 and GRK51–562 3–4-fold (EC50 values, ∼0.02 and ∼0.004 mg/ml, respectively; Fig. 2 C). Strikingly, addition of PIP2 resulted in an ∼13-fold increase in the affinity of GRK51–551 (EC50, ∼0.13 mg/ml). This finding confirms a PIP2 binding site in GRK5 located upstream of the C-terminal phospholipid binding domain identified in this study. The interaction of the C-terminal residues of the kinase with phospholipids was further demonstrated using peptides. A peptide corresponding to GRK5 residues 547–565 effectively competed for interaction with phospholipids and inhibited GRK5 binding to liposomes with an IC50 of ∼15 μm (Fig. 3, A and B). A peptide containing only a portion of the putative phospholipid binding site (residues 556–571) had no effect on GRK5 binding to phospholipids at concentrations up to 0.4 mm (Fig. 3 A). Consistent with the ability of peptide 547–565 to inhibit GRK5 membrane association, this peptide effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of rhodopsin, whereas peptide 556–571 had no effect on the kinase activity (Fig. 3 C). A more detailed kinetic analysis of rhodopsin phosphorylation revealed that the presence of 0.3 mm peptide 547–565 decreased the affinity of GRK5 for rhodopsin ∼3.1-fold and reduced the V max∼1.6-fold (data not shown). Neither of these peptides had a significant effect on phosvitin phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). The ability of residues 552–562 of GRK5 to promote interaction with phospholipids was also shown using a series of GST-GRK5 fusion proteins. A fusion protein containing residues 489–551 of GRK5 (GST-GRK5489–551) displayed no ability to bind phospholipid vesicles (<5% bound), whereas the addition of 11 residues (GST-GRK5489–562) resulted in substantial phospholipid binding (>70% protein bound; Fig. 3 D). The binding of GRK5 to phospholipid appears to be predominantly attributable to ionic interactions, because sodium chloride concentrations >300 mm significantly inhibit phospholipid binding of both GRK5 and GST-GRK5489–562 (data not shown). To assess the potential role of the C-terminal phospholipid binding domain in the intracellular localization of GRK5, GRK5 was transiently expressed in COS-1 cells and visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. The distribution of wild-type GRK5 is consistent with a significant fraction of the kinase being associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 4,A and B). Indeed, the distribution of GRK5 appears similar to that of an epitope-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 4 G, GFP-β2 AR), a transmembrane protein that is primarily localized at the plasma membrane. GRK51–562had a distribution virtually identical to that of wild-type GRK5 (Fig. 4, C and D), confirming the ability of this protein to associate with the phospholipid bilayer. In contrast, the expression pattern of GRK51–551 displayed a distribution consistent with a cytosolic localization (Fig. 4, E and F). Indeed, the distribution of GRK51–551 was similar to that of GFP (Fig. 4 H), a soluble protein that when overexpressed localizes to the cytosol and nucleus. These results demonstrate that the C-terminal phospholipid binding domain of GRK5 (residues 552–562) plays a critical role in the intracellular localization of this kinase. Previous studies have demonstrated that PKC phosphorylation of GRK5, primarily within residues 565–572, results in significant inhibition of GRK5 activity (9Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Because calmodulin-stimulated autophosphorylation also significantly inhibits GRK5 activity (13Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18273-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we examined the aforementioned deletion mutants to determine whether the major site autophosphorylated in the presence of calmodulin also resided within the C-terminal domain of GRK5. Although the deletion of 5 C-terminal residues (GRK51–585) had no effect on calmodulin-stimulated autophosphorylation, the deletion of 7 additional residues (GRK51–578) nearly abolished autophosphorylation (Fig. 5 A). This finding suggests that residues autophosphorylated in the presence of calmodulin lie within amino acids 579–585 of GRK5. This region includes Ser579, Ser583, and Ser584 and is distinct from the primary sites phosphorylated by PKC. To confirm that the major calmodulin-stimulated autophosphorylation site is located at the extreme C terminus of GRK5, we used an antibody generated against residues 571–590 that is capable of immunoprecipitating the kinase. 32P-Labeled GRK5 was initially generated via autophosphorylation in the presence of either phospholipids or calmodulin. Each sample was then divided in half, incubated with or without trypsin for 20 min at 30 °C, quenched with trypsin inhibitors, and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Trypsin treatment should result in cleavage after lysine 570 and thus release the C-terminal 20-amino acid peptide recog"

Furthermore, the promoter region in HDC-expressing cell lines was found to be selectively unmethylated. The correlation between HDC expression and hypomethylation was also found in primary human mast cells.

Mills J.C. Ganellin C.R. Parson M.E. Pharmacology in Histamine Receptors. Wright PSG Publishing Co., Inc., Littleton, MA1982: 436-481Google Scholar). The expression of HDC mRNA is detected only in a limited number of tissues and cells, showing a good correlation with the distribution of histamine-mediated functions (2Watanabe T. Taguchi Y. Maeyama K. Wada H. Uvnäs B. Histamine and Histamine Antagonists. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 145-163Google Scholar). We earlier cloned the human HDC gene, analyzing its structure and sequencing entirety, including the 5′-flanking region (3Yatsunami K. Ohtsu H. Tsuchikawa M. Higuchi T. Ishibashi K. Shida A. Shima Y. Nakagawa S. Yamauchi K. Yamamoto M. Hayashi N. Watanabe T. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1554-1559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In hematopoietic lineages, the human HDC gene is expressed in mast cells and basophils, and we have been interested in the mechanism underlying this cell specificity. Mast cells and basophils are responsible for many pathologic conditions such as systemic anaphylaxis, cutaneous allergic reactions, bronchial asthma, and parasitic infections (4Schwartz L. Huff T. Middleton E.M. Reed M.D. Allergy. Mosby-Year Book, St. Louis, MO1993: 135-168Google Scholar). It is known that mast cells leave the bone marrow as progenitors and complete their differentiation in peripheral tissues, while basophils complete their differentiation in the bone marrow (4Schwartz L. Huff T. Middleton E.M. Reed M.D. Allergy. Mosby-Year Book, St. Louis, MO1993: 135-168Google Scholar). Human mast cells can be obtained in vitro by long term culture of CD34-positive cells with stem cell factor (5Saito H. Ebisawa M. Tachimoto H. Shichijo M. Fukagawa K. Matsumoto K. Iikura Y. Awaji T. Tsujimoto G. Yanagida M. Uzumaki H. Takahashi G. Tsuji K. Nakahata T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 343-350PubMed Google Scholar). But little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation of mast cells. One of the approaches to this problem is to elucidate how the expression of mast cell-specific genes are regulated. The presence of several lineage-specific transcription factors is reported in mast cells. For example, cell-specific expression of the mast cell-carboxypeptidase A gene is regulated through GATA site (6Zon L.I. Gurish M.F. Stevens R.L. Mather C. Reynolds D.S. Austen K.F. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22948-22953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription factors GATA-1, GATA-2, and PU.1 play a critical role in mast cell-specific expression of interleukin-4 through binding to an enhancer in the second intron (7Henkel G. Brown M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,8Henkel G. Weiss D.L. McCoy R. Deloughery T. Tara D. Brown M.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3239-3246PubMed Google Scholar). We reported that the transcription factor NF-E2 transactivated the mouse HDC gene (9Ohtsu H. Kuramasu A. Suzuki S. Igarashi K. Ohuchi Y. Sato M. Tanaka S. Nakagawa S. Shirato K. Yamamoto M. Ichikawa A. Watanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28439-28444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is well known, however, thattrans-acting factors are not the only regulators of cell-specific transcription. For example, the CpG methylation or packed chromatin structure exerts negative effects on gene expression and also must be considered to understand the precise mechanisms of specific gene transcription. We show here that cell-specific expression of HDC mRNA is regulated at the transcriptional level. It is revealed that a region including the GC box sequence in the promoter is essential for transactivation and that Sp1 binds to this GC box. However, lines of evidence that even cell lines that do not transcribe the HDC gene show some transactivation and that there is little difference in binding of nuclear extracts to the GC box between HDC-expressing and -nonexpressing cell lines point to the presence of an additional regulatory mechanism(s). In this study, we observed that the promoter region in HDC-expressing cell lines is more sensitive to nucleases and has unmethylated CpG sites around the transcription initiation site. Moreover, in vitro methylation of reporter plasmids was shown to have inhibitory effects on the HDC gene promoter. These results indicate that chromosomal configuration and methylation of the HDC gene would be critical for the cell-specific transcription of this gene. HeLa and HMC-1 (10Butterfield J.H. Weiler D.

K562 (11Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and KU-812-F (12Fukuda T. Kishi K. Ohnishi Y. Shibata A. Blood. 1987; 70: 612-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To prepare primary human mast cells, umbilical cord blood samples were obtained from normal full-term deliveries according to the hospital's legal guidelines (National Children's Hospital, Tokyo, Japan). Mononuclear cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation using lymphocyte separation medium (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC). CD34-positive cells were isolated from mononuclear cells using a magnetic separation column according to the manufacturer's instruction (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The cells were cultured in media I (IBL, Gunma, Japan) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, human recombinant stem cell factor (Kirin Brewery, Maebashi, Japan) at 100 ng/ml and interleukin-6 (Kirin Brewery) at 50 ng/ml for 20 weeks (5Saito H.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform procedure (14Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63082) Google Scholar). HDC mRNA was analyzed by RNA blot hybridization. Twenty-μg aliquots of total cellular RNA were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels under denaturing conditions, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes at 42 °C overnight in hybridization buffer comprising 50% formamide, 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The blots were washed in 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS; 1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS; and then 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. DNA blots were hybridized at 65 °C overnight in hybridization buffer comprising 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 20 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The blots were washed at 65 °C in the same buffers as used for RNA blots. The human HDC cDNA probe used was a 1.8-kbPvuII–PvuII (positions 265–2063) restriction fragment from the human HDC cDNA clone, pTN-2 (15Mamune-Sato R. Yamauchi K. Tanno Y. Ohkawara Y. Ohtsu H.

The human β-actin probe was a 0.9-kb ScaI–SmaI (positions 121–1048) restriction fragment from a human β-actin cDNA clone (provided by Dr. T. Yamamoto at the Tohoku University Gene Research Center). The HDC probes for genomic Southern analysis were 409-bp PstI–PstI (positions −612 to −203) (probe 1 in Fig. 4) and 387-bp PstI–PstI (positions −203 to +184) restriction fragments (probe 2 in Fig. 5) and the 238-bp PCR product (probe 3 in Fig. 5) amplified with two primers: Pr.1iDS1Eco (5′-CCTGATTTCTCTATGTCACTTCTAG-3′ (+2298 to +2322)) and Pr.2iUS1Eco (5′-CCTGAATTCCAGAACTGCCCTTG-3′ (+2535 to +2513)). These fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (16Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16645) Google Scholar).Figure 5Methylation pattern of the human HDC gene. A, 10-μg aliquots of genomic DNA isolated from HeLa (lanes 1 and 5), K562 (lanes 2 and 6), HMC-1 (lanes 3 and 7) and KU-812-F (lanes 4 and 8) were first treated with EcoRI and then with MspI (lanes 1–4) or HpaII (lanes 5–8). The samples were separated, blotted, and hybridized with probe 2. B, each slot was loaded with 5 μg of genomic DNA from HeLa (lanes 1 and 2), K562 (lanes 3 and 4), HMC-1 (lanes 5 and 6), and KU-812-F (lanes 7 and 8) digested withEcoRI and HpaII (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or EcoRI and MspI (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). The blot was hybridized with probe 3.C, restriction map of the human HDC gene. Exons I and II are represented by thick vertical lines.MspI/HpaII recognition sites (CCGG) and CpG dinucleotides are also indicated. Closed and open circles represent methylated and unmethylated sites, respectively. Two MspI sites in the first intron just 5′ of the second exon are too close to be discriminated from each other by Southern blot analysis (*). Therefore, at least one of them could be recognized to be unmethylated from the results in B. Thelines at the bottom of C represent the expected size of fragments produced by restriction endonuclease digestion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nuclear run-on transcription assay was performed basically as described previously (17Celano P.

Wade M.F. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 238-243PubMed Google Scholar). About 2 x 107 nuclei were isolated and incubated with [α-32P]UTP and unlabeled ATP, CTP, and GTP. The radiolabeled nascent RNA transcripts were treated with 20 units/ml of DNase I at 30 °C for 10 min and 1 mg/ml of proteinase K at 42 °C for 30 min. RNA was then isolated by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform procedure (14Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63082) Google Scholar). Unincorporated [α-32P]UTP was removed by two rounds of ammonium acetate/ethanol precipitation. To prepare cDNA blots, pBluescript KS(+) inserted with human HDC cDNA (positions 236–2060) or human β-actin cDNA (full-length) or without any insert was linearized, alkaline-denatured, and slot-blotted to Hybond N+. Hybridization and washing were performed as described previously (18Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). The signal intensity was quantified using a MacBAS bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). A BamHI/HindIII restriction fragment containing the −5947 to +97 region just upstream of the first codon of human HDC gene was isolated from pUCHDC(−5.8k) (kindly provided by Prof. A. Ichikawa, Kyoto University), inserted between BglII and HindIII sites in the 5′ multiple cloning site (MCS) of the pGL2 basic vector (Promega) to construct pGL−5947. To construct pGL−4687 and pGL−2435,SmaI (MCS)/BglII (−4687) and SmaI (MCS)/NdeI (−2435) fragments, respectively, were removed from pGL−5947, treated with T4 DNA polymerase to make blunt ends, and self-ligated. pGL−278 was constructed from pGL−5947 by removing theSacI (MCS)/SacI (−278) fragment for self-ligation. PCR products amplified with Pr.-1 (5′-TGGCTCTCTTGACCAGTCAA-3′ (−155 to −135))/GL primer 2 (Promega) and Pr.-0.5 (5′-GGAGCTAAGGTCAAAGAAAG-3′ (−53 to −33))/GL primer 2 using pGL−5947 as a template were digested with HindIII, and larger fragments were isolated and cloned into SmaI and HindIII sites of the pGL2 basic vector to produce pGL−153 and pGL−52, respectively. Because pGL−153 does not contain suitable restriction sites for a deletion reaction with exonuclease III, theHindIII-digested PCR fragment used to produce pGL−153 was cloned into SmaI and HindIII sites of pBluescript KS(+) to produce pBS−153. The BamHI (MCS)/HindIII (MCS) restriction fragment from pBS−153 was recloned into BglII and HindIII sites of pGL basic vector to produce pGLBH−153. Then pGLBH−153 linearized withSacI and XhoI was treated with exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease to make unidirectional deletions and self-ligated to produce pGL−123, pGL−100, pGL−84, and pGL−64. Constructs pGL−153 GC mut and pGL−123 GC mut were generated using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instruction using Pr.Sp1Smut (5′-GGACTTTGAAGaatacAGCTAAGGTCAAAG-3′ (−67 to −38; lowercase letters indicate mutations)) as a mutagenic primer. Constructs produced using PCR products were sequenced by dideoxy chain termination method (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52494) Google Scholar) to exclude plasmids with PCR mutation(s). DNA transfection was carried out by the electroporation method (21Showe M.K. Williams D.L. Showe L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3153-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in PBS at a density of 107 cells/ml. A mixture of 320 μl of cell suspension and 30 μl of DNA solution was incubated in 4-mm-wide cuvettes (Bio-Rad) on ice for 10 min before electroporation. The DNA solutions contained 5 pmol of reporter plasmid, 50 μg of pBluescript KS(+) as carrier, and 10 μg (for HMC-1 and HeLa) or 2 μg (for K562) of pENL β-galactosidase expression vector as an internal control per cuvette. Cell suspensions were exposed to an electric pulse of 360 V/960 microfarads (for HeLa), 320 V/960 microfarads (for K562) or 380V/960 microfarads (for HMC-1), provided by a Gene Pulser electroporation device (Bio-Rad). After electroporation, the cuvettes were incubated on ice for 10 min again, and the transfected cells were cultured with 6 ml of medium for 48 h at 37 °C under 5% of CO2 until harvesting. Preparation of cell lysates and luciferase assays was carried out using a Luciferase Assay Kit (Toyo-Inki, Tokyo, Japan). β-Galactosidase activities in cell lysates were assayed as described earlier (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was standardized by the β-galactosidase activity and was expressed as a relative value to that obtained with the pGL2 basic. Nuclear extracts were prepared from four cell lines by hypotonic lysis followed by high salt extraction of nuclei as described previously (22Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide DNAs were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase. Five μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 104 cpm of the labeled probe at room temperature for 30 min in 22 μl of the reaction mixture comprising 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and electrophoresed in 4% polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 400 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.5). Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography. Synthetic oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixtures as competitors at a 100-fold molar excess over the input probe concentration. For the supershift analysis, 1 μg of anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the reaction mixture. Nuclei were isolated as described previously with minor modifications (23Siebenlist U. Hennighausen L. Battey J. Leder P. Cell. 1984; 37: 381-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). About 3 × 108 cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and resuspended in ice-cold nuclear isolation buffer (60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EGTA (pH 7.8), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.3 m sucrose at a concentration of 107 cells/ml. Cells were lysed by adding Nonidet P-40 (0.5% final concentration) and kept for 5 min on ice. This solution was layered onto the same volume of sucrose solution (1.5m in nuclear isolation buffer) and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitated nuclei were resuspended in glycerol storage buffer (40% glycerol and 0.3 m sucrose in nuclear isolation buffer without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), frozen after aliquoting, and stored at −70 °C until use. Aliquots of nuclei (4 A 260units in 400 μl) were treated with serial 2-fold increasing concentrations of DNase I (28–448 units/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min or with ApaI (200 units/ml) at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS and EDTA to final concentrations of 0.5% and 10 mm, respectively, and followed by digestion at 55 °C overnight with proteinase K at a final concentration of 400 μg/ml. The reaction mixtures were then extracted with phenol and phenol/chloroform, ethanol precipitation, and treated with 100 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. The same extraction and precipitation protocol was then repeated, and these samples were electrophoresed, blotted, and hybridized as stated under “RNA and DNA Blot Hybridization Analysis.” Bisulfite genomic sequencing was performed basically as described previously (24Clark S.J.

Ten-μg aliquots of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from cell lines were denatured in 0.3 m of NaOH at 37 °C for 15 min in a total volume of 50 μl. Next, sulfonation and hydrolytic deamination reactions were carried out by adding 450 μl of 2.5m sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5)/10 mmhydroquinone solution (pH 5.0) to the digested genomic DNA and incubating at 50 °C for 4 h in the dark. DNA was purified by absorbing to Glassmilk (Bio101) silica matrix and eluted with TE, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Desulfonation reaction were then performed in 0.3 m of NaOH at 37 °C for 15 min, and DNA was precipitated with 3 m ammonium acetate/ethanol and resuspended in 100 μl of water. PCR amplification was performed in 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 5 μl of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA, 0.5 μm primers, 200 μm dNTPs, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), and 2.5 units of ExTaq polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles. Modified primers used in this experiment were as follows: hHDCa1 (5′-TTTGAATTCAGGGGTAGAAAGAATTGAGGG-3′ (modified sequences from −267 to −238)) and hHDCa2 (5′-CCATCATCTCCCTTAAACTCTAACTCCTTC-3′ (+113 to +84)) to amplify the sense strand, with hHDCb1 (5′-CCTACAAACTTGAATTCCTAAATACACTAC-3′ (−209 to −180)) and hHDCb2 (5′-TTTTATAGATGGATATGTAGGAGGTGGAAG-3′ (+85 to +56)) to amplify the antisense strand. Amplified DNA was sequenced directly or after subcloning in Bluescript KS(+) by the cycle sequencing method using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). The reporter plasmid pGL−278 was digested with KpnI and HindIII, and the promoter region was gel-isolated. The promoter region was methylated in vitro with 3 units of SssI methylase (New England Biolabs)/μg of DNA in the presence of 160 μm S-adenosylmethionine at 37 °C for 3 h. For the unmethylated control, the same fragment was incubated in the same condition without SssI methylase. Complete methylation of the fragment was confirmed by HpaII and HhaI restriction enzyme digestion. The pGL basic vector digested withKpnI and HindIII was ligated with an equimolar concentration of methylated or unmethylated promoter fragment at 16 °C for 30 min at a DNA concentration of 10 μg/ml. The DNA was ethanol-precipitated, and 4 μg of ligated DNA was transfected using SuperFect transfection reagent (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Five hundred ng of total RNA was primed with random hexamer and reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 10 μl. The cDNA pool was then diluted 10-fold. PCR was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 5 μl of cDNA, 0.2 mm dNTP mixture, 100 mm specific sets of primers, and 0.5 unit of ExTaq polymerase. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min for 30 or 35 cycles for HDC; 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min for 28 cycles for β-actin. Primers used in reverse transcriptase-PCR were as follows (5′ to 3′): Pr.hHDCS, GCATCCAGCCCTGCGTGTAC (positions 425–444), Pr.hHDCAS, GAAGTCGGTGGCCACGCCTG (complementary to positions 1125–1144); β-actin S, CCACACCTTCTACAATGAGC (positions 302–321); β-actin AS, ACAGCACTGTGTTGGCGTAC (complementary to positions 919–938). The GenBankTM accession number for the humanl-histidine decarboxylase genomic sequence is D16583. RNA blot analysis of four human cell lines demonstrated HDC mRNA expression in HMC-1 human mast cells and KU-812-F human basophilic leukemia cells but not in HeLa human cervical cancer cells and K562 human erythroleukemia cells (Fig. 1 A). The amount of HDC mRNA in the HMC-1 cells appeared slightly greater than that in KU-812-F cells. Two HDC mRNA species were observed in HMC-1 cells as in KU-812-F cells, which were supposed to be generated by alternative splicing (15Mamune-Sato R. Yamauchi K. Tanno Y. Ohkawara Y. Ohtsu H. Katayose D. Maeyama K. Watanabe T. Shibahara S. Takishima T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In order to ascertain whether mast cell-/basophil-specific expression of HDC mRNA is transcriptionally regulated, we performed a nuclear run-on assay. The signal intensities for the HDC gene in HMC-1 and KU-812-F were 57 and 37%, respectively, of those for the β-actin gene (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, HDC signals in HeLa and K562 were as weak as those for control pBluescript KS(+) vector signals. These results suggest that the cell-specific expression of HDC mRNA in mast cells and basophils is dependent on transcription. To locate thecis-acting sequence that regulates HDC gene transcription, a series of 5′-deleted promoter fragments, including a 97-bp fragment downstream from the transcription initiation site, were fused to the luciferase gene in the pGL−2 basic vector and transfected into HMC-1, K562, and HeLa cell lines. Since the efficiency of transfection into KU-812-F was very low, we did not include this cell line. Construct pGL−5947, containing 5947 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site, produced a relative luciferase activity of about 75 in HMC-1 cells (Fig. 2 A). This activity was equivalent to that produced by pGL2 control vector, which possesses the SV40 early promoter and enhancer (data not shown). When the promoter region was deleted to −4687, the relative luciferase activity was reduced by 40% only in HMC-1, suggesting mast cell-specific positive regulatory elements in this region. The deletion to −52 decreased the luciferase activity to the basal level in all cell lines. Further analysis was made in order to identify the regulatory elements between −153 and −52. The removal of sequences between −153 and −123 increased the luciferase activity by 64% in HMC-1, indicating the existence of a negative element in this region. Removal of sequences from −64 to −52 abolished the reporter activity, suggesting that the GC box in this region was important for promoter activity. The requirement of the GC box was confirmed by the fact that pGL−153 GC mut or pGL−123 GC mut containing point mutations in the GC box showed significant loss of reporter activity (Fig. 2 B). To examine whether nuclear extracts from different cell lines bind to the GC box in different fashions, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 3 A). Two major shift bands were observed for all four cell lines, and this shift was specifically inhibited by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of the cold oligonucleotide (Fig. 3 B). When the mutated probe was used instead of the wild type probe, these two bands were not observed (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, the addition of anti-Sp1 antibody resulted in retardation of these bands (Fig. 3 D). Bindings of Sp1 were not affected by methylation of GC box, and there was no difference in binding capacity among four cell lines (Fig. 3 E). These results confirm that Sp1 binds to the GC box, whether it is methylated or not, in all four cell lines and that the complexes are not specific to mast cells or basophils. The sensitivity of the promoter region of the HDC gene to DNase I was compared among the four cell lines. Smaller fragments of about 1.8–1.9 kb after DNase I digestion were found to hybridize with the probe in the HMC-1 and KU-812-F but not in HeLa and K562 cells (Fig. 4 A). These fragments specific to the two cell lines indicate the presence of DNase I-sensitive sites that map to regions just 5′ of exon I (Fig. 4 C). The absence of the 1.8–1.9-kb fragments in HeLa and K562 was not found to be due to ineffectiveness of DNase I digestion, because with a higher DNase I concentration, the 6.3-kbEcoRI–EcoRI fragment signal became weaker in all cell lines. We next used restriction endonuclease ApaI, which recognizes a site (−18 bp relative to the transcription initiation site) in the promoter region (Fig. 4 C, asterisk). The digestion of nuclei with ApaI again produced a strong 1.9-kb fragment in the HMC-1 and KU-812-F, but not in HeLa and K562 cells (Fig. 4 B). OtherApaI-sensitive sites were also found in the"
https://openalex.org/W1967250681,"SPACR (sialoproteinassociated with cones and rods), is the major 147–150-kDa glycoprotein present in the insoluble interphotoreceptor matrix of the human retina. Immunocytochemistry localizes SPACR to the matrix surrounding rods and cones (Acharya, S., Rayborn, M. E., and Hollyfield, J. G. (1998)Glycobiology 8, 997–1006). From affinity-purified SPACR, we obtained seven peptide sequences showing 100% identity to the deduced sequence of IMPG1, a purported chondroitin 6-sulfate proteoglycan core protein, which binds peanut agglutinin and is localized to the interphotoreceptor matrix. We show here that SPACR is the most prominent 147–150-kDa band present in the interphotoreceptor matrix and is the gene product of IMPG1. SPACR is not a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, since it is not a product of chondroitinase ABC digestion and does not react to a specific antibody for chondroitin 6-sulfate proteoglycan. Moreover, the deduced amino acid sequence reveals no established glycosaminoglycan attachment site. One hyaluronan binding motif is present in the predicted sequence of SPACR. We present evidence that SPACR has a functional hyaluronan binding domain, suggesting that interactions between SPACR and hyaluronan may serve to form the basic macromolecular scaffold, which comprises the insoluble interphotoreceptor matrix. SPACR (sialoproteinassociated with cones and rods), is the major 147–150-kDa glycoprotein present in the insoluble interphotoreceptor matrix of the human retina.

The IPM1 resides within the outer eye wall, at the interface between the neural retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Projecting from the neural retina outer surface, the elongate photoreceptor inner and outer segments penetrate into and are surrounded by the IPM (1Röhlich P. Exp. Eye Res. 1970; 10: 80-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A number of activities of fundamental importance to vision are thought to be mediated by the IPM, including retinal adhesion, visual pigment chromophore exchange, metabolite trafficking, photoreceptor alignment, and membrane turnover (2Hageman G.S. Johnson L.V. Prog. Retinal Res. 1991; 10: 207-249Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The specific IPM molecules that participate in these activities are not well defined. The distribution of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-binding domains in the IPM surrounding rod and cone photoreceptors has previously been documented (3Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Landers R.A. Myers K.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 107-110Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These matrix components are relatively stable and resist extraction with physiological salt solutions. A major WGA-binding glycoprotein, glycoprotein 147, was identified in extracts of the insoluble IPM from human retina (4Tien L. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 55: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). More recently, this protein was purified from the insoluble IPM and characterized (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The glycoprotein was renamed SPACR, which is an acronym for “sialoprotein associated withcones and rods” (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody prepared against SPACR intensely labels the rod-associated matrix with weaker labeling of the matrix surrounding cones (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This pattern and intensity of immunoreactivity mimics the differential distribution of WGA binding to the rod and cone matrix domains. Using a variety of lectins in conjunction with neuraminidase and glycosidase digestions, we established that (a) the molecule is heavily sialylated, (b) both N- and O-linked glycoconjugates are present in the molecule, and (c) glycoconjugates account for approximately 30% of the molecular mass (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To obtain sufficient amino acid sequence from purified SPACR, which would permit cloning of the gene, SPACR peptides were sequenced and found to be identical to predicted peptides encoded by the cDNA of IMPG1 (also called IPM150, accession number AF047492). The gene product of IMPG1 is reported to be a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core protein present in the IPM (6Hageman G.S. Hewitt A.T. Keuchoff M. Johnson L.V. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1990; 30 (suppl.): 489Google Scholar, 7Kirchoff M.A. Anderson K. Johnson L.V. Hageman G.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1990; 31 (suppl.): 153Google Scholar, 8Kuehn M.H. Mullins R.F.

Stone E.M. Hageman G.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38 (suppl.): 2788Google Scholar). Although both IMPG1 and SPACR are located in the IPM, our earlier studies demonstrated that SPACR is a glycoprotein and not a proteoglycan (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Could SPACR and IMPG1 be products of the same gene, differing only in post-translational modifications? In this study we present evidence demonstrating that the gene product of IMPG1 is not a proteoglycan, but instead is the IPM glycoprotein SPACR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one function of SPACR is to bind and organize HA in the IPM. The lectins WGA and peanut agglutinin (PNA), biotinylated horseradish peroxidase, streptavidin, and goat anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate tablets, iodoacetic acid, and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma. Protease inhibitors were from Boehringer Mannheim. Diaminobenzidine tablets were from Amresco (Solon, OH). Biotinylated chondroitin 6-sulfate Δ-disaccharide-specific antibody (3B3), chondroitinase ABC (protease-free), chondroitinase ACII (protease-free), and Streptomyces hyaluronidase were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Ijamsville, MD). Sequencing grade trypsin was from Boehringer Mannheim. Endoproteinase Lys-C and endoproteinase Glu-C were purchased from Waco Bioproducts (Richmond, VA). Cetylpyridinium chloride was obtained from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). Immobilon P membranes were purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Healon (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) was the source of HA. Gel Code stain was obtained from Pierce. Sixty-five human eyes were obtained from the Cleveland Eye Bank (Cleveland, OH) for use in this study. Donor ages ranged from 4 to 70 years, with postmortem times between 2 and 12 h. Retinas were isolated and washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors to remove soluble components, followed by detachment of the insoluble IPM with distilled water (3Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Landers R.A. Myers K.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 107-110Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar,11Johnson L.V. Hageman G.S. Invest. Ophthalmol.

The insoluble IPM was collected (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) after centrifugation, and the pellet was solubilized in 0.1 m TBS, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol. This procedure was performed as described earlier (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SPACR was solubilized in 0.1 m TBS, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol. The supernatant was dialyzed against the same buffer before loading on a PNA-agarose column. The flow-through from this column was then applied to a WGA-Sepharose column, and the protein eluted with 0.25 m N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. Individual fractions were analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE, followed by lectin blotting using biotinylated WGA, and stored as individual fractions at −70 °C. 50 ml of 1 mg/ml IPM extract was resuspended in 0.1 m Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.3, and 3 milliunits of each enzyme, containing protease inhibitors, was added to the tube. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 3 h. IPM extract (100 μg of total protein) was incubated in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, for 2 h at 37 °C with Streptomyceshyaluronidase (2–5 turbidity reducing units). The reaction products were analyzed by staining with Gel Code stain after SDS-PAGE. Equal protein concentrations were loaded on the gels prior to electrophoresis, transfer, and lectin blotting. The efficiency of electrotransfer to the membrane in the enzyme-treated preparation was assessed by comparing the SPACR staining intensity with Coomassie Blue in the gel before and after transfer. We found no significant difference in the transfer efficiency of the IPM before or after enzymatic treatment in any of these studies. SDS-PAGE-separated IPM samples were electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes and incubated in TBS, pH 7.5, for 30 min. TBS was replaced by the appropriate biotinylated lectin (20 μg/ml) in 1% BSA-TBS and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed with TBS (three times) and incubated with biotinylated horseradish peroxidase-avidin D complex, and the bands were visualized by the peroxidase reaction product. For Western blots, the membranes were incubated in 1:1000-diluted primary anti-SPACR antiserum (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in TBS overnight at 4 °C after BSA blocking. Membranes were washed and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed, and the color reaction was developed using the substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium. Protease digestions were carried out as described by Stone et al. (13Stone K. LoPresti M. Crawford J. DeAngelis R. Williams K. Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, Inc., New York1989: 33-43Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of freeze-dried, purified SPACR was reduced and alkylated with iodoacetic acid. The enzyme (1:100 by weight) was added to SPACR in sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The peptides were separated by standard reverse phase HPLC on a C-18 column using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Sequencing of the isolated peptides was done in the Protein Core Facility of The Cleveland Clinic Foundation. SPACR wasN-deglycosylated as described (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and 20 μg was dissolved in 200 μl of 70% trifluoroacetic acid. Cyanogen bromide (200 μg) in acetonitrile was added to the tube, flushed with nitrogen, and incubated in the dark at an ambient temperature for 24 h. After diluting with 20 volumes of distilled water, the mixture was lyophilized. The peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and subjected to sequencing by Edman degradation. Affinity-purified SPACR was further separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and the band was excised, and then the gel was destained and sent to the Harvard Microchemistry Laboratory (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) for digestion with trypsin and separation by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Four of the resultant peptides were sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry. All peptides were subjected to a BLAST search, which displayed 100% identities with peptides from the deduced sequence for IMPG1. The cDNA sequence of IMPG1 was submitted by M. H. Kuehn and G. S. Hageman to GenBankTM (accession number AF047492). To demonstrate HA binding to SPACR, we used a protocol previously described (14Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 15Goodstone N.J. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, IPM extract in 0.1 m Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 0.5m NaCl and protease inhibitors was incubated at 37 °C with 1.25% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) for 1 h. The extract was centrifuged (12,000 rpm) for 15 min at room temperature. The pellet was washed with 1% CPC in Tris acetate buffer and solubilized in Laemmli buffer (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar), and both pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Gel Code. BSA was included as a negative control. Samples were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes by the application of 25 μl of IPM extract in TBS into wells of a Bio-Rad 96-well dot blot apparatus (17Plaas A.H.K. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Proteins were adsorbed to the membrane for 1 h at room temperature before removing buffer and unbound molecules. The membrane was washed with Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.3, for 5 min and then incubated for 1 h in 5% nonfat milk powder in TBS. This was followed by a 4-h incubation with a 1:500 dilution of biotinylated 3B3 antibody at room temperature followed by a 1-h incubation with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase solution. The bands were developed by peroxidase reaction with hydrogen peroxide and DAB. Total RNA from human tissues was either purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) or isolated from the human tissues using the RNAzol method (Cinna/Biotech Laboratory, Friendswood, TX). Macula and peripheral retina RNA was isolated from 5-mm punches of fresh monkey retina as described previously (18Schoen T.J. Mazuruk K. Chader G.J. Rodriguez I.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The RNA was separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose 2.2 m formaldehyde gels. The gels were run in 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39-7.52Google Scholar). Images of SDS-PAGE, immunoblots, and lectin blots were digitized at 300 dots per inch on a flat-bed Scanmaker III scanner, using Scan Wizard 3.0.7 software from Microtech Laboratories (Redondo Beach, CA). Band area and pixel density were measured using Kodak Digital Science software (Eastman Kodak Co.) on a Power Macintosh 7600/132 (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA). Mean density and S.D. values were calculated from the pixel density in the bands of interest. The data were normalized to adjust for unequal background staining throughout the lane in the Coomassie Blue-stained gels and lectin blots. At least three separate measurements were made for each treatment, and comparisons were made between treatments using a two-tailed Student's t test. All figures were assembled and labeled with PowerPoint 4.0 software (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) and printed on a Codonics (Middleburg Heights, OH) NC 1600 dye substitution printer. SPACR was purified on a WGA-Sepharose column after removal of all PNA-binding molecules to ensure a homogeneous population of WGA-binding protein (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The WGA-binding fraction was further separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the SPACR band was excised for sequence analysis. N-terminal sequencing was attempted on four separate occasions using increasing amounts of protein (from 2 to 20 pmol), which revealed that the majority of this protein is blocked (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, using 20 pmol of protein, a low level signal (less than 1 pmol), corresponding to SAFFPTGVKV was obtained. Seven peptides were obtained from solution digests of purified SPACR or in gel digests of SPACR separated by SDS-PAGE accounting for 9.1% of the protein sequence. Endoproteinase Glu-C digest yielded peptides EILDNTL and EFAVLEE. Cyanogen bromide cleavage yielded the peptide MQKIFKKL. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis, following trypsin digestion, yielded the peptides SAFFPTGVK, VCQEAVWEAYR, AELADSQSPYYQELAGK, and QLEILNFR. The sequence of these seven peptides matched the predicted amino acid sequence of IMPG1 (AF047492) with 100% fidelity (Fig. 1). These data indicate that the cDNA sequence submitted as IMPG1 is the sequence encoding SPACR. The tissue distribution of SPACR expression was determined by Northern blot analysis using a variety of monkey and human tissues. To test for expression within the retina, 5-mm trephine isolates from different areas of the monkey retina were taken and the RNA isolated. Probes were designed from the cDNA sequence (see Fig. 2 for details). SPACR mRNA was found in nearly equal amounts in macula and peripheral retina but was barely detectable in the pigmented epithelium/choroid (Fig. 2). This low level of expression may be due to contamination from the neural retina, which is difficult to cleanly separate from the retinal pigment epithelium during tissue dissection. This is consistent with our data from human multitissue Northern blots, where the retina was the only tissue with detectable SPACR expression (Fig. 3). The mRNA is approximately 3.5 kb in length, consistent with the size of the cDNA sequence of IMPG1 (AF047492). The minor signal around 8 kb observed in the monkey retina lanes (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 3) may represent an alternative polyadenylation site in the mRNA. These results demonstrate the high level of specificity of this IPM protein to retina.Figure 3Multitissue Northern blot analysis of IMPG1/SPACR expression. Total RNA (6 μg) from 13 human tissues was separated and blotted as described. The blot was probed and treated as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Retina (lane 1), retinal pigment epithelium/choroid (lane 2), brain (lane 4), skeletal muscle (lane 5), heart (lane 6), kidney (lane 7), stomach (lane 8), small intestine (lane 9), testis (lane 10), uterus (lane 11), spleen (lane 12), and lung (lane 13) tissues are shown. Note the intense binding of the probe to the retina sample, minor binding to the retinal pigment epithelium/choroid sample, and the absence of binding in any other tissue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The deduced amino acid sequence of IMPG1/SPACR is presented in Fig. 1. Several interesting features are observed. Residues 1–70 represent a likely N-terminal signal peptide involved in the secretion of this IPM molecule. The natural N terminus of the mature protein was found to begin at position Ser71 by N-terminal amino acid analysis of purified SPACR. The tryptic peptides derived from SPACR, which were analyzed by mass spectrometry, did not contain the peptides expected from the first 70 amino acid residues in the deduced sequence, confirming that this is a signal sequence. Thus, the mature SPACR protein contains 701 amino acid residues. A large mucin-like domain, containing numerous potentialO-linked glycosylation sites, lies in the central part of the protein (Gly296–Pro552). Seven consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation are located in two clusters flanking either side of the mucin domain (at residues Asn143, Asn191, Asn215, Asn592, Asn616, Asn630, and Asn648, shown in boldface type in Fig. 1). This confirms and extends our previous direct glycoconjugate analysis of purified SPACR indicating that it contained both N- and O-linked glycoconjugates accounting for approximately 30% of the molecular mass (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A linear HA binding motif of the RHAMM type (20Yhang B. Zhang L. Turley E.A. J. Biol Chem. 1993; 268: 8617-8623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Yang B. Savani R. Turley E. EMBO. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) is located at residues Lys280–Lys288. This motif conforms to the sequence pattern BX 7B, where B represents lysine or arginine residues separated by seven amino acids, excluding aspartic or glutamic acid. This site is flanked by two proline residues (Pro277, Pro289), which are known to be strong β-turn promoters, and may be required to present this motif in the appropriate conformation for HA binding. An EGF-like motif is present on the C-terminal side of the mucin-like domain (Asp687–Cys730). EGF-like domains are characteristic of a number of extracellular matrix proteins and are implicated in protein-protein interactions (22Scott J. Ufdea M. Quiroga M. Sanchez-Pescador R. Fong N.

Brain Res. 1996; 41: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The six conserved cysteine residues present in this domain are involved in intrachain disulfide bonding that is required for the structural stability of this motif (26Handford P.A. Mayhew M. Baron M. Winship P.R. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Some EGF-like domains require calcium for their biological function (27Selander-Sunnerhagen M. Ullner M. Persson E. Teleman O. Stenflo J. Drakenberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19642-19649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the EGF-like domain in IMPG1/SPACR contains the critical asparagine (Asn702), which has been implicated in calcium binding (27Selander-Sunnerhagen M. Ullner M. Persson E. Teleman O. Stenflo J. Drakenberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19642-19649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The potential for calcium binding by SPACR could point toward an important physiological role for this IPM protein in sequestering extracellular calcium released by photoreceptors in response to light (28Gold G.H. Korenbrot J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5557-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Gold G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1150-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). No documented consensus sites for GAG attachment are present in the deduced amino acid sequence of IMPG1/SPACR (Fig. 1). Our biochemical analysis of SPACR indicates that this molecule is a glycoprotein (4Tien L. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 55: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Based on electrophoretic mobility, the molecular mass of SPACR was defined as 147 kDa (4Tien L. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 55: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which corresponds closely to the 150 kDa ascribed to IMPG1 after chondroitinase digestion (8Kuehn M.H. Mullins R.F. Hageman G.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1993; 34 (suppl.): 2443Google Scholar, 9Kuehn M.H. Hageman G.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1995; 36 (suppl.): 3264Google Scholar, 10Kuehn M.H. Stone E.M. Hageman G.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38 (suppl.): 2788Google Scholar). If IMPG1 is the core protein of a chondroitin 6-sulfate proteoglycan, as claimed (8Kuehn M.H. Mullins R.F. Hageman G.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1993; 34 (suppl.): 2443Google Scholar, 9Kuehn M.H. Hageman G.S. Invest. Ophthalmol.

Sci. 1997; 38 (suppl.): 2788Google Scholar), it should not enter a 7.5% SDS-PAGE unless the chondroitin sulfate chains are degraded. This, however, was not the result we observed when these comparisons were evaluated (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–3). A prominent SPACR band is present in both chondroitinase-digested (Fig. 4 A, lane 1) and undigested (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) samples. The relative staining densities of the SPACR bands are not significantly different (see histogram in Fig. 4 A). The similarities in staining densities of the SPACR bands in these two groups indicate that additional protein with a molecular mass of 150 kDa is not released when the IPM is digested with chondroitinase. In contrast, dramatic changes are observed in the higher molecular weight proteins. The high molecular weight components, which only minimally enter the gel in the undigested sample (Fig. 4 A, lane 2), are no longer observed after chondroitinase digestion (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). Instead, two new bands, one just above and the other below the 220-kDa marker, are now present (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). Since these bands are seen neither in the untreated sample (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) nor in the enzyme control (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), they could only represent the core proteins of chondroitin or dermatan sulfate proteoglycans. A polyclonal antibody to SPACR recognizes both native SPACR and SPACR treated with N- and/or O-glycosidases (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If the core protein of IMPG1 and SPACR represent the same gene product, the anti-SPACR antibody should recognize any IMPG1 molecules released after chondroitinase digestion, resulting in an increased intensity of immunostaining of the 150-kDa band. We used this antibody in Western blotting analysis (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–3) to determine whether increased immunoreactivity could be detected in the 147–150-kDa band following chondroitinase digestion. Similar levels of SPACR immunoreactivity are observed in chondroitinase-digested (Fig. 4 B, lane 1), and undigested samples (Fig. 4 B, lane 2) with no significant differences in the relative staining densities observed when the blots were quantitated (see histogram in Fig. 4 B). Additionally, in the undigested sample (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), no SPACR immunoreactivity is observed at the top of the lane where the high molecular weight proteoglycan bands are observed in the Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). The two new bands present on either side of the 220-kDa marker, released after chondroitinase digestion (Fig. 4 A, lane 1), also fail to show SPACR immunoreactivity (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). These data indicate that no additional protein with epitopes recognized by the anti-SPACR antibody is released following chondroitinase digestion. WGA was the principal lectin used for SPACR identification (3Hollyfield J.G. Rayborn M.E. Landers R.A. Myers K.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 107-110Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Tien L.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We used this lectin to determine whether additional WGA binding molecules are released following chondroitinase digestion. WGA blots of enzyme-treated and control IPM samples are presented in Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 2. It should be noted that equal amounts of IPM protein (25 μg of total protein) were loaded for all these comparisons. As previously reported (5Acharya S. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G.

In addition, recombinant angiostatin inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and the growth of several diverse carcinomas in mice (3Sim S.K. O'Reilly M.S. Liang H. Fortier A.H. He W. Madsen J.W.

The inhibitory effect of angiostatin on growth factor-induced endothelial cell proliferation appears to be expressed by recombinant kringles 1, 3 and, to a lesser extent, 2 (6Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinas M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29461-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar).The mechanism of formation of angiostatin in mice with tumor burden is not completely understood at this time. It was recently reported that macrophages recruited to Lewis lung carcinomas were responsible for the formation of angiostatin via their expression of metalloelastase (MMP-12) (7Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Macrophage expression of MMP-12 is induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor secreted by the carcinoma cells (7Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the carcinoma cells and host macrophages cooperate in the generation of angiostatin. Supporting the role of metalloproteinases in the generation of angiostatin is the observation that stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), matrilysin (MMP-7), and type IV collagenase (MMP-9) proteolyzed plasminogen to generate angiostatin fragments in a cell free system (8Lijnen H.R. Ugwu F. Bini A. Collen D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4699-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 9Patterson B.C. Sang Q.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28823-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been reported that reduction of disulfide bonds in plasmin, via a reductase secreted by HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells or Chinese hamster ovary cells, triggered serine proteinase-dependent angiostatin formation (10Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Likewise, the conversion of plasminogen to angiostatin by prostate carcinoma cells was dependent on urokinase and free sulfhydryl donors (11Gately S. Przemyslaw T. Stack M.S. Patrick M. Boggio L. Cundiff D.L. Schnaper H.W. Madison L. Volpert O. Bouck N. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Soff G.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4887-4890PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Cundiff D.L.

Taken together these data suggest that angiostatin may form via multiple pathways in animals with malignant neoplasia.The observation that an angiostatic fragment of plasminogen is generated in mice with Lewis lung carcinomas, raises the hypothesis that these or other angiostatic molecules may be generated under non-neoplastic settings as well. In this regard, we previously reported that autoproteolysis was a mechanism by which plasmin activity on the surface of macrophages is regulated in vitro (13Falcone D.J. Borth W. McCaffrey T.A. Mathew J. McAdam K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32660-32666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation with plasmin, THP-1 macrophage membrane-bound plasmin activity fell 80% over a 24-h period, despite the presence of enzymatically active plasmin in the incubation media (13Falcone D.J. Borth W. McCaffrey T.A. Mathew J. McAdam K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32660-32666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of THP-1 macrophages with either 125I-plasminogen or125I-plasmin resulted in the accumulation of several degradative fragments in their conditioned media. The smaller plasmin fragments (<36 kDa) were enzymatically active but lacked cell-binding activity. Following their release from the macrophage surface, they were rapidly inactivated in the fluid-phase. The larger plasmin fragment (∼48 kDa) appeared to be enzymatically inactive and bound to cells in a lysine-dependent manner.In studies reported here, we have isolated inactive lysine-binding fragments of plasmin from cultures of murine RAW264.7 and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. These kringle-containing fragments are byproducts of the regulation of membrane-bound plasmin activity. They contain the entire sequence of angiostatin and inhibit bFGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. The loss of membrane-bound plasmin activity and subsequent formation of angiostatin-like fragments were unaffected by inhibitors of metalloproteinase activity. Similar angiostatin-like plasmin fragments were recovered from the peritoneal cavities of mice following thioglycollate-induced inflammation. This is the first demonstration that angiostatin forms in vivo in the absence of neoplasia. Thus, the activation of plasminogen on macrophage surface initiates plasmin proteolysis, which releases catalytically active fragments from the cell surface and generates inactive fragments with angiostatic properties.DISCUSSIONThe observation that angiostatin is generated in mice with Lewis lung carcinoma (5O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3150) Google Scholar) suggested that similar angiostatic fragments of plasminogen may form under non-neoplastic settings in which angiogenesis is commonly observed. In studies reported here, angiostatin-like plasmin fragments were recovered from the peritoneal cavities of mice following thioglycollate-induced inflammation. This is the first in vivo demonstration that angiostatin forms in mice in the absence of neoplasia.The mechanism by which angiostatin-like plasmin fragments form was studied in vitro. We previously reported that proteolysis of membrane-bound plasmin was a mechanism by which macrophages localize and regulate pericellular plasmin activity. A byproduct of this regulatory mechanism was the generation of an inactive plasmin fragment, which was bound to the cell surface and found in the fluid-phase (13Falcone D.J. Borth W. McCaffrey T.A. Mathew J. McAdam K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32660-32666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing affinity chromatography, we have isolated lysine binding plasmin fragments from cultures of RAW264.7 macrophages and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. The plasmin fragments are enzymatically inactive, contain kringles 1–4, and inhibit bFGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. Thus, in addition to regulating pericellular plasmin activity, proteolysis of membrane-bound plasmin generates inactive kringle-containing fragments expressing angiostatic properties.The proteolysis of membrane-bound plasmin is either autoproteolytic or plasmin activates metalloproteinases, which are responsible for plasmin proteolysis. Supporting the later hypothesis are the observations that cleavage of plasminogen by several metalloproteinases has been identified as a mechanism for the formation of angiostatin (7Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 8Lijnen H.R. Ugwu F. Bini A. Collen D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4699-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 9Patterson B.C. Sang Q.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28823-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, incubation of RAW264.7 macrophages with plasminogen and inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and EDTA) did not effect the loss of membrane-bound plasmin activity or plasmin fragmentation. Consistent with these data is the observation that proteolysis of membrane-bound plasmin was not observed when macrophages were incubated with active site-inhibited plasmin (13Falcone D.J. Borth W. McCaffrey T.A. Mathew J. McAdam K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32660-32666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, we conclude that autoproteolysis of plasmin is responsible for the generation of angiostatin-like fragments.The ability of angiostatin to block tumor angiogenesis may be because of its anti-proliferative effect on endothelial cells (5O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3150) Google Scholar, 6Cao Y. Ji R.W.

Both purified and recombinant angiostatin inhibit bFGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation (5O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3150) Google Scholar, 6Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinas M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29461-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The anti-proliferative property of angiostatin is also expressed by individual recombinant kringles 1, 2, and 3 (6Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinas M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29461-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Kringle 4 was not effective. Moreover, the removal of kringle 4 from angiostatin enhanced its anti-proliferative activity. These data suggest that the anti-proliferative activity of angiostatin can be shared by similar but non-identical kringle-containing plasmin fragments. Supporting this conclusion is the observation that lysine-binding plasmin fragments isolated from macrophage-conditioned media, which are larger (42–50 kDa) than angiostatin, inhibited bFGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. The observed inhibition between experiments was variable, but the macrophage-derived plasmin fragments were as effective as a fragment of plasmin containing kringle 1–3. Recently, the antiproliferative activity of angiostatin has been reported to be because of increased apoptosis ((20). Whether the decrease in endothelial cell number induced by macrophage-derived angiostatin fragments is because of increased apoptosis or decreased cell division is the subject of ongoing studies.These studies have not addressed what significance, if any, the generation of plasmin fragments by macrophages might have on angiogenesis in non-neoplastic settings. However, macrophages are a prominent cellular component of chronic inflammation and are often associated with wound healing. Macrophages are capable of expressing a variety of angiogenic and angiostatic factors (21Sunderkotter C. Steinbrink K. Goebeler M. Bhardwaj R. Song C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 410-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Recent experiments utilizing mice deficient in plasminogen have verified the important role of plasminogen activation in the ability of macrophages to migrate to sites of injury and inflammation, and their removal of necrotic debris and fibrin (22Romer J.

In studies reported here, we have demonstrated that macrophages produce angiostatin-like plasmin fragments as a byproduct of proteolysis of membrane-bound plasminin vitro. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that angiostatin-like plasmin fragments are generated in a non-neoplastic inflammatory setting in vivo. Thus, proteolysis of membrane-bound plasmin may contribute to the regulation of angiogenesis observed in chronic inflammation and wound healing. Angiostatin, a 38-kDa internal fragment of plasminogen, is a potent inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and the growth of metastatic foci in mice (1O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C.

In addition, recombinant angiostatin inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and the growth of several diverse carcinomas in mice (3Sim S.K. O'Reilly M.S. Liang H. Fortier A.H. He W. Madsen J.W.

The inhibitory effect of angiostatin on growth factor-induced endothelial cell proliferation appears to be expressed by recombinant kringles 1, 3 and, to a lesser extent, 2 (6Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinas M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29461-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The mechanism of formation of angiostatin in mice with tumor burden is not completely understood at this time. It was recently reported that macrophages recruited to Lewis lung carcinomas were responsible for the formation of angiostatin via their expression of metalloelastase (MMP-12) (7Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Macrophage expression of MMP-12 is induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor secreted by the carcinoma cells (7Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the carcinoma cells and host macrophages cooperate in the generation of angiostatin. Supporting the role of metalloproteinases in the generation of angiostatin is the observation that stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), matrilysin (MMP-7), and type IV collagenase (MMP-9) proteolyzed plasminogen to generate angiostatin fragments in a cell free system (8Lijnen H.R. Ugwu F. Bini A. Collen D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4699-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 9Patterson B.C. Sang Q.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28823-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been reported that reduction of disulfide bonds in plasmin, via a reductase secreted by HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells or Chinese hamster ovary cells, triggered serine proteinase-dependent angiostatin formation (10Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Likewise, the conversion of plasminogen to angiostatin by prostate carcinoma cells was dependent on urokinase and free sulfhydryl donors (11Gately S. Przemyslaw T. Stack M.S. Patrick M. Boggio L. Cundiff D.L. Schnaper H.W. Madison L. Volpert O. Bouck N. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Soff G.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4887-4890PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Cundiff D.L. Grella D. Castellino F.J. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Lee F. Kramer R.A. Volpert O. Bouck N. Soff G.A. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest that angiostatin may form via multiple pathways in animals with malignant neoplasia. The observation that an angiostatic fragment of plasminogen is generated in mice with Lewis lung carcinomas, raises the hypothesis that these or other angiostatic molecules may be generated under non-neoplastic settings as well. In this regard, we previously reported that autoproteolysis was a mechanism by which plasmin activity on the surface of macrophages is regulated in vitro (13Falcone D.J. Borth W. McCaffrey T.A. Mathew J. McAdam K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32660-32666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation with plasmin, THP-1 macrophage membrane-bound plasmin activity fell 80% over a 24-h period, despite the presence of enzymatically active plasmin in the incubation media (13Falcone D.J. Borth W. McCaffrey T.A. Mathew J. McAdam K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32660-32666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of THP-1 macrophages with either 125I-plasminogen or125I-plasmin resulted in the accumulation of several degradative fragments in their conditioned media. The smaller plasmin fragments (<36 kDa) were enzymatically active but lacked cell-binding activity. Following their release from the macrophage surface, they were rapidly inactivated in the fluid-phase. The larger plasmin fragment (∼48 kDa) appeared to be enzymatically inactive and bound to cells in a lysine-dependent manner. In studies reported here, we have isolated inactive lysine-binding fragments of plasmin from cultures of murine RAW264.7 and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. These kringle-containing fragments are byproducts of the regulation of membrane-bound plasmin activity. They contain the entire sequence of angiostatin and inhibit bFGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. The loss of membrane-bound plasmin activity and subsequent formation of angiostatin-like fragments were unaffected by inhibitors of metalloproteinase activity. Similar angiostatin-like plasmin fragments were recovered from the peritoneal cavities of mice following thioglycollate-induced inflammation. This is the first demonstration that angiostatin forms in vivo in the absence of neoplasia. Thus, the activation of plasminogen on macrophage surface initiates plasmin proteolysis, which releases catalytically active fragments from the cell surface and generates inactive fragments with angiostatic properties. DISCUSSIONThe observation that angiostatin is generated in mice with Lewis lung carcinoma (5O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3150) Google Scholar) suggested that similar angiostatic fragments of plasminogen may form under non-neoplastic settings in which angiogenesis is commonly observed. In studies reported here, angiostatin-like plasmin fragments were recovered from the peritoneal cavities of mice following thioglycollate-induced inflammation. This is the first in vivo demonstration that angiostatin forms in mice in the absence of neoplasia.The mechanism by which angiostatin-like plasmin fragments form was studied in vitro. We previously reported that proteolysis of membrane-bound plasmin was a mechanism by which macrophages localize and regulate pericellular plasmin activity. A byproduct of this regulatory mechanism was the generation of an inactive plasmin fragment, which was bound to the cell surface and found in the fluid-phase (13Falcone D.J. Borth W. McCaffrey T.A. Mathew J. McAdam K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32660-32666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing affinity chromatography, we have isolated lysine binding plasmin fragments from cultures of RAW264.7 macrophages and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. The plasmin fragments are enzymatically inactive, contain kringles 1–4, and inhibit bFGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. Thus, in addition to regulating pericellular plasmin activity, proteolysis of membrane-bound plasmin generates inactive kringle-containing fragments expressing angiostatic properties.The proteolysis of membrane-bound plasmin is either autoproteolytic or plasmin activates metalloproteinases, which are responsible for plasmin proteolysis. Supporting the later hypothesis are the observations that cleavage of plasminogen by several metalloproteinases has been identified as a mechanism for the formation of angiostatin (7Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 8Lijnen H.R. Ugwu F. Bini A. Collen D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4699-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 9Patterson B.C. Sang Q.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28823-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, incubation of RAW264.7 macrophages with plasminogen and inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and EDTA) did not effect the loss of membrane-bound plasmin activity or plasmin fragmentation. Consistent with these data is the observation that proteolysis of membrane-bound plasmin was not observed when macrophages were incubated with active site-inhibited plasmin (13Falcone D.J. Borth W. McCaffrey T.A. Mathew J. McAdam K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32660-32666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, we conclude that autoproteolysis of plasmin is responsible for the generation of angiostatin-like fragments.The ability of angiostatin to block tumor angiogenesis may be because of its anti-proliferative effect on endothelial cells (5O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3150) Google Scholar, 6Cao Y. Ji R.W.

Both purified and recombinant angiostatin inhibit bFGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation (5O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H.

The anti-proliferative property of angiostatin is also expressed by individual recombinant kringles 1, 2, and 3 (6Cao Y. Ji R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinas M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29461-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Kringle 4 was not effective. Moreover, the removal of kringle 4 from angiostatin enhanced its anti-proliferative activity. These data suggest that the anti-proliferative activity of angiostatin can be shared by similar but non-identical kringle-containing plasmin fragments. Supporting this conclusion is the observation that lysine-binding plasmin fragments isolated from macrophage-conditioned media, which are larger (42–50 kDa) than angiostatin, inhibited bFGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. The observed inhibition between experiments was variable, but the macrophage-derived plasmin fragments were as effective as a fragment of plasmin containing kringle 1–3. Recently, the antiproliferative activity of angiostatin has been reported to be because of increased apoptosis ((20). Whether the decrease in endothelial cell number induced by macrophage-derived angiostatin fragments is because of increased apoptosis or decreased cell division is the subject of ongoing studies.These studies have not addressed what significance, if any, the generation of plasmin fragments by macrophages might have on angiogenesis in non-neoplastic settings. However, macrophages are a prominent cellular component of chronic inflammation and are often associated with wound healing. Macrophages are capable of expressing a variety of angiogenic and angiostatic factors (21Sunderkotter C. Steinbrink K. Goebeler M. Bhardwaj R. Song C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 410-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Recent experiments utilizing mice deficient in plasminogen have verified the important role of plasminogen activation in the ability of macrophages to migrate to sites of injury and inflammation, and their removal of necrotic debris and fibrin (22Romer J.

https://openalex.org/W1986926515,"The RecA protein of Escherichia coliis a prototype of the RecA/Rad51 family of proteins that exist in virtually all the organisms. In a process called DNA synapsis, RecA first polymerizes onto a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule; the resulting RecA-ssDNA complex then searches for and binds to a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule containing the almost identical, or “homologous,” sequence. The RecA-ssDNA complex thus can be envisioned as a sequence-specific binding entity. How does the complex search for its target buried within nonspecific sequences? One possible mechanism is the sliding mechanism, in which the complex first binds to a dsDNA molecule nonspecifically and then linearly diffuses, or slides, along the dsDNA. To understand the mechanism of homology search by RecA, this sliding model was tested. A plasmid containing four homologous targets in tandem was constructed and used as the dsDNA substrate in the synapsis reaction. If the sliding is the predominant search mode, the two outermost targets should act as more efficient targets than the inner targets. No such positional preference was observed, indicating that a long range sliding of the RecA-ssDNA complex does not occur. These and other available data can be adequately explained by a simple three-dimensional random collision mechanism.

An early phase of homologous recombination involves a reaction by which two DNA molecules with almost identical, or “homologous,” sequences are aligned and the strands are exchanged between them. This reaction is called the “DNA strand exchange reaction.” The RecA protein of Escherichia coli is a catalyst of this reaction.RecA is a member of the RecA/Rad51 family of proteins, which are ubiquitous among organisms, including humans (1Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Matsuda Y. Ushio N. Ikeo K. Ogawa T. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 2Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Yamamoto A. Matsushiro A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These proteins are generally thought to catalyze recombination. A different perspective also exists in which these proteins are regarded as the enzymes primarily designed to repair damaged DNA by recombination (3Cox M.M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Roca A. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, it is interesting to note that a human RecA homologue appears to be interacting with proteins involved in oncogenesis, including the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins (5Scully R. Chen J.

It is not yet clear what exactly those eukaryotic RecA homologues (Rad51 proteins) do in vivo. However, at least in vitro, they can catalyze the DNA strand exchange reaction in a manner reminiscent of the E. coli RecA (7Baumann P. Benson F.E. West S.C.

The reaction can be carried out in vitro using only defined components: a homologous pair of dsDNA and ssDNA molecules, RecA, Mg2+, and ATP, as essential components (for reviews, see (4Roca A. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kowalczykowski S. Eggleston A. Annu. Rev.

The reaction produces a pair of DNA products: a hybrid-duplex molecule, which comprises the original ssDNA and the complementary strand in the original dsDNA, and a displaced strand from the original dsDNA. The molecular mechanism of how this reaction works, however, is not well understood, and many important questions remain unanswered.The strand exchange reaction initiates with polymerization of RecA molecules onto the ssDNA substrate in the presence of ATP. The resulting filamentous RecA-ssDNA complex is called the presynaptic complex (PSC) and acts as a central intermediate (11Flory J. Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Azhderian E. Gonda D.K. Radding C.M. Flory J. Chase J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). RecA has at least two DNA binding sites (13Kubista M. Takahashi M. Norden B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18891-18897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Müller B. Koller T. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Takahashi M. Kubista M. Norden B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The primary site is occupied by the ssDNA in the PSC. Using the unoccupied secondary site, the PSC searches for and eventually binds to a homologous sequence in the dsDNA substrate very stably. This binding, or “synapsis” of the dsDNA and ssDNA molecules, gives rise to another nucleoprotein filament called the stable synaptic complex (SSC), which involves all three DNA strands. Finally, in the presence of ATP hydrolysis, the synapsis step is followed by the release of a displaced strand from the SSC. Because at least one role of ATP hydrolysis is to release the strand exchange product(s) (16Menetski J.P. Bear D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 17Rosselli W. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the SSC accumulates in the presence of practically nonhydrolyzable ATPγS. In this paper, the term “DNA synapsis” is operational and refers to the reaction to form the SSC by using ATPγS.As a first approximation, the DNA synapsis reaction can be viewed as a binding reaction between a large “sequence-specific” binding entity (i.e. PSC) and its target (homologous sequence). Just like any other sequence-specific binding proteins, the PSC must find its target among vast arrays of nonspecific sequences and must do so within a time scale that biology of cells demands. How does the PSC do this? The initial contact between the complex and a dsDNA molecule must necessarily be nonhomologous. After this nonproductive contact, the PSC might fall off from the dsDNA molecule and start over another round of random search. Alternatively, the PSC might sample the next potential target without leaving the dsDNA molecule to which it is already bound. In the latter scenario, the initial nonspecific PSC-dsDNA complex is not an abortive complex destined to fall apart but instead acts as an essential intermediate in homology search.Berg et al. (18Berg O.G. Winter R.B. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6929-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) have rigorously discussed the two-step binding mechanism, in which nonspecifically bound complexes act as intermediates (see also Ref. 19Berg O.G. von Hippel P.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 14: 131-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Only those aspects directly relevant to this article are summarized here. Compared with the one-step search mechanism, which relies only on the three-dimensional random collision, the two-step mechanism could make the search more efficient by accelerating the diffusion of reactants. One such mechanism is called the “sliding” mechanism (20Richter P.H. Eigen M. Biophys. Chem. 1974; 2: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In this model, a protein first binds to a DNA molecule nonspecifically and then diffuses linearly, or “slides,” along the contour of the DNA molecule. It is crucial to recognize that the sliding is a one-dimensional random walk, not a unidirectional movement at the expense of external energy. Thus, at any point along the DNA, probabilities for a sliding protein to move to the left and right are in principle equal and not dependent on the prior movement. Sliding could accelerate diffusion of a protein, because it circumvents the activation energy involved in dissociation-reassociation with DNA. Also, the sliding in effect expands the size of a target to a distance that a protein “scans” during sliding. Note that diffusion such as sliding progresses in proportion to not the time but the square root of the time (e.g. it takes 4 times more time to diffuse twice as far). Therefore, the kinetic gain by sliding tends to diminish as the diffusing distance becomes longer.For at least some sequence-specific binding proteins, several lines of evidence support the involvement of sliding during target location. These examples include, but are not limited to, the Lac repressor (21Ruusala T. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4903-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Winter R.B. Berg O.G. von Hippel P.H.

Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and E. coli RNA polymerase (26Kabata H. Kurosawa O. Arai I. Washizu M. Margarson S.A. Glass R.E. Shimamoto N. Science. 1993; 262: 1561-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 27Ricchetti M. Metzger W. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4610-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Might the sliding also be involved in the homology search by RecA? Attempts to address this problem in the mid-1980s produced mixed results (28Gonda D.K. Radding C.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 647-654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Gonda D.K. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13087-13096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Julin D.A. Riddles P.W. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1025-1030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, no further systematic attempts have been made to date. This article describes the results of simple functional assays that should signal the existence of sliding if this is a predominant mechanism for homology search.DISCUSSIONThe main conclusion of this study is that, during a search of homology, sliding of the PSC along a dsDNA molecule does not occur to any significant extent. Because of the way experiments were set up, “significant extent” here means a few hundred bp or longer. This conclusion is based on the finding that four homologous targets placed in tandem in the test substrate (pKN106 DNA) acted as equally efficient targets in the synapsis reaction. In addition, removal of either of the two flanking sequences did not reduce the target efficiency of the homologous sequence that used to be connected to the removed flanking sequence.The Sliding of the EcoRI NucleaseThe lack of sliding of the PSC is further supported by the finding that the same experimental system can signal the existence of sliding of the EcoRI nuclease, an enzyme that had been shown to slide along DNA (24Jack W.E. Terry B.J. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4010-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At a low salt condition, EcoRI cleaved the pKN106 DNA preferentially at the two outermost targets, and this preferential cleavage disappeared at a high salt condition where the sliding distance is expected to become negligible.The sliding distance of EcoRI has been reported to be at least several hundred bp under a catalytic condition (25Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or even ∼1,300 bp under a noncatalytic condition (24Jack W.E. Terry B.J. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4010-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Considering these distances, the level of preferential cleavage observed in this study (∼40%) might appear too small. A possible interpretation of this level of preference might be that the average sliding distance is just ∼150 bp (∼106 bp × 1.4). However, Terry et al.(25Terry B.J. Jack W.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13130-13137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the EcoRI can cut the DNA “processively”; i.e. after cutting one site, the nuclease may proceed to cut a nearby site located in ciswithout leaving the DNA. The idea of processive cleavage can indeed explain why the partial digestion of the pKN106 DNA still predominantly produced the bands of complete cleavage (L1 and R4; see Fig. 3). A possible sliding distance mentioned above (∼150 bp) is based on the intensities of two particular bands, R1 and L4, relative to R2 and -3 and L2 and -3, respectively. If the cleavage by EcoRI was very processive, however, it must have greatly reduced the relative intensities of R1 and L4, because the production of these bands strictly requires the DNA to be cut only once (see Fig. 2). Therefore, the ∼150-bp estimate most probably represents just the lowest end of possible sliding distance of EcoRI.Nonideal Behavior of the DNA Synapsis ReactionTo analyze a complex reaction such as DNA synapsis, it is important to consider what is not being measured: the side reactions that are most likely occurring simultaneously with the “real” reaction. In the synapsis reaction, these side reactions may include any combination of the following: self-aggregation of RecA (39Brenner S.L. Zlotnick A. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 40Morrical S.W. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), binding of free RecA to dsDNA (38Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1326-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), side-by-side bundle formation of RecA-DNA filaments (41Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 329-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the synapsis at pseudohomologous sites. These side reactions are probably irreversible in the presence of ATPγS and result in the inhibition of the synapsis reaction by effectively taking away the reactants (RecA and DNA).The existence of side reactions at least partly explains why the extent of synapsis is usually much lower than what is expected to be at equilibrium; i.e. because the “off” rate of the SSC is negligible, the extent of synapsis in principle should reach near 100%. In reality, it reaches usually only up to ∼50% with respect to the dsDNA substrate, even when there are twice as many ssDNA molecules as dsDNA substrates (for example, see Ref. 42Adzuma K. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1679-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the extent of synapsis appears to be controlled kinetically,i.e. determined primarily by how quickly the “real” reaction occurs relative to “unwanted” reactions. Under these conditions, the reaction outcome becomes very sensitive to initial conditions, since even a slight change of condition would affect not just the equilibrium but also the partition of reactants among competing reactions. Consequently, a condition that decreases the rate of synapsis tends to decrease its extent as well rather than simply result in a longer time to reach the same extent, because more reactants participate in side reactions in this case. For the same reason, “stimulation” of the DNA synapsis can be achieved by counteracting the inhibitory effects of “unwanted” reactions, although the biological significance of such stimulation should be interpreted carefully.Rationale for Experimental DesignA traditional method for testing the sliding model is to embed a target in nonspecific DNA molecules of various lengths and then measure the rates of binding with these DNA molecules. If the sliding is operative, binding to the DNA molecules whose lengths are significantly shorter than the sliding distance should be slower than the binding to longer DNA molecules (20Richter P.H. Eigen M. Biophys. Chem. 1974; 2: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This strategy can be straightforward so long as one is measuring the rate of a simple binding reaction. However, the situation becomes complicated if the rate being measured is a composite of the initial association rate (on rate) and the rates of various first-order steps (such as a chemical step) that follow it. In this case, one must set up the experiment so that the measured rate becomes proportional to the on rate; otherwise, the results could become misleading. For example, when a later step was limiting the measured rate, effects of sliding would be masked. A problem, however, is that it is not easy to determine where the rate-limiting step is in a complex reaction. Moreover, in the synapsis reaction, interference from side reactions has made it difficult for us to obtain the kinetic data whose quality warrants vigorous postmeasurement analyses needed for the determination of rate-limiting step(s).The experimental strategy used in this study was a compromise. The strategy was originally inspired by related studies on the E. coli RNA polymerase (27Ricchetti M. Metzger W. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4610-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the Lac repressor (21Ruusala T. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4903-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and aims at deducing a qualitative conclusion as to the existence of sliding. The principle of the experiment is straightforward; first let four potential targets arrayed in tandem compete for a single PSC molecule, and then record which target won and by what degree. Since the experiment focuses on relative efficiencies of the targets present in the same test tube, interference from side reactions should not be a crucial problem.What is crucial, however, is to ensure that any potential change of the on rates would show up as the corresponding difference in target occupancy, which is what experiments measure. To achieve this correlation, the reaction was set up so that the fractional occupancy was far below saturation when the reaction reached a plateau. The SSC detected under these conditions should correspond to essentially the first and only SSC formed on that dsDNA molecule. The DNA synapsis is a practically irreversible reaction in the presence of ATPγS, with the half-life of SSC being at least 8 h. 2K. Adzuma, unpublished observation. Also see Refs. 43Baliga R.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13098-13108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar for similar observations. Therefore, as long as the assumption of irreversibility is valid, the fractional occupancy at each target should faithfully reflect the frequency with which each target is captured by the PSC. This frequency in turn should be proportional to the bimolecular association rate constant between the PSC and each target.Might the PSC Pass through a Homologous Target?In the foregoing arguments, a possibility that the PSC might somehow pass through a homologous target has been set aside. It was assumed that the PSC would become the SSC at the first target it encountered. If this assumption is valid, then the even distribution of the SSC seen in Fig. 5 speaks against the sliding model. However, if the PSC can “overlook” a homology, the same data might still be consistent with the sliding model. In this case, the PSC might pass through a homologous target(s) to become equilibrated among all of the targets.To explore this issue more quantitatively, a computer simulation was carried out to ask the following question. Let us assume that the PSC actually slides and that the even distribution of the SSC is a result of the PSC having passed through the targets. How frequently does the PSC need to overlook a homology in order for the SSC to become more or less equally distributed among the targets? It turned out that the PSC must overlook a homology most of the time it encounters a homologous target. An example is shown in Fig. 8. Here the sliding distance was set to be 400 bp. Under this condition, the probability for overlooking a homology needs to be as high as ∼99% to produce a more or less even distribution of the SSC (Fig. 8,filled bars). The probability of 90% is clearly not enough to produce an even distribution (stippled bars). These results may seem strange, but they are a consequence of the fact that a sliding particle tends to go over the same point back and forth many times before it wanders away for good. Because of this redundancy, overlooking a homology, for example just 50% of the time, would not significantly affect the efficiency of target capture.In brief, if the sliding were to be involved in homology search at all, the test of homology during sliding would have to be very “sporadic,” such as only once during ∼100 or more sliding steps. Otherwise, there would be little chance for the PSC to pass through the target it meets first. Since the PSC must recognize a homology in the first place, a very high level of overlooking a homology poses a paradox and thus seems counterintuitive. Nevertheless, the question of how frequently the PSC might overlook a homology requires further study to answer definitively. In the case of the EcoRI nuclease, however, the enzyme appears to be acting on the site it encounters first during sliding (34Jeltsch A. Alves J. Wolfes H. Maass G. Pingoud A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10215-10219Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Is Homology Search Facilitated?Is it necessary to consider a facilitated diffusion mechanism other than sliding, such as “intersegmental transfer” (for a review, see Ref. 18Berg O.G. Winter R.B. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6929-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar), in the DNA synapsis reaction? Alternatively, can a simple random collision mechanism explain the available data at least for the time being? To answer this question, one must look at the rate of synapsis and compare this to the theoretical upper limit of association rate based entirely on a three-dimensional collision. If the actual rate exceeds this theoretical limit, the existence of some kind of facilitated mechanism can be inferred.Using a restriction enzyme protection assay, Yancey-Wrona and Camerini-Otero (46Yancey-Wrona J.E. Camerini-Otero R.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) measured the association rate constant of the synapsis reaction between a 27-mer oligonucleotide coated with RecA and the homologous dsDNA molecule. With a long (∼2,700-bp) plasmid DNA as the dsDNA target, the authors found the rate constant to be on the order of 103 to 104m−1 s−1. The rate constants of these magnitudes are too small to be considered diffusion-limited. One can estimate the upper limit of a bimolecular association rate constant using the so-called Smoluchowski's equation (for an example of such a calculation, see Ref. 47von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the condition used by Yancey-Wrona and Camerini-Otero (46Yancey-Wrona J.E. Camerini-Otero R.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), our crude estimate for the upper limit would be on the order of 107m−1s−1 (parameters used are 5 × 10−7cm2 s−1 for diffusion constant of the 27-mer PSC; 80 Å for interaction radius; we also assumed that only 1% of the total collision would be productive). This estimate, although very crude, is still 3–4 orders of magnitude larger than the value reported by Yancey-Wrona and Camerini-Otero (46Yancey-Wrona J.E. Camerini-Otero R.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, at least when the length of homology is short (tens of bp), the speed of DNA synapsis appears to be much slower than the diffusion limit. In other words, there seems to be no need to invoke facilitated diffusion to explain the available kinetic data, at least for the time being.In what is so far the most vigorous quantitative study using the fluorescence energy transfer technique, Bazemore et al. (48Bazemore L.R. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14672-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) analyzed the real-time kinetics of the synapsis between an 83-mer oligonucleotide coated with RecA and the homologous 83-bp dsDNA molecule. Because the target dsDNA is short and carries no flanking sequences, no significant one-dimensional diffusion should take place under these conditions. The association rate constant obtained, 1 × 106m−1 s−1, is about 2 orders of magnitude larger than that reported by Yancey-Wrona and Camerini-Otero (46Yancey-Wrona J.E. Camerini-Otero R.D. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Still, the diffusion limit of the system used by Bazemore et al. (48Bazemore L.R. Takahashi M. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14672-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) can be crudely estimated to be on the order of 107 to 108m−1 s−1, depending on what kind of shape we assume for the diffusing particles (see Ref. 49Lapham J. Rife J.P. Moore P.B. Crothers D.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar for different equations to calculate diffusion constants; we also assumed that only 1% of the collision is productive). Thus, it appears that the DNA synapsis reaction is fundamentally a slow binding reaction.In general, the simplest model consistent with a slow second-order kinetics is to assume some kind of two-step mechanism involving a rapid equilibrium such as, A+B ↔Ks AB →k C SCHEME I A ↔Ks A*,A*+B →k C SCHEME II In either scheme, the rate of the complex (C) formation will be as follows, d[C]dt=kKs[A][B](Eq. 3) where [A] and [B] are free concentrations of A and B. In terms of total concentrations, the equation will become a complicated one, unless the concentration of one reactant is much greater than that of the other. When the K s is very large compared with total concentrations of A and B, however, the concentration of AB (Scheme I) or A* (Scheme II) becomes negligible, and free concentrations of A and B can approximate their total concentrations. Only under these conditions, the overall rate will exhibit a pseudo-second-order kinetics with the k/K s as the apparent association rate constant, which can be smaller than the real association rate constant. Thermal annealing of two short ssDNA molecules is an example of this kind of slow second-order reaction (50Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R.

We expressed CBFβ-SMMHC from the zinc-responsive MT promoter in 32D cl3 myeloid and Ba/F3 B-lymphoid cells (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Induction of CBFβ-SMMHC resulted in decreased CBF DNA binding and slowed proliferation during G1 phase. The differentiation of 32D cl3 cells in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was unaffected. We proposed that initial genetic alterations occur during leukemogenesis that bypass the growth inhibitory effect of CBFβ-SMMHC, potentiating inhibition of differentiation. We have now expressed several CBFβ-SMMHC mutants in Ba/F3 cells. Amino acids 1–165 of the 182-amino acid CBFβ protein are present in the majority of CBFβ-SMMHC fusion proteins, although a variant containing only residues 1–133 is present in rare patients (31Shurtleff S.A. Meyers S. Hiebert S.W. Raimondi S.C. Head D.R. Willman C.L. Wolman S. Slovak M.L. Carroll A.J. Behm F. Hulshof M.G. Motroni T.A. Okuda T. Liu P. Collins F.S. Downing J.R.

Segment 1–137 is sufficient to strongly increase the affinity of CBFα subunits for DNA, whereas segment 1–133 or 1–132 does so only weakly (7Levanon D. Negreanu V. Bernstein Y. Bar-Am I. Avivi L.

Also, deletion of amino acids 1–10, 2–11, 56–94, or 95–133 disrupts binding to CBFα in vitro (16Adya, N., Stacy, T., Speck, N. A., and Liu, P. P. (1998)Mol. Cell.

In addition, CBFβ-(1–141) rescues hematopoiesis in embryonic stem cells lacking CBFβ (34Miller J.D. Stacy T. Bushweller J.H. Speck N.A. Blood. 1997; 90 (abstr.): 41aCrossref Google Scholar). We found that a CBFβ-SMMHC variant lacking amino acids 2–11 of the CBFβ segment did not interfere with CBF DNA binding or slow cell proliferation, whereas a variant lacking CBFβ amino acids 142–165 did. The tail domain of SMMHC is α-helical and consists of multiple, related 28-amino acid regions. One face of the helix is hydrophobic, allowing dimerization, and the other face has alternating positively and negatively charged zones and allows multimerization, which occurs with a 98-amino acid (3.5 repeat) stagger. In addition, SMMHC has a non-helical C terminus required for optimal multimerization (35Hodge T.P. Cross R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Human SMMHC has two isoforms (SMMHC204 and SMMHC200) that differ in the lengths of their non-helical C termini as a result of alternative splicing (36Nagai R. Kuro-o M. Babij P. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9734-9737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Herein we refer to CBFβ-SMMHC200 as INV and CBFβ-SMMHC204 as INVa. INVa is more abundant than INV in M4Eo AML (37Liu P.P. Wijmenga C. Hajra A. Blake T.B. Kelley C.A. Adelstein R.S. Baggf A. Rector J. Cotelingam J. Willman C.L. Collins F.S. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1996; 16: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that INV and INVa have identical effects on Ba/F3 cells. Variants of INV lacking two-thirds or all of the SMMHC segment, and so incapable of oligomerization, did not affect cell growth. Also, the SMMHC segment, in isolation or linked to CBFβ(Δ2–11), did not inhibit cell proliferation, even when directed to the nucleus. In addition, the ability of each INV mutant to inhibit CBF DNA binding and cell proliferation correlated with its ability to inhibit transactivation. Ba/F3 cells (38Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1 ng/ml murine interleukin-3 (R&D Systems). CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum. All cultures contained penicillin/streptomycin. 100 μm zinc chloride was added when indicated. Ba/F3 cells were stably transfected by electroporation as described (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Single-cell clones were isolated by limiting dilution. Viable cell numbers were determined by enumerating cells that excluded trypan blue dye using a hemocytometer. Incorporation of tritiated thymidine to assess proliferation rate was carried out as described (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of CV-1 cells and luciferase assays were carried out as described (39Britos-Bray M. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5127-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). pMTINV contains the INV cDNA in the pMTCB6 vector (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). pMTINVa was prepared by ligating the INVa cDNA into pMTCB6 similarly. INV(ΔC283), INV(βΔ2–11), CBFβ(165), and INV(β141) cDNAs were prepared by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis followed by DNA sequencing. The ΔC283 coding sequence ends with 5′-CTCAGATGAAGTGA-3′. These cDNAs were used to construct pMTINV(ΔC283), pMTINV(βΔ2–11), pMTCBFβ(165), and pMTINV(β141), respectively. pMTINVa(βΔ2–11) was constructed by ligating a C-terminalStuI-XbaI fragment from INVa into similarly digested pMTINV(βΔ2–11). pMT-NLS-INV(βΔ2–11) was constructed by ligating an oligonucleotide obtained by annealing NLS-A (5′-GATCCGCCGCCACCATGGGGCCAAAAAAGAAGAGAAAGGTAG-3′) with NLS-B (5′-AATTCTACCTTTCTCTTCTTTTTTGGCCCCATGGTGGCGGCG-3′), encoding the SV40 T-antigen nuclear localization signal, into BamHI and EcoRI polylinker sites located just upstream of the ATG initiation codon in pMTINV(βΔ2–11). The sequence just upstream of the ATG codon reads 5′-GAATTCGGGAAGATG-3′, with the EcoRI site and the ATG codon underlined. pMT-NLS-INVa(βΔ2–11) was constructed similarly. pMT-HA-SMMHC was constructed by ligating an oligonucleotide obtained by annealing HA-A (5′-CATGGTTGGATACCCCTACGACGTCCCCGACTACGCCGGAGTTGGGGATC-3′) with HA-B (5′-TCGAGATCCCCAACTCCGGCGTAGTCGGGGACGTCGTAGGGGTATCCAAC-3′), encoding an ATG initiation codon and the HA epitope, upstream of a C-terminalStuI-XbaI fragment from the INV cDNA in pMTINV. HA-SMMHC retains amino acids 142–165 of CBFβ. pJ3V-AML1-VP16 was constructed by ligating a SalI-BamHI fragment derived from pMSV-VP16 (40Triezenberg S.J. Kingsbury R.C. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 718-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), encoding the VP16 transactivating domain, downstream of the SmaI site at amino acid 216 of murine AML1B, which corresponds to amino acid 189 of human AML1B. pJ3V contains the SV40 promoter. The wild-type and mutant CBFβ-SMMHC cDNAs were ligated into pGEM/CMV. pTKLUC and p(CBF)4TKLUC have been described (29Suzow J. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2141-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Total cellular extracts were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using CBFβ antiserum as described (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Gel shift analysis and indirect immunofluorescence were carried out as described (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). cDNAs in pGEM/CMV or pBS were transcribed and translated using the TNT reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. 3 μl of each extract was then diluted to 15 μl with phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to 0.0025% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by adding glycine to 192 mm and Tris (pH 6.8) to 25 mm. Samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The variants of INV investigated herein are diagrammed in Fig. 1. INV(ΔC283) has a deletion of 283 residues from the 440-amino acid SMMHC segment. INV(βΔ2–11) and INVa(βΔ2–11) lack amino acids 2–11 of the CBFβ segment. Deletion of residues 2–11 from INV prevents heterodimerization with AML1B in vitro (16Adya, N., Stacy, T., Speck, N. A., and Liu, P. P. (1998)Mol. Cell. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). CBFβ(165) contains the 165 CBFβ residues found in INV. Additional variants are described below. To verify that the intact SMMHC domain can mediate homodimerization and to determine whether INV(ΔC283) has lost this activity, we expressed several INV variants and AML1B in reticulocyte lysates and subjected them to glutaraldehyde cross-linking (Fig. 2). INVa, INV, and INVa(βΔ2–11) contain intact SMMHC domains and dimerized efficiently. CBFβ, INV(ΔC283), and AML1B did not form dimers. Clonal Ba/F3 cell lines expressing INV(ΔC283), INV(βΔ2–11), or CBFβ(165) from the MT promoter were obtained by electroporation and G418 selection. Ba/F3 cells were chosen in lieu of 32D cl3 cells for these experiments as it had been much easier to obtain MTINV lines with Ba/F3 cells (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), perhaps because the MT promoter is leakier in 32D cl3 cells. In addition, the effects of INV on CBF DNA binding and cell cycle progression were identical in Ba/F3 and 32D cl3 cells (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The MT promoter offers the advantage over other inducible systems of higher level expression, and some leakiness is tolerable when expressing a dominant-interfering protein. Expression of these three INV variants ± zinc was assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 3 A). INV-3 cells express INV. Expression of each protein was stimulated by zinc to comparable levels. INV and INV(βΔ2–11) were detected at 69 kDa; INV(ΔC283) migrated at 35 kDa; and CBFβ(165) migrated at 18 kDa. Endogenous CBFβ was evident at 22 kDa. The effect of each of these INV variants on DNA binding by endogenous CBF was assessed by gel shift analysis using a strong CBF-binding site present in the myeloperoxidase gene (Fig. 3 B). Zinc did not affect CBF DNA binding in vector-transfected CB6 cells, but induction of INV in the INV-3 cells reduced CBF DNA binding severalfold as described (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The specificity of the observed gel shift complex was verified by competition with unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide or a mutant oligonucleotide that does not bind CBF (29Suzow J. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2141-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Induction of INV(ΔC283), INV(βΔ2–11), or CBFβ(165) did not affect DNA binding by CBF. Equivalence between paired extracts was verified by gel shift assay with a USF-binding site. We also expressed INV(β141) in two Ba/F3 lines (Fig. 4, left panel). This protein contains the minimal CBFβ domain required for strongly binding CBFα subunits and the entire SMMHC segment present in INV. Induction of INV(β141) reduced CBF DNA binding (Fig. 4, right panel). The effect of these variants on the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells was assessed by viable cell counting and by tritiated thymidine incorporation (Fig. 5). INV slowed cell proliferation as described (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas INV(ΔC283), INV(βΔ2–11), or CBFβ(165) did not. INV(β141) slowed proliferation as effectively as INV. Results are shown for days 2 and 3, as differences were less evident during day 1. These results indicate that both the CBFβ and SMMHC domains of INV are required to inhibit CBF DNA binding and cell proliferation and suggest that these activities require heterodimerization via the CBFβ domain and homodimerization via the SMMHC domain. The subcellular localization of INV(βΔ2–11) and of several other INV variants was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 6). INV was detected prominently in the nucleus of Ba/F3 cells in a speckled, rod-like pattern (upper right panel) as described (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). INV(βΔ2–11) was detected most prominently in the cytoplasm (second row), as were INV(ΔC283) and CBFβ(165) (third row). To verify that nuclear expression of the SMMHC domain does not slow cell growth, we linked the SV40 T-antigen nuclear localization signal to CBFβ(Δ2–11) in the context of both SMMHC isoforms. These proteins, NLS-INV(βΔ2–11) and NLS-INVa(βΔ2–11), were expressed from the MT promoter in Ba/F3 cells. At the same time, we prepared lines expressing INVa and HA-SMMHC. The expression of these proteins in Ba/F3 cells treated with zinc was confirmed by Western blotting with CBFβ antiserum (Fig. 7). HA-SMMHC retains 24 CBFβ residues, and so could be detected with this antiserum raised against glutathione S-transferase-CBFβ (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NLS-INV(βΔ2–11) was detected most abundantly in the nucleus (Fig. 6, lower left panel), although despite numerous attempts, we never achieved a speckled pattern similar to that detected with INV. Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions confirmed that the NLS directed greater than two-thirds of INV(βΔ2–11) to the nucleus. 3W. Cao, M. Britos-Bray, and A. D. Friedman, unpublished data. Strikingly, indirect immunofluorescence detected HA-SMMHC as large bright spots both in the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting that the CBFβ domain of INV limits the extent of its multimerization (Fig. 6, lower right panel). The ability of these INV isoforms to inhibit CBF DNA binding and to slow cell proliferation was then assessed (Fig. 7 B and Fig. 8). INVa inhibited CBF DNA binding and slowed cell proliferation as effectively as INV, whereas the two NLS-INV(βΔ2–11) variants were ineffective. HA-SMMHC did not reduce CBF DNA binding upon induction with zinc, relative to USF DNA binding, which was reduced in the zinc-containing extract, and which did not slow cell growth. These results support the conclusion that interaction with CBFα subunits is the mechanism whereby INV slows cell proliferation. To assess the affect of INV variants on transactivation, we employed a reporter containing four CBF-binding sites, derived from the myeloperoxidase gene (29Suzow J. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2141-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). An internal control was not utilized, as we observed specific inhibition of several viral promoters by INV.3 AML1B activated p(CBF)4TKLUC 6-fold, and coexpression of INV reduced this activation 3-fold, on average. However, these modest effects did not allow us to identify differences between the INV variants.3 To develop a more reliable assay, we employed a protein containing the AML1B DNA-binding domain and the VP16 transactivating domain. AML1-VP16 did not activate pTKLUC, but activated p(CBF)4TKLUC 15-fold (Fig. 9). pCMV-INV reproducibly inhibited activation 8-fold. INV(βΔ2–11), NLS-INV(βΔ2–11), and HA-SMMHC each mildly inhibited activation by AML1-VP16 (1.5-fold). Notably, these three variants each contain an intact SMMHC segment. INV(β141) strongly inhibited activation (6-fold), and INV(ΔC283) and CBFβ(165) were not inhibitory. AML1-ETO was more potent than INV, inhibiting activation 21-fold. Suppression of AML1-VP16 activation by INV and these six variants approximately paralleled their ability to inhibit cell proliferation, suggesting that inhibition of CBF transactivation is the mechanism whereby INV slows cell cycle progression. By expressing INV from the MT promoter in Ba/F3 and 32D cl3 cells, we provide evidence suggesting that lack of hematopoiesis in INV-expressing mice is due to inhibition of cell proliferation during G1 phase (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have now extended these observations by identifying the domains of INV required for inhibition of CBF DNA binding and transactivation and for inhibition of cell proliferation. Deletion of just 10 amino acids from the CBFβ segment, required for interaction with CBFα subunits, prevented each of these activities. Although the resulting protein, INV(βΔ2–11), might still interact with other cellular proteins, either via the CBFβ or SMMHC segment, these interactions were not sufficient to strongly interfere with CBF activities or to slow proliferation. Consistent with this finding, neither the CBFβ segment nor the SMMHC segment alone was active in these assays. On the other hand, deletion of CBFβ amino acids 142–165 from INV, which leaves its CBFα interaction domain intact, did not prevent its inhibition of CBF DNA binding, transactivation, or proliferation. INV was expressed most abundantly in the nucleus, whereas INV(βΔ2–11) was localized more extensively to the cytoplasm. INV has previously been shown to localize predominantly to the cytoplasm of fibroblastic cells, co-localizing with the cytoskeleton (16Adya, N., Stacy, T., Speck, N. A., and Liu, P. P. (1998)Mol. Cell. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar, 41Lu J. Maruyama M. Satake M. Bae S.-C. Ogawa E. Kagoshima H. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1651-1661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps increased nuclear expression of INV in hematopoietic cells results from their having less cytoskeletal structure and higher levels of CBFα subunits. Using Western blotting, we also detected INV predominantly in the nuclei of M4Eo patient samples (37Liu P.P. Wijmenga C. Hajra A. Blake T.B. Kelley C.A. Adelstein R.S. Baggf A. Rector J. Cotelingam J. Willman C.L. Collins F.S. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1996; 16: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and in ME-1 cells,3 which derive from an M4Eo AML (42Yanagisawa K. Horiuch T. Fujita S. Blood. 1991; 78: 451-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether expressing INV(βΔ2–11) more abundantly in the nucleus allows either its CBFβ(Δ2–11) or SMMHC segment to interact with nuclear proteins and so interfere with cell proliferation. We found that addition of a nuclear localization signal to its N terminus directed INV(βΔ2–11) to the nucleus, but did not result in reduced CBF DNA binding or cell growth rate. We expressed a construct, INV(ΔC283), lacking two-thirds of the SMMHC segment. This protein did not dimerize in vitro or interfere with CBF activities or cell proliferation in vivo. In the future, we intend to more precisely identify the regions of the SMMHC domain required for the activities of INV. Such investigations might eventually lead to the identification of relevant SMMHC-interacting proteins. Herein we demonstrate that both INV and INVa inhibit CBF activities and cell proliferation equally, indicating that their different non-helical C-terminal tails (8 or 34 amino acids) are interchangeable. Interestingly, HA-SMMHC appeared to form much larger intracellular aggregates than INV, suggesting that the CBFβ segment interferes with, but does not prevent, multimerization via the SMMHC domain. INV/CBFα heterodimers are capable of interacting with CBF-binding sites. INV inhibits activation of the myeloid NP-3 promoter by AML1B (43Westendorf J.J. Yamamoto C.M. Lenny N. Downing J.R. Selsted M.E. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 322-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that these heterodimers are not transactivating, and we reached the same conclusion using the p(CBF)4TKLUC reporter. Although this assay is artificial, our results suggest that interaction with CBFα subunits and integrity of the SMMHC segment are both required for INV to inhibit CBF-mediated transactivation. INV might inhibit CBF transactivation by sequestering AML1B into multimeric structures away from chromatin. Alternatively, INV/CBFα dimers bound to relevant genes might directly interfere with transcription. Which of these mechanisms predominates is unknown, but our recent finding that INV can redirect AML1B to the cytoplasm in NIH 3T3 cells supports the importance of the sequestration model (16Adya, N., Stacy, T., Speck, N. A., and Liu, P. P. (1998)Mol. Cell. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Phenotypic differences between M2 AML associated with t(8;21) and M4Eo AML associated with inv(16) might in part result from AML1-ETO being a more potent inhibitor of CBF transactivation than INV. AML1-ETO slowed 32D cl3 cell myeloid differentiation, whereas INV did not (14Cao W. Britos-Bray M. Claxton D.F. Kelley C.A. Speck N.A. Liu P.P. Friedman A.D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 43Westendorf J.J. Yamamoto C.M. Lenny N. Downing J.R. Selsted M.E. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell.

A. 1998; 95: 1812-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting that cell proliferation is more sensitive than differentiation to inhibition of CBF activities. In the context of additional genetic hits, inhibition of differentiation might become more evident. Also, we recently found that expression of INV or AML1-ETO in Ba/F3 cells reduces induction of p53 when the cells are treated with DNA-damaging agents (45Britos-Bray, M., Ramirez, M., Cao, W., Liu, P., Wang, X., Civin, C. I., and Friedman, A. D. (1998) Blood, in pressGoogle Scholar). This effect was not observed with cells expressing INV(βΔ2–11). Thus, inhibition of CBF activities might prevent apoptosis and encourage leukemic progression in premalignant cells. Finally, although we have demonstrated that inhibition of CBF activities accounts for inhibition of cell proliferation by CBFβ-SMMHC, interactions of the CBFβ or SMMHC segment with other proteins might contribute to transformation and to the phenotype of M4Eo AML.

The cornified envelope is a 15-nm-thick insoluble protein layer that is formed under the plasma membrane in the upper layers of epidermis and keratinizing stratified epithelium (1Reichert U. Michel S. Schmidt R. Darmon M. Blumberg M. Molecular Biology of the Skin. Academic Press Inc, San Diego1993: 107-150Google Scholar). It appears to play a major role in the physical barrier properties of the stratum corneum (2Elias P.M. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 65: 180-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Cornified envelope precursor proteins have structural roles in the stratum corneum cells, and their expression is associated with terminal differentiation. The envelope is formed from several precursor proteins by the calcium-dependent enzyme transglutaminase, which catalyzes formation of ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-links (3Polakowska R.R. Goldsmith L.A. Goldsmith L.A. Physiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the Skin. 2nd Ed. 1. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 168-201Google Scholar) that are resistant to proteolytic digestion. It has been postulated that involucrin is cross-linked at the plasma membrane as a first step in envelope assembly (4Ishida-Yamamoto A. Kartasova T. Matsuo S. Kuroki T. Iizuka H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 12-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) followed by the less abundant precursors such as SPRR proteins, elafin, envoplakin, filaggrin, keratin filaments, and cystatin-α (5Sun T.T.

Finally, loricrin covers the cytoplasmic side of the envelope (12Candi E. Melino G. Mei G. Tarcsa E. Chung S.I. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26382-226390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that multiple components are necessary for envelope structure and function and that they have different roles. For example, involucrin acts as the framework for the attachment of other envelope components and is covalently linked to the lipids, which are important components of the barrier of stratum corneum cells (13Downing D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 33: 301-313Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The SPRR/pancornulin proteins have been shown to act as molecular bridges and are able to cross-link with two different proteins (14Greco M.A. Lorand L. Lane W.S. Baden H.P. Parameswaran K.N. Kvedar J.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 204-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Loricrin is believed to form a meshlike scaffold, which is flexible as a result of its high glycine content and insoluble due to disulfide bonding and transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking to other cornified envelope components (12Candi E. Melino G. Mei G. Tarcsa E. Chung S.I. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26382-226390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Gene knockout and mutation studies have been used to gather information on the function of epidermal proteins, with the keratins being the most well known (15Fuchs E. Esteves R.A. Coulombe P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6906-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16Vassar R. Coulombe P.A. Degenstein L. Albers K. Fuchs E. Cell. 1991; 64: 365-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Only one null mutation study of an envelope-related protein has been reported, a loricrin knockout mouse (17deViragh P.A. Scharer L. Bundman D. Roop D.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 555Google Scholar). Heterozygous mice were normal, whereas homozygotes have abnormal skin during the first few days, but the animals appeared structurally normal as adults. However, the mice have a defect in barrier function and respond abnormally to the application of irritants such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. Mutations of the loricrin gene have been observed in patients with a rare autosomal dominant palmoplantar keratoderma, Vohwinkel's keratoderma (19Korge B.P. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Punter C. Dopping-Hepenstal P.J. Iizuka H. Stephenson A. Eady R.A. Munro C.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 604-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), as well as in progressive, symmetric erythrokeratoderma (20Ishida-Yamamoto A. McGrath J.A. Lam H. Iizuka H. Friedman R.A. Christiano A.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mutations in the epidermal transglutaminase gene result in the human disease lamellar ichthyosis, which is characterized by a thickened stratum corneum, disturbed epidermal keratinization, and inflammatory changes (18Huber M. Rettler I. Bernasconi K. Frenk E. Lavrijsen S.P. Ponec M. Boh A. Lautenschlager S. Schorderet D.F. Hohl D. Science. 1995; 267: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Overexpression of human loricrin in transgenic mice resulted in no detectable phenotype, even though all of the expressed protein was incorporated into the cornified envelope (21Yoneda K. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10754-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The assembly of the CE1 was not interfered with, supporting the hypothesis that loricrin is deposited very late during CE assembly. However, overexpression of human involucrin in transgenic mice did result in an abnormal epidermal phenotype (22Crish J.F. Howard J.M. Saim T.M. Murthy S. Eckert R.L. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Heterozygous mice appeared normal, although their hair stood erect. A subset of homozygous animals had reduced birth weight, a scaly epidermis, the onset of their first hair cycle was delayed by 5 days, and their hair also stood erect. Overexpression of involucrin caused abnormalities in the structure and function of the CE and hair follicles. The protein sciellin was identified in earlier studies by a monoclonal antibody generated from mice immunized with cornified envelopes purified from cultured human keratinocytes (23Baden H.P. Kubilus J. Phillips S.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 454-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kvedar J.C. Manabe M. Phillips S.B. Ross B.S. Baden H.P. Differentiation. 1992; 49: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sciellin was extracted from keratinocytes with a neutral buffer when a chaotropic agent such as urea or SDS was added, but not when non-ionic detergents were present (24Kvedar J.C. Manabe M. Phillips S.B. Ross B.S. Baden H.P. Differentiation. 1992; 49: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The protein remained in solution when a urea extract was dialyzed against a neutral buffer with 0.3 m NaCl, but precipitated when the salt was omitted. The mobility of the protein in SDS-PAGE was identical with or without a reducing agent in the lysis buffer, indicating little if any intermolecular disulfide bonding of the molecule. The protein in human keratinocytes and epidermis had a molecular weight of 82,000 and pI of about 8.0, but with charge heterogeneity. The antibody identified proteins of similar molecular weight in other animals by Western blot. The antibody stained the periphery of keratinocytes in the granular layer, and evidence was presented that the protein was a substrate for transglutaminase and cross-linked into the CE. The protein was present in stratified squamous epithelium but not simple epithelium. In the hair follicle, it was found in the upper part of the outer root sheath in the inner most layer, as well as in the periphery of cells of the inner root sheath. In the nail it was demonstrated in the nail fold, matrix, and bed (25Baden H.P. Kvedar J.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 72S-74SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Involucrin and SPRR proteins were present in the inner root sheath, but had a cytoplasmic location (23Baden H.P. Kubilus J. Phillips S.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 454-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Murphy G.F. Flynn T.C. Tice R.H. Pinkus G.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1984; 82: 453-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and loricrin was absent (27Hohl D. Ruf Olano B. deViragh P.A. Huber M. Detrisac C.J. Schnyder U.W. Roop D.R. Differentiation. 1993; 54: 25-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yoneda K. Imamura S. Lee J.H. Steinert P.M. Kim S.Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 875Google Scholar). Their distribution in the nail was limited to the matrix. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the human sciellin cDNA. The cDNA encoded a unique protein of 75.3 kDa, which is characterized by internal repeat units and a carboxyl LIM domain. A rabbit antibody prepared against a sciellin fusion protein stained the epidermis identically to the monoclonal one and identified a band of the same M r by Western blot. The gene was localized to human chromosomal band 13q22 by FISH and was closely linked to STS marker WI-457 by radiation hybrid analysis. A human foreskin keratinocyte library packaged in λ gt11 (29Gerecke D.R. Wagman D.W. Champliaud M.F. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11073-11080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was screened with a 1:50 dilution of the mAb 34D11 (23Baden H.P. Kubilus J. Phillips S.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 454-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and detected with 1:500 goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (ICN/Cappel, Aurora, OH) and chloronaphthol (Bio-Rad) according to standard protocols (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts from plaque-purified clones were amplified by PCR using primers made to the λ gt11 cloning site flanking sequence (PFO169, ACGACTCCTGGAGCCCGTCAGTAT; PFO170, ACCAACTGGTAATGGTAGCGACCG) and subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) or the EcoRI site of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Overlapping cDNA clones that further extended the sequence were generated by 5′ and 3′ RACE reactions using nested primers and the 5′ and 3′ RACE system kits (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's protocols. The nested primers used for 5′ RACE were MF79 (CTTCAGGGGTCACTTTGATGAGAT) and MF80 (ATCAAGGCTCTGGCCCCTCGTAAT). The nested primers used for 3′ RACE were MF85 (AACAATCAGAGCCAAGACTTGGAC) and MF86 (GAAACACTAATCGAGACCAGAACCTGG). cDNAs that were subcloned into pBluescript, pGEM (Promega), or pCR2.1 were sequenced using the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [33P]ddNTPs. At least two independent cDNA subclones were sequenced to rule outTaq polymerase-generated nucleotide substitutions. In some cases, PCR product bands were sequenced directly by cycle sequencing after excision from a TAE-EtBr agarose gel and purification using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The sequencing project was maintained and analyzed using the Wisconsin Package version 9.1 (Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI). Data base comparisons were made using BLAST v2.0 (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). The protein sequence was analyzed using the program PSORTII (32Horton P. Nakai K. Intelligent Systems Mol. Biol. 1997; 5: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) from human foreskin keratinocytes cultured in high calcium medium and also from postpartum human placentas, carefully dissected into amnion, chorion, villous, and non-villous layers. A total of 25 μg/lane was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and hybridized using the NorthernMax kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the enclosed protocols. [32P]dCTP-labeled probes were generated from gel-purified DNA using the Rediprime random primer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probe for the keratinocyte and placenta blot (Fig. 4 A) was generated from the EcoRI insert of cDNA clone SC4. The probe for the 4.4-kb sciellin message was generated by 3′ RACE from clone 86A using primer MF175 (GCAAGCGGGTGATAGTATTTGGAT). Human Normal Tissue Blots I and II (Northern Territory total RNA blots; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were hybridized with a [32P]UTP-labeled antisense RNA probe made from pPO325 (sciellin cDNA nucleotides 830–2310 subcloned into pBluescript II KS+) using the RNA transcription kit (Stratagene). The blots were hybridized and washed under stringent conditions using the NorthernMax buffer system (Ambion), according to the supplied protocols. Sciellin cDNA, corresponding to cDNA clone SC4 (Fig. 1), nucleotides 1120–1736, was amplified by RT-PCR from human differentiated keratinocyte RNA using adaptor primers PFO237 (GTTCCATATGGAAAATACCACTGGAAAAAAAGAC) and PFO238 (TCCCGCGGTTACTTGGCTCCAGTGTTAGAGCT) and subcloned into theNdeI and SacII sites of the T7 expression vector pET-15b (Novagen), which had been modified by replacement of theBamHI site with a SacII site (a gift of Manuel Koch). The resulting fusion protein construct, pPO324, was transformed into Novablue(DE3) competent cells (Novagen), and the fusion protein SC4 was expressed and purified using the His-Bind resin and His-Bind buffer system (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer's protocols. Polyclonal antiserum was raised in two rabbits by Charles River Pharmservices using 0.1 mg of SC4 fusion protein/injection. The Stanford G3 Radiation Hybrid Mapping Panel (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) was screened by PCR using two primer pairs derived from the sciellin genomic DNA sequence, MF122 (TTTGGAACCTTGGTTACTTCT) and MF124 (GGCTCTGAGACTAAAATAATGTCT), and MF79 (CTTCAGGGGTCACTTTGATGAGAT) and PFO280 (AGCGGCCAAATGGCTCTGAGAC). The G3 panel was also screened using two STS markers that were linked to Clouston's hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED), D13S141 and D13S175 (Research Genetics). These markers were ordered relative to the SHGC framework markers of the G3 RH map v2.0 using the statistical analysis program RHMAP. 2The statistical analysis program RHMAP is available via the World Wide Web (http://shgc-www.stanford.edu). Sense and antisense dig-RNA probes were transcribed from the plasmids pPOSC5 and pPOK5 using the RNA transcription kit (Stratagene) and DIG RNA labeling mix (Boehringer Mannheim). The RT-PCR amplification product of the keratin K5 mRNA from nucleotides 73–1076 (33Lersch R. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ to create pPOK5, and clone SC5 was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ to create pPOSC5. Sections (10 μm) were cut from human foreskin that had been fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and frozen in OCT compound (TissueTek, Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN). Tissue sections were hybridized overnight at 60 °C in a 50% formamide hybridization buffer. Digoxigenin was detected using anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase FAb fragments (Boehringer Mannheim) according to manufacturer's protocols. The purification of sciellin was done as follows. Human placentas were dissected to collect only the amniotic membrane. These were then frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground in a Waring blender (Waring Product Division, New Hartford, CT), and resuspended in 0.1 m citric acid monohydrate (100 ml for 50 g of tissue) containing 625 mg/liter N-ethylmaleimide and 150 mg/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was incubated at 4 °C with stirring overnight. The soluble fraction was collected following centrifugation (30,000 × g, 30 min) and precipitated by adding 0.3 m NaCl final and raising the pH to 5.0. The precipitated proteins were collected following centrifugation (30,000 × g, 30 min) and redissolved into buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8) containing 1% SDS. At this point, the solution was boiled for 5 min, then nine volumes of buffer A were added. The solution was then passed over a gelatin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by an pAb SC4 immunoaffinity column. The columns were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the elutions were done with 1 m acetic acid. Sciellin was eluted from the pAb SC4 affinity column, and the fractions were concentrated by precipitation with nine volumes of 100% ethanol. The material was then run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE, stained briefly with 0.2% Coomassie Blue, destained in 7% acetic acid, 10% methanol. The band corresponding to sciellin was excised from the gel, washed in H2O, and kept in 50% acetonitrile until sent to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. At the facility the band was incubated with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry performed on a Finnigen Lasermat 2000 (Finnigen, Hemel, UK) (34Chait B.T. Kent S.B. Science. 1992; 257: 1885-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). To obtain the NH2-terminal sequence, the material was blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) stained with Ponceau-S and the band corresponding to sciellin was sequenced on the sequenator. The following procedures were performed as described previously: SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and electrophoretic transfer of protein to nitrocellulose with immunoblot analysis (36Lunstrum G.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Morris N.P. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9042-9048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mouse monoclonal antibody to sciellin (34D11) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a sciellin fusion protein were the primary antibodies. The appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (ICN) was used as the secondary antibody in Western blots, and the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Cappel) was used for indirect immunofluorescence on 10-μm sections fixed with acetone at −20 °C for 10 min. A human foreskin keratinocyte expression library was screened with a mouse monoclonal antibody (34D11) specific for the cornified envelope precursor sciellin. Duplicating positive clones were analyzed by DNA sequencing and Northern blotting. Four positive clones had overlapping sequence, and each hybridized to two bands of 3.4 and 4.4 kb on a Northern blot of keratinocyte RNA. Because these clones had overlapping sequence that was not identified as a known sequence in GenBank and they hybridized to keratinocyte mRNAs within the expected size range, they were suspected to represent the sciellin gene. Overlapping cDNA clones that further extended the sequence were generated by 5′ and 3′ RACE reactions (Fig. 1). The complete cDNA sequence of sciellin was 2347 bp, including 86 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence and 257 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. The nucleotide sequence surrounding the AUG initiator codon fits the consensus sequence for the initiation of translation by eukaryotic ribosomes (37Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). The 2004-bp open reading frame encoded a protein with a molecular mass of 75.3 kDa, which was close to the 82 kDa previously reported (24Kvedar J.C. Manabe M. Phillips S.B. Ross B.S. Baden H.P. Differentiation. 1992; 49: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) for the protein upon Western blotting of cultured human keratinocyte extracts. The predicted isoelectric point of the unmodified protein as calculated from sequence data was 10.09. Sciellin protein was extracted from human amnion and purified for peptide sequencing on an immunoaffinity column made with polyclonal antiserum generated against the fusion protein SC4. The NH2-terminal amino acid was blocked, and sequence was obtained by mass spectrometry from two tryptic peptides. The peptide sequences SSEQGLDEHINVSPK and QPLENLQAGDSIWIYR matched perfectly with the translated cDNA sequence from residues 443–457 and 635–650 (Fig. 2). The amino acid sequence of sciellin, which was translated from the cDNA sequence, is shown in Fig. 2 and is 668 residues long. Comparison of the sciellin protein sequence with the GenBank data base using the program BLAST showed that sciellin was a unique protein. The protein was generally hydrophilic and did not contain any regions likely to form either a signal peptide or a transmembrane domain, consistent with its cytoplasmic localization by immunohistochemistry. The sciellin protein may be divided into three domains based upon secondary structure predictions such as those generated by the program Plotstructure (GCG): an amino-terminal domain, a central domain composed of repeating units, and a carboxyl domain containing a single LIM motif. Pro was evenly distributed throughout the molecule, except for an enriched “hinge” region before the first repeat unit, starting at residue 165. There were 16 inexact repeat units from residues 231 to 543, of which 12 were 20 amino acids in length. The 4th, 7th, 8th, and 10th amino acid residues in the repeats were mainly hydrophobic; the 5th, 9th, 13th, and 16th charged; and the 2nd, 9th, and 16th rich in Gln and Lys. The overall percent content of the transglutaminase target residues Gln and Lys in the repeat region of the molecule was identical to that of the remainder of the sequence. The 12th position was rich in Pro, which would allow for flexibility in the approximate center of the repeats. In plots of relative hydrophobicity, the repeats appear as alternating patterns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic stretches (Fig. 3). The hydrophobic stretches are predicted to form β structures of 5–7 residues, terminating at the Pro residue. Transglutaminase catalyzes isopeptide bond formation between the residues Gln and Lys, and ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine-cross-linked peptides have been identified from several cornified envelope proteins. The sciellin amino acid sequence was examined for the presence of previously reported transglutaminase target sequences. The repeat GQDPVK reported as a transglutaminase substrate in elaphin (8Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) and the repeats AQEPVK and GQDKVK (8Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) found to link elaphin to loricrin were not observed in sciellin. Additionally, the preferred transglutaminase sites in involucrin at Gln496 (EQQV) (38Simon M. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and at Gln465 and Lys468 in the context of QEEK (39Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) were not present in sciellin. The sequences surrounding the sites of transglutaminase cross-linking, the amine donor at Lys3 and the amine acceptor at Gln102, that were utilized in the oligomerization of the calcium-binding CE protein S100A11 were also not observed in sciellin (40Robinson N.A. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 2721-2728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 41Robinson N.A. Lapic S. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12035-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, short sequences including Lys or Gln were found several times in the repeat region of sciellin, as shown in Fig. 2. The peptide sequence LIKV was repeated seven times, NQG was found three times, and GQS was found twice. The carboxyl domain of sciellin contained a LIM motif consensus sequence (Fig. 4). The LIM domain has a characteristic arrangement of Cys and His residues, which coordinate zinc ions into structures that function as protein-binding interfaces (42Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). All nine Cys residues in sciellin were found in this carboxyl domain, starting at residue 601. These were not expected to form interchain cross-links because sciellin has the same mobility in SDS-PAGE with and without treatment with a disulfide-bond reducing agent. Comparison of the encoded protein with the PROSITE data base (43Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) revealed that sciellin has 16 potential N-glycosylation sites, 5 potential myristoylation sites, and 35 potential phosphorylation sites (including 3 cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites, 22 protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, 9 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and 1 tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site). Western blots of large two-dimensional gels of cultured keratinocyte extracts using 34D11 showed bands of 85.7 kDa (pI 8.32), 86.1 kDa (pI 8.72), 86.1 kDa (pI 8.86), and 86.2 kDa (pI 9.08). 3The Human Keratinocytes-NEPHGE Database (Danish Center for Human Genome Research) is available via the World Wide Web (http://biobase.dk/cgi-bin/celis). Post-translational phosphorylation of sciellin may explain the difference between the observed and calculated pI and M r values of the protein. Analysis of the sciellin protein sequence with the subcellular localization site prediction program PSORTII (32Horton P. Nakai K. Intelligent Systems Mol. Biol. 1997; 5: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that sciellin may be a nuclear protein, based upon the presence of four potential nuclear localization signals. However, we have never found sciellin located in the nucleus by immunological staining of keratinocyte cell cultures, which presumably contain cells in all phases of"

Mutation of several conserved residues in yeast top1 mutants is sufficient to induce cell lethality in the absence of camptothecin. Despite tremendous differences in catalytic activity, the mutant proteins Top1T722Ap and Top1R517Gp cause cell death via a mechanism similar to that of Cpt, i.e.stabilization of the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. To establish the interdomainal interactions required for the catalytic activity of Top1p and how alterations in enzyme structure contribute to the cytotoxic activity of Cpt or specific DNA topoisomerase I mutants, we initiated a genetic screen for intragenic suppressors of thetop1T722A-lethal phenotype. Nine single amino acid substitutions were defined that map to the conserved central and C-terminal domains of Top1p as well as the nonconserved linker domain of the protein.

DNA topoisomerases catalyze changes in the winding or linkage of DNA strands via a conserved mechanism of transient DNA strand cleavage and religation (reviewed in Refs. 1Bjornsti M.-A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 99-103Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar, 3Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). These enzymes play a critical role in such processes as DNA replication, transcription, and recombination. The cellular form of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I (Top1p) is a highly conserved enzyme that catalyzes the relaxation of positively and negatively supercoiled DNA. This type IB enzyme cleaves a single strand of a DNA duplex via the nucleophilic attack of the active site tyrosine hydroxyl on a phosphodiester backbone bond of the DNA. This results in the formation of a covalent phospho-tyrosyl linkage with the 3′ end of the cleaved DNA strand. The other end is presumably free to rotate around the nonscissile strand, effecting a rewinding or unwinding of the DNA. This transient enzyme-DNA intermediate is resolved by a second transesterification whereby the free 5′-hydroxyl end of the DNA attacks the phospho-tyrosyl bond to reseal the nicked DNA strand. Camptothecin (Cpt)1 is a potent antineoplastic agent that targets eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I by reversibly stabilizing the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate (reviewed in Refs. 3Froelich-Ammon S.J.

During S-phase, the collision of the advancing replication fork with these drug-stabilized cleavable complexes is thought to produce the potentially lethal double-stranded DNA breaks that lead to cell cycle arrest in G2 and eventually cell death. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the gene encoding DNA topoisomerase I,TOP1, is nonessential (reviewed in Refs. 2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar and 4Bjornsti M.-A. Knab A.M. Benedetti P. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1994; 34: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).top1Δ strains are viable as other proteins such as DNA topoisomerase II or Trf4p can compensate for the loss of Top1p function (7Goto T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2404-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, cells devoid of DNA topoisomerase I are resistant to Cpt. The cytotoxic activity of Cpt is restored when plasmid-borne yeast or human TOP1 is expressed in these cells (9Bjornsti M.-A. Benedetti P. Viglianti G.A. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6318-6323PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Together, these data establish Top1p as the cellular target of Cpt, which converts the enzyme into a poison by increasing the half-life of the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. In addition to Top1p-targeted drugs, recent studies suggest additional mechanisms of DNA topoisomerase I-mediated cytotoxicity. For example, the introduction of abasic sites or DNA mismatches at preferred sites of DNA cleavage by Top1p dramatically increases the formation of covalent complexes (11Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26441-26447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), although the cellular consequences of such DNA lesions has yet to be established in vivo. In contrast, single amino acid substitutions have been defined in DNA topoisomerase I that mimic the cytotoxic activity of Cpt, including a terminal G2-arrested phenotype and increased rates of DNA recombination (13Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12801-12808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Levin N.A. Bjornsti M.-A. Fink G.R. Genetics. 1993; 133: 799-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast Top1T722Ap, alanine is substituted for threonine 722, a highly conserved residue just N-terminal to the active site tyrosine 727, whereas in Top1R517Gp the conserved arginine 517 is mutated to glycine (13Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12801-12808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Despite tremendous differences in enzyme specific activity and Cpt sensitivity, the cytotoxicity of both mutant proteins could be attributed to an increase in the half-life of the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. Recent structural studies demonstrate a circumferential binding of DNA by DNA topoisomerase I (15Lue N. Sharma A. Mondragon A. Wang J.C.

The structures of a 26-kDa fragment of yeast Top1p and reconstituted fragments of human DNA topoisomerase I in covalent or noncovalent complexes with DNA illustrate a protein clamp that circumscribes duplex DNA (15Lue N. Sharma A. Mondragon A. Wang J.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1315-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J.

Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Based on the structures of reconstituted and truncated versions of human Top1p, a “controlled rotation” mechanism has been proposed to explain the changes in DNA strand winding catalyzed by the enzyme (18Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In this model, the rotation of the untethered end of the cleaved DNA strand around the uncleaved strand of DNA is modulated by interactions between the DNA and the charged surfaces of two sets of α-helices projecting outward from the core of the protein clamp. Vaccinia virus Top1p, also a type IB enzyme, forms a C-shaped protein clamp; although distinct differences in structure, DNA sequence specificity and Cpt sensitivity distinguish this enzyme from cellular Top1p (20Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).

Although distributed throughout the conserved central and C-terminal portions of the enzyme, they are clustered along one face of the DNA helix in the co-crystal structure of the reconstituted human enzyme with DNA (16Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The consequences of other mutations on enzyme function, including the top1R517G mutant, provide insight into residues that constitute the catalytic site of the enzyme (13Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12801-12808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, despite this wealth of biochemical and structural data, a clear picture of the domainal movements and interactions required for DNA binding and the catalytic activity of the intact enzyme remain unclear. To address this, a mutational analysis of yeast Top1T722Ap was undertaken to define intragenic suppressors that abrogate the cytotoxic activity of the mutant enzyme. All of the top1T722Aintragenic suppressors examined abolished enzyme activity. However, the detailed characterization of several mutants suggest this was mediated by a reduced affinity for DNA. The positions of the intragenic suppressors within the structure of human DNA topoisomerase I are discussed in terms of enzyme mechanism. Camptothecin (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml, and aliquots were stored at −20 °C. Yeast strains EKY3 (MAT α , ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1) and JCW28 (MAT α , ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top2-4, top1Δ) have been described (30Kauh E.A. Bjornsti M.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6299-6303Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). MBY3 is EKY3 deleted for RAD52. To accomplish this, LEU2sequences were excised with KpnI from therad52::LEU2 disruption construct, pSM20 (obtained from Dr. D. Schild, Berkeley Lawrence Laboratories). BglII linkers were ligated to the repaired DNA ends; the plasmid was cleaved with BglII and ligated to a BamHI fragment containing the HIS3 gene from plasmid YDp-H (31Sikorski R. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therad52Δ::HIS3 sequences were excised withBamHI and used for single step gene replacement. YCpGAL1-TOP1 and YCpGAL1-TOP1-L are ARS/CENvectors that contain TOP1 under the galactose-inducible pGAL1 promoter and are marked with URA3 and LEU2, respectively (22Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To simplify subcloning of top1 alleles, plasmid YCpGAL1-TOP1-L was digested withNsiI and XbaI. The ends were repaired and ligated to yield plasmid YCpGAL1-TOP1-Lx, in which the NsiI and XbaI sites in the 3′-noncoding region of TOP1were destroyed. Purification from dam- Escherichia coli reveals a methylation-sensitive XbaI site within the TOP1-coding region. Plasmids YCpGAL1-top1T722A, YCpGAL1-top1R517G, and YCpGAL1-top1Y727F have been described (13Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12801-12808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The double mutanttop1T722A,R517G was constructed by replacing the wild-type sequences in a SpeI restriction fragment from YCpGAL1-top1R517G with the corresponding mutated sequences from YCpGAL1-top1T722A. The epitope tagged construct, YCpGAL1-eTOP1 (32Hann C. Evans D.L. Fertala J. Bendetti P. Bjornsti M.-A. Hall D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8425-8433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), contains the N-terminal sequence MDYKDDDDKAIM. The underlined residues are recognized by the M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak, IBI). To introduce this epitope tag into top1mutants, a 1.0-kbp BamHI-Bsu36I DNA fragment was excised from YCpGAL1-eTOP1 and used to replace the untagged sequences in plasmids YCpGAL1-TOP1-L and YCpGAL1-top1-Lx to yield the corresponding YCpGAL1-eTOP1-L/YCpGAL1-etop1-Lx constructs. Mutations spanning the central domain of Top1p were excised withBamHI-SphI and ligated into the same sites in YCpGAL1-eTOP1-L. HIS3-marked YCpGAL1-etop1-H constructs were made by ligating the SacI-XhoI fragments from YCpGAL1-etop1-L(x) into the same sites in plasmid pRS413 (31Sikorski R. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the top1 alleles in each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid YCpGAL1-top1T722A was subjected to hydroxylamine mutagenesis as described (33Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of DNA were incubated in 500 μl of a freshly prepared solution of 1 m hydroxylamine (Sigma), 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl and 2 mmEDTA at 75 °C. At 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min, 100-μl aliquots were stored on ice and fractionated on a 1.5-ml G-25 Sephadex column, pre-equilibrated with TE buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA). The DNA in the column eluent, detected by monitoring absorbance at 280 nm, was recovered by ethanol precipitation. One-tenth of each DNA sample was used to transformE. coli MC1066 (Abcx74, hsr-,rpsL, pyrF::Tn5, leuB600, trpC9830, galE, galK) (provided by Dr. Edward Winter, Thomas Jefferson University). Expression of the plasmid-borne URA3 gene is sufficient to complement the uracil auxotrophy of strain MC1066, so the mutation frequency could be estimated. Under these conditions, ∼2.2% of the 10-min pool of transformants had lost URA3 function when replica-plated onto minimal media. Plasmids from 50,000 transformants were CsCl-purified, and the mutated top1T722A sequences were excised in a 2.9-kbp BamHI-XbaI fragment and used to replace the unmutagenized sequences in YCpGAL1-top1T722A. The mutant pool was re-amplified and transformed in EKY3 yeast cells by the lithium acetate procedure. Intragenic suppressors were selected by plating the transformants on synthetic complete media lacking uracil and supplemented with 2% galactose (S.C. − uracil plus galactose media). Plasmids were isolated from the surviving colonies by vortexing the cells in the presence of phenol and glass beads (34Strathern J.N. Higgins D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and plasmid integrity was confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping. Overlapping sequences of top1T722A DNA were excised from plasmids encoding full-length Top1 protein (as assessed in immunoblots) with BamHI and Bsu36I, BclI and SphI or XbaI and PstI. In each case, the ∼1-kbp DNA fragments were used to replace the corresponding sequences in YCpGAL1-top1T722A-Lx, and the resulting plasmids were re-screened in EKY3 cells on S.C.-leucine plus galactose plates. Intragenic suppressors were defined by direct sequencing of the DNA fragments sufficient to suppress the top1T722A lethal phenotype. Exponentially growing cultures of EKY3 cells transformed with the indicated top1constructs were serially 10-fold diluted and spotted (5 μl) onto selective media containing dextrose or galactose and incubated at 30 °C. Cpt sensitivity was assayed on selective galactose plates containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and 5 μg/ml Cpt in a final 0.125% Me2SO or Me2SO alone (35Reid R.J.D. Kauh E.A. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol.

MBY3 (rad52Δ) cell viability was assessed by streaking cell suspensions onto S.C.-histidine plates containing dextrose or galactose. To assess mutant Top1p integrity, crude extracts of 50-ml cultures of EKY3 cells expressing the YCpGAL1-top1T722A-L intragenic suppressors were prepared as described (22Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad reagent, and 45 μg of total protein was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Top1p levels and integrity were assayed in immunoblots with a polyclonal antibody specific for yeast Top1p (22Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Untagged and epitope-tagged Top1 proteins were partially purified from galactose-induced EKY3 cells as described (22Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Top1 proteins lacking an N-terminal tag were corrected for protein concentration in immunoblots as above. eTop1 protein levels were determined in immunoblots probed with an epitope-specific M2 monoclonal antibody (IBI) and stained with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the chemiluminescent-CP star system (Novagen). eTop1p bands were quantitated by densitometry. Serial dilutions of homogenous eTop1 preparations were included as calibration standards. The catalytic activity of the purified Top1 protein preparations and the crude extracts were determined in plasmid DNA relaxation assays (22Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol.

JCW28 (top1Δ, top2ts) cells were co-transformed with YEptopA-PGPD, which constitutively expresses bacterial DNA topoisomerase I, and one of the following plasmids: YCpGAL1-L, YCpGAL1-eTOP1-L, YCpGAL1-etop1T722A-L, YCpGAL1-etop1C273Y,T722A-Lx, YCpGAL1-etop1G295V,T722A-Lx, or YCpGAL1-etop1G369D,T722A-Lx. Individual transformants grown in S.C.-uracil/-leucine raffinose media at the permissive temperature (26 °C) were induced with 2% galactose at anA 595 = 1.2. Five hours post-induction, half the culture was shifted to the non-permissive temperature (34 °C) for an additional 3 h. As described (13Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol.

The membranes were probed with 32P-labeled 2-μm sequences, and the distribution of plasmid DNA topoisomers was visualized by autoradiography. A 32P-labeled, 107-base pair DNA fragment containing a high affinity DNA topoisomerase I-binding site was amplified from plasmid pBlueAK3-1 (23Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol.

The epitope-tagged wild-type and mutant Top1 proteins (0–50 pmol) were incubated in a final 140 μl with 5 μg of biotinylated M2 antibody (Kodak, IBI) and 25 μl of streptavidin-coated cellulose beads (Pierce) in 20 mmphosphate (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, for 1 h on ice. After sequential washes with 250 μl of 20 mm phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 m NaCl and 2× 250-μl volumes of binding buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml gelatin, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), the bead-bound enzymes were incubated on ice with 12,000 cpm (50–100 fmol) of the32P-labeled DNA substrate in 250 μl of binding buffer in cellulose acetate microcentrifuge spin columns (Micron Separations Inc.). After 10 min, the unbound DNA was eluted by centrifugation at 6000 rpm (2800 × g) and a subsequent wash with 250 μl of binding buffer. The label in the combined eluent fractions and that retained on the beads was counted in a Beckman LS801 liquid scintillation counter. The percentage of bound DNA was calculated as (bead-bound cpm)/(bead-bound cpm) + (combined eluent cpm). In side by side reactions, the concentration of bead-bound protein was determined in immunoblots with the M2 antibody, in comparison with known concentrations of homogeneous eTop1p. Column fractions prepared fromtop1Δ strains were included as DNA-binding controls. Cpt converts DNA topoisomerase I into an S-phase poison by reversibly stabilizing the covalent Top1p-DNA intermediate. Specific mutations in DNA topoisomerase I have also been shown to increase the formation of covalent complexes with similar effects on cell viability (13Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J.

Expression of yeast mutants,top1T722A or top1R517G, from the galactose-inducible pGAL1 promoter, produced a dramatic reduction in cell viability and a terminal G2-arrested phenotype indistinguishable from that obtained following Cpt treatment of cells expressing wild-type TOP1 (13Megonigal M.D. Fertala J.

A. 1995; 92: 6299-6303Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Further biochemical analyses demonstrated an increase in the stability of the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate, albeit via distinct alterations in catalytic activity (13Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12801-12808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the structure of reconstituted human Top1p, the corresponding residues, Thr-718 and Arg-590, lie in close proximity to the active site tyrosine Tyr-723 (16Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 18Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Indeed, Arg-590 (residue 517 in yeast Top1p) appears to be one of four residues that form the catalytic site of the enzyme (18Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Along with Arg-488 and His-632, Arg-590 may coordinate the scissile phosphate during the cleavage reaction. In contrast, the mechanism of Top1T722Ap-enhanced DNA cleavage remains unclear. As a prelude to establishing the molecular interactions necessary for DNA topoisomerase I catalysis, we first addressed this question by asking what effect the Arg-517 to Gly substitution would have on Top1T722Ap function. As shown in Fig. 1 A, galactose-induced expression of either single mutant in atop1Δ strain produced at least a 3-log drop in the number of viable cells. In contrast, expression of the double mutanttop1R517G,T722A had little effect on yeast cell viability. This correlated with a lack of detectable enzyme activity in crude extracts (Fig. 1 B). As previously reported (13Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12801-12808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the specific activity of Top1T722Ap was ∼1/3 that of wild-type Top1p when assayed in plasmid DNA relaxation assays, whereas Top1R517Gp activity was not detectable. Similarly, the introduction of R517G into the Top1T722A mutant enzyme abolished the activity of the double mutant. However, in contrast with Top1R517Gp, the double mutant was no longer cytotoxic suggesting the lack of covalent complex formation by Top1R517G,T722Ap. This was confirmed in the DNA cleavage assay shown in Fig. 1 C, where the introduction of the R517G mutation suppressed the enhanced stability of the covalent DNA-Top1T722Ap complex at a high affinity cleavage site. This intragenic suppressor of top1T722A-induced lethality further diminished the camptothecin hypersensitivity of Top1T722Ap. These data, in turn, imply a functional interaction between residues Arg-517 and Thr-722 in wild-type Top1p. Intragenic suppression and complementation are widely used genetic approaches to define specific interactions between protein domains and/or residues (37Shen H. Sosa-Peinado A. Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11844-11851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 38Sommers C.M. Dumont M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 559-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Such functional assignments are especially critical in defining enzyme mechanism once the structure of the protein is known. To clarify such interactions in the various aspects of Top1p catalysis, a genetic screen for intragenic suppressors of the top1T722A lethal phenotype was undertaken. As described in Fig. 2, plasmid YCpGAL1-top1T722A was mutagenized with hydroxylamine. After establishing relative mutation rates of the plasmid-borneURA3 marker in E. coli MC1066 cells, a pool of mutagenized plasmids was amplified. The mutated top1T722Aalleles, designated top1T722A m, were excised and subcloned into a fresh plasmid backbone. This step eliminated mutations affecting pGAL1 function or plasmid maintenance by restricting the selected mutations to the coding region of top1T722A. The resultant top1T722A mpool was transformed into EKY3 (top1Δ) cells and plated on selective media containing galactose. To ensure plasmid integrity and that the mutations conferring viability were plasmid-borne, individual plasmids were purified, analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion, and transformed into top1Δ cells to screen for viability on galactose. Of these, 92 individual top1T722A mmutants were further analyzed. Exponentially growing cu"

Endonuclease VII (endo-VII)1 is the product of gene 49 of phage T4 (T4). It is a versatile endonuclease with a broad substrate profile. Besides resolving four-way and three-way junctions, the nuclease also recognizes mismatches, heteroduplex loops, single strand overhangs, flap substrates, nicks, gaps, bent DNA, bulky adducts (all reviewed in Ref. 1Kemper B. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M. Biochemistry, Genetics and Cell Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 179-204Google Scholar) and, as recently shown, apyrimidinic sites (AP-sites) (2Greger B. Kemper B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4432-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The enzyme introduces staggered nicks flanking the targets within a distance of 2–6 nucleotides. In the case of Holliday structures, this results in precise resolution of the junction and formation of patch and splice recombinants. The enzyme is essential for phage growth in vivo and is responsible for resolving branches in the newly synthesized DNA that otherwise block the translocation of the molecule during DNA packaging (3Flemming M. Deumling B. Kemper B. Virology. 1993; 196: 910-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 4Kemper B. Brown D.T. J. Virol. 1976; 18: 1000-1015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Frankel F.R.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4527-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Each dimer contains two DNA binding sites composed of one N- and one C-terminal portion of each subunit and two cleavage sites (12Birkenbihl R.P. Kemper B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In theory, one dimer would be sufficient to cleave two strands flanking the junction of a Holliday structure or its substitute, a cruciform DNA. Interestingly, electromobility shift assays (EMSA) indicated that the synthetic cruciform DNA CF01 binds in total three dimers of endo-VII (12Birkenbihl R.P. Kemper B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To further study the DNA binding of endo-VII, we have visualized the DNA-protein complexes formed between a cruciform DNA and the protein in the electron microscope and have calculated the amount of protein bound by visual inspection. Again we find that three dimers of endo-VII bind to the junction of the cruciform DNA. Acrylamide/bisacrylamide (37.5:1) for native- or SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was purchased from Bio-Rad (München, Germany). [γ-32P]dATP (specific activity > 5000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Braunschweig, Germany). All other chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany). The sequences of the four oligonucleotides and the protocol of their assembly giving cruciform DNA CF01 were described earlier (13Golz S. Birkenbihl R. Kemper B. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Synthesis of cruciform DNA J12, kindly provided by Jack Griffith, was described earlier (14Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The preparation of samples for the electron microscope was done essentially as described earlier (14Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 50-fold molar excess of endo-VII dimer was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 100 ng of J12 DNA in 50 μl of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl. After fixation at room temperature for 5 min with 0.8% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, the solution containing protein-DNA complexes was filtered through a 2-ml Bio-Gel A5 m-column (Bio-Rad) to remove excess unbound protein. The samples were then mixed with spermidine buffer giving a final concentration of 0.1 mm spermidine, 0.1 mmMgCl2, 7.5 mm NaCl, and 5 mm KCl and then transferred to carbon foils. After a rotary showcast at 10−7 torr with tungsten, the samples were examined in a Phillips CM12 electron microscope. Proteins endo-VIIWT and cleavage-deficient mutant protein [Asp]-EVII-(1–156) were used for the EM studies. Proteins endo-VIIWT and His-tagged covalently linked endo-VII dimer CD321 were used for EMSA. Expression and purifications of the proteins and removal of the 6xHis tag (where applicable) were performed as described before (10Golz S. Christoph A. Birkenkamp-Demtroeder K. Kemper B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11Birkenbihl R.P. Kemper B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4527-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 12Birkenbihl R.P. Kemper B.

DNA-binding reactions were performed in 10 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Varying amounts of protein were incubated with 1 fmol (100 pm final concentration) of radioactively labeled cruciform DNA CF01 at 16 °C. After 15 min, 2.5 μl of loading buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 400 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) were added to each sample. The mixtures were immediately loaded onto an 8% native PAA gel and run at 4 °C for 2.5 h at 7 V/cm in electrophoresis buffer (6.7 mm Tris HCl pH 8.1, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, and 2 mm EDTA). The DNA was visualized by autoradiography of the dried gels and quantitated by phosphoimaging on a Fuji BAS1000. Endo-VII has a general tendency to bind to single-stranded DNA as well as double-stranded DNA (15Kemper B. Garabett M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Kemper B. Garabett M. Courage U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The protein also binds with high affinity to cruciform DNA and mismatch-containing oligonucleotides (10Golz S. Christoph A. Birkenkamp-Demtroeder K. Kemper B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,11Birkenbihl R.P. Kemper B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4527-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Golz S. Birkenkamp-Demtroeder K. Kemper B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1132-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). When synthetic cruciform DNA CF01 was exposed to increasing amounts of endo-VII, three distinct shift positions were revealed by band shift analyses suggesting one, two, and three units of protein binding in succession to the DNA (Fig. 1 a, lanes 1 through7). The size of the smallest binding unit of endo-VII was determined as a dimer because a synthetic covalently linked endo-VII dimer shifted the DNA to the same positions in the gel as the endo-VII wild-type protein (11Birkenbihl R.P. Kemper B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4527-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To further analyze the modalities of endo-VII-binding to cruciform DNA, we loaded the protein on cruciform DNA and inspected the samples after fixation with glutaraldehyde in the electron microscope. The same procedure and the same DNA were recently used successfully to demonstrate the binding of tumor suppressor protein p53 to cruciform DNA (14Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Two forms of endo-VII were used in these studies. These were the enzymatically active wild-type protein (pEVIIWT) and the enzymatically inactive mutant protein ([Asp]-EVII-(1–156)) which lacks the ultimate C-terminal amino acid 157 and carries a point mutation in codon 62 (EVII-N62D). This mutant has recently been described (10Golz S. Christoph A. Birkenkamp-Demtroeder K. Kemper B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Christoph A. Heesberg G. Kemper B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Typical photographs from the analyses are shown in Fig. 2. A list summarizing and classifying all samples investigated is given in Table I. Among 151 inspected intact cruciform DNA molecules (Fig. 2 a), 132 were found associated with distinct protein complexes after the reaction with EVIIWT. The complexes were either located at the junction (43 complexes) (Fig. 2 b), somewhere along the arms (47 complexes) (Fig. 2 c) or at the end of one of the arms (42 complexes) (Fig. 2 d). A similar result was obtained when EVIIWTwas replaced by mutant protein [Asp]-EVII-(1–156). In this experiment, a total of 138 molecules were inspected, and 51 of them had protein complexes bound to the junction, 30 carried complexes somewhere along one of the arms, and 48 had the protein attached to the end of one arm. In both experiments, the majority of DNA-protein complexes contained only one protein complex per DNA. A molar ratio of endo-VII dimers to cruciform DNA molecules of 50:1 was found to give the best results in terms of number and size of protein-DNA complexes. When a 10-fold higher concentration of protein was used, large amorphous aggregates of protein were found along with “regular” sized complexes. The aggregates were considered unspecific and left out of this study. Lower amounts of endo-VIIWT resulted in fewer countable complexes, again of regular size.Table ICompilation of endo-VII-cruciform DNA complexes as analyzed by electron microscopyMgCl2TotalComplexes bound toFree DNAJunctionArmEnd%%%WT endo VII−151 (100)43 (28)47 (31)42 (28)19 (13)[Asp]-EVII-(1–156)−138 (100)51 (37)30 (22)48 (35)9 (6)[Asp]-EVII-(1–156)+148 (100)73 (49)32 (22)34 (23)9 (6)DNA J12 was visualized in the EM after incubation of 100 ng of the DNA with a 50-fold molar excess of dimers of endo-VIIWT or mutant protein [Asp]-EVII-(1–156) in the absence or presence of 10 mm MgCl2. Open table in a new tab DNA J12 was visualized in the EM after incubation of 100 ng of the DNA with a 50-fold molar excess of dimers of endo-VIIWT or mutant protein [Asp]-EVII-(1–156) in the absence or presence of 10 mm MgCl2. When the mutant protein was used in the presence of 10 mmMgCl2 (which is possible because the mutant protein is enzymatically inactive and does not degrade the substrate), the number of molecules with protein complexes bound to the junction was significantly higher (73 complexes) when compared with those with protein bound along one arm (32 complexes) or at the end of one arm (34 complexes). This suggests that Mg2+ may increase the affinity of endo-VII to the junction. Mg2+-induced changes in the secondary structure of cruciform DNA have recently been reported (19Bhattacharyya A. Murchie A.I.H. von Kitzing E. Diekmann S. Kemper B. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1191-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). They may eventually make the structure more apt to bind endo-VII protein. How much endo-VII binds to the junction of a cruciform DNA? We approached the problem by measuring the diameters of protein complexes on enlarged photos and compared these numbers to measures of the length of one arm of the cruciform DNA on the same photo. One arm contains 565 base pairs with a predicted length of 1,921 Å. The relative diameter of the protein complex was then calculated to be 171 ± 43 Å as averaged from ten samples. Remarkably, this number was nearly the same as the diameter of p53dimer protein complexes (169 Å) formed under the same experimental conditions using the same cruciform DNA (14Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The mass of DNA bound p53dimer complexes was originally estimated from comparisons to the mass of T7 DNA polymerase, used as an internal standard, times the ratio of the projected areas to the 3/2 power (14Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The calculated mass of endo-VII complexes was about 108 kDa, 2Mass EVIIcomplex = mass p53 ((diameter EVIIcomplex)/(diameter p53dimers))32 = 106 kDa (171 Å/169 Å)32= 107.8 kDa. suggesting that on the average three dimers of endo-VII bind to cruciform DNA. This is consistent with the results obtained by EMSA (Fig. 1, lanes 1 through 7). However, we want to emphasize that the molar ratio of endo-VII protein to cruciform DNA required to shift the DNA to the third position in the gel was about 50-fold higher here than the ratio used in the EM analyses. We suspect that the binding equilibrium between protein and DNA is shifted under the EM conditions such that the back reaction is prevented, possibly by the fixation with glutaraldehyde. Unfortunately, this hypothesis could not be tested with cruciform DNA CF01 and EMSA using EM cross-linking conditions because the substrate was not stable (results not shown). Interestingly, when the same protein concentration was used for shift experiments with linear double-stranded DNA containing a C/C mismatch, two shift positions were obtained (Fig. 1 a, lanes 8–11). From the band shift experiment shown in Fig. 1 a, a dissociation constant (K d) of 5 nm (5 × 10−9 m) was calculated for endo-VIIWT and cruciform DNA CF01 (Fig. 1 b) and 14 nm (1.4 × 10−8 m) for mismatch containing substrate Bea46MM11(Fig. 1 c). A consistent failure to obtain footprints with endo-VII and any of its substrates including cruciform DNA and mismatch-containing DNA (results not shown) indicate that the affinity of the protein to DNA is too low. Only when extremely high protein to DNA ratios (≫1000-fold molar excess of endo-VII) are chosen is footprinting possible (20Parsons C.A. Kemper B. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9285-9289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Resolution of Holliday structures requires a minimum of two staggered nicks placed across the junction, which could in principle be done by one protein dimer. The three-dimensional structure of a cruciform DNA in solution was predicted by model building as an X-shaped scissors like arrangement of the arms in space with a small angle of 60° between two pairs of arms and a compensatory wide angle of 120° between the other two pairs of arms (19Bhattacharyya A. Murchie A.I.H. von Kitzing E. Diekmann S. Kemper B. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1191-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21von Kitzing E. Lilley D.M. Diekmann S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2671-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Binding of endo-VII to cruciform DNA was reported to cause a structural change from an X-shaped molecule into a planar +-shaped molecule (22Pöhler J.R.G. Giraud-Panis M.J. Lilley D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 678-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Based on the two-fold symmetry of the cruciform DNA, one can easily envisage how binding of two arms by one endo-VII dimer (comprising two DNA-binding sites) would be sufficient to resolve the structure. By the same structural argument, one can also envisage how a second endo-VII dimer binds to the same DNA molecule without interfering with the first dimer. Binding of three dimers, however, is not understood. We therefore believe that binding of the third dimer is unspecific, possibly reflecting protein-protein interactions viadifferently charged surfaces of the protein. The recently obtained crystal structure of endo-VII revealed that the dimer has two differently charged surfaces indeed. 3D. Suck, personal communication. Dwelling upon this argument further, the two dimers binding to a mismatch oligonucleotide would then reflect one dimer binding specifically to the two arms flanking the mismatch and one dimer adhered nonspecifically to the first. It should be noted, that the amount of endo-VII protein required to shift DNA CF01 to the first, second, and third position in the gel is about 1,000-, 20,000-, and 300,000-fold higher, respectively, than is required for cleavage of 50% of the same DNA in the nuclease reaction. We therefore assume that the three-dimer complexes reflect the special situation caused by high protein concentrations that may or may not be relevant in vivo. We are grateful for the hospitality and enthusiastic support of Dr. Jack Griffith from the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in whose laboratory the EM studies were performed.
