https://openalex.org/W1758970340,"The brain contains two distinct molecular forms of the (Na,K)-ATPase (sodium and potassium ion-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase). They can be resolved by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, and can be identified by sodium-dependent, potassium-sensitive phosphorylation by [gamma-32P]ATP. They are present in the brain of every animal species examined, while only one molecular form is detected in the other organs examined. They are located in different kinds of cells within the brain, and can be physically separated while fully active by gentle tissue fractionation procedures. One is the only (Na,K)-ATPase of brain non-neuronal cells (astrocytes), while the other is the only (Na,K)-ATPase of axolemma (plasma membrane of myelinated axons). They differ in at least one kinetic parameter: the affinity for the specific inhibitor strophanthidin. They have similar one-dimensional peptide maps, but differ in their sensitivity to digestion by trypsin and in the number or reactivity of sulfhydryl groups. It is anticipated that they will be found to play functionally different roles in the complex ion transport mechanisms of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1542817241,"Cholera toxin containing intact A chain (Mr = 29,000) was isolated, and its enzymic properties were characterized. The form of the toxin, produced by a protease-deficient, hypertoxinogenic mutant of Vibrio cholerae 569B, had greatly reduced activity in catalyzing the NAD+-glycohydrolase and ADP-ribosyltransferase reactions as compared to the naturally nicked form commonly isolated. In the latter, the intact A chain has been cleaved by bacterial proteases to yield disulfide-linked A1 and A2 chains (Mr = 23,000 and 6,000, respectively). Digestion of unnicked toxin with trypsin or elastase yielded a nicked form similar to or identical with the naturally nicked toxin, but chymotryptic digestion did not. Disulfide bond reduction was necessary for expression of enzymic activity by naturally nicked or trypsin-nicked toxin, or the A1A2 protomer. Fractionation of thiol-treated, nicked cholera toxin by ion exchange, molecular exclusion, or affinity chromatography gave results suggesting that the reduced toxin displays enzymic activity while remaining structurally intact."

https://openalex.org/W1568303936,"The sequences of two phosphopeptides isolated from the catalytic subunit of bovine cardiac muscle cAMP-dependent protein kinase (type II) and from two of its cyanogen bromide fragments, have been determined. One phosphorylation site is a threonyl residue located approximately 180 residues from the blocked NH2 terminus. Its sequence is: -Gly-Arg-Thr-Trp-Thr(P)-Leu-Cys- and includes one of the three sulfhydryl groups present in the molecule. The second phosphorylated site within the sequence: -Val-Ser(P)-Ile-Asn- is located towards the carboxyl end of the protein where the other 2 cysteinyl residues also reside. The finding that phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit occurs on two discrete sites rather than at random suggests that it might be of physiological importance, e.g. in the regulation of enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1914889559,"Pregnant rabbit liver membranes have been shown to possess two types of receptors by displacement analysis, a growth hormone (GH) receptor which binds bovine growth hormone with an affinity constant (KA) of 3 x 10(9) M-1 and ovine prolactin with a KA of 3 x 10(8) M-1, and a prolactin (Prl)-specific receptor which binds ovine prolactin with a KA of 5 x 10(9) M-1. The prolactin-specific receptor when solubilized with Triton exhibits a 4-fold increase in the its KA while the KA of the growth hormone receptor decreases slightly to 2 x 10(9) M-1 after solubilization. The 10-fold difference in affinity which results has been exploited to facilitate the separation of these two receptors by differential affinity chromatography on human growth hormone (hGH) affinity gels. The growth hormone receptor is eluted from the gel with 4 M urea while 5 M MgCl2 is required to elute the prolactin receptor. Conditions of affinity chromatography have been optimized, and further purification of the GH receptor by preparative isoelectric focusing and Sepharose 6B gel filtration resulted in a more than 8000-fold purification of the receptor. This material had a Stokes radius of 62 A, consistent with a molecular weight of 300,000 and gave one main band (75,000 to 80,000) and two minor bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels, which could be interpreted as indicating a tetrameric receptor. The GH receptor was shown to be a sialoglycoprotein (or closely associated with sialoglycoprotein) by analytical isoelectric focusing with an isoelectric point of 4.6. Specificity studies with the highly purified receptor confirmed the initial hypothesis that this receptor is capable of binding bovine growth hormone (bGH) with high affinity and ovine prolactin (oPrl) with low affinity, in contrast to the prolactin-specific receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1591604684,"The effect of glucagon on the phosphorylation and the enzymic activity of phosphofructokinase in rat liver in vivo was investigated. Glucagon stimulated the phosphorylation of liver phosphofructokinase approximately 3- to 5-fold and increased cAMP levels 5-fold and blood glucose levels 2-fold over the values obtained for control animals. The specific radioactivity of ATP isolated from liver was the same in both control and hormone-treated animals. During the purification of the 32P-labeled enzyme from both animals, no difference was observed in the total or specific enzyme activities of the enzymes from the various fractions. Thus, phosphofructokinase appears to be phosphorylated in vivo by a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Although phosphorylation does not affect the maximum catalytic activity of the enzyme, it does render the enzyme significantly more sensitive to ATP inhibition. Thus, at a given concentration of ATP, the phosphorylated phosphofructokinase exhibits considerably lower activity than the unphosphorylated enzyme. The possible relationship between our observations and glucagon-mediated control of glycolysis is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1544909488,"When a single injection of 500 I.U. of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is given to rats there is an initial acute rise of plasma testosterone and of testicular content for both cyclic AMP and testosterone. This response correlates with an increase in both lyase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase activities. Thereafter both plasma and testicular testosterone decline and do not increase after a second injection of hCG. During this period of desensitization, isolated Leydig cells were insensitive to the steroidogenic stimulatory effect of both hCG and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The post-cyclic AMP block is not due to an alteration of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase but it is correlated with a decrease in both lyase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase activities of the Leydig cell's microsomes. This decrease is not caused by the absence of the recently described cytosol activator of this enzyme because its addition did not restore the enzymatic activity. Within 60 to 96 h after hCG injection there was a spontaneous increase of both plasma and testicular testosterone and this parallels the recovery of lyase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase activities. These results suggest that both enzymatic activities are regulated, directly or indirectly, by hCG, and that this is partly responsible for the hCG-induced steroidogenic refractoriness of Leydig cells."

https://openalex.org/W1587952060,"Abstract Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (labile toxin, LT) catalyzed the hydrolysis of NAD to ADP-ribose and nicotinamide and the ADP-ribosylation of arginine (Moss, J., and Richardson, S.H. (1978) J. Clin. Invest. 62, 281-285). Analysis of the product of the ADP-ribosylation of arginine by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that the reaction was stereospecific and resulted in the formation of alpha-ADP-ribosyl-L-arginine. This reaction product rapidly anomerized to yield a mixture of the alpha and beta forms. In the presence of [adenine-U-14C]NAD, E. coli enterotoxin catalyzed the transfer of the radiolabel to proteins; the ADP-ribosylation of proteins was inhibited by arginine methyl ester, an alternative substrate. Digestion of the 14C-protein with snake venom phosphodiesterase released predominantly 5'-AMP. No product was obtained with a mobility similar to that of 2'-(5''-phosphoribosyl)-5'-AMP. This result is consistent with the covalent attachment by the enterotoxin of ADP-ribose rather than poly(ADP-ribose) to protein. Thus, LT is catalytically equivalent to choleragen, an enterotoxin of Vibrio cholerae, and activates adenylate cyclase through a similar stereospecific ADP-ribosylation reaction."

https://openalex.org/W184153690,"The formation of cytochrome c oxidase in yeast is dependent on oxygen. In order to examine the oxygen-dependent formation of the active enzyme, the effect of oxygen on the synthesis and the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase subunits was studied. Pulse-labeling experiments revealed that oxygen has no significant immediate effect on the synthesis of the three mitochondrially made subunits I to III; however, its presence causes subunits I and II to form a complex with the cytoplasmically made subunits VI and VII. This assembly-inducing effect can be demonstrated with intact yeast cells as well as with isolated mitochondria. It is independent of cytoplasmic or mitochondrial protein synthesis. After anaerobic growth for 10 or more generations, the intracellular concentrations of individual cytochrome c oxidase subunits drop 10- to 100-fold. Most of these residual subunits are not assembled within a functional cytochrome c oxidase molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1529906069,"Pyridoxal kinase has been purified 2,000-fold from pig brain. The enzyme preparation migrates as a single protein and activity band on analytical gel electrophoresis. Pyridoxal kinase, 60,000 molecular weight, catalyzes the phosphorylation of pyridoxal (Km = 2.5 x 10(-5) M) and pyridoxine (Km = 1.7 x 10(-5) M). Pyridoxamine is not a substrate of the purified kinase. Irradiation of the kinase in the presence of riboflavin leads to irreversible loss of catalytic activity. Riboflavin binds to the kinase with a KD = 5 microM as shown by fluorometric titrations. Singlet excited oxygen, generated by energy transfer from the lowest triplet of riboflavin to oxygen, acts as the oxidizing agent of approximately one histidine residue per mol of enzyme. The amino acid residues tyrosine, tryptophan, and cysteine are not photooxidized by the sensitizer bound to the enzyme. It is postulated that histidine is involved in the binding of the substrate ATP to the catalytic site of pyridoxal kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1550739098,"The intrinsic fluorescence of the T4 helix-destabilizing protein specified by gene 32 (32P) is not altered by the proteolytic removal of either the 6200-dalton COOH-terminal region (32P*-A) or both the A and the 2300-dalton NH2-terminal region (32P*-(A + B)). The intrinsic fluorescence of 32P, 32P*-A, and 32P*-(A + B) is decreased 23% by the addition of d(pT)8 and 34% by the addition of poly(dT). Saturation binding curves of the percentage of change in protein fluorescence as a function of nucleotide concentration show that the intact 32P as well as the two proteolysis-generated fragments all have association constants of approximately 10(6) M-1 for d(pT)8. This demonstrates that the DNA binding site is not contained within either the A or B regions of 32P. Both 32P and 32P*-A bind cooperatively to poly(dT) as evidenced by a 400- to 1000-fold increase in association constant for poly(dT) compared to d(pT)8. Since within the limits of our measurements 32P and 32P*-A bind equally well to poly(dT) (Kassoc approximately 5 . 10(8) M-1), the enhanced helix-destabilizing properties previously reported for 32P*-A cannot be accounted for by a significant increase in binding affinity of 32P*-A for single-stranded DNA. The binding constant for the 32P*-(A + B):poly(dT) complex is only 3-fold higher than that for the 32P*-(A + B):d(pT)8 complex, which confirms our proposal that the B region is essential for cooperative 32P:32P protein interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1666781637,"Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrase, EC 3.1.3.11) of Bacillus subtilis is a constitutive enzyme that was purified 1000-fold (30% yield) to 80% purity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis where it exhibits a band corresponding to 72,000 daltons. It sediments at 15 S in sucrose density gradients indicating a molecular weight of 380,000, but apparently is very asymmetric. Its activity is irreversibly inactivated in the absence of Mn2+. The enzyme specifically catalyzes dephosphorylation of D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate with a pH optimum of 8.0. It has 40 to 60% of full activity in the absence of P-enolpyruvate; 20 microM P-enolpyruvate activates it maximally. High concentrations of monovalent cations also activate, NH4+ being most effective. Inhibitors fall into two groups. 1) Nucleoside monophosphates, phosphorylated coenzymes, and polynucleotides inhibit competitively with P-enolpyruvate (AMP (Ki = 2 microM) and dAMP are most effective). 2) The inhibition by nucleoside di- and triphosphates, PPi, and highly phosphorylated nucleotides (guanosine 5'-triphosphate 3'-diphosphate (pppGpp) and adenosine 5'-triphosphate 3'-diphosphate are most effective) is not competed by P-enolpyruvate but is partially overcome by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (2 microM). Therefore, highly phosphorylated nucleotides (pppGpp and others), produced in over 0.2 mM concentrations upon step down from fast to slow growth rates (Gallant, J., and Lazzarini, R.A. (1976) in Protein Synthesis (McConkey, E.H., ed) Vol. 2, pp. 309-349, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York), can reduce the conversion rate of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate during gluconeogenesis. Comparing glycolytic growth on D-glucose and gluconeogenic growth on L-malate, the intracellular concentrations of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate differ but are both above the Km (13 microM) of the enzyme, those of AMP are similar, whereas those of P-enolpyruvate (0.18 mM versus 1.3 mM) indicate that the enzyme has only 40% of its full activity during glycolysis; nucleotides other than AMP may inhibit additionally. Thus, the futile cycle of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate synthesis and degradation during glycolysis is partially avoided, but the cells are poised for rapid adaptation upon change to gluconeogenic growth conditions."

We report the sequencing and proton magnetic resonance spectral assignments, including those of 4 aromatic residues, of tyrocidine A, an analog of the decapeptide gramicidin S. Two complementary methods, proton-proton nuclear Overhauser enhancements and scalar decoupling, evaluated by two distinct forms of difference double resonance, were used. All chemical shifts, scalar coupling constants, and [1H:1H] nuclear Overhauser enhancements for the backbone protons are reported. The [1H:1H] nuclear Overhauser enhancements are consistent with tyrocidine A possessing a beta-I turn/beta-II' turn/antiparallel beta-pleated sheet conformation. In addition to the previously proposed nuclear Overhauser enhancement criteria for beta turns and antiparallel beta sheets, another criterion for identifying the antiparallel beta sheet is demonstrated; namely, the nuclear Overhauser enhancement between 2 CalphaH protons of the central resisdues, in this case the Phe7CalphaH and Orn2CalphaH."
https://openalex.org/W1581942322,"The pyrimidine moiety of a pterin, 2,4,5-triamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine, has been found to be active in the phenylalanine-hydroxylating system. The phenylalanine-dependent, phenylalanine hydroxylase-catalyzed reaction in the presence of the pyrimidine is largely, but not completely, uncoupled; the ratio of DPNH oxidized to tyrosine formed is about 20 to 1. In addition to the pyrimidine having activity with phenylalanine hydroxylase, a product of the pyrimidine is also a substrate for dihydropteridine reductase. The activity of the pyrimidine with the hydroxylase indicates that neither carbon atoms 6 or 7 of the pterin ring is involved in activation of oxygen during the hydroxylase-catalyzed reaction."

The methylation of the 5'-terminal 7-methylguanosine, however, does not appear to be significantly affected. The poly(A)+ RNA synthesized in cycloleucine-treated cells is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and associates with polyribosomes at rates comparable to poly(A)+ RNA in untreated cells. On the other hand, the transport and utilization of newly synthesized ribosomal RNA in cycloleucine-treated cells is impaired, and the accumulation of mature 18 S and 28 S rRNA is reduced."

No RNA polymerase inhibitor could be detected in extracts of infected cell nuclei. Reconstitution experiments with solubilized RNA polymerases dissociated from chromatin of infected and uninfected cells demonstrated that vesicular stomatitis viral infection did not affect the ability of the polymerases to function on endogenous or exogenous templates; nor did infection alter the template capability of the chromatin. Measurement of the number of actively growing RNA chains revealed that infected cell nuclei contained fewer active polymerase units; however, the rates of RNA chain elongation were the same in nuclei from infected and uninfected cells. Quantitation of the number of polymerase units active in nuclear chromatin revealed that the alpha-amantin-sensitive polymerase II was more severely reduced by viral infection than were polymerases I and III."

Purified Fragment A consists of a mixture of 3 molecules of 190, 192, and 193 residues; the first 190 residues are in common and correspond to the NH2-terminal region the toxin. All three species of Fragment A are active in catalyzing ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2, an essential component of protein synthesis. This reaction inactivates the factor and is responsible for the toxin's action in inhibiting protein synthesis in animal cells. It is believed that Fragment A or similar enzymically active fragments released into the cytosol of toxin-treated cells mediate this inhibition.

This increase in activity is due to in vivo activation of the enzyme by a factor present in erythrocytes. Activation also occurs in killed or disrupted organisms. The activator can be separated from heme proteins and has been purified approximately 100-fold from erythrocytes, yielding material of approximately 105,000 daltons. It is sensitive to trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin and exhibits considerable heat stability. Activation of cyclase in intact B. pertussis organisms exhibits a lag of 3 to 4 min and is not reversed by washing. Response to the activator decreases with increasing purification of the adenylate cyclase and is absent in the pure enzyme. The activation does not appear to be proteolytic and does not appear to change access to the substrate, ATP. The activator has no effect on a number of eukaryotic cyclases. We conclude that this is a new type of activation and that the activator differs from all those previously described."

In concentrated solutions, the membrane-derived protein kinase undergoes aggregation with a concomitant loss in observed phosphotransferase activity. This loss of activity can be restored by means of inducing deaggregation. The phosphotransferase activity of the protein kinase is virtually obliterated in the presence of high (300 mM) concentrations of sodium chloride. This effect is also reversible. The pH optimum for the phosphotransferase reaction that is catalyzed by the membrane-derived protein kinase is approximately 8. Micromolar concentrations of cAMP are optimal with respect to promoting the phosphotransferase reaction. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies were conducted on the cAMP-independent protein kinase derived from the cAMP-dependent enzyme. These studies indicate that the phosphotransferase reaction proceeds by a sequential kinetic mechanism."

We have examined whether the changes in solute transport which are usually associated with cessation of growth at confluency also take place when cell growth is arrested by the addition of plasma membranes. We find that the rate of uptake of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and uridine is decreased after the addition of plasma membranes to 3T3 cells, but the rate of uptake of 2-deoxyglucose and phosphate is not. We conclude from these observations that uptake of uridine and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid are related to contact inhibition of growth, while the decline in the rate of uptake of 2-deoxyglucose and phosphate observed at high cell density must be due to changes other than cell to cell contact."

https://openalex.org/W1508056680,"Abstract Ferric yeast cytochrome c peroxidase in the presence of different anions may assume a number of forms which differ in optical spectra and chemical properties. In solutions whose only anion is acetate, two spectral forms are present together in an equilibrium. Each of these spectral species is believed to bear bound acetate anion. A form characterized by an intense absorption maximum at 620 nm is unreactive enzymatically and does not react with hydrogen peroxide or with dithionite. A form characterized by a less intense absorption near 645 nm is enzymatically and chemically reactive. Increasing temperature and increasing pH displace the equilibrium toward the 645 nm form. Increasing cytochrome c peroxidase concentration favors the 620 nm form. In kinetic experiments in which the 645 nm form is removed by rapid reaction with H2O2 or dithionite, the 620 nm form is converted in a first order reaction (k = 0.36 s-1, 15 degrees C) to the 645 nm form. In solutions whose sole anion is phosphate a 645 nm form is the only demonstrable spectral species. The enzymatic activity and rates of chemical reaction of 645 nm spectral forms occurring in acetate and in phosphate buffers are the same."
https://openalex.org/W1577681564,"The rate and extent of electron transfer from ferrous ion to ferricytochrome c are enhanced by the presence of inorganic orthophosphate at concentrations comparable to those of reductant and oxidant. Evidence, obtained by the method of continuous variations, shows that the electron transfer occurs within a stoichiometric complex composed of cytochrome c, ferrous ion, and phosphate in molar proportions of about 1:1:1. The incorporation of the anion into this complex appears to result in a modulation of the extent and rate of cytochrome c reduction. The rate of electron transfer obeys a first order rate law, characterized by an apparent first order rate constant of 1.4 min-1. The complex has kinetic significance only; equilibrium dialysis, gel filtration, and sedimentation velocity experiments yielded no evidence for stable binding of phosphate and iron, or of aggregation, on a significant scale. The extent of reduction is limited (for reasons not yet known) to about one-half of the available cytochrome molecules. Reduction in excess of 50% can be achieved only when both, ferrous ion and phosphate, are present in excess of the cytochrome concentration. Kinetic data indicate that reduction to extents over and below 50% occurs by different mechanisms."

Binding studies with 8-slAMP at 8 degrees C indicate three independent binding sites (Kd = 1.4 microM) per molecule of enzyme (Mr = 320,000). These properties make 8-slAMP a good spin probe for AMP nucleosidase. The analog may also be useful for other proteins known or suspected of binding AMP analogs in a syn conformation."

In the presence of high concentrations of nucleotide both forward and reverse reactions were observed. In the presence of succinate the degree of cooperativity between subunits of the homodimer decreased, i.e. the Hill coefficient, n, decreased from 2.5 to 1.4 for acetyl phosphate in the presence of succinate. At low substrate concentrations hyperbolic kinetic data were observed with succinate. We have proposed a modified version of the concerted symmetry model to describe the kinetics observed with this enzyme. The primary differentiating feature of the proposed model is the requirement for activator ligand binding for catalysis. In the absence of succinate, the substrate (acetate or acetyl phosphate) also functions as an activating ligand."
