Here we quantify 34 trends in terrestrial water storage observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites during 2002-2016 and categorize their drivers as natural interannual variability, unsustainable groundwater consumption, climate change or combinations thereof. Several of these trends had been lacking thorough investigation and attribution, including massive changes in northwestern China and the Okavango Delta. Others are consistent with climate model predictions. This observation-based assessment of how the world's water landscape is responding to human impacts and climate variations provides a blueprint for evaluating and predicting emerging threats to water and food security."
https://openalex.org/W2802718873,"The scalable and sustainable manufacture of thick electrode films with high energy and power densities is critical for the large-scale storage of electrochemical energy for application in transportation and stationary electric grids. Two-dimensional nanomaterials have become the predominant choice of electrode material in the pursuit of high energy and power densities owing to their large surface-area-to-volume ratios and lack of solid-state diffusion1,2. However, traditional electrode fabrication methods often lead to restacking of two-dimensional nanomaterials, which limits ion transport in thick films and results in systems in which the electrochemical performance is highly dependent on the thickness of the film1-4. Strategies for facilitating ion transport-such as increasing the interlayer spacing by intercalation5-8 or introducing film porosity by designing nanoarchitectures9,10-result in materials with low volumetric energy storage as well as complex and lengthy ion transport paths that impede performance at high charge-discharge rates. Vertical alignment of two-dimensional flakes enables directional ion transport that can lead to thickness-independent electrochemical performances in thick films11-13. However, so far only limited success11,12 has been reported, and the mitigation of performance losses remains a major challenge when working with films of two-dimensional nanomaterials with thicknesses that are near to or exceed the industrial standard of 100 micrometres. Here we demonstrate electrochemical energy storage that is independent of film thickness for vertically aligned two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3C2T x ), a material from the MXene family (two-dimensional carbides and nitrides of transition metals (M), where X stands for carbon or nitrogen). The vertical alignment was achieved by mechanical shearing of a discotic lamellar liquid-crystal phase of Ti3C2T x . The resulting electrode films show excellent performance that is nearly independent of film thickness up to 200 micrometres, which makes them highly attractive for energy storage applications. Furthermore, the self-assembly approach presented here is scalable and can be extended to other systems that involve directional transport, such as catalysis and filtration."

Microglia modulate pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic activities in astrocytes, but the mechanisms involved are not completely understood4,5. Here we report that TGFα and VEGF-B produced by microglia regulate the pathogenic activities of astrocytes in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Microglia-derived TGFα acts via the ErbB1 receptor in astrocytes to limit their pathogenic activities and EAE development. Conversely, microglial VEGF-B triggers FLT-1 signalling in astrocytes and worsens EAE. VEGF-B and TGFα also participate in the microglial control of human astrocytes. Furthermore, expression of TGFα and VEGF-B in CD14+ cells correlates with the multiple sclerosis lesion stage. Finally, metabolites of dietary tryptophan produced by the commensal flora control microglial activation and TGFα and VEGF-B production, modulating the transcriptional program of astrocytes and CNS inflammation through a mechanism mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. In summary, we identified positive and negative regulators that mediate the microglial control of astrocytes. Moreover, these findings define a pathway through which microbial metabolites limit pathogenic activities of microglia and astrocytes, and suppress CNS inflammation. This pathway may guide new therapies for multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders. TGFα and VEGF-B produced by microglia regulate astrocyte function in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis."

Here, to investigate the functions of these genes, we present genome-wide mutant fitness data from 32 diverse bacteria across dozens of growth conditions. We identified mutant phenotypes for 11,779 protein-coding genes that had not been annotated with a specific function. Many genes could be associated with a specific condition because the gene affected fitness only in that condition, or with another gene in the same bacterium because they had similar mutant phenotypes. Of the poorly annotated genes, 2,316 had associations that have high confidence because they are conserved in other bacteria. By combining these conserved associations with comparative genomics, we identified putative DNA repair proteins; in addition, we propose specific functions for poorly annotated enzymes and transporters and for uncharacterized protein families. Our study demonstrates the scalability of microbial genetics and its utility for improving gene annotations. A large-scale mutagenesis screen identifies mutant phenotypes for over 11,000 protein-coding genes in bacteria that had previously not been assigned a specific function."
https://openalex.org/W2803360616,"Somatic mutations in tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), which encodes an epigenetic modifier enzyme, drive the development of haematopoietic malignancies1-7. In both humans and mice, TET2 deficiency leads to increased self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells with a net developmental bias towards the myeloid lineage1,4,8,9. However, pre-leukaemic myeloproliferation (PMP) occurs in only a fraction of Tet2-/- mice8,9 and humans with TET2 mutations1,3,5-7, suggesting that extrinsic non-cell-autonomous factors are required for disease onset. Here we show that bacterial translocation and increased interleukin-6 production, resulting from dysfunction of the small-intestinal barrier, are critical for the development of PMP in mice that lack Tet2 expression in haematopoietic cells. Furthermore, in symptom-free Tet2-/- mice, PMP can be induced by disrupting intestinal barrier integrity, or in response to systemic bacterial stimuli such as the toll-like receptor 2 agonist. PMP was reversed by antibiotic treatment and failed to develop in germ-free Tet2-/- mice, which illustrates the importance of microbial signals in the development of this condition. Our findings demonstrate the requirement for microbial-dependent inflammation in the development of PMP and provide a mechanistic basis for the variation in PMP penetrance observed in Tet2-/- mice. This study will prompt new lines of investigation that may profoundly affect the prevention and management of haematopoietic malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2800319132,"A fundamental quest of modern astronomy is to locate the earliest galaxies and study how they influenced the intergalactic medium a few hundred million years after the Big Bang1-3. The abundance of star-forming galaxies is known to decline4,5 from redshifts of about 6 to 10, but a key question is the extent of star formation at even earlier times, corresponding to the period when the first galaxies might have emerged. Here we report spectroscopic observations of MACS1149-JD1 6 , a gravitationally lensed galaxy observed when the Universe was less than four per cent of its present age. We detect an emission line of doubly ionized oxygen at a redshift of 9.1096 ± 0.0006, with an uncertainty of one standard deviation. This precisely determined redshift indicates that the red rest-frame optical colour arises from a dominant stellar component that formed about 250 million years after the Big Bang, corresponding to a redshift of about 15. Our results indicate that it may be possible to detect such early episodes of star formation in similar galaxies with future telescopes."
https://openalex.org/W2800399253,"The Montreal Protocol was designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by enabling reductions in the abundance of ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the atmosphere1–3. The reduction in the atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) has made the second-largest contribution to the decline in the total atmospheric concentration of ozone-depleting chlorine since the 1990s1. However, CFC-11 still contributes one-quarter of all chlorine reaching the stratosphere, and a timely recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer depends on a sustained decline in CFC-11 concentrations1. Here we show that the rate of decline of atmospheric CFC-11 concentrations observed at remote measurement sites was constant from 2002 to 2012, and then slowed by about 50 per cent after 2012. The observed slowdown in the decline of CFC-11 concentration was concurrent with a 50 per cent increase in the mean concentration difference observed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and also with the emergence of strong correlations at the Mauna Loa Observatory between concentrations of CFC-11 and other chemicals associated with anthropogenic emissions. A simple model analysis of our findings suggests an increase in CFC-11 emissions of 13 ± 5 gigagrams per year (25 ± 13 per cent) since 2012, despite reported production being close to zero4 since 2006. Our three-dimensional model simulations confirm the increase in CFC-11 emissions, but indicate that this increase may have been as much as 50 per cent smaller as a result of changes in stratospheric processes or dynamics. The increase in emission of CFC-11 appears unrelated to past production; this suggests unreported new production, which is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out global CFC production by 2010. Atmospheric CFC-11 concentrations have been declining less rapidly since 2012; evidence suggests that this finding is explained by an increase in the emission of CFC-11during these years."

 1
 . The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized
 2
 . Here we use a genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9-based screen to identify the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 as an entry mediator for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya, Ross River, Mayaro and O’nyong nyong viruses. Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced levels of viral infection of cells and, reciprocally, ectopic expression of these genes resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to chikungunya virus particles and enhanced virus attachment and internalization into cells. Consistent with these findings, Mxra8–Fc fusion protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked chikungunya virus infection in multiple cell types, including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of chikungunya virus E2 protein, which are a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of the Mxra8–Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies to mice reduced chikungunya and O’nyong nyong virus infection as well as associated foot swelling. Pharmacological targeting of Mxra8 could form a strategy for mitigating infection and disease by multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses. The cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 is identified as a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses such as chikungunya virus, and anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies are shown to reduce rates of chikungunya virus infection in mice and a range of human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2757980502,"Heterostructures of atomically-thin materials have attracted significant interest owing to their ability to host novel electronic properties fundamentally distinct from their constituent layers. In the case of graphene on boron nitride, the closely-matched lattices yield a moir\'e superlattice that modifies the graphene electron dispersion and opens gaps both at the primary Dirac point (DP) and the moir\'e-induced secondary Dirac point (SDP) in the valence band. While significant effort has focused on controlling the superlattice period via the rotational stacking order, the role played by the magnitude of the interlayer coupling has received comparatively little attention. Here, we modify the interaction between graphene and boron nitride by tuning their separation with hydrostatic pressure. We observe a dramatic enhancement of the DP gap with increasing pressure, but little change in the SDP gap. Our surprising results identify the critical role played by atomic-scale structural deformations of the graphene lattice and reveal new opportunities for band structure engineering in van der Waals heterostructures."
https://openalex.org/W2804476437,"Non-membrane-bound organelles such as nucleoli, processing bodies, Cajal bodies and germ granules form by the spontaneous self-assembly of specific proteins and RNAs. How these biomolecular condensates form and interact is poorly understood. Here we identify two proteins, ZNFX-1 and WAGO-4, that localize to Caenorhabditis elegans germ granules (P granules) in early germline blastomeres. Later in germline development, ZNFX-1 and WAGO-4 separate from P granules to define an independent liquid-like condensate that we term the Z granule. In adult germ cells, Z granules assemble into ordered tri-condensate assemblages with P granules and Mutator foci, which we term PZM granules. Finally, we show that one biological function of ZNFX-1 and WAGO-4 is to interact with silencing RNAs in the C. elegans germline to direct transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. We speculate that the temporal and spatial ordering of liquid droplet organelles may help cells to organize and coordinate the complex RNA processing pathways that underlie gene-regulatory systems, such as RNA-directed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance."
https://openalex.org/W2803948904,"Volume-regulated anion channels are activated in response to hypotonic stress. These channels are composed of closely related paralogues of the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8 (LRRC8) family that co-assemble to form hexameric complexes. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, we determine the structure of a homomeric channel of the obligatory subunit LRRC8A. This protein conducts ions and has properties in common with endogenous heteromeric channels. Its modular structure consists of a transmembrane pore domain followed by a cytoplasmic leucine-rich repeat domain. The transmembrane domain, which is structurally related to connexin proteins, is wide towards the cytoplasm but constricted on the outside by a structural unit that acts as a selectivity filter. An excess of basic residues in the filter and throughout the pore attracts anions by electrostatic interaction. Our work reveals the previously unknown architecture of volume-regulated anion channels and their mechanism of selective anion conduction."
https://openalex.org/W2804871344,"The increasing use of engineered organisms for industrial, clinical, and environmental applications poses a growing risk of spreading hazardous biological entities into the environment. To address this biosafety issue, significant effort has been invested in creating ways to confine these organisms and transgenic materials. Emerging technologies in synthetic biology involving genetic circuit engineering, genome editing, and gene expression regulation have led to the development of novel biocontainment systems. In this perspective, we highlight recent advances in biocontainment and suggest a number of approaches for future development, which may be applied to overcome remaining challenges in safeguard implementation. Synthetic biology offers innovative approaches for engineering biological systems, but also supports the development of biocontainment strategies that ensure the safe application of genetically modified organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2798358022,"The sine-cosine algorithm (SCA) is a new population-based meta-heuristic algorithm. In addition to exploiting sine and cosine functions to perform local and global searches (hence the name sine-cosine), the SCA introduces several random and adaptive parameters to facilitate the search process. Although it shows promising results, the search process of the SCA is vulnerable to local minima/maxima due to the adoption of a fixed switch probability and the bounded magnitude of the sine and cosine functions (from -1 to 1). In this paper, we propose a new hybrid Q-learning sine-cosine- based strategy, called the Q-learning sine-cosine algorithm (QLSCA). Within the QLSCA, we eliminate the switching probability. Instead, we rely on the Q-learning algorithm (based on the penalty and reward mechanism) to dynamically identify the best operation during runtime. Additionally, we integrate two new operations (L\'evy flight motion and crossover) into the QLSCA to facilitate jumping out of local minima/maxima and enhance the solution diversity. To assess its performance, we adopt the QLSCA for the combinatorial test suite minimization problem. Experimental results reveal that the QLSCA is statistically superior with regard to test suite size reduction compared to recent state-of-the-art strategies, including the original SCA, the particle swarm test generator (PSTG), adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) and the cuckoo search strategy (CS) at the 95% confidence level. However, concerning the comparison with discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO), there is no significant difference in performance at the 95% confidence level. On a positive note, the QLSCA statistically outperforms the DPSO in certain configurations at the 90% confidence level."
https://openalex.org/W2803685741,"Serine hydrolases play diverse roles in regulating host–pathogen interactions in a number of organisms, yet few have been characterized in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Here we describe a chemical proteomic screen that identified ten previously uncharacterized S. aureus serine hydrolases that mostly lack human homologs. We termed these enzymes fluorophosphonate-binding hydrolases (FphA–J). One hydrolase, FphB, can process short fatty acid esters, exhibits increased activity in response to host cell factors, is located predominantly on the bacterial cell surface in a subset of cells, and is concentrated in the division septum. Genetic disruption of fphB confirmed that the enzyme is dispensable for bacterial growth in culture but crucial for establishing infection in distinct sites in vivo. A selective small molecule inhibitor of FphB effectively reduced infectivity in vivo, suggesting that it may be a viable therapeutic target for the treatment or management of Staphylococcus infections. ABP profiling identifies uncharacterized S. aureus serine hydrolases, including the surface-localized FphB, which processes lipid ester substrates and is required for infection in vivo. An FphB inhibitor reduces in vivo bacterial load."
https://openalex.org/W2803105126,"Potassium-sensitive hypokalaemic and normokalaemic periodic paralysis are inherited skeletal muscle diseases characterized by episodes of flaccid muscle weakness1,2. They are caused by single mutations in positively charged residues ('gating charges') in the S4 transmembrane segment of the voltage sensor of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.4 or the calcium channel Cav1.11,2. Mutations of the outermost gating charges (R1 and R2) cause hypokalaemic periodic paralysis1,2 by creating a pathogenic gating pore in the voltage sensor through which cations leak in the resting state3,4. Mutations of the third gating charge (R3) cause normokalaemic periodic paralysis 5 owing to cation leak in both activated and inactivated states 6 . Here we present high-resolution structures of the model bacterial sodium channel NavAb with the analogous gating-charge mutations7,8, which have similar functional effects as in the human channels. The R2G and R3G mutations have no effect on the backbone structures of the voltage sensor, but they create an aqueous cavity near the hydrophobic constriction site that controls gating charge movement through the voltage sensor. The R3G mutation extends the extracellular aqueous cleft through the entire length of the activated voltage sensor, creating an aqueous path through the membrane. Conversely, molecular modelling shows that the R2G mutation creates a continuous aqueous path through the membrane only in the resting state. Crystal structures of NavAb(R2G) in complex with guanidinium define a potential drug target site. Molecular dynamics simulations illustrate the mechanism of Na+ permeation through the mutant gating pore in concert with conformational fluctuations of the gating charge R4. Our results reveal pathogenic mechanisms of periodic paralysis at the atomic level and suggest designs of drugs that may prevent ionic leak and provide symptomatic relief from hypokalaemic and normokalaemic periodic paralysis."

https://openalex.org/W2804396963,"The receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-induced osteoclast differentiation has a critical role in the process of bone metabolism. Overactivation of osteoclastogenesis may result in a series of diseases. Irisin, a novel myokine, which was first reported in 2012, has been proposed to mediate the beneficial metabolic effects of exercise. Studies have demonstrated that irisin targets osteoblasts by promoting osteoblast proliferation and differentiation; however, the underlying mechanism regarding the effect of irisin on osteoclasts remains elusive. Using 2 types of osteoclast precursor cells, RAW264.7 cells and mouse bone marrow monocytes, we showed that irisin promoted osteoclast precursor cell proliferation but inhibited osteoclast differentiation. Irisin down-regulated the expression of osteoclast differentiation marker genes, including receptor activators of NF-κB, nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1, cathepsin K, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), as well as decreasing the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells and hydroxyapatite resorption pits. Furthermore, we showed that irisin suppressed the NF-κB signaling pathway, but activated the p38 and JNK signaling pathways. In the presence of an inhibitor of p38 and JNK, irisin-induced promotion of RAW264.7 cell proliferation was attenuated. However, irisin-induced inhibition of osteoclast differentiation was not affected by either the p38 or JNK signaling pathway. Our study suggested the direct effect of irisin on osteoclastogenesis and revealed the mechanism responsible for the therapeutic potential of irisin in bone metabolism disease.-Ma, Y., Qiao, X., Zeng, R., Cheng, R., Zhang, J., Luo, Y., Nie, Y., Hu, Y., Yang, Z., Zhang, J., Liu, L., Xu, W., Xu, C.

https://openalex.org/W2804476197,"Our ability to directly relate results from test-tube biochemical experiments to the kinetics in living cells is very limited. Here we present experimental and analytical tools to directly study the kinetics of fast biochemical reactions in live cells. Dye-labeled molecules are electroporated into bacterial cells and tracked using super-resolved single-molecule microscopy. Trajectories are analyzed by machine-learning algorithms to directly monitor transitions between bound and free states. In particular, we measure the dwell time of tRNAs on ribosomes, and hence achieve direct measurements of translation rates inside living cells at codon resolution. We find elongation rates with tRNAPhe that are in perfect agreement with previous indirect estimates, and once fMet-tRNAfMet has bound to the 30S ribosomal subunit, initiation of translation is surprisingly fast and does not limit the overall rate of protein synthesis. The experimental and analytical tools for direct kinetics measurements in live cells have applications far beyond bacterial protein synthesis. Combination of single-molecule tracking experiments and machine-learning approaches to monitor diffusional state transitions between ribosome-bound and free tRNAs allows codon resolution measurements of translation kinetics."

The structure reveals a unique architecture, provides mechanistic insight and identifies ligand-binding determinants for PglC and the monotopic PGT superfamily.

https://openalex.org/W2804011161,"Editing domains of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases correct tRNA charging errors to maintain translational fidelity. A mutation in the editing domain of alanyl tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) in Aars sti mutant mice results in an increase in the production of serine-mischarged tRNAAla and the degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Here, using positional cloning, we identified Ankrd16, a gene that acts epistatically with the Aars sti mutation to attenuate neurodegeneration. ANKRD16, a vertebrate-specific protein that contains ankyrin repeats, binds directly to the catalytic domain of AlaRS. Serine that is misactivated by AlaRS is captured by the lysine side chains of ANKRD16, which prevents the charging of serine adenylates to tRNAAla and precludes serine misincorporation in nascent peptides. The deletion of Ankrd16 in the brains of Aarssti/sti mice causes widespread protein aggregation and neuron loss. These results identify an amino-acid-accepting co-regulator of tRNA synthetase editing as a new layer of the machinery that is essential to the prevention of severe pathologies that arise from defects in editing."

Vitamin D is first modified in the liver by the 25-hydroxylases CYP2R1 and CYP27A1 and further activated in the kidney by the 1α-hydroxylase CYP27B1, while the renal 24-hydroxylase CYP24A1 catalyzes the first step of its inactivation. While the kidney is the main organ responsible for circulating levels of active 1,25(OH)2D3, other organs also express some of these enzymes. Their regulation, however, has been studied less.Here we investigated the effect of several Pi-regulating factors including dietary Pi, PTH and FGF23 on the expression of the vitamin D hydroxylases and the vitamin D receptor VDR in renal and extrarenal tissues of mice. We found that with the exception of Cyp24a1, all the other analyzed mRNAs show a wide tissue distribution. High dietary Pi mainly upregulated the hepatic expression of Cyp27a1 and Cyp2r1 without changing plasma 1,25(OH)2D3. FGF23 failed to regulate the expression of any of the studied hydroxylases at the used dosage and treatment length. As expected, renal mRNA expression of Cyp27b1 was reduced and Cyp24a1 was increased in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. However, the 25-hydroxylases were rather unaffected by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment.The analyzed vitamin D hydroxylases are regulated in a tissue and treatment-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2803192212,"Households in low-income settings are vulnerable to seasonal changes in dietary diversity because of fluctuations in food availability and access. We assessed seasonal differences in household dietary diversity in Burkina Faso, and determined the extent to which household socioeconomic status and crop production diversity modify changes in dietary diversity across seasons, using data from the nationally representative 2014 Burkina Faso Continuous Multisectoral Survey (EMC). A household dietary diversity score based on nine food groups was created from household food consumption data collected during four rounds of the 2014 EMC. Plot-level crop production data, and data on household assets and education were used to create variables on crop diversity and household socioeconomic status, respectively. Analyses included data for 10,790 households for which food consumption data were available for at least one round. Accounting for repeated measurements and controlling for the complex survey design and confounding covariates using a weighted multi-level model, household dietary diversity was significantly higher during both lean seasons periods, and higher still during the harvest season as compared to the post-harvest season (mean: post-harvest: 4.76 (SE 0.04); beginning of lean: 5.13 (SE 0.05); end of lean: 5.21 (SE 0.05); harvest: 5.72 (SE 0.04)), but was not different between the beginning and the end of lean season. Seasonal differences in household dietary diversity were greater among households with higher food expenditures, greater crop production, and greater monetary value of crops sale (P<0.05). Seasonal changes in household dietary diversity in Burkina Faso may reflect nutritional differences among agricultural households, and may be modified both by households' socioeconomic status and agricultural characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2804934607,"Titanium (Ti) and Ti-6 Aluminium-4 Vanadium alloys are the most common materials in implants composition but β type alloys are promising biomaterials because they present better mechanical properties. Besides the composition of biomaterial, many factors influence the performance of the biomaterial. For example, porous surface may modify the functional cellular response and accelerate osseointegration. This paper presents in vitro and in vivo evaluations of powder metallurgy-processed porous samples composed by different titanium alloys and pure Ti, aiming to show their potential for biomedical applications. The porous surfaces samples were produced with different designs to in vitro and in vivo tests. Samples were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and elastic modulus analyses. Osteogenic cells from newborn rat calvaria were plated on discs of different materials: G1—commercially pure Ti group (CpTi); G2—Ti-6Al-4V alloy; G3—Ti-13 Niobium-13 Zirconium alloy; G4—Ti-35 Niobium alloy; G5—Ti-35 Niobium-7 Zirconium-5 Tantalum alloy. Cell adhesion and viability, total protein content, alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization nodules and gene expression (alkaline phosphatase, Runx-2, osteocalcin and osteopontin) were assessed. After 2 and 4 weeks of implantation in rabbit tibia, bone ingrowth was analyzed using micro-computed tomography (μCT). EDS analysis confirmed the material production of each group. Metallographic and SEM analysis revealed interconnected pores, with mean pore size of 99,5μm and mean porosity of 42%, without significant difference among the groups (p>0.05). The elastic modulus values did not exhibit difference among the groups (p>0.05). Experimental alloys demonstrated better results than CpTi and Ti-6Al-4V, in gene expression and cytokines analysis, especially in early experimental periods. In conclusion, our data suggests that the experimental alloys can be used for biomedical application since they contributed to excellent cellular behavior and osseointegration besides presenting lower elastic modulus."

First, the Sum-Modified-Laplacian is applied to measure the focus of multi-focus images. Then the density-based region growing algorithm is utilized to segment the focused region mask of each image. Finally, the mask is decomposed into a mask pyramid to supervise region mosaicking on a Laplacian pyramid. The region level pyramid keeps more original information than the pixel level. The experiment results show that RMLP has best performance in quantitative comparison with other methods. In addition, RMLP is insensitive to noise and can reduces the color distortion of the fused images on two datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2803695704,"Bioinformatics analyses of caleosin/peroxygenases (CLO/PXG) demonstrated that these genes are present in the vast majority of Viridiplantae taxa for which sequence data are available. Functionally active CLO/PXG proteins with roles in abiotic stress tolerance and lipid droplet storage are present in some Trebouxiophycean and Chlorophycean green algae but are absent from the small number of sequenced Prasinophyceaen genomes. CLO/PXG-like genes are expressed during dehydration stress in Charophyte algae, a sister clade of the land plants (Embryophyta). CLO/PXG-like sequences are also present in all of the >300 sequenced Embryophyte genomes, where some species contain as many as 10–12 genes that have arisen via selective gene duplication. Angiosperm genomes harbour at least one copy each of two distinct CLO/PX isoforms, termed H (high) and L (low), where H-forms contain an additional C-terminal motif of about 30–50 residues that is absent from L-forms. In contrast, species in other Viridiplantae taxa, including green algae, non-vascular plants, ferns and gymnosperms, contain only one (or occasionally both) of these isoforms per genome. Transcriptome and biochemical data show that CLO/PXG-like genes have complex patterns of developmental and tissue-specific expression. CLO/PXG proteins can associate with cytosolic lipid droplets and/or bilayer membranes. Many of the analysed isoforms also have peroxygenase activity and are involved in oxylipin metabolism. The distribution of CLO/PXG-like genes is consistent with an origin >1 billion years ago in at least two of the earliest diverging groups of the Viridiplantae, namely the Chlorophyta and the Streptophyta, after the Viridiplantae had already diverged from other Archaeplastidal groups such as the Rhodophyta and Glaucophyta. While algal CLO/PXGs have roles in lipid packaging and stress responses, the Embryophyte proteins have a much wider spectrum of roles and may have been instrumental in the colonisation of terrestrial habitats and the subsequent diversification as the major land flora."
https://openalex.org/W2951764736,"Numerous in vitro studies have yielded a refined picture of the structural and molecular associations between Cyclic-AMP receptor protein (Crp), the DNA motif, and RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme.

Surprisingly, Crp was found to provide little to no protection of the DNA motif under activating conditions. Instead, Crp demonstrated binding patterns that closely resembled those generated by σ70. The binding patterns of both Crp and σ70 are indicative of RNAP holoenzyme DNA footprinting profiles associated with stages during transcription initiation that occur post-recruitment. This is marked by a pronounced advancement of the template strand footprint profile to the +20 position relative to the transcription start site and a multimodal distribution on the nontemplate strand. This trend was also observed in the familial transcription factor, Fnr, but full protection of the motif was seen in the repressor ArcA. Given the time-scale of ChIP studies and that the rate-limiting step in transcription initiation is typically post recruitment, we propose a hypothesis where Crp is absent from the DNA motif but remains associated with RNAP holoenzyme post-recruitment during transcription initiation. The release of Crp from the DNA motif may be a result of energetic changes that occur as RNAP holoenzyme traverses the various stable intermediates towards elongation complex formation."

https://openalex.org/W2803963529,"Previous studies indicated that cognitive conflict continues to bias actions even after a movement has been initiated. The present paper examined whether cognitive control also biases actions after movement initiation. To this end, we had participants perform a Stroop task in which we manipulated the item-specific proportion of (in)congruent trials (80% congruent vs. 20% congruent). Importantly, participants responded via mouse movements, allowing us to evaluate various movement parameters: initiation times, movement times, and movement accuracy. Results showed that mouse movements were faster and more accurate during congruent trials compared to incongruent trials. Moreover, we observed that this congruency effect was larger for 80% congruent compared to 20% congruent items, which reflects item-specific cognitive control. Notably, when responses were initiated very fast - rendering virtually no time for stimulus processing before movement onset - this item-specific control was observed only in movement times. However, for relatively slow initiated responses, item specific control was observed both in initiation and in movement times. These findings demonstrate that item-specific cognitive control biases actions before and after movement initiation."

https://openalex.org/W2803743005,"Burkholderia pseudomallei, a gram-negative intracellular bacillus, is the causative agent of a tropical infectious disease called melioidosis. Bacterial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters import and export a variety of molecules across bacterial cell membranes. At present, their significance in B. pseudomallei pathogenesis is poorly understood. We report here characterization of the BPSL1039-1040 ABC transporter. B. pseudomallei cultured in M9 medium supplemented with nitrate, demonstrated that BPSL1039-1040 is involved in nitrate transport for B. pseudomallei growth under anaerobic, but not aerobic conditions, suggesting that BPSL1039-1040 is functional under reduced oxygen tension. In addition, a nitrate reduction assay supported the function of BPSL1039-1040 as nitrate importer. A bpsl1039-1040 deficient mutant showed reduced biofilm formation as compared with the wild-type strain (P = 0.027) when cultured in LB medium supplemented with nitrate under anaerobic growth conditions. This reduction was not noticeable under aerobic conditions. This suggests that a gradient in oxygen levels could regulate the function of BPSL1039-1040 in B. pseudomallei nitrate metabolism. Furthermore, the B. pseudomallei bpsl1039-1040 mutant had a pronounced effect on plaque formation (P < 0.001), and was defective in intracellular survival in both non-phagocytic (HeLa) and phagocytic (J774A.1 macrophage) cells, suggesting reduced virulence in the mutant strain. The bpsl1039-1040 mutant was found to be attenuated in a BALB/c mouse intranasal infection model. Complementation of the bpsl1039-1040 deficient mutant with the plasmid-borne bpsl1039 gene could restore the phenotypes observed. We propose that the ability to acquire nitrate for survival under anaerobic conditions may, at least in part, be important for intracellular survival and has a contributory role in the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei."
https://openalex.org/W2804536885,"Objective This study aims to validate the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as a biometric modality based on two straightforward binary QRS template matching characteristics. Different perspectives of the human verification problem are considered, regarding the optimal lead selection and stability over sample size, gender, age, heart rate (HR). Methods A clinical 12-lead resting ECG database, including a population of 460 subjects with two-session recordings (>1 year apart) is used. Cost-effective strategies for extraction of personalized QRS patterns (100ms) and binary template matching estimate similarity in the time scale (matching time) and dissimilarity in the amplitude scale (mismatch area). The two-class person verification task, taking the decision to validate or to reject the subject identity is managed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Non-redundant LDA models for different lead configurations (I,II,III,aVF,aVL,aVF,V1-V6) are trained on the first half of 230 subjects by stepwise feature selection until maximization of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC). The operating point on the training ROC at equal error rate (EER) is tested on the independent dataset (second half of 230 subjects) to report unbiased validation of test-ROC AUC and true verification rate (TVR = 100-EER). The test results are further evaluated in groups by sample size, gender, age, HR. Results and discussion The optimal QRS pattern projection for single-lead ECG biometric modality is found in the frontal plane sector (60°-0°) with best (Test-AUC/TVR) for lead II (0.941/86.8%) and slight accuracy drop for -aVR (-0.017/-1.4%), I (-0.01/-1.5%). Chest ECG leads have degrading accuracy from V1 (0.885/80.6%) to V6 (0.799/71.8%). The multi-lead ECG improves verification: 6-chest (0.97/90.9%), 6-limb (0.986/94.3%), 12-leads (0.995/97.5%). The QRS pattern matching model shows stable performance for verification of 10 to 230 individuals; insignificant degradation of TVR in women by (1.2–3.6%), adults ≥70 years (3.7%), younger <40 years (1.9%), HR<60bpm (1.2%), HR>90bpm (3.9%), no degradation for HR change (0 to >20bpm)."
https://openalex.org/W2803321275,"Meat quality is closely related to adipose tissues in ducks, and adipogenesis is controlled by a complex network of transcription factors tightly acting at different stages of differentiation especially in ducks. The aim of this study was to establish the preadipocyte in vitro culture system and understand the biological characteristics of expansion of duck adipocyte tissue at the cellular and molecular level. We isolated pre-adipocytes from the subcutaneous fat of three breeds of duck and differentiated them into mature adipocytes using a mixture of insulin, rosiglitazone, dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and oleic acid over 0,2, 4, 6, and 8 days. Successful differentiation was confirmed from the development of lipid droplets and their response to Oil Red O, and increasing numbers of lipid droplets were stained red over time. The expression of key marker genes, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα), adipocyte fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), and fatty acid synthetase (FAS), gradually increased during pre-adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, it was verified by interference experiments that the knockdown of PPARγ directly reduced lipid production. Meanwhile we analyzed the role of unsaturated fatty acids in the production of poultry fat using different concentrations of oleic acid and found that lipid droplet deposition was highest when the concentration of oleic acid was 300 μM. We also compared the level of differentiated pre-adipocytes that were isolated from Jianchang ducks (fatty-meat duck), Cherry Valley ducks (lean-meat duck) and White-crested ducks (egg-producing duck). The proliferation and differentiation rate of pre-adipocytes derived from Jianchang ducks was higher than that of White-crested ducks. These results provide the foundation for further research into waterfowl adipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2803868246,"Rapamycin, an immunosuppressant, is widely used in patients with kidney transplant. However, the therapeutic effects of rapamycin remain controversial. Additionally, previous studies have revealed deleterious effects of rapamycin predominantly when administered for ≥24 h. Few studies, however, have focused on the short term effects of rapamycin administered only during the initial reperfusion phase. As such, we designed this study to explore the potential effects and mechanisms of rapamycin under a specific therapeutic regimen in which rapamycin is mixed in the perfusate during the initial reperfusion phase (within 24 h). Interestingly, we found that rapamycin maintained renal function and attenuated ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced apoptosis in vivo and in vitro during the initial reperfusion phase, especially at 8 h after reperfusion. Simultaneously, rapamycin activated autophagy and inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and 3 pathways of unfolding protein response: ATF6, PERK, and IRE1α. Interestingly, we further found that the protective effects of rapamycin were suppressed when autophagy was inhibited by chloroquine and 3-methyladenine or when ER stress was induced by thapsigargin. Moreover, in terms of the regulatory effects of rapamycin, a negative-feedback loop between autophagy and ER stress occurred, with autophagy inhibiting ER stress and increased ER stress promoting autophagy during the initial reperfusion phase of renal I/R injury. Our study provides evidence that immediate reperfusion with rapamycin during the initial reperfusion phase repairs renal function and reduces apoptosis via activating autophagy, which could further inhibit ER stress. These results suggest a novel treatment modality for application during the initial reperfusion phase of renal I/R injury caused by kidney transplantation.—Li, X., Zhu, G., Gou, X., He, W., Yin, H., Yang, X., Li, J.

https://openalex.org/W2803368713,"Invasion potential should be part of the evaluation of candidate species for any species introduction. However, estimating invasion risks remains a challenging problem, particularly in complex landscapes. Certain plant traits are generally considered to increase invasive potential and there is an understanding that landscapes influence invasions dynamics, but little research has been done to explore how those drivers of invasions interact. We evaluate the relative roles of, and potential interactions between, plant invasiveness traits and landscape characteristics on invasions with a case study using a model parameterized for the potentially invasive biomass crop, Miscanthus × giganteus. Using that model we simulate invasions on 1000 real landscapes to evaluate how landscape characteristics, including both composition and spatial structure, affect invasion outcomes. We conducted replicate simulations with differing strengths of plant invasiveness traits (dispersal ability, establishment ability, population growth rate, and the ability to utilize dispersal corridors) to evaluate how the importance of landscape characteristics for predicting invasion patterns changes depending on the invader details. Analysis of simulations showed that the presence of highly suitable habitat (e.g., grasslands) is generally the strongest determinant of invasion dynamics but that there are also more subtle interactions between landscapes and invader traits. These effects can also vary between different aspects of invasion dynamics (short vs. long time scales and population size vs. spatial extent). These results illustrate that invasions are complex emergent processes with multiple drivers and effective management needs to reflect the ecology of the species of interest and the particular goals or risks for which efforts need to be optimized."

https://openalex.org/W2804099706,"Increasing evidence shows that active sites of proteins have non-trivial conformational dynamics. These dynamics include active site residues sampling different local conformations that allow for multiple, and possibly novel, inhibitor binding poses. Yet, active site dynamics garner only marginal attention in most inhibitor design efforts and exert little influence on synthesis strategies. This is partly because synthesis requires a level of atomic structural detail that is frequently missing in current characterizations of conformational dynamics. In particular, while the identity of the mobile protein residues may be clear, the specific conformations they sample remain obscure. Here, we show how an appropriate choice of ligand can significantly sharpen our abilities to describe the interconverting binding poses (conformations) of protein active sites. Specifically, we show how 2-(2’-carboxyphenyl)-benzoyl-6-aminopenicillanic acid (CBAP) exposes otherwise hidden dynamics of a protein active site that binds β-lactam antibiotics. When CBAP acylates (binds) the active site serine of the β-lactam sensor domain of BlaR1 (BlaRS), it shifts the time scale of the active site dynamics to the slow exchange regime. Slow exchange enables direct characterization of inter-converting protein and bound ligand conformations using NMR methods. These methods include chemical shift analysis, 2-d exchange spectroscopy, off-resonance ROESY of the bound ligand, and reduced spectral density mapping. The active site architecture of BlaRS is shared by many β-lactamases of therapeutic interest, suggesting CBAP could expose functional motions in other β-lactam binding proteins. More broadly, CBAP highlights the utility of identifying chemical probes common to structurally homologous proteins to better expose functional motions of active sites."
https://openalex.org/W2803776363,"Introduction Fluoroscopy is currently the standard imaging modality for curettage of atypical cartilaginous tumors/chondrosarcoma grade 1 (ACT/CS1). Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) is a possible alternative, offering higher resolution imaging and continuous three-dimensional feedback without ionizing radiation use. CAS hypothetically makes curettage more accurate, thereby decreasing residue or recurrence rate. This study aims to compare CAS and fluoroscopy in curettage of ACT/CS1. Patients and methods A single center retrospective cohort study was performed. CAS and fluoroscopy were used in parallel. Included were patients who had curettage for ACT/CS1in the long bones, with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Tumor volume was determined on pre-operative MRI scans. Outcome comprised local recurrence rates, residue rates, complications and procedure time. Results Seventy-seven patients were included, 17 in the CAS cohort, 60 in the fluoroscopy cohort. Tumor volume was significantly larger in the CAS cohort (p = 0.04). There were no recurrences in either group. Residual tumor (2/17 vs. 7/60), complications did not differ significantly: fracture rate (3/17 vs. 6/60); nor did surgical time (1.26h vs. 1.34h). Discussion CAS curettage showed good oncologic results. Outcome was comparable to fluoroscopy, while not using ionizing radiation. There was no significant difference in surgical time. Residue rates can likely be decreased with specific software functions and surgical tools."

Maintenance of telomere length is performed by the enzyme telomerase. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is a subunit of telomerase, and its dysfunction affects telomere shortening. This study assessed whether maternal or fetal genetic variations in the hTERT gene are associated with PTL or pPROM.A case (PTL or pPROM) control (term birth) genetic association study was conducted in 654 non-Hispanic white mothers (438 term, 162 PTL, 54 pPROM) and 502 non-Hispanic white newborns (346 term, 116 PTB, 40 pPROM). Maternal and fetal DNA samples were genotyped for 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the hTERT gene. Allele frequencies were compared between cases and controls, stratified by PTL and pPROM. Maternal and fetal data were analyzed separately.Allelic differences in one SNP of hTERT (rs2853690) were significantly associated with both PTL (adjusted OR 2.24, 95%CI 1.64-3.06, p = 2.32e-05) and with pPROM (adjusted OR 7.54, 95%CI 3.96-14.33, p = 2.39e-07) in maternal DNA. There was no significant association between the hTERT SNPs analyzed and PTL or pPROM in the fetal samples.hTERT polymorphisms in fetal DNA do not associate with PTL or pPROM risk; however, maternal genetic variations in hTERT may play a contributory role in risk of PTL and PPROM."
https://openalex.org/W2799626005,"The spatial location of proteins in living cells can be critical for their function. For example, the E. coli chemotaxis machinery is localized to the cell poles. Here we describe the polar localization of the serine chemoreceptor Tsr using a strain synthesizing a fluorescent Tsr-Venus fusion at a low level from a single-copy chromosomal construct. Using photobleaching and imaging during recovery by new synthesis, we observed distinct asymmetry between a bright (old) pole and a dim (new) pole. The old pole was shown to be a more stable cluster and to recover after photobleaching faster, which is consistent with the hypothesis that newly synthesized Tsr proteins are inserted directly at or near the old pole. The new pole was shown to be a less stable cluster and to exchange proteins freely with highly mobile Tsr-Venus proteins diffusing in the membrane. We propose that the new pole arises from molecules escaping from the old pole and diffusing to the new pole where a more stable cluster forms over time. Our localization imaging data support a model in which a nascent new pole forms prior to stable cluster formation."
https://openalex.org/W2803129831,"The R-package BIOdry allows to model and compare fluctuations of Tree-ring Width (TRW) and climate, or dendroclimatic fluctuations, while accounting for source variability. The package eases multilevel modeling and multivariate comparison in dendroclimatic analysis using the nlme and ecodist packages, respectively. For implementing such libraries, the in-package algorithms transform the dendroclimatic fluctuations into Multilevel Dendroclimatic Data Series and maintain categorical variables and time units in the outputs. The dendroclimatic modeling is developed with two functions: modelFrame and muleMan. The first function binds core-level cumulative TRWs to the processed data sets and subtracts trends in TRWs by fitting multilevel log-linear growth formulas or multilevel linear formulas. modelFrame can also model within-group fluctuations in dendroclimatic variables other than tree-radial increments such as aridity indices or allometric components of tree growth: e.g. diameters at breast height over bark, tree basal areas, total tree biomass, among other. The second function compares fluctuations in modelFrame objects that share outermost categorical variable and annual records. Here, we use BIOdry to model dendroclimatic relationships in northern and east-central Spain to illustrate future users in the implementation of the package for modeling ecological relationships in space and time."
