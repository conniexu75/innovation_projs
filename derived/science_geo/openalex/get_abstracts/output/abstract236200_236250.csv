https://openalex.org/W2247766769,The ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project aims to identify all functional elements in the human genome sequence. The pilot phase of the Project is focused on a specified 30 megabases (∼1%) of the human genome sequence and is organized as an international consortium of computational and laboratory-based scientists working to develop and apply high-throughput approaches for detecting all sequence elements that confer biological function. The results of this pilot phase will guide future efforts to analyze the entire human genome.
https://openalex.org/W2125937596,"Signaling by the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) involves its release from inhibitor kappa B (IκB) in the cytosol, followed by translocation into the nucleus. NF-κB regulation of IκBα transcription represents a delayed negative feedback loop that drives oscillations in NF-κB translocation. Single-cell time-lapse imaging and computational modeling of NF-κB (RelA) localization showed asynchronous oscillations following cell stimulation that decreased in frequency with increased IκBα transcription. Transcription of target genes depended on oscillation persistence, involving cycles of RelA phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The functional consequences of NF-κB signaling may thus depend on number, period, and amplitude of oscillations."

Such concepts are transforming current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to medicine and, together with new technologies, will enable a predictive and preventive medicine that will lead to personalized medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2013802515,"Single-photon–added coherent states are the result of the most elementary amplification process of classical light fields by a single quantum of excitation. Being intermediate between a single-photon Fock state (fully quantum-mechanical) and a coherent (classical) one, these states offer the opportunity to closely follow the smooth transition between the particle-like and the wavelike behavior of light. We report the experimental generation of single-photon–added coherent states and their complete characterization by quantum tomography. Besides visualizing the evolution of the quantum-to-classical transition, these states allow one to witness the gradual change from the spontaneous to the stimulated regimes of light emission."
https://openalex.org/W2027379868,"The efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity. In mammalian cells, the nonhomologous end-joining process that represents the predominant repair pathway relies on the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and the XRCC4-DNA ligase IV complex. Nonetheless, several in vitro and in vivo results indicate that mammalian cells use more than a single end-joining mechanism. While searching for a DNA-PK-independent end-joining activity, we found that the pretreatment of DNA-PK-proficient and -deficient rodent cells with an inhibitor of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 enzyme (PARP-1) led to increased cytotoxicity of the highly efficient DNA double-strand breaking compound calicheamicin γ1. In addition, the repair kinetics of the DSBs induced by calicheamicin γ1 was delayed both in PARP-1-proficient cells pretreated with the PARP-1 inhibitor and in PARP-1-deficient cells. In order to get new insights into the mechanism of an alternative route for DSBs repair, we have established a new synapsis and end-joining two-step assay in vitro, operating on DSBs with either nuclear protein extracts or recombinant proteins. We found an end-joining activity independent of the DNA-PK/XRCC4-ligase IV complex but that actually required a novel synapsis activity of PARP-1 and the ligation activity of the XRCC1-DNA ligase III complex, proteins otherwise involved in the base excision repair pathway. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that a PARP-1-dependent DSBs end-joining activity may exist in mammalian cells. We propose that this mechanism could act as an alternative route of DSBs repair that complements the DNA-PK/XRCC4/ligase IV-dependent nonhomologous end-joining.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSBs, DNA double-strand breaks; NHEJ, nonhomologous end-joining; HR, homologous recombination; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, catalytic subunit of DNA-PK; IR, ionizing radiations; SSBs, single-strand breaks; PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1; XL, XRCC1/DNA ligase III; BER, base excision repair; DIQ, 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinolin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; NE, nuclear extracts; XL, XRCC1-DNA ligase III. represent normal intermediates during physiological processes like meiosis or V(D)J recombination but also toxic lesions produced by collapsed DNA replication forks and by DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation (IR) or reactive oxygen species. Repair of DSBs is critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity because unproperly repaired breaks can lead to cancer via chromosomal aberrations (1Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 396: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3391) Google Scholar, 2Mills K.D. Ferguson D.O. Alt F.W. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 194: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, DSBs are repaired through two major pathways: homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) (for reviews see Refs. 3Jackson S.P. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 4van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev.

Sung P. Tomkinson A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 74: 159-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is largely admitted that DSBs are repaired by NHEJ at least in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, whereas HR operates in late S/G2 (7Rothkamm K. Kruger I. Thompson L.H. Lobrich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23 (and references therein): 5706-5715Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The NHEJ process requires several factors that recognize and bind the double-strand break, catalyze the synapsis of the broken ends, and then process and reseal the break (8Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 712-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 9Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The NHEJ pathway relies on a set of proteins comprising at least (i) a DNA end binding activity, the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) that consists of the catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs and the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer (10Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 11Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), and (ii) a DNA break resealing activity, the XRCC4-DNA ligase IV complex (12Li Z. Otevrel T. Gao Y. Cheng H.L. Seed B.

In order to gain insight into the NHEJ mechanism, both in vitro and in vivo approaches have been undertaken. The end-joining reaction has been studied in vitro by various assays, many of them using incubation with cell extracts of plasmid DNA linearized by enzymatic restriction as a model for DSBs containing substrates (17Labhart P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Results of these in vitro repair experiments have brought substantial evidence for an alternative DNA-PK-independent end-joining pathway (18Cheong N. Perrault A.R. Wang H. Wachsberger P. Mammen P.

Biochem. 2004; 92: 781-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In vivo studies also support the hypothesis that several DNA end-joining pathways exist either in yeast (25Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 26Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5093-50103Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) or in mammalian cells (27DiBiase S.J. Zeng Z.C. Chen R. Hyslop T. Curran Jr., W.J. Iliakis G.

Morton C.C. Alt F.W. Cell. 2002; 109: 811-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). For example, end-joining of restricted DNA remained efficient after transfection of cells deficient in various components of the DNA-PK-dependent pathway and relied mostly on an end homology-dependent mechanism (29Verkaik N.S. Esveldt-van Lange R.E. van Heemst D. Bruggenwirth H.T. Hoeijmakers J.H. Zdzienicka M.Z. van Gent D.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Also, it was shown recently that Ku was dispensable for the microhomology-directed rejoining of an intrachromosomal DSB (32Guirouilh-Barbat J. Huck S. Bertrand P. Pirzio L. Desmaze C. Sabatier L. Lopez B.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Taken together, these in vitro and in vivo studies strongly suggest that end-joining of DSBs relies on more than the DNA-PK-dependent pathway. Any candidate for an alternative end-joining pathway of DSBs would recognize DNA ends, and its defect would have an impact on cell survival to double-strand breaking agents. Based on its high binding affinity for DNA DSBs (33Weinfeld M. Chaudhry M.A. D'Amours D. Pelletier J.D. Poirier G.G. Povirk L.F. Lees-Miller S.P. Radiat. Res. 1997; 148: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34D'Silva I. Pelletier J.D. Lagueux J. D'Amours D. Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. Lees-Miller S.P. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the involvement of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 protein (PARP-1) in sensing and/or repairing DSBs can be hypothesized. PARP-1 is involved in different cellular processes, including the DNA base excision repair pathway (BER), responsible for the removal of alkylated bases and abasic sites (for reviews see Refs. 35Bouchard V.J. Rouleau M. Poirier G.G. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 446-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 36Burkle A.

PARP-1 catalyzes the covalent transfer of successive units of ADP-ribose moiety from NAD to itself and other nuclear protein acceptors in a manner dependent upon the presence of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs). A possible role of PARP-1 in the repair of DSBs is supported by the following points. (i) Ku heterodimer does not represent the sole DSBs recognition complex in cell extracts because it was originally pointed out that PARP-1 is activated in vitro not only by SSBs but also by DSBs (39Benjamin R.C. Gill D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10502-10508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that purified PARP-1 binds to DSBs with an efficacy higher than to SSBs (33Weinfeld M. Chaudhry M.A. D'Amours D. Pelletier J.D. Poirier G.G. Povirk L.F. Lees-Miller S.P. Radiat. Res. 1997; 148: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34D'Silva I. Pelletier J.D. Lagueux J.

Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. Lees-Miller S.P. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). (ii) PARP-1 has been shown to interact with both subunits of DNA-PK (40Galande S. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20521-20528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 41Ariumi Y. Masutani M. Copeland T.D. Mimori T. Sugimura T. Shimotohno K. Ueda K. Hatanaka M. Noda M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4616-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and to catalyze their poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (42Li B. Navarro S. Kasahara N. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13659-13667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 43Ruscetti T. Lehnert B.E. Halbrook J. LeTrong H. Hoekstra M.F. Chen D.J. Peterson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14461-14467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). (iii) In cells, nuclear areas of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation were induced concomitantly to the formation of direct DSBs via V(D)J recombination in the absence of functional DNA-PK (44Brown M.L. Franco D. Burkle A. Chang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4532-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). (iv) DSB repair was delayed under conditions of overexpression of the catalytically inactive DNA-binding domain of PARP-1 (45Rudat V. Bachmann N. Kupper J.H. Weber K.J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2001; 77: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or when cells were pretreated with a PARP-1 inhibitor (46Bryant P.E. Johnston P.J. Mutat. Res. 1993; 299: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 47Chung H.W. Phillips J.W. Winegar R.A. Preston R.J. Morgan W.F. Radiat.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7322-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Despite all these data, no biochemical experiments were yet specifically devoted to substantiate the potential role of PARP-1 in the repair of DSBs. Classical DSB-inducing agents such as IR mostly induce SSBs and base damage but only a few percent of DSBs. Therefore, we have used calicheamicin γ1 that is a more potent producer of DSBs (51Elmroth K. Nygren J. Martensson S. Ismail I.H. Hammarsten O. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We initially found that both chemical PARP inhibition or genetic loss of PARP-1 function impaired DSBs repair. Then we developed a DNA pull-down assay using nuclear extracts (NE) from mammalian cells. By using this approach, we have identified a new synapsis and end-joining activity independent of the classical NHEJ proteins. We have reconstituted this DSB end-joining activity with recombinant PARP-1, XRCC1, and DNA ligase III, proteins otherwise involved in BER (52Caldecott K.W. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 955-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that a PARP-1-dependent DSB end-joining mechanism operates in cells as an alternative route that complements the DNA-PK/XRCC4/ligase IV-dependent NHEJ. Cells Lines and Culture—EM9 (XRCC1 mutant) and AA8 (parental Chinese hamster) cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. L. Thompson (Livermore, CA). PARP-1–/– and control mouse embryonic fibroblasts were a gift from Dr. G. de Murcia (Illkirch, France). The Ku80-deficient xrs6 cell line and the control xrs6/haKu80 cell line transfected with the hamster Ku80 cDNA were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Culture (Salisbury, UK). Dr. G. Whitmore (Toronto, Ontario) generously provided us with the DNA-PKcs mutant V3 cell line. Cell lines were grown in α-minimum Eagle's medium (CHO cells) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (MEF cells) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 125 units/ml penicillin, and 125 μg/ml streptomycin. Clonogenic Survival Assays—Cells growing in exponential phase in tissue culture flasks were trypsinized, and 500 cells per 35-mm Petri dish were plated and left to attach for 24 h. Calicheamicin γ1, a generous gift from P. R. Hamann (Wyeth Research, Pearl River, NY), was dissolved in ethanol and stored at –70 °C. The drug was diluted in uncomplemented culture medium immediately before use and added directly to the cell culture. When indicated, 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinolin (DIQ, Sigma) dissolved in Me2SO was added to the cell culture medium at 10 μm 1 h before calicheamicin γ1. The dishes were then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 7 days. Dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and colonies were stained with crystal violet (2 mg/ml). Triplicate wells were seeded per point. Colonies containing over 50 cells were scored under an inverted microscope. Antibodies—Anti-actin, anti-Ku70 (N3H10), anti-Ku80 (clone 111), anti-Ku70/80 (clone 162), and anti-XRCC1 (33-2-5) monoclonal antibodies were from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). The monoclonal anti-PARP-1 antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc., and anti-PAR monoclonal antibody was from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies anti-XRCC4 and anti-DNA ligase IV were from Serotec Ltd. (Oxford, UK) and from Abcam Ltd. (Cambridge, UK), respectively. Monoclonal antibodies anti-phosphorylated H2AX (JBW301) and anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PC10) were from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Milton Keynes, UK) and DAKO (Denmark), respectively. Immunoblotting—Protein samples were heated with SDS sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and proteins were immunoblotted with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then probed with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Specific proteins were visualized as immunoreactive bands by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce). γ-H2AX Dephosphorylation Assay—Cells growing in exponential phase in tissue culture flasks were trypsinized, and 6 × 105 cells per well were plated in 6-well tissue culture dishes and left to attach for 24 h. Cells were pretreated for 1 h with or without 100 μm DIQ and then treated in serum-free media with 3 pm calicheamicin γ1 in the presence or absence of DIQ. The cells were then rinsed twice and post-incubated in fresh culture medium still in the presence of DIQ when necessary, for the time indicated. At each time point, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped, spun down for 4 min at 1000 rpm, and resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS-SDS 1%). Extracts were boiled for 10 min and sonicated for 20 s. Protein samples were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and immunoblotted as described above. Nuclear Protein Extracts Preparation—HeLa nuclear extracts were purchased from Computer Cell Culture Center (Seneffe, Belgium). Nuclear extracts from EM9, AA8, and PARP-1–/– cells were prepared as described previously (53Calsou P. Frit P. Salles B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27601-27607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For actin or Ku immunodepletions, anti-actin and anti-Ku70/80 (clone 162) were coupled to magnetic anti-mouse IgG beads (Dynabeads M-450, Dynal). For XRCC4 immunodepletion, anti-XRCC4 antibodies were coupled to magnetic anti-rabbit IgG beads (Dynabeads M-280, Dynal), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Two successive depletions with each antibody were performed as described (54Calsou P. Delteil C. Frit P. Drouet J. Salles B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides Substrates—Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Sigma Genosys. The blunt-end YC0 DNA fragment was constructed by annealing the 30-nucleotide oligomer 5′-TAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTGGGTACCGGTGTT-3′ biotinylated on the 5′-end with the complementary C0 nonbiotinylated oligonucleotide. The 5′ YC protruding oligonucleotides were constructed by annealing the 30-mer biotinylated as above with nonbiotinylated oligonucleotides bearing various protruding 5′-ends (5′-CG-3′ for C2, 5′-GGCC-3′ for C4, 5′-CGATCG-3′ for C6, 5′-CGTTAACG-3′ for C8, and 5′-AATT-3′ for NC, respectively). The 4-nucleotide 3′-protruding DNA fragment YC4 –3′ was constructed by annealing the C0 oligonucleotide with the oligonucleotide 5′-TAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTGGGTACCGGTG-TTCCGG-3′, biotinylated on the 5′-end. All YC fragments contained an AluI restriction site at position +15. In each case, the nonbiotinylated oligomer was phosphorylated at the 5′-end by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), and unincorporated ATP was removed by gel filtration (Sepharose G-50, Amersham Biosciences). In order to construct radiolabeled oligomers, the T4 polynucleotide kinase reaction was performed in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci mmol–1, ICN Pharmaceuticals), and unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by gel filtration as above. DNA Pull-down Assay—40 pmol of YC oligonucleotide were immobilized on 100 μl of streptavidin paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads M280 streptavidin, Dynal) as recommended by the manufacturer. 5 μl of mock- or DNA-treated beads were washed in reaction buffer A (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KOAc, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and then incubated under gentle agitation in a final 10-μl reaction at 30 °C for 1 h with 30 μg of NE, with or without 1 mm NAD (Sigma) as indicated. The supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed twice in an excess volume of reaction buffer, and 0.2 pmol of radioactive YC DNA fragment preincubated with 5 pmol of soluble streptavidin (Sigma) was added in a final 10-μl reaction with or without 1 mm ATP for 1 h at 30°C. Beads were washed twice in an excess volume of reaction buffer. For analysis of the pulled down DNA, beads were heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min and incubated in a final 20-μl reaction with 10 units of AluI, plus 10 units of HaeIII, 10 units of MseI, or 10 units of MboI when necessary (all from New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 37 °C. Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide denaturing gels, and autoradiography of the gel was processed with a PhosphorImager (Storm System™, Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative analysis of the gel was performed with the ImageQuant software (5.2 version). Adenylation Assay—After incubation with nuclear extracts as above, DNA beads were reacted for 1 h at 30 °C under gentle agitation in reaction buffer containing 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). After five washes in reaction buffer, DNA beads were heated in SDS sample buffer and resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Adenylated proteins were detected by autoradiography of the membrane processed with a PhosphorImager (Storm System™, Amersham Biosciences). DNA Rejoining Assay with Purified and Recombinant Proteins—The vector coding for the histidine-tagged recombinant human DNA ligase III was a kind gift from Dr. T. Lindahl and Dr. D. Barnes, and the protein was produced as described (55Nash R.A. Caldecott K.W. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5207-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recombinant human XRCC1 was provided by J. P. Radicella (CEA, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France) and was produced as described (56Vidal A.E. Boiteux S. Hickson I.D. Radicella J.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6530-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Human recombinant PARP-1 protein (95% purity) was from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD). For the reaction with purified recombinant proteins PARP-1, XRCC1 and DNA ligase III were preincubated in reaction buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KOAc, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 30 °C for 10 min prior to 30 min of incubation with DNA beads at 30 °C, and the reaction was then conducted in reaction buffer B as in the DNA pull-down assay with nuclear extracts. Effect of PARP-1 Inhibition on the Cytotoxicity of Calicheamicin γ1—If PARP-1 is involved in an end-joining reaction in vivo, a specific inhibitor should potentiate the cytotoxic effect of a DSB inducer. Indeed, previous reports (48Veuger S.J. Curtin N.J. Richardson C.J. Smith G.C. Durkacz B.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6008-6015PubMed Google Scholar, 49Boulton S. Kyle S. Durkacz B.W. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 50Veuger S.J. Curtin N.J. Smith G.C. Durkacz B.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7322-7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have shown such potentiation effect when IR was used in combination with a PARP-1 inhibitor. However, IR produce mainly SSBs, despite the fact that DSBs are believed to be responsible for cell toxicity (57Iliakis G. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Consequently, we used calicheamicin γ1 as a DSB generator. This natural hydrophobic enediyne antibiotic has been shown to produce DSBs with selectivity and efficiency higher than IR, yielding a 1:3 ratio of DNA DSBs to SSBs in vivo, compared with a 1:20 ratio for IR (51Elmroth K. Nygren J. Martensson S. Ismail I.H. Hammarsten O. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, we anticipated that the sensitization effect by a PARP inhibitor might rely on an end-joining reaction independent of DNA-PK. Therefore, we investigated by clonogenic assay the sensitivity of DNA-PK-proficient and -deficient rodent cells to the radiomimetic compound calicheamicin γ1, in the presence or absence of a nontoxic concentration of the potent PARP-1 inhibitor DIQ (58Banasik M. Komura H. Shimoyama M. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1569-1575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We treated in parallel two paired CHO cell lines, the control AA8 and DNA-PKcs-deficient V3 cell lines (59Blunt T. Gell D. Fox M. Taccioli G.E. Lehmann A.R. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10285-10290Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and the hamster control Ku80 cDNA-complemented xrs6 (xrs6/haKu80) and the xrs6 Ku-deficient cell lines (60Singleton B.K. Priestley A. Steingrimsdottir H. Gell D. Blunt T. Jackson S.P. Lehmann A.R. Jeggo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). First, we confirmed that DIQ was a potent inhibitor of PARP-1 activity in vivo (61Okano S. Lan L. Caldecott K.W. Mori T. Yasui A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3974-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 62Leppard J.B. Dong Z. Mackey Z.B. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5919-5927Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) since we observed a dose-dependent inhibition by DIQ of the H2O2-induced overall cellular protein poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by Western blotting with an anti-PAR antibody (data not shown). By performing clonogenic assay on the four rodent cell lines, we measured the cytotoxicity of DIQ and chose 10 μm as the highest drug concentration that still allowed 100% cell survival (data not shown). Then we assessed the clonogenic survival to calicheamicin γ1 of rodent cells pretreated or not with 10 μm DIQ. Fig. 1, A and B, showed that DNA-PK deficiency sensitizes cells to calicheamicin γ1 as compared with the respective control, 5.5-fold for xrs6 and 3.5-fold for V3 cells at LD50 (concentration of drug that inhibited cell survival by 50%), as already reported (63van Duijn-Goedhart A. Zdzienicka M.Z. Sankaranarayanan K. van Buul P.P. Mutat. Res. 2000; 471: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of PARP-1 inhibition on cell sensitivity, we calculated for each cell line the potentiating factor as the mean ratio of LD50 for calicheamicin γ1 alone divided by LD50 in the presence of DIQ. As shown in Table I, all the ratios were significantly superior to 1, clearly indicating that DIQ potentiates the cytotoxicity of calicheamicin γ1 in both DNA-PK-proficient and -deficient cells.Table IComparison of PF50 values derived from survival curvesCell linexrs6/haKu80xrs6AA8V3PF50aAll mean PF50 (potentiating factor) values (±S.E.) were calculated from the ratio of individual paired LD50 (concentration of drug that inhibited cell survival by 50%) values for each cell line, i.e. LD50 without DIQ divided by LD50 in the presence of DIQ.

https://openalex.org/W2085413415,"We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of formaldehyde (H 2 CO) dissociation to H 2 and CO at energies just above the threshold for competing H elimination. High-resolution state-resolved imaging measurements of the CO velocity distributions reveal two dissociation pathways. The first proceeds through a well-established transition state to produce rotationally excited CO and vibrationally cold H 2 . The second dissociation pathway yields rotationally cold CO in conjunction with highly vibrationally excited H 2 . Quasi-classical trajectory calculations performed on a global potential energy surface for H 2 CO suggest that this second channel represents an intramolecular hydrogen abstraction mechanism: One hydrogen atom explores large regions of the potential energy surface before bonding with the second H atom, bypassing the saddle point entirely."

Production of an extracellular mixture of sugar polymers called exopolysaccharide is characteristic and critical for biofilm formation. However, there is limited information about the mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis and modification of exopolysaccharide components and how these processes influence bacterial pathogenesis. Staphylococcus epidermidis is an important human pathogen that frequently causes persistent infections by biofilm formation on indwelling medical devices. It produces a poly-N-acetylglucosamine molecule that emerges as an exopolysaccharide component of many bacterial pathogens. Using a novel method based on size exclusion chromatography-mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that the surface-attached protein IcaB is responsible for deacetylation of the poly-N-acetylglucosamine molecule. Most likely due to the loss of its cationic character, non-deacetylated poly-acetylglucosamine in an isogenic icaB mutant strain was devoid of the ability to attach to the bacterial cell surface. Importantly, deacetylation of the polymer was essential for key virulence mechanisms of S. epidermidis, namely biofilm formation, colonization, and resistance to neutrophil phagocytosis and human antibacterial peptides. Furthermore, persistence of the icaB mutant strain was significantly impaired in a murine model of device-related infection. This is the first study to describe a mechanism of exopolysaccharide modification that is indispensable for the development of biofilm-associated human disease.

Exopolysaccharide (EPS) 1The abbreviations used are: EPS, exopolysaccharide; SEC/ESI-MS, size-exclusion chromatography-mass spectrometry; PMN, polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes. is a key component of the biofilm matrix in many biofilm-forming bacteria and may be composed of various sugar polymers (1Watnick P. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2675-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). It has an important role in immune evasion and tolerance toward antibacterial agents. By far most known EPS molecules are neutral or polyanionic (2Sutherland I. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). Enzymatic alteration of EPS is believed to significantly change its physico-chemical properties and, thus, biofilm structure. However, particularly in Gram-positive bacteria, EPS-modifying enzymes and the relationship between the composition of EPS and its biological function have remained poorly characterized. The Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most prevalent pathogen involved in hospital-acquired infections (3Vuong C. Otto M. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The costs related to infections caused by S. epidermidis in the hospital setting are enormous and represent a major health care burden. Most infections caused by S. epidermidis occur after the insertion of indwelling devices such as catheters or prosthetic heart valves. In these cases, the ability of S. epidermidis to form biofilms represents the most important virulence determinant (3Vuong C. Otto M. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In a biofilm, the bacteria are dramatically less susceptible to antibiotic treatment and attacks by innate host defense. For these reasons, S. epidermidis biofilm-associated infections are very difficult to eradicate. PIA, a homopolymer of β-1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues, is located in fibrous strands on the S. epidermidis cell surface, where it serves as an essential factor involved in biofilm formation (4Mack D. Fischer W. Krokotsch A. Leopold K. Hartmann R. Egge H. Laufs R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Importantly, it protects the pathogen from innate host defense (5Vuong C. Voyich J.M. Fischer E.R. Braughton K.R. Whitney A.R. DeLeo F.R. Otto M. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). PIA production is crucial for virulence in animal infection models (6Rupp M.E. Ulphani J.S. Fey P.D. Mack D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2656-2659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rupp M.E. Ulphani J.S. Fey P.D. Bartscht K. Mack D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rupp M.E. Fey P.D. Heilmann C. Götz F. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 183: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and is encoded by the ica gene locus, which consists of the icaA, icaD, icaB, and icaC genes (9Heilmann C. Schweitzer O. Gerke C. Vanittanakom N. Mack D. Götz F. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). IcaA and IcaD form a UDP-GlcNAc-transferase located in the cellular membrane (10Gerke C. Kraft A. Süssmuth R. Schweitzer O. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18586-18593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Another putative membrane protein, IcaC, is required for the formation of longer polymers and might be involved in the export of the growing PIA chain (10Gerke C. Kraft A. Süssmuth R. Schweitzer O. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18586-18593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). PIA represents a very unusual EPS molecule, as some GlcNAc residues become deacetylated, which produces a positive net charge of the polymer. The basis of deacetylation is unclear. PIA is also produced in Staphylococcus aureus and some strains of Escherichia coli (11Cramton S.E. Gerke C. Schnell N.F. Nichols W.W. Götz F. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5427-5433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wang X. Preston J.F.I. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2724-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gene clusters similar to the ica locus are found in other species of the genus Staphylococcus and in a range of human and plant pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Xanthomonas axonopodis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Bordetella pertussis (12Wang X. Preston J.F.I. Romeo T. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2724-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 13Darby C. Hsu J.W. Ghori N. Falkow S.

In Y. pestis, for example, ica homolog-dependent biofilms are crucial for vector transmission from fleas to humans (15Hinnebusch B.J. Perry R.D. Schwan T.G. Science. 1996; 273: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that PIA production represents an important virulence determinant in a series of infectious diseases. Here we describe the role of the IcaB protein in PIA biosynthesis and S. epidermidis pathogenesis. We show that IcaB is located on the S. epidermidis cell surface and involved in the introduction of positive charges in the PIA polymer by deacetylation of GlcNAc moieties. Notably, the presence of deacetylated PIA was essential for biofilm formation, immune evasion, adhesion to epithelial cells, and virulence in an animal model of implant infection.

Nedelmann M. Krokotsch A. Schwarzkopf A. Heesemann J. Laufs R. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3244-3253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was grown in tryptic soy broth medium containing 0.5% of filtered glucose, except for overexpression studies with xylose induction, for which basic medium (1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 0.1% K2HPO4) was used. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 140 rpm, unless otherwise noted. Immuno-dot-blot Assay—To quantify PIA production, corresponding amounts of S. epidermidis cells and culture supernatants were used. Surface-located PIA was extracted by incubating the cells in 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0 (final volume, 1:50 of cultures) for 5 min at 100 °C. Staphylococcal supernatants were concentrated about 50-fold by centrifugal filter devices (Amicon Ultrafree-MC, YM-10). 3-μl aliquots of the samples were spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane and air-dried, and PIA was detected using anti-PIA antiserum as described previously (23Vuong C. Saenz H.L. Götz F. Otto M. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 182: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and a scanner and Total Lab Version 2003 software (Nonlinear USA, Durham, NC). Construction of an Isogenic icaB Deletion Mutant, an icaB-complementing Vector, and icaB Overexpression Vectors—To delete icaB in S. epidermidis 1457, PCR-amplified regions flanking the icaB gene and an erythromycin resistance cassette were cloned into plasmid pBT2 (24Brückner R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 151: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pBTΔicaB, which was used for allelic replacement as described (25Vuong C. Götz F. Otto M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The proper integration of the resistance gene marker ermB was verified by direct sequencing of the genomic DNA at the borders of the PCR-derived regions. S. epidermidis 1457, in which icaB was deleted, was named S. epidermidis ΔicaB. To complement for icaB in S. epidermidis ΔicaB, the icaB gene under control of the icaA promoter was cloned into plasmid pRB473 (24Brückner R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 151: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was named pRBicaB. S. epidermidis ΔicaB (pRB473) was used for comparison with the complemented strain S. epidermidis ΔicaB (pRBicaB). To overexpress icaB, the icaB gene was amplified using mutagenizing primers introducing BamHI and MluI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and MluI and cloned into BamHI/MluI-cleaved vector pTX15, yielding pTXicaB. Plasmids pTXicaB and pTX16 as control were transformed into S. epidermidis ΔicaB and wild-type strains. Analysis of PIA Deacetylation by Size-exclusion Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (SEC/ESI-MS)—PIA samples for SEC/ESI-MS were obtained as described above. Purified PIA used for preliminary studies was obtained from the supernatant of an S. aureus PIA (PNAG)-over-producing strain (S. aureus MN8m, kindly provided by G. Pier, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and treated for varying times up to 24 h with 12 n HCl to achieve chemical deacetylation. Completely acetylated PIA was separated from other molecules on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences), whereas partially or completely deacetylated PIA was separated on a Jordi PolarPac WAX 10,000 Å 300 × 7.8-mm column (Alltech, Deerfiel, IL). All samples were run on both columns. SEC/ESI-MS was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using 0.2% acetic acid on an Agilent 1100 system coupled to a Trap VL mass spectrometer. Biofilm Assay—In vitro biofilm assays were performed in polystyrene microtiter plates as described previously (23Vuong C. Saenz H.L. Götz F. Otto M. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 182: 1688-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter plates (96 U-button polystyrene wells (Greiner, Longwood, FL)) were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h without shaking. Biofilm formation was made visible by staining S. epidermidis cells with 0.1% safranin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 s. S. epidermidis biofilm formation in microtiter wells was quantified using a Safire microtiter plate reader (Tecan, U. S. Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC) with Magellan Version 3.00 software. The reader was set to the multiple read mode (circle pattern, 6 × 6 number of reads), and absorbance was measured at 490 nm. Human Cell Culture and Adherence Assay—A2058 human skin epithelial cells (ATCC CRL-11147) were used to compare the level of adherence of S. epidermidis wild-type and icaB mutant strains as described (26Vuong C. Kocianova S. Yao Y. Carmody A.B. Otto M. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in quadruplicate, and results were expressed for each experiment as the mean number of S. epidermidis cells per A2058 cell ± S.E. Isolation of Human PMNs and Phagocytosis Experiments—PMNs were isolated from heparinized venous blood of healthy individuals with a standard method (27Voyich J.M. Sturdevant D.E. Braughton K.R. Kobayashi S.D. Lei B. Virtaneva K. Dorward D.W. Musser J.M. DeLeo F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1996-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). All studies were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects, NIAID. Cell preparations contained >99% PMNs, and all reagents used contained <25.0 pg/ml endotoxin. Phagocytosis of S. epidermidis by human PMNs was analyzed by flow cytometry with a previously described method (27Voyich J.M. Sturdevant D.E. Braughton K.R. Kobayashi S.D. Lei B. Virtaneva K. Dorward D.W. Musser J.M. DeLeo F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1996-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Peptide Bacterial Killing Assays—Assays were performed as described previously (5Vuong C. Voyich J.M. Fischer E.R. Braughton K.R. Whitney A.R. DeLeo F.R. Otto M. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼105 S. epidermidis cells were exposed to a range of antimicrobial peptide concentrations at 37 °C for 2 h, and an appropriate dilution series of the samples were plated on tryptic soy broth agar. Survivor S. epidermidis cells were enumerated after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. The percentage of killed S. epidermidis was calculated using the equation (1-(colony-forming unitsH2O2/colony-forming unitsControl)) × 100. Immunodetection of IcaB—IcaB-specific antisera were developed by Sigma Genosys against a mixture of five synthetic BSA-conjugated peptides from the IcaB sequence. The antisera were blocked with cell extracts of S. epidermidis ΔicaB. Immunoblots were incubated for 8 h with blocked anti-IcaB antiserum. An anti-rabbit-IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was used for detection with an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Scanning Electron Microscopy—For ultrastructural preservation of the PIA structure, samples were prepared as described by Fassel and Edmiston (28Fassel T.A. Edmiston Jr., C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 310: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with previously described modifications (5Vuong C. Voyich J.M. Fischer E.R. Braughton K.R. Whitney A.R. DeLeo F.R. Otto M. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Mouse Model of Device-related Infection—Female Balb/c mice were used in a model of subcutaneous implanted device-related infection according to Kadurugamuwa et al. (19Kadurugamuwa J.L. Sin L. Albert E. Yu J. Francis K. DeBoer M. Rubin M. Bellinger-Kawahara C. Parr Jr., T.R. Contag P.R. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and Rupp et al. (7Rupp M.E. Ulphani J.S. Fey P.D. Bartscht K. Mack D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two catheter pieces of 1 cm in length were placed under the skin of the dorsum of each animal. Colony-forming units on catheters were counted before insertion and were in the range of 2 × 105 on all implanted catheters. Colony-forming units on excised catheters and surrounding tissues were counted after 1 week of infection. Statistics—Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism Version 4.0. (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). IcaB Is Responsible for PIA Deacetylation—In these studies we investigated the mechanism responsible for the formation of deacetylated GlcNAc in PIA and its role in virulence of S. epidermidis. On the basis of sequence similarity to oligosaccharide deacetylases in other organisms, we hypothesized that icaB is involved in the deacetylation of PIA. To determine the role of icaB, we constructed an isogenic icaB mutant of a biofilm-forming, clinical S. epidermidis isolate by allelic replacement with an erythromycin resistance cassette (Fig. 1). Correct insertion of the cassette in the chromosome was confirmed by sequencing of the flanking regions. The absence of the icaB transcript in the icaB mutant and maintained expression of icaC, the only gene located downstream of icaB in the ica operon (Fig. 1), were verified by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). PIA deacetylation was analyzed with SEC/ESI-MS. In contrast to previously used protocols (4Mack D. Fischer W. Krokotsch A. Leopold K. Hartmann R. Egge H. Laufs R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 16Maira-Litran T. Kropec A. Abeygunawardana C. Joyce J. Mark G. II I Goldmann D.A. Pier G.B. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4433-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), this method does not require extensive purification of PIA before analysis, which may lead to precipitation and selective enrichment of specific forms of PIA. PIA from the wild-type strain revealed fragmentation patterns that included ions originating from deacetylated residues (Fig. 2). These ions were not found in PIA from the icaB mutant strain (Fig. 2), indicating that this strain is deficient in PIA deacetylation. In addition, we purified PIA from mutant and wild-type strains and analyzed the degree of deacetylation by a conventional method based on the detection of free amino groups (17Habeeb A.F.S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 14: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). We found that 16.4 ± 9.9% of GlcNAc residues in the wild-type strain were deacetylated, whereas no deacetylation was detected in the icaB mutant strain. These findings indicate that the introduction of deacetylated GlcNAc into PIA occurs by a dedicated mechanism to deacetylate a polymeric PIA precursor. Importantly, our data demonstrate that the IcaB protein is involved in PIA deacetylation. Furthermore, our ESI-MS data provide novel insight into the mechanism of oligosaccharide deacetylases. They indicate that the PIA-deacetylating enzyme modifies GlcNAc residues in PIA in random rather than in a specific distance. This theory is supported by the following observations. First, Glc-NAc oligomer peaks in the wild-type strain appeared in series with varied rather than uniform degrees of deacetylation (Fig. 2). Second, we found fragments of short GlcNAc oligomers that are multiply deacetylated (Fig. 2). For example, the presence of a peak corresponding to 2 glucosamine residues (323 Da) confirms this idea and indicates that the enzyme is capable of deacetylating adjacent GlcNAc residues.Fig. 2Analysis of PIA deacetylation by SEC/ESI-MS. Samples of culture filtrates and cell surface fractions of S. epidermidis strains were analyzed by SEC/ESI-MS. Mass spectra averaged over the elution range of PIA are shown. PIA was isolated from the surface of the wild-type strain (WT) and from the culture filtrate of the icaB mutant strain (ΔicaB). No PIA was detected on the surface of the icaB mutant strain nor in the culture filtrate of the wild-type strain. Fragmentation of polysaccharide homopolymers results in a series of ESI-MS m/z peaks with a constant mass distance, which is equal to the mass of the monomer (29Deery M.J. Stimson E. Chappell C.G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 2273-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Completely acetylated PIA has an expected series of ESI-MS peaks with mass distances of 203 Da, the mass of the GlcNAc moiety (blue arrows). Deacetylation results in additional peaks with a mass defect of multiples of 42 Da, the mass of an acetyl rest (red arrows). PIA from the complemented icaB mutant strain S. epidermidis ΔicaB (pRBicaB) produced ESI-MS peaks consistent with normal deacetylation observed in the wild-type strain (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Deacetylation Is Crucial for Attachment of PIA to the Bacterial Cell Surface—Deacetylation introduces positive charges in the otherwise neutral PIA molecule, as free amino groups are exposed that become protonated at neutral and acid pH. We found that the altered chemistry of deacetylated PIA significantly affected its biophysical properties. We have previously shown that PIA is located in fibrous strands on the S. epidermidis surface (5Vuong C. Voyich J.M. Fischer E.R. Braughton K.R. Whitney A.R. DeLeo F.R. Otto M. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild-type strain, PIA from the icaB mutant was released to the culture filtrate (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, deacetylation is essential for surface localization of PIA. Moreover, completely acetylated PIA from the icaB mutant strain had a much higher tendency to precipitate in aqueous solution compared with partially deacetylated PIA from the wild-type strain. Hence, deacetylation of PIA is important for solubility in an aqueous environment. IcaB Is a Surface-bound Protein—We next determined the subcellular location of the IcaB protein using IcaB-specific antisera (Fig. 3C). Notably, IcaB was extracted from the wild-type and icaB-overexpressing strains by boiling cells with sodium dodecyl sulfate, an established method to isolate proteins that are non-covalently attached to the surface of Gram-positive bacteria (18Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). IcaB was not detected in the culture filtrate or cellular fractions (from which surface-attached proteins were previously released) of these strains nor in any fraction derived from the icaB mutant strain. IcaB had an apparent molecular mass of ∼30 kDa, which is in good accordance with the theoretical value of the translational product after cleavage of the putative signal peptide (30.4 kDa). Thus, our data indicate that IcaB is exported and attached to the staphylococcal cell surface by non-covalent interaction. PIA deacetylation, therefore, very likely occurs in the cell surface matrix. PIA Deacetylation Is Indispensable for Efficient Biofilm Formation and Surface Colonization—To investigate the impact of PIA deacetylation on major virulence mechanisms of S. epidermidis, we first determined colonization of an abiotic surface and human epithelial cells in vitro. Biofilm formation on plastic in vitro was completely abolished in the icaB mutant strain and restored in the complemented mutant (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, adhesion of the icaB mutant to epithelial cells was significantly lower than that of the wild-type (p < 0.0001) and complemented mutant strains (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that PIA deacetylation contributes to efficient colonization of surface matrices relevant to S. epidermidis infection. PIA Deacetylation Is Required for Immune Evasion—Immune evasion is believed to be a key virulence mechanism of S. epidermidis. This notion is underscored by the fact that virulence of this pathogen is based on prolonged persistence in relative silence rather than on aggressive virulence factors (3Vuong C. Otto M. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that PIA protects S. epidermidis from major components of innate host defense (5Vuong C. Voyich J.M. Fischer E.R. Braughton K.R. Whitney A.R. DeLeo F.R. Otto M. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To test if deacetylation of PIA plays a major role in immune evasion processes, we evaluated phagocytosis by human neutrophils and resistance to antibacterial peptides of S. epidermidis icaB mutant and wild-type strains. Phagocytosis by human neutrophils was significantly increased at all time points in the icaB mutant strain (Fig. 5A). Inasmuch as neutrophils are the critical effector cells in human innate host response to bacterial infections, the data indicate that PIA deacetylation is important for immune evasion. Furthermore, the icaB mutant strain showed significantly higher sensitivity to the effects of LL-37 and human β-defensin-3, two representative antibacterial peptides from human skin and neutrophil specific granules (Figs. 5, B and C). These findings indicate that IcaB plays a key role in protecting S. epidermidis from the microcidal effects of innate host defense components. Remarkably, the values for the icaB mutant were in the same range as those that we have obtained earlier for a mutant of the same strain devoid of PIA (5Vuong C. Voyich J.M. Fischer E.R. Braughton K.R. Whitney A.R. DeLeo F.R. Otto M. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of PIA in immune evasion is largely dependent on deacetylation of GlcNAc residues. An Isogenic icaB Mutant Shows Impaired Persistence in a Model of Device-related Infection—Persistence of surface-attached bacterial agglomerations, particularly on indwelling medical devices, is considered the main basis of S. epidermidis virulence. To investigate if deacetylation of PIA affects persistence of S. epidermidis during infection of indwelling medical devices, we compared S. epidermidis wild-type and icaB mutant strains in a murine model of subcutaneous catheter infection (Fig. 6). Similarly to described models of device-related infection with S. epidermidis (7Rupp M.E. Ulphani J.S. Fey P.D. Bartscht K. Mack D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2627-2632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kadurugamuwa J.L. Sin L. Albert E. Yu J. Francis K. DeBoer M. Rubin M. Bellinger-Kawahara C. Parr Jr., T.R. Contag P.R. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the model includes the insertion of a piece of medical tubing under the skin of the dorsum of the animals. After 1 week of infection, bacteria on the implant were counted. Significantly fewer bacteria were detected at the infection site in the mice infected with the icaB mutant compared with those infected with the wild-type (p = 0.0142). These results indicate that deacetylation of PIA represents an important virulence mechanism during S. epidermidis device-related infection. EPS is one of the main constituents of the biofilm matrix (1Watnick P. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2675-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Investigation of the role of EPS in biofilm formation has focused on Gram-negative bacteria, among which EPS of Vibrio cholerae (20Watnick P.I. Kolter R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exopolymer alginate have gained much attention (1Watnick P. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2675-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Less is known about EPS in gram-positives. Furthermore, there is limited information about the bacterial mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis and modification of EPS components. Specifically, we lack knowledge about how the structure of EPS influences the virulence of human pathogens. In this report, we investigated how enzymatic modification of EPS in S. epidermidis influences biofilm formation and virulence. SEC/ESI-MS analysis revealed that PIA in an icaB deletion mutant was completely acetylated. The introduction of deacetylated GlcNAc into PIA, therefore, occurs by a dedicated mechanism to deacetylate a polymeric PIA precursor rather than by incorporation of UDP-glucosamine as an alternative substrate of the IcaAD UDP-GlcNAc-transferase. Given that IcaB also has similarity to oligosaccharide deacetylases, our results strongly suggest that the protein is the PIA-deacetylating enzyme. However, this remains to be demonstrated by conversion of acetylated PIA with purified IcaB. Furthermore, our data indicate that (i) deacetylation sites in wild-type PIA are randomly distributed and (ii) deacetylation by the surface-attached IcaB occurs in the cell surface matrix, in contrast to the other steps in PIA biosynthesis, which take place inside the cell (10Gerke C. Kraft A. Süssmuth R. Schweitzer O. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18586-18593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Based on our results, we propose a model of PIA biosynthesis, which is shown in Fig. 7. Comparison of the icaB mutant with the wild-type strain allowed investigation of the biological role of deacetylation and the introduction of positive charges in the PIA molecule. The icaB mutant strain had a strong defect in colonization and resistance against innate host defense, which was reflected by significantly decreased virulence in a mouse model of catheter-related infection. Notably, many of the biological effects seen in an icaB mutant strain may be related to the fact that non-deacetylated PIA was not retained on the S. epidermidis cell surface. Deacetylated PIA is cationic due to free amino groups (theoretical pK = 6.9) that become protonated at neutral or acidic pH. The cationic character of PIA presumably is essential for the attachment of PIA to the negatively charged bacterial cell surface. By PIA production, the bacteria, thus, can efficiently change the electrostatic properties of their cell surface. This is very likely responsible for the resistance against antibacterial peptides, which are usually cationic (5Vuong C. Voyich J.M. Fischer E.R. Braughton K.R. Whitney A.R. DeLeo F.R. Otto M. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In comparison to other known EPS components, which are almost all neutral or negatively charged, PIA might, therefore, be exceptionally well suited for its role in biofilm formation and immune evasion. In conclusion, we demonstrate that enzymatic modification of PIA by deacetylation is crucial for biofilm formation, immune evasion, and virulence of S. epidermidis. To our knowledge this is the first report to show that modification of a specific EPS component by a dedicated mechanism affects virulence and pathogen success in biofilm-associated infection. Because PIA and homologues of the ica gene cluster have been discovered in a variety of pathogenic and biofilm-forming microorganisms, PIA deacetylation likely represents a widespread mechanism of virulence. Furthermore, PIA biosynthesis is a potential target for anti-biofilm drug development (21Götz F. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1367-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Targeting IcaB function might be of particular interest, as we demonstrate herein that IcaB has a crucial function in biofilm formation and virulence. In addition, IcaB represents the only extracellular protein of the ica system, making it most easily accessible for therapeutics designed to control S. epidermidis infection on indwelling devices.

https://openalex.org/W2056499409,A waxy protective cuticle coats all primary aerial plant tissues. Its synthesis requires extensive export of lipids from epidermal cells to the plant surface. Arabidopsis cer5 mutants had reduced stem cuticular wax loads and accumulated sheetlike inclusions in the cytoplasm of wax-secreting cells. These inclusions represented abnormal deposits of cuticular wax and resembled inclusions found in a human disorder caused by a defective peroxisomal adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) transporter. We found that the CER5 gene encodes an ABC transporter localized in the plasma membrane of epidermal cells and conclude that it is required for wax export to the cuticle.

Although this clustering suggests shared causation, unifying factors remain unknown. We describe a large kindred with a syndrome including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hypomagnesemia.

Analysis of the mitochondrial genome of the maternal lineage identified a homoplasmic mutation substituting cytidine for uridine immediately 5′ to the mitochondrial transfer RNA Ile anticodon. Uridine at this position is nearly invariate among transfer RNAs because of its role in stabilizing the anticodon loop.

https://openalex.org/W4232818534,We report on the coherent quantum state transfer from a two-level atomic system to a single photon. Entanglement between a single photon (signal) and a two-component ensemble of cold rubidium atoms is used to project the quantum memory element (the atomic ensemble) onto any desired state by measuring the signal in a suitable basis. The atomic qubit is read out by stimulating directional emission of a single photon (idler) from the (entangled) collective state of the ensemble. Faithful atomic memory preparation and read-out are verified by the observed correlations between the signal and the idler photons. These results enable implementation of distributed quantum networking.

RNA expression of protein coding and nonprotein coding sequences was determined for each major stage of the life cycle, including adult males and females. We detected transcriptional activity for 93% of annotated genes and RNA expression for 41% of the probes in intronic and intergenic sequences. Comparison to genome-wide RNA interference data and to gene annotations revealed distinguishable levels of expression for different classes of genes and higher levels of expression for genes with essential cellular functions. Differential splicing was observed in about 40% of predicted genes, and 5440 previously unknown splice forms were detected. Genes within conserved regions of synteny with D. pseudoobscura had highly correlated expression; these regions ranged in length from 10 to 900 kilobase pairs. The expressed intergenic and intronic sequences are more likely to be evolutionarily conserved than nonexpressed ones, and about 15% of them appear to be developmentally regulated. Our results provide a draft expression map for the entire nonrepetitive genome, which reveals a much more extensive and diverse set of expressed sequences than was previously predicted."

https://openalex.org/W2150661602,"In mammalian cells, repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is critical for genome stability. Although the end-bridging and ligation steps of NHEJ have been reconstituted in vitro, little is known about the end-processing reactions that occur before ligation. Recently, functionally homologous end-bridging and ligation activities have been identified in prokarya. Consistent with its homology to polymerases and nucleases, we demonstrate that DNA ligase D from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt-Lig) possesses a unique variety of nucleotidyl transferase activities, including gap-filling polymerase, terminal transferase, and primase, and is also a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease. These enzyme activities allow the Mt-Ku and Mt-Lig proteins to join incompatible DSB ends in vitro, as well as to reconstitute NHEJ in vivo in yeast. These results demonstrate that prokaryotic Ku and ligase form a bona fide NHEJ system that encodes all the recognition, processing, and ligation activities required for DSB repair."

Glycoside hydrolases play critical roles in biology ranging from digestion and decomposition of polysaccharides to biosynthesis of glycoproteins. Gene sequences of many thousands of these important enzymes have now been determined, and the corresponding enzymes have been grouped into families on the basis of sequence similarity (1Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar, 2Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 309-316Crossref Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 3Henrissat B. Bairoch A.

Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). 1These are widely available at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/. The α-glucosidases are a particularly important subset of these enzymes, both in primary metabolism and in glycoconjugate biosynthesis and processing. These enzymes are principally found in families 13 and 31 and, to a lesser extent, in families 4 and 63. Family 13 contains a wide range of glucoside-processing enzymes, including the α-amylases and cyclodextrin glucanotransferases. Correspondingly, enzymes of this family have attracted considerable attention, with numerous mechanistic studies and with three-dimensional structures having been known for some 20 years. By contrast, family 31 has received relatively little attention despite its importance and the number of different activities represented from a range of organisms, including animals, plants, and microorganisms (6Frandsen T.P. Svensson B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7Yu S. Bojen K. Svensson B. Marcussen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1433: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This family contains such important α-glucosidases as the human lysosomal α-glucosidase, a deficiency of which results in Pompe's disease (also known as glycogen storage disease type 2 or acid maltase deficiency, the marked feature of which is the accumulation of glycogen in heart and skeletal muscle cells); the endoplasmic reticulum glucosidase II, which plays a key role in glycoprotein processing and folding; and the digestive enzyme sucrase-isomaltase, which is the target of inhibition by the anti-diabetes drugs acarbose and miglitol. It also contains α-xylosidases, isomaltosyltransferases, and the mechanistically interesting α-glucan lyases, which carry out an elimination reaction rather than hydrolysis. Despite the importance of this family, mechanistic insights are limited. The enzymes are known to be retaining α-glycosidases, which hydrolyze the glycosidic bond with net retention of anomeric configuration via an acid/base-catalyzed mechanism involving a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. Through a range of studies involving affinity labeling, trapping of reaction intermediates, and site-directed mutagenesis, the catalytic nucleophile has been identified as an aspartic acid residue within the consensus sequence WIDMNE (Asp224 for the Aspergillus niger α-glucosidase) (6Frandsen T.P.

However, a key missing component, which would be particularly important for inhibitor design, is the three-dimensional structure of any member of this family. Inspection of the complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli revealed that it contains two genes encoding enzymes from family 31, yicI and yihQ, but no information was available concerning the function of each gene product. These proteins should be good model enzymes for both mechanistic and structural analyses, being devoid of the post-translational modifications that can complicate such studies in proteins from higher order organisms. They are therefore attractive targets for investigation. This study describes the cloning, expression, and kinetic and mechanistic characterization and also the three-dimensional structural analysis of one of these two enzymes, YicI. The results obtained confirm previous predictions of key catalytic residues in this family and provide a structural framework both for the design of new α-glucosidase inhibitors and for the understanding of lysosomal α-glucosidase mutations that result in Pompe's disease. 2During the preparation of this manuscript, another report describing the cloning, expression, and preliminary characterization of YicI appeared (22Okuyama M.

Synthesis of (5S)- and (5R)-5-fluoro-α-d-xylopyranosyl fluorides (ax-5FαXF and eq-5FαXF, respectively) was achieved via radical bromination of per-O-acetyl-α-d-xylopyranosyl fluoride, followed by displacement with fluoride using AgBF4 and then deprotection using NH3/MeOH.

Yeast extracts and Tryptone were purchased from Difco. 40% acrylamide/N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide and TEMED were purchased from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Cloning of the yicI Gene—The genomic DNA of E. coli K12 was isolated using a QIAmp tissue kit (QIAGEN Inc.). The yicI gene was amplified by PCR with Pwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science) using the chromosomal DNA of E. coli as a template and the two synthetic primers YicITOP (5′-CAG AAC TAA GGA ACG CAT ATG AAA ATT AGC-3′) and YicIEND (5′-ATC AAG CTC GAG CAA CGT AAT TGT CAG CGC-3′), which were designed based on the sequence of the yicI gene (GenBank™/EBI accession number AE000443). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated with pET29a (Novagen) that had been digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes. After sequence analysis, one clone without any PCR error was designated as pET29YICI and was used for the production of His6-tagged YicI protein. The synthesis of PCR primers and the analysis of DNA sequences were carried out by the Nucleic Acid and Peptides Service Unit in the Biotechnology Laboratory at the University of British Columbia. Expression and Purification of YicI—Plasmids containing the yicI gene (pET29YICI) were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and the resulting cells were cultured overnight at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium containing 20 μg/ml kanamycin. The overnight culture was induced directly by addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for a further 5 h. The cell pellet was harvested and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm imidazole and 300 mm NaCl. The cell suspension was passed twice through a French press at 5 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the soluble extract was purified by nickel chelation chromatography. The protein was then dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and stored at 4 °C. The tryptic fragments of the protein were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to confirm the identity of the protein. The protein (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 10 units of trypsin in 1 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for 1 h. The resulting digest was subjected to liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis, and masses of fragments were analyzed. Enzyme Kinetics—All experiments were carried out at 37 °C in 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin unless indicated otherwise. Michaelis-Menten parameters for the p-nitrophenyl glycosides were measured by monitoring the release of p-nitrophenol in the presence of enzyme at 400 nm with a Varian Cary 300 Bio UV-visible spectrometer equipped with a circulating water bath. Cuvettes of either 1- or 0.1-cm path length were used. The typical substrate concentration range employed was 0.3–3 × Km. The difference in extinction coefficient (Δϵ) between p-nitrophenyl glycoside and p-nitrophenol at 400 nm, pH 7.0, and 37 °C was determined by measuring the difference in absorbance between fixed equal concentrations of each pair of p-nitrophenols and p-nitrophenyl glycosides. Kinetic parameters were obtained by direct fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the software GraFit 4.0 (73Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit. Version 4.0, Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1990Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters for α-d-xylopyranosyl fluoride were determined by monitoring the release of fluoride from a range of substrate concentrations using an Orion 96-09 combination fluoride ion electrode interfaced to a computer running LoggerPro software (Vernier Software Ltd.). Initial rates were used for the determination of kinetic parameters, which were obtained by direct fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraFit 4.0. Initial rates of hydrolysis of ax-5FαXF and eq-5FαXF by YicI were identical at all concentrations of ax-5FαXF (0.1–2 mm) and eq-5FαXF (0.1–1.2 mm) assayed. This rate was taken as the Vmax value for each substrate, and each kcat value was calculated from these Vmax values by dividing each Vmax by the corresponding enzyme concentration. pH Dependence Studies—Measurement of the pH-dependent activity of YicI was carried out using α-d-xylopyranosyl fluoride as substrate by monitoring fluoride ion release. The following buffers were used: sodium acetate (pH 4.0–5.5), MES (pH 6.0), MOPS (pH 6.5–7.5) and glycylglycine (pH 8.0–8.5). All buffers were 0.05 m in strength and contained 0.05 m NaCl. The substrate depletion method was employed as follows. A solution of substrate (0.02 mm, ∼50-fold lower than the Km value) was preincubated at 37 °C, and then the release of fluoride ion after addition of the enzyme was monitored using an Orion 96-09 combination fluoride ion electrode interfaced to a computer running the LoggerPro software until at least 80% depletion of substrate had occurred. Appropriate controls confirmed that, at 37 °C, YicI was stable over the reaction time at each pH value studied. Fitting the data to a first-order rate equation (GraFit 4.0) yielded an apparent rate constant for the reaction, from which the kcat/Km value for each substrate was calculated by dividing that rate constant by the concentration of YicI. The kcat/Km values obtained were then plotted versus pH and fitted to the appropriate curve using GraFit 4.0, thereby yielding apparent pKa values. Inhibition Studies—Inhibition studies were performed by measuring enzyme activity in the presence of various concentrations of each inhibitor using pNPαXyl as substrate. YicI (preincubated at 37 °C) was added to 200 μl of buffer solution containing pNPαXyl and varying amounts of inhibitors (also preincubated at the corresponding temperature). The release of p-nitrophenol was monitored spectrophotometrically at 400 nm. The experiments were repeated at different concentrations of pNPαXyl. A Dixon plot of 1/v versus inhibitor concentration for each substrate concentration intersects a line given by 1/Vmax at an inhibitor concentration equal to -Ki. Inactivation Kinetics—For analysis of inactivation kinetics, the enzyme (final concentration of 0.2–3.6 mg/ml) was preincubated with a range of concentrations of ax-5FαXF or eq-5FαXF at 37 or 10 °C. 10-μl aliquots of the sample were withdrawn at time intervals and added to 500 μl of 3 mm pNPαXyl pre-equilibrated at the appropriate temperature in the UV-visible spectrometer. The residual enzyme activity at each time interval at each concentration of inactivator was measured in this way. Pseudo first-order rate constants at each inactivator concentration (kobs) were determined by fitting each curve to a first-order rate equation. Values for the inactivation rate constant (ki) and the inactivator dissociation constant (Ki) were determined by fitting kobs values and inhibitor concentrations to the following equation: kobs = ki[I]/(ki + [I]). Reactivation of the inactivated enzyme was carried out as follows. Enzyme (100 μl, 0.30 mg/ml) fully inactivated by the inactivator at 10 °C was concentrated using 10-kDa nominal cutoff centrifugal concentrators (Amicon Corp., Danvers, MA) to a volume of ∼40 μl and diluted with 1000 μl of buffer. This was repeated twice, and the retentate was diluted to a final volume of 100 μl. The inactivated enzyme was then incubated at 37 °C, and reactivation was monitored by removal of aliquots (10 μl) at appropriate time intervals and assayed as described above. Measured activities were corrected for decreases in activity due to denaturation over this time course using data for non-inactivated control samples. The reactivation rate constant (kreact) was determined by fitting the data to a first-order rate equation as described above. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—All YicI crystals used in this study were grown using a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml, with 1 μl of purified protein mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution in a hanging drop experiment. Crystal form 1 was obtained with Crystal Screen II (26Cudney R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 414-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) solution 47 (100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6) and 2 m ammonium sulfate) at 18 °C. Crystal form 2 was obtained with Zeelen Screen (27Bergfors T.M. Protein Crystallization. 1st Ed. International University Line, La Jolla, CA1999: 77-82Google Scholar) solution 39 (100 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500, and 5% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol) at 8 °C. During optimization of the growth of crystal form 1, it was realized that the original screening solution had undergone a pH shift during storage and that the crystals grew at pH 6.5. Both crystal forms were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection at 100 K. Crystal form 1 was cryoprotected using mother liquor supplemented with 100 mm MOPS (pH 6.5) and 16% (w/v) glycerol. Crystal form 2 was cryoprotected using mother liquor supplemented with a final concentration of 25% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Data for all native data sets and the holmium derivative were collected on an ADSC Q210 detector at beamline 8.2.1 at the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA). Data for the lanthanum and p-chloromercuribenzoate data sets were collected on a MAR 345 detector using an in-house CuKα source. Diffracted intensities were evaluated using DENZO and SCALEPACK (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and MOSFLM and SCALA (29Collaborative Computational, ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Various data manipulations were accomplished using the CCP4 program suite (29Collaborative Computational, ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Briefly, multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion phases from the holmium derivative were combined with multiple isomorphous replacement phases obtained using the highly redundant lanthanum derivative as an anomalously scattering “native” data set and the p-chloromercuribenzoate crystal soak as an isomorphous derivative. The mean figure of merit following this procedure was 0.39. Density modification using DM (29Collaborative Computational, ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) improved the map enough to be able to assign a rough C-α trace for one monomer, which was then utilized to find the non-crystallographic symmetry operators. Phase extension to 2.2 Å with 6-fold averaging was performed using RESOLVE (30Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The model output from RESOLVE contained ∼85% of the structure, with matched sequence assignment for 60% of the side chains. The remainder of the model was built manually using XFIT (31McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Crystal form 2 was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP (32Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) using the crystal form 1 hexamer as the search model. Refinement of all data sets was achieved using CNS (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), with full statistics provided in Table II. Ligand topologies and restraints were generated using the PRODRG server (35Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar). No non-crystallographic symmetry constraints or restraints were used during refinement. Sequence Alignment Analysis—The hypothetical protein encoded by the yicI gene from E. coli shows sequence similarity of 50% or more to hypothetical proteins from a range of organisms as well as to known glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 31 enzymes (Fig. 1). It also shows 20–29% similarity to mammalian, plant, and fungal α-glucosidases and plant α-xylosidases and 20% similarity to α1,4-glucan lyases from family 31. The consensus sequence surrounding the catalytic aspartate nucleophile in this region of plant, mammalian, and fungal enzymes, including α-glucosidases and α-xylosidases, is WiDMnE, with a slight variation for α1,4-glucan lyases to WiDMnX (where X is V or T). However, bacterial proteins are known to have the sequence KTDFGE and are absolutely invariant. These clear distinctions between amino acid sequences of family 31 enzymes of higher organisms and bacteria suggest that the bacterial proteins took a different path early in the evolution of GH family 31 (36Sampedro J. Sieiro C. Revilla G. Gonzallez-Villa T. Zarra I. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 37Monroe J.D. Garcia-Cazarin M.L. Poliquin K.A. Aviano S.K. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2003; 41: 877-885Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Substrate Specificity—To investigate the enzyme activity of the YicI protein (see “Materials and Methods” for cloning, overexpression, and purification), 12 different glycoside substrates were incubated with the protein in 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 37 °C. As expected from the high sequence similarity to the GH family 31 α-xylosidase from Lactobacillus pentosus, the YicI protein rapidly hydrolyzed pNPαXyl and α-d-xylopyranosyl fluoride as substrates. Lower but significant activity was observed with p-nitrophenyl α-d-glucopyranoside, whereas neither the aryl α-glycosides of sugars such as galactose, mannose, and arabinose or any β-glucosides were hydrolyzed at all (Table III). Similarly, neither maltose nor maltotriose was cleaved, although the recent study of Okuyama et al. (22Okuyama M. Mori H. Chiba S. Kimura A. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 37: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) showed that isoprimeverose (Xyl-α(1,6)-Glc) is an excellent substrate, consistent with the expected role of this enzyme in xyloglucan degradation. Okuyama et al. also reported the ability of YicI to bind disaccharide acceptors in the aglycone-binding site, raising the possibility of potential substrates with at least three sugar units. Values of kcat and Km for the hydrolysis of pNPαXyl by this protein are in the same range as those for two other bacterial α-xylosidases (kcat = 0.21 s-1 and Km = 1 mm for the enzyme from Bacillus sp. and kcat = 0.1 s-1 and Km = 1.3 mm for that from L. pentosus) (38Zong N. Yasui T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 187-195Google Scholar, 39Chaillou S. Lokman B.C. Leer R.J. Posthuma C. Postma P.W. Pouwels P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2312-2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When YicI was incubated with either pNPαXyl or p-nitrophenyl α-d-glucopyranoside and products were checked by TLC, only the hydrolysis products xylose and glucose were detected, indicating the absence of lyase activity. As a result, the YicI protein has been designated as an α-xylosidase, and very s"

Sialidases hydrolyze sialic acids to produce asialo compounds, which is the first step of degradation processes of glycoproteins and gangliosides. Sialidase involvement has been implicated in some lysosomal storage disorders such as sialidosis and galactosialidosis. Neu2 is a recently identified human cytosolic sialidase. Here we report the first high resolution x-ray structures of mammalian sialidase, human Neu2, in its apo form and in complex with an inhibitor, 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA). The structure shows the canonical six-blade β-propeller observed in viral and bacterial sialidases with its active site in a shallow crevice. In the complex structure, the inhibitor lies in the catalytic crevice surrounded by ten amino acids. In particular, the arginine triad, conserved among sialidases, aids in the proper positioning of the carboxylate group of DANA within the active site region. The tyrosine residue, Tyr334, conserved among mammalian and bacterial sialidases as well as in viral neuraminidases, facilitates the enzymatic reaction by stabilizing a putative carbonium ion in the transition state. The loops containing Glu111 and the catalytic aspartate Asp46 are disordered in the apo form but upon binding of DANA become ordered to adopt two short α-helices to cover the inhibitor, illustrating the dynamic nature of substrate recognition. The N-acetyl and glycerol moieties of DANA are recognized by Neu2 residues not shared by bacterial sialidases and viral neuraminidases, which can be regarded as a key structural difference for potential drug design against bacteria, influenza, and other viruses.

Sialidases, or neuraminidases (EC 3.2.1.18), are glycohydrolytic enzymes widely distributed among species (1Saito M. Yu R.K. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 261-313Crossref Google Scholar). The removal of sialic acids on the non-reducing termini of complex carbohydrates by sialidases is the first step of degradation of glycolipids or glycoproteins. Furthermore, sialidases are considered to be involved in various biological events such as infection processes, antigenic expression, differentiation, signal transduction, or intercellular interactions (2Schauer R. Kelm S. Reuter G. Roggentin P. Shaw L. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 7-67Crossref Google Scholar). Mammalian sialidases are classified into three categories based on their cellular localizations: cytosolic, lysosomal, and plasma membrane-bound (3Monti E. Bassi M.T. Bresciani R. Civini S.

A major change detectable in Neu2 transfected cells was a decrease in ganglioside GM3, 1The abbreviations used are: GM3, N-acetylneuraminylgalactosylceramide; DANA, 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; NANA, N-acetylneuraminic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: GM3, N-acetylneuraminylgalactosylceramide; DANA, 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; NANA, N-acetylneuraminic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. concordant with an increase in lactosylceramide content. Several lines of evidence have indicated the association of glycosphingolipids with the cytoskeleton (11Tokuyama S. Moriya S. Taniguchi S. Yasui A. Miyasaki J. Orikasa S. Miyagi T. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Chan K.F. Liu Y. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In particular, the GM3 ganglioside has been suggested to interact with microtubules and intermediate filaments (13Gillard B.K. Thurmon L.T. Marcus D.M. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, Neu2 might act on GM3 leading to the alteration of the cytoskeleton functions, consistent with the decreased invasiveness of transfected melanoma cells (11Tokuyama S. Moriya S. Taniguchi S. Yasui A. Miyasaki J. Orikasa S. Miyagi T. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using highly metastatic sublines of mouse colon adenocarcinoma 26 in which endogenous Neu2 sialidase levels are inversely correlated with the metastatic capacities (14Sawada M. Moriya S. Saito S. Shineha R. Satomi S. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Kannagi R. Miyagi T. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Neu2 overexpression led to a marked inhibition of lung metastasis, invasion, and cell motility, as well as a decrease of sialyl Lewis X and, again, of GM3 cellular contents. Thus, desialylation of these target molecules including GM3 by cytosolic sialidase is somehow related to suppression of metastasis. The atomic structure of the human cytoplasmic sialidase may not only give further insights into the molecular mechanisms of its substrate recognition but also will provide important clues to understanding the catalytic mechanism of mammalian sialidases. Here we report the first crystal structures of a mammalian sialidase, human Neu2, in its free form and in complex with an inhibitor 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA, Fig. 1c). The core of Neu2 folds as a six-bladed β-propeller, typical of viral and bacterial sialidases. Interaction between Neu2 and DANA shows similarities with bacterial and viral counterparts but also exhibits some differences in the active site arrangement and dynamic nature of the loops containing residues responsible for catalysis and substrate recognition.Fig. 1Sialic acid and inhibitors.

Papini N. Fusi P. Croci G. Borsani G. Preti A. Tortora P. Tettamanti G. Venerando B. Monti E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3169-3179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Approximately 2.4 mg of Neu2 at a concentration of 1.8 mg·ml-1 was obtained from 1 liter of culture. Crystallization and Soaking of the Crystals—The purified protein was concentrated to 10 mg·ml-1 in 400 mm sodium chloride and 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.7. Crystals were grown in hanging drops at 289 K. For the apo form Neu2, the reservoir solution contained 100 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, 2.5 m NaCl, and the hanging drops contained 1:1 mixtures of the protein solution and the precipitants. Crystals grew in 1-2 days to a size of ∼500 × 200 × 50 μm3. The crystals were mounted in nylon loops (Hampton research) and flash-frozen at 100 K in a cryoprotectant solution containing 20% glycerol in addition to the precipitant solution. Crystals belong to the space group R3, with unit cell dimensions a = b = 145.6 Å, c = 64.6 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°, and contain one protein per asymmetric unit. “Sugar-induced form” crystals were prepared by soaking apo form crystals in the reservoir solution additionally containing 50 μm of one of the following, monosaccharides, galactose, glucose, or maltose, for 4 h. These crystals were handled in the same way as in the apo form crystals. Cell dimensions of the crystals soaked with sugar are equivalent to those of the apo form crystals. Soaking apo form crystals in solutions containing inhibitors, N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA, Fig. 1b) or DANA, either dissolved the crystals after a few days or did not give clear electron density of the bound ligands. Co-crystallization trials of Neu2 with either of the inhibitors using the same crystallization condition as the apo form gave rise to cracked crystals and the resulting crystal structure did not show any density of the inhibitors. Further screening for other crystallization conditions proved to be successful with DANA; crystals of the Neu2-DANA complex were obtained with a reservoir solution containing 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, 65% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 100 mm guanidine hydrochloride. Hanging drops were prepared at 289 K as a 1:1 mixture of the protein solution and the precipitant. The molar ratio of Neu2 to DANA in the protein solution was 1:50. The crystals grew in 20 days to an approximate size of 100 × 50 × 50 μm3. They were frozen in liquid nitrogen without additional cryoprotectant. The crystals of Neu2-DANA contain two complex molecules per asymmetric unit and belong to the space group C2 with the unit cell dimensions of a = 157.6 Å, b = 74.0 Å, c = 77.2 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 90.6°. Data Collection and Structure Determination—X-ray diffraction data were collected at the resolutions of 1.75, 1.49, and 2.85 Å at the Photon Factory AR-NW12 and BL6A beam lines for the apo, maltose-induced (referred as sugar-induced hereafter), and the DANA complex, respectively. The data were reduced and scaled using program HKL2000 (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38231) Google Scholar) and CCP4 programs (17Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The apo form structure of Neu2 was solved by the molecular replacement method using CNS (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Structures of the sugar-induced form and Neu2-DANA complex were solved by the molecular replacement method using the apo form structure as a search model. Initial model building of the Neu2 apo form was carried out by automated model building with the program ARP/wARP (19Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2559) Google Scholar). Further model building and refinement of the apo form Neu2 and that of the complex molecules were carried out manually with programs O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M.

Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar) and refinement with the CNS programs suite. Crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table I. After the model building, the protein structure was compared with those of other sialidases using programs of the CCP4 suite. Figures were drawn by a combination of the programs MOLSCRIPT (22Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), Grasp (23Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins Struct.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The final structures include residues 3-41, 50-106, 119-283, and 288-377 for the apo form Neu2, residues 4-42, 50-284, and 289-377 for the sugar-induced form, and residues 1-225, 229-283, and 288-377 for the Neu2-DANA complex form, respectively. Final Rfactor values for the Neu2 apo form, the sugar-induced form, and the Neu2-DANA complex are 20.13, 20.17, and 19.50%, respectively, with no residues in the disallowed regions. Neu2 Apo Form Structure—The Neu2 apo form adopts a typical six-bladed β-propeller fold with 26 β-strands and five α-helices (Fig. 2). The overall structure of the β-propeller is similar to those of bacterial sialidases and viral neuraminidases (26Taylor G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) despite low sequence identities between them. Each of the six antiparallel β-sheet blades is composed of four β-strands with the exceptions of strand D/blade I and strand A/blade III, which are broken into two (Fig. 2b). The N and C termini have extra residues outside of the β-propeller and are close to each other. Some α-helices are found in the loops between two consecutive β-strands (Fig. 2a α3, α4, and α5) or at the C terminus (Fig. 2a, α6 and α7). In addition, three Asp boxes typical of sialidases (27Roggentin P. Rothe B. Kaper J.B. Galen J. Lawrisuk L. Vimr E.R. Schauer R. Glycoconj. J. 1989; 6: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) are located in the second, third, and fourth blades of the propeller (Figs. 2b and 3). An acidic crevice at the center of the β-propeller forms an activating core for the enzymatic catalysis and the basic residues at the mouth of the crevice coordinate substrates (28Burmeister W.P. Henrissat B. Bosso C. Cusak S. Ruigrok R.W. Structure (Lond.). 1993; 1: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). On the opposite side of the β-propeller, an acidic deep cleft extends very close to the back of the catalytic site (Fig. 3). This cleft is also found in sialidases from other organisms such as trypanosome (29Buschiazzo A. Tavares G.A. Campetella O. Spinelli S. Cremona M.L. Paris G. Amaya M.F. Frasch A.C.C. Alzari P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), Vibrio cholerae (Protein Data Bank code 1KIT), leech Macrobdella decora (Protein Data Bank code 1SLL), and M. viridifaciens (Protein Data Bank codes 1EUT and 1EUU) and might act as an additional control mechanism by binding cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Cu2+, which are known to inhibit Neu2 (15Tringali C. Papini N. Fusi P. Croci G. Borsani G. Preti A. Tortora P. Tettamanti G. Venerando B. Monti E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3169-3179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30Miyagi T. Hata K. Hasegawa A. Aoyagi T. Glycoconj. J. 1993; 10: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Neu2 Sugar-induced Form Structure—Two loops are disordered on the top side of the apo form Neu2: one contains Glu111 important for the substrate binding and the other Asp46 for the catalysis. Soaking the apo form crystals with monosaccharide such as galactose, glucose, or maltose orders the former loop into α2 (Fig. 4b). Unfortunately, there is no electron density for the monosaccharide despite various attempts of co-crystallization and soaking. For example, soaking experiments in higher concentrations (100 and 150 mm) of monosaccharides dissolved the crystals after several hours. Neu2-DANA Complex Structure—The two complexes in the asymmetric unit of Neu2-DANA crystals show only minor structural differences. Thus, only one of them, chain A and C in the Protein Data Bank deposition 1VCU, will be discussed in detail here. Its overall structure is mostly similar to that of the apo form Neu2 (r.m.s.d. of 1.1 Å over 347 Cα atoms). Even at the resolution of 2.85 Å, the electron density of DANA was clear in the active site (Fig. 5c). DANA lies in a half-chair conformation interacting with 10 amino acids of the active site (Figs. 2b and 5). The binding is assured by a network of electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions with additional hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 5d). Upon binding of DANA, the two loops, which were disordered in the apo form, become ordered to form two helices α1 and α2 and cover the inhibitor in the active site (Fig. 4). In particular, Asp46 of α1 helix and Glu111 of the α2-helix come close to coordinate the inhibitor (Fig. 2b). To date, 13 mammalian sialidases have been cloned, including four from human (3Monti E. Bassi M.T. Bresciani R. Civini S. Croci G.L. Papini N. Riboni M. Zanchetti G. Ballabio A. Preti A. Tettamanti G. Venerando B. Borsani G. Genomics. 2004; 83: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown that Neu2 also folds as a six-bladed β-propeller and adopts the same active site architecture indicating a similar hydrolysis mechanism. In addition, a structure-based sequence alignment of Neu2 with the other human sialidases suggests that they also fold as six blade β-propellers with the conserved residues forming the active site. 2L. M. G. Chavas, C. Tringali, P. Fusi, B. Venerando, G. Tettamanti, R. Kato, E. Monti, and S. Wakatsuki, unpublished data. On the other hand, new drugs have been designed to target virus sialidases, in particular the influenza virus neuraminidases, based on the x-ray structures (31McKimm-Breschkin J.L. Colman P.M. Jin B. Krippner G.Y. McDonald M. Reece P.A. Tucker S.P. Waddington L. Watson K.G. Wu K.G. Wu W.Y. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 3118-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus a detailed structural analysis of Neu2 might shed light on the catalytic mechanism of the human sialidases and give additional clues for designing a new generation of neuraminidase inhibitors based on the difference between human sialidases and bacterial and viral neuraminidases. Crystal Contacts in Apo and Sugar-induced Forms and Inhibitor-Complex Structures—The loop connecting β-strands B and C of blade III (Fig. 2b) plays an important role in the crystal contacts and the active site accessibility. In the apo and sugar-induced forms (space group R3), this loop plugs directly into the active site of the neighboring molecule and prevents inhibitors from entering. This explains the failure of soaking experiments of the apo form crystals in inhibitor containing solutions. On the other hand, in the Neu2-DANA complex structure (space group C2), the loop participates in the crystal packing by interacting with the same loop of the next molecule. In this case, the loop is unable to enter the active site of the next molecule because the inhibitor and the loops (helices α1 and α2) involved in the inhibitor coordination already occupy the active site. Structural Changes upon Complex Formation—A comparison between the complex and sugar-induced structures shows a movement of helix α2 by about 16 Å, bringing Glu111 to the active site, illustrating the flexibility of the loop (Fig. 4). Other residues of the catalytic pocket stay in the same positions as in the apo form, with an average r.m.s.d. of 0.9 Å for all the main chain and side chain atoms in the active site. Previous studies on viral neuraminidases proposed a catalytic mechanism where the sialic acid is first recognized by the arginine triad and then hydrolyzed by an acidic residue (28Burmeister W.P. Henrissat B. Bosso C. Cusak S. Ruigrok R.W. Structure (Lond.). 1993; 1: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Combining these results, we suggest a two-step binding mechanism. Once a substrate enters the catalytic crevice, 8 out of the 10 residues (excluding Asp46 and Glu111) coordinate the sialic acid by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 5b). At this stage, the catalytic site still adopts an open conformation, i.e. Asp46 and Glu111 located away from their final positions. Then the two loops containing Asp46 and Glu111 come in close contact with the sialic acid and partially cover the catalytic site (Fig. 5b). Here, Asp46 is at an appropriate distance from the C2 atom of the sialic acid for the reaction to proceed, whereas Glu111 forms three hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of the glycerol moiety. Flexibility of Substrate Recognition—Four residues, Arg21, Arg237, Arg302, and Tyr334, conserved in sequence as well as in space among sialidases, coordinate the carboxylic oxygen atoms of DANA by seven hydrogen bonds. The cluster of the three arginines is known as the arginine triad, which encircles the carboxylate group. Tyr334 presents its hydroxyl group in close proximity to the C2 carbon atom, a direct target of catalysis, at a distance of 3.2 Å. When superimposed with active site residues of the bacterial model, 1EUS, the arginine triads and tyrosines show high structural similarities (Fig. 5e). The fact that Neu2, the first human sialidase whose structure has been characterized, also adopts the same active site architecture reinforces the notion of a common ancestor of sialidases despite the low sequence homologies to the bacterial and viral counterparts. But the parallel between Neu2, bacterial sialidases, and viral neuraminidases ends here. On the opposite side of DANA, three residues Glu111, Tyr179, and Tyr181 help positioning of the inhibitor by interacting with the O-7 and O-9 oxygens (Fig. 5). Based on the crystallographic structure of influenza virus neuraminidase, new potential inhibitors of the enzyme have been developed and extensively studied (31McKimm-Breschkin J.L. Colman P.M. Jin B. Krippner G.Y. McDonald M. Reece P.A. Tucker S.P. Waddington L. Watson K.G. Wu K.G. Wu W.Y. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 3118-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32Colman P.M. Vaccine. 2002; 20: S55-S58Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The residues described above are not shared by bacterial sialidases and viral neuraminidases and therefore can be exploited as a key difference for drug design against bacteria, influenza, and other viruses. Moreover, some sialidases have a glutamine residue, as opposed to glutamic acid, at the position corresponding to Glu111 to coordinate DANA by electrostatic interactions, which seems to alter the substrate specificity. For instance, a cytosolic sialidase from Chinese hamster ovary cells (67.4% sequence identity with Neu2) has corresponding glutamic acid and glutamine residues swapped at this position, hence the glutamine interacts with substrates and is able to hydrolyze N-acetylneuraminic acid as well as N-glycolylneuraminic acid (33Müthing J. Burg M. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 330: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the glutamic acid (Glu111) of Neu2 is located at the beginning of helix α2, which becomes ordered upon inhibitor binding (see above), and is directly followed by four glutamines (Gln112, Gln113, Gln114, and Gln116). Taken together, these results imply a possible adaptability of the protein for substrates of different sizes by interchanging glutamic acid and glutamine residues and rearranging the helix as the glycerol hydroxyls of the inhibitor are necessary for its recognition. Further structural and mutagenesis studies are now under way to confirm this adaptability and to exploit the difference in this part of the active site for designing better inhibitors against viral and bacterial counterparts with no affinities against human sialidases. Asp Boxes—Asp boxes are a β-hairpin structure, architecturally similar to the hairpin of chitobiase, and are found in several O-glycosyl hydrolases, such as sulfate oxydase, microbial ribonuclease, and sialidases (27Roggentin P. Rothe B. Kaper J.B. Galen J. Lawrisuk L. Vimr E.R. Schauer R. Glycoconj. J. 1989; 6: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 34Copley R.R. Russel R.B. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the Neu2 structure, two Asp boxes STDHGRTW (residues 129-136) and SHDHGRTW (residues 199-206) are easily identified (where boldface letters indicate residues structurally important for Asp boxes). A least square minimization between the two Asp boxes resulted in an r.m.s.d. of only 0.3 Å over 32 atoms. A third Asp box STNDGLDF (residues 247-254), which we previously predicted as a less conserved Asp box (Fig. 2 of Ref. 35Monti E. Preti A. Nesti C. Ballabio A. Borsani G. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1313-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was confirmed (Asp box 3, Figs. 2b and 3) with an r.m.s.d. of 0.4 Å compared with the two other boxes. A water molecule stabilizes the hairpin structure at the center of three conserved residues, serine, aspartate, and tryptophan, in each of the three Asp boxes of Neu2 apo form. In the structure of Neu2-DANA complex, the water molecule is not visible, presumably due to the low resolution of the data (2.85 Å); nevertheless, the overall topology of the Asp boxes remains the same as that of the apo form. In Neu2, the Asp boxes are positioned on the opposite side of the catalytic crevice (Fig. 3). In addition, no special hydrophobic surface or extended contact surface is visible between the Asp boxes. The residues of the known Asp boxes show a high sequence homology, with five of them strictly conserved at defined positions: SXDXGXTW. The two Asp boxes STDHGRTW (residues 129-136) and SHDHGRTW (residues 199-206) of Neu2, separated by 62 amino acids, follow the same sequence similarity: S(T/H)DHGRTW. Screening of proteins containing the previously known consensus sequence was established (34Copley R.R. Russel R.B. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) but resulted so far with no clear indication of biological roles of the Asp boxes in O-glycosyl hydrolases. The sequence of the third Asp box in Neu2, STNDGLDF, extends the consensus sequence of Asp boxes as SX(D/N)XGX(T/D)Φ, where Φ stands for aromatic residues. A new screening may therefore give further insights into the function of these structural elements. We thank Masashi Ozawa for his excellent work on the biochemical preparations as well as Tomoo Shiba and Yusuke Yamada for their help and useful discussions on the structure determination."
https://openalex.org/W2004361019,"Despite evidence that protein kinases are regulators of apoptosis, a specific role for phosphatases in regulating cell survival has not been established. Here we show that alpha4, a noncatalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is required to repress apoptosis in murine cells. alpha4 is a nonredundant regulator of the dephosphorylation of the transcription factors c-Jun and p53. As a result of alpha4 deletion, multiple proapoptotic genes were transcribed. Either inhibition of new protein synthesis or Bcl-xL overexpression suppressed apoptosis initiated by alpha4 deletion. Thus, mammalian cell viability depends on repression of transcription-initiated apoptosis mediated by a component of PP2A."

Here we characterize the conformational changes in β-arrestin 2 (arrestin 3) by comparing the limited tryptic proteolysis patterns and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiles of β-arrestin 2 in the presence of a phosphopeptide (V2R-pp) derived from the C terminus of the vasopressin type II receptor (V2R) or the corresponding nonphosphopeptide (V2R-np). V2R-pp binds to β-arrestin 2 specifically, whereas V2R-np does not. Activation of β-arrestin 2 upon V2R-pp binding involves the release of its C terminus, as indicated by exposure of a previously inaccessible cleavage site, one of the polar core residues Arg394, and rearrangement of its N terminus, as indicated by the shielding of a previously accessible cleavage site, residue Arg8. Interestingly, binding of the polyanion heparin also leads to release of the C terminus of β-arrestin 2; however, heparin and V2R-pp have different binding site(s) and/or induce different conformational changes in β-arrestin 2. Release of the C terminus from the rest of β-arrestin 2 has functional consequences in that it increases the accessibility of a clathrin binding site (previously demonstrated to lie between residues 371 and 379) thereby enhancing clathrin binding to β-arrestin 2 by 10-fold. Thus, the V2R-pp can activate β-arrestin 2 in vitro, most likely mimicking the effects of an activated phosphorylated 7MSR. These results provide the first direct evidence of conformational changes associated with the transition of β-arrestin 2 from its basal inactive conformation to its biologically active conformation and establish a system in which receptor-β-arrestin interactions can be modeled in vitro. β-Arrestins are multifunctional adaptor proteins, which mediate desensitization, endocytosis, and alternate signaling pathways of seven membrane-spanning receptors (7MSRs).

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The human genome encodes ∼1,000 7MSRs, which function primarily in the transmission of diverse signals (including light, odorants, chemoattractants, neurotransmitters, and hormones) from the extracellular environment to the interior of the cell (1Lefkowitz R.J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The dynamic sensitivity of 7MSR function is in large part a function of their regulation by the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)/β-arrestin system (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This regulation is accomplished by a two-step process involving the phosphorylation of the receptor, usually at its C terminus, by GRKs, and the subsequent binding of β-arrestins, which prevents further receptor activation of G proteins (desensitization) (1Lefkowitz R.J.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin binding to the receptor also facilitates clathrin-mediated endocytosis (internalization) of the receptor (5Goodman Jr., O.B.

In stark contrast to the multiplicity of 7MSRs, there are only four known isoforms of arrestin: visual arrestin (arrestin 1), cone arrestin, β-arrestin 1 (arrestin 2), and β-arrestin 2 (arrestin 3) (3Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 8Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Visual arrestin and cone arrestin are expressed primarily in the eye and are almost exclusively involved in visual signaling processes. β-Arrestins 1 and 2 are ubiquitously expressed and are fundamental to the regulation of 7MSR-mediated signaling throughout the body. In addition to their well characterized role in 7MSR desensitization and internalization, recent evidence suggests that the β-arrestins also function as signaling transducers, which interact directly with a variety of effectors, such as non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the c-Src family and extracellular-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK3), in a receptor activation-dependent manner (3Shenoy S.K.

These receptor activation-dependent interactions of β-arrestins suggest that the conformations of free (basal or inactive) and receptor-bound (active) β-arrestins are different, and that conformational changes in β-arrestin occur upon binding to activated phosphorylated receptors. Multiple lines of evidence, including mutagenesis and biochemical and biophysical studies, suggest that visual arrestin undergoes substantial conformational changes upon binding to light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin (12Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1037-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 105-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, to date, there has been no direct evidence of conformational changes in β-arrestins. For example, the solved crystal structure of bovine β-arrestin 1 is of the molecule in its basal inactive conformation (14Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 15Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Thus, the structural and molecular basis for β-arrestin activation as well as the associated conformational changes remains largely unknown. 7MSRs can be divided into two broad classes, “Class A” and “Class B,” based on the nature of their interaction with β-arrestin (16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Class A receptors, such as the β2-adrenergic receptor, interact with β-arrestin transiently, whereas Class B receptors, such as the V2R, form relatively stable receptor/β-arrestin complexes. This increased stability of the interaction between the receptor and β-arrestin makes Class B 7MSRs, like V2R, ideal for studying the ability of a receptor to induce conformational changes in β-arrestin. Accordingly, in an effort to investigate the activation mechanism of β-arrestins, we used limited proteolysis and MALDI-TOF MS to characterize conformational changes in β-arrestin 2 upon binding a synthetic phosphopeptide (V2R-pp) derived from the C terminus of the Class B V2R to mimic receptor binding to β-arrestin 2. Peptide Synthesis—The phosphopeptide (V2R-pp) and the corresponding nonphosphopeptide (V2R-np) derived from the C terminus of the human V2R were synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory of Baylor College of Medicine. The C-terminal sequence of V2R is ARGRTPPSLGPQDESCTTASSSLAKDTSS, with the phosphorylated residues in V2R-pp underlined. Both phosphopeptide and nonphosphopeptide have been subjected to analytical HPLC, mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis before their use in our in vitro binding experiments. The other two nonspecific peptides, a 28-mer WKKELTETFMEAQRLLRRAPKFLNKSRS (termed 28-mer peptide) and a 30-mer NVWRPDGQMPDDMKGVSGQEAAPSSKSGMC (termed 30-mer peptide), were synthesized previously by our laboratory. Mutagenesis and Purification of Rat β-Arrestin 2—Wild-type rat β-arrestin 2 was cloned into a pGEX4T3 expression vector (expresses GST-tagged β-arrestin 2, i.e. GST-β-arrestin 2) or a pET29 expression vector (expresses S-protein-tagged β-arrestin 2, i.e. S-β-arrestin 2). All mutations discussed here were constructed with a QuikChange® II Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS. To overexpress GST-β-arrestin 2 in E. coli, 800 ml of LB medium were inoculated with 10 ml of overnight cell cultures and grown initially at 37 °C until the OD600 reached 0.6-0.8. The temperature was then lowered to 25 °C, and the expression of GST-β-arrestin 2 was induced with 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After overnight incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,500 × g, and lysed by freeze-thaw followed by sonication in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine). The lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant filtered through a 0.8-μm membrane. The clarified supernatant was then loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) by gravity and washed with 20 column volumes of binding buffer. The GST-β-arrestin 2-bound glutathione Sepharose was resuspended in two column volumes of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT. Thrombin protease (Sigma) (10 unit/liter of cell culture) was added to cleave the GST protein tag (seven extra amino acids (GSPNSRV) remain after thrombin cleavage (Fig. 1)). The thrombin digestion was performed at 4 °C overnight, and flow through was collected followed by two additional washes with the digestion buffer. Washes were pooled with the initial flow through and diluted to a final NaCl concentration of 50 mm. The sample was then loaded on a heparin-Sepharose column and eluted with a 50-350 mm linear NaCl gradient. Fractions containing β-arrestin 2 were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine. After dialysis, the sample was loaded onto a SP-Sepharose high performance column, and β-arrestin 2 was eluted with a 50-350 mm linear NaCl gradient in the dialysis buffer. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pooled based on purity, concentrated to 5-10 mg/ml, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Protein purity was more than 95% based on SDS-PAGE analysis, and typical yield was 1-2 mg of purified β-arrestin 2/liter of cell culture. Cell growth conditions for the S-β-arrestin 2 was the same as that for the GST-β-arrestin 2. An S-Tag™ Thrombin purification kit (Novagen) was used to purify the S-β-arrestin 2. Cells were lysed under the same conditions as that for the GST-β-arrestin 2, and the cell lysate was incubated with S-protein beads for 2 h with agitation at 4 °C, followed by washing with 20 column volumes of binding buffer. The β-arrestin 2-bound S-protein beads were then divided into two portions. One portion of the beads was digested with thrombin (10 unit/liter of cell culture), and the β-arrestin 2 was eluted and subjected to limited tryptic proteolysis. The other portion of the beads was used directly for in vitro clathrin binding assays. Limited Tryptic Proteolysis—A 5:1 molar ratio of ligand (V2R-pp, V2R-np, the other two nonspecific peptides or heparin) to β-arrestin 2 (0.5-1 mg/ml) was used to reveal the effects of ligand on limited tryptic proteolysis of β-arrestin 2 in all experiments except where otherwise indicated. An average molecular mass of 12,000 Da was used to calculate the concentration of heparin (Sigma). Prior to proteolysis, β-arrestin 2, in the absence or presence of ligand, was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. An appropriate amount of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) was added to the mixture for limited proteolysis. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for indicated time points. At each time point, 5 μl (2.5-5 μg of β-arrestin 2) was removed from each reaction. For SDS-PAGE analysis, each sample was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube containing 5 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer, and boiled for 5 min to quench the tryptic digestion. The samples were run on 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) to determine the effects of ligands on the digestion pattern of β-arrestin 2. For MALDI-TOF MS analysis, the samples were transferred to new empty microcentrifuge tubes and flash frozen for MALDI-TOF analysis to measure the molecular masses for the proteolytic fragments. MALDI-TOF MS—MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager DE Biospectrometry Work station (Applied Biosystems) in the linear mode using a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Mass spectra were collected in the positive ion mode using an acceleration voltage of 25 kV and a delay of 900 ns. The grid voltage, guide wire voltage, low mass gate, and laser intensity were set to 92.5%, 0.15%, 10,000.0 m/z, and 2580, respectively. Each mass spectrum collected represents the sum of the data from 75 laser shots. Sinapinic acid (SA) (Sigma) was used as the matrix and the SA matrix solution was prepared as a saturated, aqueous solution that contained 45% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. During MALDI-TOF sample preparation, 1 μl of flash frozen limited tryptic proteolysis products was mixed with 9 μl of SA matrix solution before depositing 1 μl (1-2 μm final protein concentration) of the sample matrix mixture on the MALDI-TOF sample plate. The sample was allowed to air-dry at room temperature and then subjected to MALDITOF analysis. Cytochrome c and carbonic anhydrase were used as internal calibrants for data calibration. For each limited tryptic proteolytic fragment, the mean of the experimental molecular mass (m/z) was determined, and a standard deviation was calculated from six independent experiments. β-Arrestin 2 was also subjected to theoretical MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the molecular masses for all potential tryptic proteolytic fragments using a ProteinProspector program (prospector.ucsf.edu/). The experimental molecular mass (m/z) of each limited proteolytic fragment was compared with the theoretical masses (m/z) predicted by ProteinProspector program, and all the candidate fragments with theoretical masses (m/z) within the standard deviations were selected (Table I). The limited proteolytic fragments with only one possible theoretical mass (m/z) within standard deviation were assigned to individual proteolytic fragments directly, with or without further confirmation of the assignments by N-terminal sequencing or by other methods. The fragments with more than one possible theoretical mass (m/z), which could not be distinguished by MALDI-TOF MS, were designated by coupling the MS data with N-terminal sequencing, Western blot analysis with antibodies that recognize different domains of β-arrestin 2, and limited tryptic proteolysis of truncated β-arrestin 2 mutants.Table IAssignment of the limited tryptic proteolytic fragments of β-arrestin 2Candidate fragments (theoretical)MALDI-TOF m/z (experimental)Final assignment of tryptic fragmentsPredicted tryptic fragments (amino acid)Predicted m/z within standard deviationsβ-arrestin 2β-arrestin 2 + V2R-npβ-arrestin 2 + V2R-ppFive amino acids of N-terminal sequenceRecognition by antibody F4C1Molecular masses of tryptic fragments on SDS-PAGEkDaGly−7-His416Gly−7-His4164784647854 ± 847857 ± 2347855 ± 17GSPNS+48Gly−7-Arg394Gly−7-Arg39445139——45158 ± 30GSPNS+45Asp19-His41645187Gly−7-Arg364Gly−7-Arg3644165041636 ± 2441646 ± 1841646 ± 21GSPNS+42Val−1-Arg364?Val−1-Arg3644105241042 ± 2341039 ± 2741062 ± 15/Val35-Lys39841090Val9-Arg364Val9-Arg3644011140123 ± 3140102 ± 21—/Gly−7-Arg287Gly−7-Arg2873330733315 ± 1233318 ± 2233317 ± 15/+33Leu101-Arg39633327Val9-Arg287Val9-Arg2873176831758 ± 1431759 ± 24—/+32 Open table in a new tab N-terminal Sequencing—The limited proteolytic products were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The proteolytic fragments of β-arrestin 2 were then electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Proteins bound to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were stained by Coomassie Blue R-250, and the membrane was washed with Millipore water for 5 min and air-dried. The stained protein bands were excised with a clean razor blade, placed in a 1.5-ml conical centrifuge tube and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The N-terminal sequencing was performed by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility of University of Oklahoma Health Science Center. Clathrin Binding—To measure clathrin binding to β-arrestin 2, 25 μl of β-arrestin 2 S-protein beads (containing 20 μg of S-β-arrestin 2), in the absence or presence of 5:1 (ligand:β-arrestin 2) molar ratio of ligand (V2R-pp, V2R-np, 28-mer peptide or heparin) were incubated in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) at room temperature for 30 min. After the incubation, the volume of each mixture was brought up to 500 μl with binding buffer, followed by the addition of 5 μg of clathrin heavy chain (Sigma) and agitated for 2 h at 4 °C. The β-arrestin 2 bound S-protein beads were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g in a benchtop microcentrifuge, washed with 1 ml of binding buffer 5 times, and incubated with 25 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer. Clathrin binding to β-arrestin 2 was measured by Western blot analysis with an anti-clathrin antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Blots were re-probed with an anti-β-arrestin 2 antibody (A2CT) to ensure equal loading of β-arrestin 2 for each reaction. Conformational Changes in β-Arrestin 2 in Vitro upon Its Specific Association with Phosphopeptide V2R-pp—Rat β-arrestin 2 was expressed and purified from E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The primary sequence of the purified recombinant rat β-arrestin 2 cleaved from GST-β-arrestin 2 is shown in Fig. 1. To investigate the β-arrestin 2 activation mechanism by 7MSR and the associated conformational changes, the purified rat β-arrestin 2 was subjected to limited proteolysis in the absence or presence of a synthetic phosphopeptide, V2R-pp, or the corresponding nonphosphopeptide, V2R-np, derived from the C terminus of the Class B receptor V2R. Among several proteases tested in this study, TPCK-treated trypsin yields the best resolution of the digestion fragments. The optimal w/w ratio of trypsin to β-arrestin 2 for resolution of digestion fragments by SDS-PAGE was determined to range from 1:2,000 to 1:5,000 at 37 °C. The limited proteolysis of β-arrestin 2 in the absence of peptide and in the presence of 5:1 (peptide/β-arrestin 2) molar ratio of V2R-np results in identical digestion patterns on SDS-PAGE (panels I and II in Fig. 2A), which we term the “control pattern.” As illustrated in the control pattern panel of Fig. 2B, full-length β-arrestin 2 (residues Gly-7-His416) appears at 48 kDa and digestion with trypsin results in fragments with the apparent molecular masses of 42, 33, and 32 kDa (this study focused only on these major fragments). However, in the presence of 5:1 (peptide/β-arrestin 2) molar ratio of V2R-pp, the limited proteolysis pattern of β-arrestin 2 is altered and represented as “V2R-pp pattern” (panel III of Fig. 2A). Within 15 min of proteolysis in the presence of V2R-pp, a new fragment with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa is generated, whereas the prominent 32-kDa fragment seen in the control pattern is not generated (V2R-pp pattern of Fig. 2B). An identical V2R-pp pattern is also obtained when β-arrestin 2 cleaved from S-β-arrestin 2 is used (data not shown). Limited tryptic proteolysis of β-arrestin 2 was also conducted in the presence of two other nonspecific peptides, a 28-mer peptide and a 30-mer peptide (the sequences are shown under “Experimental Procedures”). Neither peptide had any effect on the limited proteolysis pattern of β-arrestin 2. Trypsin is a pancreatic serine protease that cleaves peptide bonds in proteins that have carbonyl groups donated by arginine or lysine. A change in protein conformation can mask or unmask such cleavage sites, and an alteration in the limited proteolysis pattern of a protein can be indicative of conformational changes (17Huang S.G.

Thus, the change in digestion pattern of β-arrestin 2 in the presence of V2R-pp implies that V2R-pp binds to β-arrestin 2 specifically in vitro and induces conformational changes. V2R-np does not alter the digestion pattern of β-arrestin 2, suggesting that V2R-np either cannot induce conformational changes upon binding or cannot bind β-arrestin 2 (see below). Requirement for Phosphorylation on Residues in Synthetic Peptide for Inducing Conformational Changes in β-Arrestin 2 in Vitro—We have shown that V2R-np cannot induce changes in the pattern of limited tryptic proteolysis of β-arrestin 2 at a 5:1 (peptide/β-arrestin 2) molar ratio. This could be caused by a lower affinity of V2R-np for β-arrestin 2. We therefore examined the effect of different peptide to β-arrestin 2 molar ratios on the limited tryptic proteolysis pattern of β-arrestin 2. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3A, V2R-pp alters the control pattern (lane labeled with 0 in the upper panel) of β-arrestin 2 at a 1:1 (peptide/β-arrestin 2) molar ratio to a V2R-pp pattern (lane labeled with 1:1 in the upper panel), whereas V2R-np does not change the proteolysis pattern even at a 100:1 (peptide/β-arrestin 2) molar ratio (lane labeled with 100:1 in the lower panel). Thus, even a 100-fold molar excess of V2R-np cannot induce conformational changes in β-arrestin 2. We next performed a competition binding experiment of V2R-pp and V2R-np to β-arrestin 2 (Fig. 3B). β-Arrestin 2 was incubated, simultaneously, with a 1:1 (peptide/β-arrestin 2) molar ratio of V2R-pp and with different ratios of excess V2R-np prior to limited tryptic proteolysis. A 1:1 molar ratio of V2R-pp induces a V2R-pp pattern (lane 4), whereas even a 100-fold excess of V2R-np cannot compete with the binding of V2R-pp to β-arrestin 2 (lane 6). This further supports the hypothesis that V2R-pp binds specifically to β-arrestin 2 and that the V2R-np binds either very weakly or not at all. We also tested the effects of salt concentration ([NaCl]) on limited tryptic proteolysis of β-arrestin 2 in the presence of V2R-pp (data not shown). Our data indicate that the association of V2R-pp with β-arrestin 2 is salt concentration-dependent. At low NaCl concentration, V2R-pp binds to β-arrestin 2 and causes a V2R-pp pattern of limited proteolysis. When the NaCl concentration increases to 550 mm, the association of V2R-pp with β-arrestin 2 is disrupted and the proteolysis pattern returns to a control pattern, indicating that electrostatic interactions may play a crucial role in the association of V2R-pp with the positively charged residues in β-arrestin 2. Thus phosphorylation of the synthetic peptide is required for inducing conformational changes in β-arrestin 2 in vitro, consistent with the notion that β-arrestin 2 binds to 7MSRs in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion (3Shenoy S.K.

https://openalex.org/W2068728775,"When considering the daunting complexity of eukaryotic genomes, some comfort can be found in the fact that the human genome may contain only 30,000 to 40,000 genes. Moreover, growing evidence suggests that genomes may be organized in such a way as to take advantage of space. A gene's location in the linear DNA sequence and its position in the three-dimensional nucleus can both be important in its regulation. Contrary to prevailing notions in this postgenomic era, the bacteriophage λ, a paragon of simplicity, may still have a few things to teach us with respect to these facets of nonrandom genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2107811029,"Computational tools can markedly accelerate the rate at which murine genetic models can be analyzed. We developed a computational method for mapping phenotypic traits that vary among inbred strains onto haplotypic blocks. This method correctly predicted the genetic basis for strain-specific differences in several biologically important traits. It was also used to identify an allele-specific functional genomic element regulating H2-E α gene expression. This functional element, which contained the binding sites for YY1 and a second transcription factor that is probably serum response factor, is located within the first intron of the H2-E α gene. This computational method will greatly improve our ability to identify the genetic basis for a variety of phenotypic traits, ranging from qualitative trait information to quantitative gene expression data, which vary among inbred mouse strains."
https://openalex.org/W1963881156,"Calmodulin (CaM) is a major effector for the intracellular actions of Ca 2+ in nearly all cell types. We identified a CaM-binding protein, designated regulator of calmodulin signaling (RCS). G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR)–dependent activation of protein kinase A (PKA) led to phosphorylation of RCS at Ser 55 and increased its binding to CaM. Phospho-RCS acted as a competitive inhibitor of CaM-dependent enzymes, including protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B, also called calcineurin). Increasing RCS phosphorylation blocked GPCR- and PP2B-mediated suppression of L-type Ca 2+ currents in striatal neurons. Conversely, genetic deletion of RCS significantly increased this modulation. Through a molecular mechanism that amplifies GPCR- and PKA-mediated signaling and attenuates GPCR- and PP2B-mediated signaling, RCS synergistically increases the phosphorylation of key proteins whose phosphorylation is regulated by PKA and PP2B."
https://openalex.org/W2034265459,"Relatively little is known about the importance of amino acid interactions in protein and phenotypic evolution. Here we examine whether mutations that are pathogenic in Drosophila melanogaster become fixed via epistasis in other Dipteran genomes. Overall divergence at pathogenic amino acid sites is reduced. However, approximately 10% of the substitutions at these sites carry the exact same pathogenic amino acid found in D. melanogaster mutants. Hence compensatory mutation(s) must have evolved. Surprisingly, the fraction 10% is not affected by phylogenetic distance. These results support a selection-driven process that allows compensated amino acid substitutions to become rapidly fixed in taxa with large populations."

Here we report the effect of complex formation on the catalytic properties of NAGK. Although pH and ion dependence are not affected, the catalytic efficiency of NAGK is strongly enhanced by binding of PII, with Km decreasing by a factor of 10 and Vmax increasing 4-fold. In addition, arginine feedback inhibition of NAGK is strongly decreased in the presence of PII, resulting in a tight control of NAGK activity under physiological conditions by PII. Analysis of the NAGK-PII complex suggests that one PII trimer binds to one NAGK hexamer with a Kd of ∼3 nm. Complex formation is strongly affected by ATP and ADP. ADP is a strong inhibitor of complex formation, whereas ATP inhibits complex formation only in the absence of divalent cations or in the presence of Mg2+ ions, together with increased 2-oxoglutarate concentrations.

PII proteins constitute a large family of signal transduction proteins reported from all three domains of life. Bacterial PII signaling proteins have been shown to play pivotal roles in the control of various aspects of nitrogen assimilation, such as ammonium assimilation (reviewed in Refs. 1Ninfa A.J.

In these cellular processes, PII proteins exert control on the level of transcription, e.g. by interaction with a two-component sensor kinase NtrB (6Jiang P. Ninfa A.J. J.

In addition, PII proteins bind the effector molecules 2-oxoglutarate and ATP in a synergistic manner (19Kamberov E.S. Atkinson M.R. Ninfa A.J. J. Biol.

Generally, cyanobacterial PII proteins are subject to covalent modification in response to the cellular nitrogen/carbon status through phosphorylation at seryl residue 49, as shown for S. elongatus PII (4Forchhammer K.

However, PII proteins from the genus Prochlorococcus and the plant PII homologues seem not to be covalently modified, although their sequences contains residue Ser-49 (25Palinska K.A. Laloui W.

Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of S. elongatus PII depends on the intracellular 2-oxoglutarate level, with high levels favoring PII phosphorylation and low levels favoring PII-P dephosphorylation (4Forchhammer K.

Microbiol. 1997; 26: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of phospho-PII (PII-P) in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 cells is catalyzed by a PP2C homologue protein phosphatase, termed PphA (28Irmler A. Forchhammer K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12978-12983Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of PII-P by PphA is controlled by the effector molecules binding to PII-P. 2-Oxoglutarate in synergy with ATP leads to a strong inhibition of dephosphorylation, whereas ADP has a partial inhibitory effect (29Ruppert U.

Plant. 2004; 120: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Unlike in proteobacteria, receptors of PII signaling have not been known at the molecular level in cyanobacteria, although physiological studies suggested PII to be involved in the regulation of nitrite/nitrate transport (11Lee H.M. Flores E. Forchhammer K. Herro A. Tandeau de Marsac N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the global transcriptional activator NtcA under conditions of nitrogen deprivation (31Aldehni M.F. Sauer J. Spielhaupter C.

Yeast two-hybrid studies with PII- and NAGK-encoding genes from various cyanobacteria and plants suggested that PII-dependent NAGK regulation is conserved in organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis (38Burrilo S. Luque I. Fuentes I. Contreras A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3346-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Nonphosphorylated PII forms a stable complex with NAGK and stimulates its catalytic activity, whereas mutations in Ser-49 abolish complex formation and stimulation of enzyme activity (33Heinrich A. Maheswaran M. Ruppert U. Forchhammer K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In agreement with the crucial role of Ser-49 in complex formation, enhanced NAGK activity is only observed in S. elongatus extracts in which PII is present in its nonphosphorylated state, whereas in extracts containing phospho-PII, NAGK is as low as in PII mutant cells. To gain a deeper insight into the factors controlling NAGK-PII complex formation and activation of enzyme activity, a biochemical study of PII-NAGK interaction was performed. Here we report the principal catalytic and structural properties of S. elongatus NAGK and its modulation by PII complex formation and the role of effector molecules and divalent cations on complex formation and stability. Overexpression and Purification of PII and NAGK—Overexpression and purification of recombinant PII protein with C-terminal fused Strep-tag II peptide (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) was performed as reported previously (33Heinrich A. Maheswaran M. Ruppert U. Forchhammer K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For preparation of His6-tagged recombinant NAGK, the argB gene from S. elongatus was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using the following primer pair: His tag NAGK for, 5′-TCATATGTCTAGCGAGTTTATCGAAGCAG-3′, and His tag NAGK rev, 5′-TGGATCCAGGTCACGGATCGCTCATTG-3′. The resulting 960-bp PCR product was directly cloned into the PCR cloning vector pGEM-T (Promega) resulting in plasmid pGEM-NAGK. DNA from this plasmid was digested with NdeI and BamHI. The 953-bp fragment containing the argB gene was isolated and cloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of expression vector pET15b (Novagen) to generate plasmid pET-NAGK, which encodes an N-terminal His6 fusion to the ArgB polypeptide. After verifying the sequence of pET-NAGK, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). These cells were grown to an absorbance (A600) of about 0.8; overexpression of His6-NAGK was initiated by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Incubation was continued for 2 h at 26 °C to minimize the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and kept frozen until use. To prepare His6-NAGK, the cell pellet was thawed and resuspended in buffer containing Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted by sonification and unbroken cells, and cell debris was removed from the lysate by two consecutive centrifugations (10 min at 10,000 × g and 30 min at 30,000 × g) at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded on a 15-ml Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) column connected to a BioLogic chromatography station (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 400 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole until basal absorbance was attained, and the bound His-tagged protein was then eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 400 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). The elution was collected in 2.5-ml fractions, and the purity of the samples was checked by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing pure NAGK were pooled and dialyzed against a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 25% (v/v) glycerol and stored at –20 °C until use. The concentrations of the purified proteins were calculated from their absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 9770 m–1 cm–1 for NAGK and 8480 m–1 cm–1 for PII calculated from their amino acid composition (39Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Assay of NAGK Activity—Activity of purified His6-NAGK was measured using the hydroxylamine-containing colorimetric assay (40Haas D. Leisinger T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with modifications described previously (33Heinrich A. Maheswaran M. Ruppert U. Forchhammer K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 7.5, unless otherwise stated. For the determination of optimum pH, hydroxylamine in the reaction buffer was titrated with various amounts of Tris (base) until the final pH was reached. Reaction conditions and calculation of specific activities was performed as described (33Heinrich A. Maheswaran M. Ruppert U. Forchhammer K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The program GraphPadPrism (GraphPad Software, San Diego) was used for fitting to the arginine inhibition data and generating the sigmoidal curves. This same program was used for hyperbolic fitting of the substrate saturation data, and for estimating Vmax and Km value. BIAcore Surface Plasmon Resonance Detection—Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a BIAcore X biosensor system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). To immobilize His6-NAGK on the NTA-biosensor surface, first Ni2+ was bound to the NTA surface of both flow chambers through injection of 10 μl of a 5 mm NiSO4 solution. Then His6-NAGK was injected to flow chamber 2 in a volume of 50 μlat a concentration of 30 nm (hexamers) in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5). This resulted in an increase of resonance units of ∼1500. Experiments were performed at 25 °C in HBS buffer at a flow rate of 15 μl/min. To analyze the effect of small molecules on PII binding to the His6-NAGK surface, the analyte was incubated for 5 min on ice with the various effector molecules as indicated and was then injected to the sensor chip. PII was removed from the His6-NAGK surface by injecting 25 μl of 1 mm ADP. For novel reloading of the NTA sensor chip with fresh His6-NAGK, 50 μl of 0.4 m EDTA was injected to completely remove His6-NAGK and Ni2+. Subsequently, the chip could be loaded again with Ni2+ and His6-NAGK as described above. This procedure was performed when the performance of PII binding to the His6-NAGK surface started to decrease. UV Cross-linking of ATP/ADP to PII and NAGK—UV-cross-linking of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) or [8-14C]ADP (Moravek Biochemicals, Inc) to PII and NAGK was carried out as described (41Najafi S.M.A. Harris D.A. Yudkin M.D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5628-5631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 μg of PII or 2.5 μg of NAGK was incubated in 20 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin with [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi/100 μm) or [14C]ADP (0.05 μCi/50 μm) in the presence or absence of divalent cations and 2-oxoglutarate. After 10 min on ice in the dark, the samples were exposed for 20 min to UV light (UV lamp 254 nm, 4 watts, Heraeus) at a distance of 1 cm. The samples were then were mixed with 10 μl of SDS-loading buffer, heated for 4 min to 95 °C, and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie, dried, and exposed to phosphor-screens (Bio-Rad) for 12 h for 32P labeling, and for 1 week for 14C labeling. The phosphor-screens were scanned with the PhosphorImager system (Personal Imager FX, Bio-Rad) at 100-μm resolution. Histidine Tag Pulldown Assays of NAGK-PII Complexes—His6-NAGK (4 μg) was added to Strep-tagged PII protein (1.6 μg) in 50 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Nonidet P-40 in the presence or absence of nucleotides (ATP or ADP at 5 mm), cations (MgCl2 or CaCl2 at 5 mm), and 5 mm 2-oxoglutarate. The mixture was incubated for 5 min on ice and was then loaded onto a Ni-NTA spin column. The mini spin column (Vivapure metal chelate mini spin column “m” Vivascience AG) was loaded with Ni2+ and equilibrated with 400 μl of buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Nonidet P-40 and 10 mm imidazole) prior to sample loading. The equilibration buffer was then removed by centrifugation, and 50 μl of the reaction mixture was loaded onto the column. The flow-through was collected, and unbound proteins were removed by washing three times with buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) containing the same metabolites and divalent cations present in the reaction mixture. Elution of His6-NAGK or His6-NAGK-PII complex was performed by the addition of 100 μl of elution buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, and 400 mm imidazole). Of the eluate, a 50-μl aliquot was loaded on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with silver nitrate (42Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—A Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with UV absorption optics was used for sedimentation rate and sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium experiments. For sedimentation rate analysis, samples were spun at 38,000 rpm and 20 °C using charcoal-filled double sector centerpieces in an analytical AN-Ti50 rotor. Sedimentation profiles were analyzed with the program SEDFIT (43Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) which yields diffusion-corrected sedimentation coefficient distributions. Sedimentation diffusion equilibrium measurements were done with 6 channel centerpieces in an analytical AN-Ti60 rotor at 25 °C and 10,000 rpm. Samples were spun for at least 18 h, and it was assumed that equilibrium had been reached when the measured concentration profiles did not change measurably over a period of at least 12 h. For signal smoothing, all profiles measured during this 12-h period were averaged. Apparent molar masses were calculated from these averaged profiles by fitting the distribution function as shown in Equation 1 (43Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar),A(x)=A(0)+∑i=1nAi(x0)eMi(1−v¯iρ)2RT(x2−x02)ω2(Eq. 1) where A(x) is the absorption at position x in the cell; A(0) is the buffer absorption measured after sedimenting all proteins at 44,000 rpm for 8h; n is the number of different species (n = 1 for experiments with PII and n = 2 in case of NAGK equilibria); Ai(x0), Mi, and v̄i are the absorption at position x(0), the molar mass, and the partial specific volume of the ith species, respectively. Partial specific volumes were calculated from amino acid composition using the program SEDNTRP (Amgen Corp.), and fitting was done with the program package BPCFIT/AKKUPROG (44Kindler, B.

Characterization of Enzymatic Properties of NAGK and of the NAGK-PII Complex—Recently, we have reported NAGK-PII interaction and stimulation of NAGK catalytic activity by this complex formation (33Heinrich A. Maheswaran M. Ruppert U. Forchhammer K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To characterize further the PII-dependent activation of NAGK, first the optimal pH as well as ATP and divalent cation requirement of the in vitro NAGK reaction in the presence or absence of PII was determined. Fig. 1 shows NAGK activity in the presence and absence of PII protein at different pH ranges from 5.5 to 8.5. The pH optimum of both free and PII-complexed NAGK was approximately a pH of 7.5. With respect to the ATP dependence of the in vitro NAGK reaction, 10 mm ATP were found to be required to obtain maximal activity and for divalent cations, and at least 20 mm MgCl2 were required for maximal activity of both free and PII-complexed NAGK (data not shown). To determine Km and Vmax values of NAGK in the presence or absence of PII, enzyme reactions were carried out at pH 7.5 with 10 mm ATP and 20 mm MgCl2 at different concentrations of substrate N-acetyl-l-glutamate. Fig. 2 shows the plot of reaction velocity versus substrate concentration, exhibiting a Michaelis-Menten profile and the corresponding double-reciprocal plot of the data. An apparent Km of 27.4 mm (±2.7 mm S.E.) and a Vmax of 3.3 units/mg (±0.2 units/mg S.E.) were calculated for free NAGK and a Km of 2.7 mm (±0.1 mm) and Vmax of 13.3 units/mg (±0.2 units/mg) for the NAGK-PII complex. This corresponds to a catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of 0.4 × 103 and 16 × 103 s–1m–1 for free or PII-complexed NAGK, respectively, which shows that complex formation with PII causes an ∼40-fold increase of the overall NAGK catalytic efficiency. Complex Formation with PII Relieves NAGK Feedback Inhibition by Arginine—Arginine biosynthesis in cyanobacteria occurs through the cyclic pathway, in which NAGK catalyzes the committed step of the pathway, which is feedback-regulated by arginine (34Abadjieva A. Pauwels K. Hilven P. Crabeel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42869-42880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Caldovic L. Tuchman M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 36Cunin R. Glandsdorff N. Pierard A. Stalon V. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 314-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since binding of PII to NAGK affects catalytic activity, we studied the inhibitory effect of arginine on free and PII-complexed NAGK. As shown in Fig. 3A, free NAGK is strongly inhibited by arginine with a half-maximal inhibition (I0.5) at 16 ± 1.2 μm arginine (95% confidence interval). The sigmoidal inhibition curve suggested cooperativity between multiple allosteric arginine inhibition sites. Nonlinear regression analysis using sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) fitting (GraphPad Prism program) revealed a Hill coefficient for free NAGK of 3.7 ± 0.3 (95% confidence interval). Complex formation with PII strongly affected feedback inhibition by arginine (Fig. 3B). In complex with PII, 116 ± 21 μm arginine was required to achieve half-maximal inhibition and calculation of the Hill-coefficient resulted in a value of 2.8 ± 0.5. This implies that by complex formation with PII, the cooperativity between arginine feedback inhibition sites is reduced and might suggest that PII blocks arginine-binding sites of NAGK. We also studied the inhibitory effect of other amino acids such as l-glutamine and l-glutamate; however, none of these had any effect on NAGK activity (data not shown). Structural Investigation of the NAGK-PII Interaction—To get an estimate of the stoichiometry of the NAGK-PII complex, NAGK at high protein concentration (0.625 μm His6-NAGK monomers) was titrated with increasing amounts of PII protein (from 0.1 to 0.4 μm PII monomers). A nearly linear increase in NAGK activity was observed with increasing PII until first saturation was obtained with 0.31 μm PII (not shown), suggesting that one PII monomer saturates approximately two NAGK monomers. No further increase of NAGK activity could be observed at even higher concentrations of PII over NAGK as revealed in separate experiments. Because PII is in fact trimeric, this implies that one PII trimer binds six NAGK monomers, suggesting that NAGK is a hexamer, which agrees with a previous estimation of the NAGK size (33Heinrich A. Maheswaran M. Ruppert U. Forchhammer K. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To further analyze the size of NAGK and the stoichiometry of the complex, analytical ultracentrifugation analysis on NAGK and the complex was performed. Sedimentation velocity experiments showed that ∼84% of NAGK sedimented with s20 w = 8.2 S. By taking into account a monomeric molar mass of 32 kg, this sedimentation rate corresponds to a frictional ratio of 1.07 for a tetramer and 1.4 for a hexamer. Because the frictional ratio of a hydrated globular protein is expected to be larger than 1.1 (43Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), the most likely oligomeric state of NAGK is a hexamer. The remaining 16% sedimented with s20 w = 2.8 S and is most likely a dissociated form of NAGK, since SDS-gel electrophoresis had demonstrated the purity of the sample. Sedimentation diffusion equilibrium experiments with NAGK yielded a molar mass of 185 ± 30 kg/mol for the major component, further indicating the hexameric state of the protein (not shown). For PII a molar mass of 42 ± 1 kg/mol was determined, demonstrating the presence of a trimer. In a mixture of PII in molar excess and NAGK, two sedimenting boundaries could be observed (Fig. 4, A and B). The faster moving boundary sedimented with ∼10 S. Because free PII sedimented with 3 S and free NAGK with 8 S, this increase in sedimentation rate is a clear indication of complex formation. The slower moving boundary sedimented with 3 S and thus represented free PII and monomeric NAGK. The absorbance of the slow moving boundary corresponding to free PII and the absorbance of the fast moving boundary corresponding to the complex are a measure of the relative amount of free PII present in the mixture. In a sedimentation experiment with increasing concentrations of PII relative to NAGK, this correlation was used to estimate the stoichiometry of the complex. Fig. 4C shows this stoichiometry to be 0.5:1 (Monomer PII/Monomer NAGK), which clearly shows that a single PII trimer binds to the NAGK hexamer. Estimation of the Dissociation Constant of the NAGK-PII Complex—To estimate the dissociation constant of the NAGK-PII complex, a serial dilution of a NAGK-PII mixture at a constant molar ration of 1:1 NAGK (hexamer) to PII (trimer) was made (final protein concentrations: 16.6, 12.5, 8.3, 6.6, 5, 3.3, and 1.7 nm). The specific NAGK activities at each concentration were determined, and from the known specific activities of free and PII-bound NAGK, the proportion of complexed to free NAGK at each protein concentration was calculated. By applying the law of mass action, the dissociati"

Family 6 CBMs (CBM6s) are distinct from other CBM families in that these protein modules contain multiple distinct ligand binding sites, a feature that makes CBM6s particularly appropriate receptors for the β-1,3-glucan laminarin, which displays an extended U-shaped conformation. To investigate the mechanism by which family 6 CBMs recognize laminarin, we report the biochemical and structural properties of a CBM6 (designated BhCBM6) that is located in an enzyme, which is shown, in this work, to display β-1,3-glucanase activity. BhCBM6 binds β-1,3-glucooligosaccharides with affinities of ∼1 × 105m-1. The x-ray crystal structure of this CBM in complex with laminarihexaose reveals similarity with the structures of other CBM6s but a unique binding mode. The binding cleft in this protein is sealed at one end, which prevents binding of linear polysaccharides such as cellulose, and the orientation of the sugar at this site prevents glycone extension of the ligand and thus conferring specificity for the non-reducing ends of glycans. The high affinity for extended β-1,3-glucooligosaccharides is conferred by interactions with the surface of the protein located between the two binding sites common to CBM6s and thus reveals a third ligand binding site in family 6 CBMs. This study therefore demonstrates how the multiple binding clefts and highly unusual protein surface of family 6 CBMs confers the extensive range of specificities displayed by this protein family. This is in sharp contrast to other families of CBMs where variation in specificity between different members reflects differences in the topology of a single binding site.

The plant cell wall represents the largest reservoir of organic carbon in the biosphere, and thus its degradation by microbial enzymes is pivotal to many biological and industrial processes. The plant cell wall is a complex insoluble structure that is highly recalcitrant to biological attack (1Tomme P. Warren R.A. Gilkes N.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1995; 37: 1-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). To increase the efficiency of this degradative process microorganisms synthesize modular plant cell wall hydrolases in which the catalytic modules are attached via linker peptides to non-catalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs, 1The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; CBM6, family 6 CBM; BhCBM6, family 6 CBM from B. halodurans laminarinase; IMAC, immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; MWCO, molecular weight cut-off; r.m.s.d., root mean-square-deviation; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank. 1The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; CBM6, family 6 CBM; BhCBM6, family 6 CBM from B. halodurans laminarinase; IMAC, immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; MWCO, molecular weight cut-off; r.m.s.d., root mean-square-deviation; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank.

CBMs are grouped into 40 sequence-based families (8Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1999: 3-12Google Scholar), which may be found in the continuously updated carbohydrate-active enzyme data base at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/. These protein modules have also been grouped into three types based on the topology of the binding sites, which reflects the macromolecular structure of the target ligand (3Boraston A.B. McLean B.W.

Type A CBMs contain a planar hydrophobic ligand binding surface that interacts with crystalline polysaccharides. Type B CBMs, which are derived from 11 different families, contain clefts that accommodate single polysaccharide chains, while the ligand binding sites in Type C CBMs, comprising families 9, 13, 14, 18, and 32, interact with mono- or disaccharides (See Ref. 9Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar for review). Type B CBMs generally bind to the substrate hydrolyzed by the appended catalytic domain of the enzyme, leading to considerable variation in ligand specificity within specific families. The three-dimensional structure of almost all Type B CBMs determined to date conform to a classic lectin-like β-jelly roll in which a single ligand binding site comprises a shallow cleft on the concave surface of the protein. In family 4 and family 2 CBM variation in ligand recognition between different members of these families is reflected in the structure of this conserved binding site (10Boraston A.B. Nurizzo D. Notenboom V. Ducros V. Rose D.R. Kilburn D.G. Davies G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). By contrast family 6 CBMs (CBM6s), which also adopt the classic β-jelly roll fold, contain two potential ligand binding sites; one (cleft B) on the concave surface and a second (cleft A) located on one edge of the protein between the loops that connect the inner and outer β-sheets (11Czjzek M. Bolam D.N. Mosbah A. Allouch J. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Bornet O. Zamboni V. Darbon H. Smith N.L. Black G.W. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48580-48587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The variation in ligand specificity in CBM6s reflects the functionality of these two binding sites with xylan- and β-(1,4)(1,3) mixed glucan binding modules accommodating these polysaccharides in cleft A and cleft B, respectively (12Pires V.M. Henshaw J. Prates J.A. Bolam D. Ferreira L.M. Fontes C.M. Henrissat B. Planas A. Gilbert H.J. Czjzek M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21560-21568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One of the features that distinguish Type B CBMs from lectins is the mechanism of ligand recognition. Each binding site in lectins recognizes one or two sugars through an extensive network of hydrogen bonds, while Type B CBMs generally accommodate four to six sugars, with specificity conferred primarily by the conformation of the ligand, which reflects the topology of the binding site. Although it is well established that the orientation of the aromatic residues in the binding site of CBMs confers specificity for the planar and 3-fold helical conformations of cellulose and xylan, respectively (9Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which these protein modules recognize other polysaccharides, which display more elaborate conformations, is unclear. An example of polysaccharides that exhibit complex conformations is provided by the β-1,3-linked glucose polymer laminarin, which adopts an extensive U-shaped conformation, and thus cannot be accommodated in CBMs that contain linear clefts (9Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). The two potential ligand binding sites in CBM6s may present structural features that make these proteins ideally suited to accommodate polysaccharides with extended U-shaped conformations. To assess this hypothesis we have determined the structure-function relationship of a CBM6, designated BhCBM6, located in an enzyme that displays laminarinase activity. BhCBM6 does indeed bind to laminarin displaying maximum affinity for ligands with a d.p. >5. Uniquely, the protein displays absolute specificity for the non-reducing end of laminarin chains, and the crystal structure of BhCBM6 in complex with laminarihexaose shows that the ligand extends out of cleft A interacting with the surface of the protein that does not encompass either cleft A or cleft B. These data demonstrate that the remarkable flexibility in ligand specificity displayed by CBM6s reflects variation in the location of the carbohydrate interacting sites on the surface of the protein, and is not exclusively the result of differences in the topology of a single binding site. Carbohydrates and Polysaccharides—Xylooligosaccharides, laminarioligosaccharides, Konjac glucomannan, wheat arabino-xylan, Tamarind xyloglucan, and oat β-glucan were obtained from Megazyme International Ireland Ltd.

The peak-to-trough heights at the wavelength pairs 289.3/301.0 nm, 289.3/294.5 nm, and 282.8/287.4 nm were calculated by subtraction of the trough values from the peak values, and the dilution-corrected data were plotted against total carbohydrate concentration.

Crystals of BhCBM6 (25 mg/ml) were grown at 18 °C using the vapor-phase diffusion technique from hanging drops in 24% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethylether, 0.2 m sodium citrate, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, and 3% glycerol. Crystals of BhCBM6 in complex with xylobiose were prepared by adding xylobiose powder directly to hanging drops containing crystals and allowing these to equilibrate for ∼72 h. Crystals of BhCBM6 (20 mg/ml) in complex with excess laminarihexaose were grown using the same technique in 10-μl drops with 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, containing 1.8 m ammonium sulfate as the mother liquor.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) the encoded protein appears to comprise three modules (Fig. 1). The N-terminal module of this protein shows similarity with family 81 glycoside hydrolases, a family of proteins in which some members display β-1,3-glucanase activity, exemplified by Eng1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is involved in cell separation (27Baladron V.

Vazquez de Sipiczki M. Aldana C.R. del Rey F. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), whereas others, an example of which is the Glycine max β-glucan elicitor receptor, are devoid of catalytic activity but do bind β-1,3-glucans (29Fliegmann J. Mithofer A. Wanner G. Ebel J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1132-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The putative glycoside hydrolase catalytic module from the B. halodurans protein is the only bacterial example in this family. The recombinant catalytic module of this enzyme hydrolyzed laminarin with an activity of 14,231 min-1 (14,231 mol of reducing sugar produced per mol of enzyme per min) but displays no detectable activity against oat-spelt xylan, wheat arabinoxylan, xyloglucan, lichenan, galactan, arabinan, carob galactomannan, konjac glucomannan, β-glucan, polygalacturoniuc acid (pectin), amylose, amylopectin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, or carboxymethyl cellulose. Thus, the B. halodurans protein is clearly a β-1,3-glucanase (or laminarinase), similar to its eukaryotic homologues. The C-terminal ∼100 amino acid module has no identity to proteins of known function. Separating the C-terminal module and the N-terminal catalytic module is a module of ∼140 amino acids module having ∼36% identity to the xylan binding CBM6 from C. thermocellum xylanase 10A (11Czjzek M.

Based on its identity with CBM6s and its presence in a functional β-1,3-glucanase, we hypothesized that this module, defined as BhCBM6, is indeed a CBM with β-1,3-glucan binding specificity. Analysis of BhCBM6 Binding Specificity—Using a standard depletion binding analysis (30McLean B.W. Bray M.R. Boraston A.B. Gilkes N.R. Haynes C.A. Kilburn D.G. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 801-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) no binding to the insoluble polysaccharides regenerated cellulose or pachyman (an insoluble β-1,3-glucan from Poria cocos) was evident (data not shown). Similarly, native affinity gel electrophoresis did not reveal significant binding to soluble preparations of wheat arabinoxylan, amylopectin, oat β-glucan, or lichenan, the latter two of which are commonly recognized by β-1,3-glucan binding CBMs (17Boraston A.B.

Boraston A.B. Knox J.P. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) BhCBM6 showed weak binding to wheat arabino-xylan, birchwood glucurono-xylan, and pectic galactan, but did not interact with polysaccharides containing β-(1,3)(1,4) linked glucose, i.e. oat β-glucan (data not shown). UV Difference Studies of BhCBM6 Binding—Xylose, xylooligosaccharides, and O-methyl-β-d-xylose induced relatively large changes in the UV absorbance difference spectrum indicating binding to these sugars. The addition of glucose, sophorose (β-1,2-glucobiose), and β-1,3-glucooligosaccharides (laminarioligosaccharides) also gave UV difference signals (see Fig. 2A for a representative UV difference spectrum), apparently at odds with the inability to detect binding to glucose-based polymers by affinity electrophoresis and macroarray assays. No perturbation of the UV absorbance spectrum was observed when cellobiose, cellotriose, sucrose, mannose, galactose, fucose, N-acetylglucosamine, or N-acetylgalactosamine was added to BhCBM6. Three wavelength pairs in the UV difference spectra were used to monitor the dependence of the UV absorbance spectra on ligand concentration and quantify binding to carbohydrates (Fig. 2B). BhCBM6 bound to glucose and xylose with association constants (Ka) of ∼8 × 102m-1 (Table II). Xylobiose was bound ∼2-fold more tightly indicating a small dependence of binding on ligand length.

Like the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins, signal-anchored proteins are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes and are subsequently imported into the organelle. We have studied the mechanisms by which precursors of these proteins are recognized by the mitochondria and are inserted into the outer membrane. The import of signal-anchored proteins was found to be independent of the known import receptors, Tom20 and Tom70, but to require the major Tom component, Tom40. In contrast to precursors destined to internal compartments of mitochondria and those of outer membrane β-barrel proteins, precursors of signal-anchored proteins appear not to be inserted via the general import pore. Taken together, we propose a novel pathway for insertion of these proteins into the outer membrane of mitochondria.

In contrast to precursors destined to internal compartments of mitochondria and those of outer membrane β-barrel proteins, precursors of signal-anchored proteins appear not to be inserted via the general import pore. Taken together, we propose a novel pathway for insertion of these proteins into the outer membrane of mitochondria. The mitochondrial outer membrane mediates numerous interactions between the metabolic and genetic systems of mitochondria and the rest of the eukaryotic cell. Proteins residing in the outer membrane include a diverse set of enzymes, components of the import machinery of the outer membrane of mitochondria (the TOM and TOB complexes), and pore-forming components (porins). In addition, the outer membrane contains proteins that control fusion, fission, morphology, and the inheritance of the organelle. In higher eukaryotes, members of the pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family also reside in the mitochondrial outer membrane. All these proteins, like the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins, are nuclear encoded and synthesized in the cytosol. They carry signals that are essential for their subsequent import into mitochondria. The targeting of most mitochondrial preproteins is mediated by cleavable N-terminal extensions of about 12–50 amino acid residues (the presequences or matrix targeting signals). These are necessary and sufficient to direct them into the mitochondria (1Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 2Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In contrast, all precursor proteins of the mitochondrial outer membrane are devoid of a typical N-terminal presequence. The targeting information is rather contained in the sequence of the functional protein (3Rapaport D. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 948-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Borgese N. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A special class of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins comprises those containing a single transmembrane segment at their N terminus. Examples of this class are Tom20, Tom70, and OM45 (5Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Guido E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21091-21096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Waizenegger T. Stan T. Neupert W. Rapaport D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42064-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These proteins are present in the outer membrane in an orientation, where the bulk of the polypeptide is exposed to the cytosol and only a small N-terminal segment crosses the outer membrane. They are called “signal-anchored” proteins because their transmembrane domain together with their flanking regions serve both as an intracellular sorting signal and as an anchor to the membrane (7Shore G.C. McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Steenaart N.A.E. Nguyen M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The important structural elements of such signal-anchored sequences were found to be a moderate hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain and positively charged residues in its flanking regions (6Waizenegger T. Stan T. Neupert W. Rapaport D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42064-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Kanaji S. Iwahashi J. Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Despite this progress in the characterization of signal-anchored domains, the mechanisms by which this type of signal is deciphered at the outer membrane and the protein is inserted into the lipid bilayer are only poorly understood. One reason for this is the difficulty of differentiating between nonspecific binding of precursor proteins and physiological membrane integration in in vitro import systems (4Borgese N. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this study we have established a reliable and specific assay to study the insertion of signal-anchored proteins into the outer membrane of isolated mitochondria. This new assay allowed us to obtain new insights into the mechanism of membrane insertion. Our results suggest that signal-anchored proteins are inserted into the outer membrane by a TOM complex-dependent pathway that does not require import receptors and participation of the TOM import channel. Yeast Strains and Growth Methods—Standard genetic techniques were used for growth and manipulation of yeast strains (9Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). The wild type strains BY4743 and 273-10B were employed. Transformation of yeast was carried out according to the lithium acetate method. Yeast cells were grown under aerobic conditions on YPD (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, 2% glucose) or on YPG (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, 3% glycerol) medium. The tom20 null strain YTJB64 and its corresponding parental strain YTJB4 were utilized (kind gift of Drs. G. Schatz and C. Koehler) (10Lithgow T. Junne T. Wachter C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15325-15330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tom70 deletion strain was obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Biochemical Procedures—Mitochondria were isolated from yeast cells by differential centrifugation as described (11Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For isolation of mitochondria from tom40-3 strain and its corresponding wild type yeast cells were grown at 25 °C. Radiolabeled precursor proteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine (MP Biomedicals) after in vitro transcription by SP6 polymerase from pGEM4 vectors (Promega) containing the gene of interest. Import experiments were performed in a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS 1The abbreviations used are: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; IMS, intermembrane space; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; PK, proteinase K. -KOH, 2 mm NADH, 2 mm ATP, pH 7.2. Isolation of the TOM core complex and its reconstitution into liposomes were performed as described before (12Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 13Vasiljev A. Ahting U. Nargang F.E. Go N.E. Habib S.J. Kozany C. Panneels V. Sinning I. Prokisch H. Neupert W. Nussberger S.

Blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes and immunodecoration were according to standard procedures, and visualization was by the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant DNA Techniques—For in vitro transcription and translation of Tom20 variants, the Tom20 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from genomic yeast DNA. The resulting product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into the BamHI/HindIII sites of pGEM4 vector. The Tom20ext variant was constructed by PCR amplification of the sequence encoding the N-terminal 38 amino acid residues of Neurospora crassa Tom70 and treatment of the DNA fragment with BamHI and subcloning it into the BamHI site of pGEM4-Tom20. The Tom20ext variant was introduced into the multicopy yeast plasmid, pRS426xTPIp-URA3 (kind gift of Dr. K. Dietmeier). To improve our analysis of in vitro import experiments, an N. crassa Tom70 construct was used where a methionine residue was inserted between amino acid residues 38 and 39. A major problem in analyzing the membrane insertion of N-terminally anchored signal-anchored proteins into the outer membrane is the lack of a reliable assay to control for the correct insertion into the membrane. The known N-terminally anchored proteins in yeast mitochondria expose only a few amino acid residues into the intermembrane space (IMS). Therefore, proteolytic cleavage of signal-anchored proteins with external protease results in the formation of protected fragments in the size range of 2–3 kDa, which are too small to be observed by SDS-PAGE. To overcome this problem, we constructed a fusion protein where the first 38 amino acid residues of Tom70 from N. crassa were fused in front of yeast Tom20 (Fig. 1A, Tom20ext). Proteolytic cleavage of this construct with external protease after insertion into the outer membrane is predicted to result in the formation of a 7–8-kDa fragment. To demonstrate that this Tom20 variant is correctly targeted to mitochondria in vivo, we used a functional complementation assay (6Waizenegger T. Stan T. Neupert W. Rapaport D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42064-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Deletion of the gene encoding Tom20 in yeast results in cells that cannot grow on a non-fermentable carbon source (14Ramage L. Junne T. Hahne K. Lithgow T. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4115-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of Tom20 variants to complement the growth phenotype can be taken as a criterion for correct targeting and function in the TOM complex. Tom20ext was found to complement the growth phenotype of Δtom20, demonstrating that this variant is functional in the outer membrane (Fig. 1B). To check whether the anticipated fragment can indeed be observed, radiolabeled Tom20ext precursor was imported into isolated mitochondria, and these were then treated with proteinase K (PK). A fragment of the expected size of 7 kDa was visible upon SDS-PAGE. This fragment was completely degraded upon solubilization of the organelle with the detergent Triton X-100, and it remained with the membrane fraction upon alkaline treatment of mitochondria (Fig. 1C). The 7-kDa fragment was not observed when either reticulocyte lysate containing the Tom20ext precursor or membrane-inserted authentic Tom20 were treated with PK. Taken together, the 7-kDa band represents a specific fragment of the membrane-inserted Tom20ext. Thus, this proteolytic assay can be employed to study the mechanism of insertion of Tom20 into the mitochondrial outer membrane. By using the new in vitro assay, we examined the requirement for import receptors in the insertion pathway of signal-anchored proteins. Pretreatment of mitochondria with trypsin to remove the exposed parts of the surface receptors Tom20 and Tom70 did not result in any reduction of the insertion level of Tom20ext. In contrast, the efficiency of membrane insertion of the β-barrel protein porin was strongly reduced upon this treatment (Fig. 2A). Tom20 is the main import receptor of the TOM complex. Mitochondria isolated from a strain lacking Tom20 were incubated with radiolabeled Tom20ext, and the amount of inserted precursor was analyzed. These mitochondria inserted Tom20ext into their outer membrane with a similar efficiency as wild type organelles. In contrast, a strong reduction was observed in the insertion of porin which was shown to require Tom20 for its import (Fig. 2B) (15Schleiff E. Silvius J.R. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Douglas M.G. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Hence, the import receptors Tom20 and Tom70 appear to play only a minor role, if any, in the insertion of signal-anchored proteins. We next asked whether the import of Tom20ext requires the import pore formed by the TOM core complex. To this end, a molar excess of recombinant preprotein, which is known to use the import pore, pSu9-(1–69)-DHFR, was added to the import reaction containing radiolabeled Tom20ext. Similar experiments had shown previously that import of radiolabeled matrix-destined precursors as well as precursors of outer membrane β-barrel proteins were competed out by recombinant pSu9-(1–69)-DHFR (16Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Douglas M.G. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Pfanner N. J.

In contrast, excess unlabeled recombinant pSu9-(1–69)-DHFR did not reduce but rather slightly increased the insertion of radiolabeled Tom20ext (Fig. 3A). As expected, the import of radiolabeled pSu9-(1–69)-DHFR (Fig. 3A) and porin (not shown, see Ref. 16Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M.

We further investigated whether the assembly of Tom20 into the TOM complex can be inhibited by blocking the import pore. Radiolabeled Tom20 from N. crassa was imported into isolated mitochondria, and the import reactions were analyzed by blue native gel electrophoresis. Although the assembly of Tom20 was not affected by excess amounts of preprotein, the assembly of the β-barrel-forming Tom40 was completely blocked (Fig. 3B) (17Rapaport D. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Paschen S.A. Waizenegger T. Stan T. Preuss M. Cyrklaff M. Hell K. Rapaport D. Neupert W. Nature. 2003; 426: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We also studied the effect of excess of presequence-containing precursor on the import of another signal-anchored protein, OM45. In this case, alkaline extraction was used to measure membrane insertion, because with this protein formation of a proteolytic fragment or assembly to oligomers could not be used as a criterion. Insertion of radiolabeled OM45, like that of Tom20ext, was not competed under these conditions. In contrast, the insertion of pSu9-(1–112)-DHFR via the TOM and TIM23 channels into the inner membrane was strongly inhibited (Fig. 3C). We conclude that signal-anchored proteins do not use the general import pore or do it in a completely different way compared with other mitochondrial precursor proteins. Is the TOM complex involved at all in the import of signal-anchored proteins? We investigated the insertion of Tom20ext into mitochondria isolated from a strain harboring the temperature-sensitive allele of tom40. This strain (tom40-3) was used before to study the insertion of porin into the outer membrane. It did not display altered insertion and assembly of this protein which is known to use the general insertion pore of the TOM complex (15Schleiff E. Silvius J.R. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Douglas M.G. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, the insertion of Tom20ext into the Tom40-3 mitochondria was strongly reduced in comparison to insertion into wild type mitochondria (Fig. 4). Thus, Tom40 does play a role in the insertion of signal-anchored proteins. It appears that the same mutational alterations of Tom40 can have different effects on the insertion of signal-anchored proteins as compared with β-barrel proteins. We asked whether the TOM complex by itself is sufficient to promote the import of signal-anchored proteins. The TOM core complex (containing Tom40, Tom22, Tom7, Tom6, and Tom5 but lacking Tom20 and Tom70 (12Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)) from N. crassa mitochondria was used to generate proteoliposomes (12Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 13Vasiljev A. Ahting U. Nargang F.E. Go N.E. Habib S.J. Kozany C. Panneels V. Sinning I. Prokisch H. Neupert W. Nussberger S. Rapaport D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1445-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The precursor of Tom20ext was incubated with liposomes or proteoliposomes containing either the TOM core complex or porin. Insertion of radiolabeled Tom20ext precursor was followed by analyzing the formation of the typical 7-kDa fragment. Background levels of insertion were observed when pure lipid vesicles were used (Fig. 5A). The amount of the proteolytic fragment was increased by ∼3-fold when vesicles containing the TOM core complex were used. Reconstituted porin had only a minor effect on the insertion of the protein (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained when the precursor of N. crassa Tom70 was used. Insertion of radiolabeled Tom70 precursor was followed by analyzing the formation of a typical fragment resulting from addition of external proteinase K (Fig. 5B). The relatively low enhancement factor observed with the TOM complex is most likely due to the fact that only about half of the reconstituted complexes had the correct orientation in the membrane (data not shown). Hence, only a fraction of the reconstituted TOM core complex had import activity. What are the mechanisms and components by which signal-anchored proteins are inserted into the outer membrane of mitochondria? The investigation of this problem has been hindered by the lack of available assays by which insertion of such precursor proteins can be reliably analyzed. In previous studies resistance toward alkaline extraction was taken as a criterion for correct insertion of the proteins into the outer membrane. This method, however, is hampered by the inability to discriminate between nonspecific binding and physiological membrane integration of precursor proteins (4Borgese N. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have developed a reliable assay to measure insertion, namely formation of a defined proteolytic fragment in intact mitochondria. This fragment contains the inserted transmembrane anchor and the intermembrane space segment which are not accessible to externally added protease. Our results suggest that the known import receptors Tom20 and Tom70 as well as domains of other proteins exposed on the surface of mitochondria are not required for proper insertion. These results are in line with previous observations where the mitochondrial targeting of Tom20 and Tom70 was found to be independent of protease-accessible surface receptors and not to be affected by addition of antibodies against Tom20 and Tom70 (19Schneider H. Sollner T. Dietmeier K. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Trulzsch B. Neupert W. Pfanner N. Science. 1991; 254: 1659-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Schlossmann J. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27116-27121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Suzuki H. Maeda M. Mihara K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1895-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transformation of yeast cells lacking the chromosomal copy of TOM20 with a yeast expression vector encoding Tom20 rescued the growth phenotype of the Δtom20 cells (6Waizenegger T. Stan T. Neupert W. Rapaport D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42064-42071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, pre-existing Tom20 molecules are not required for the import of newly synthesized Tom20 precursors. It appears that signal-anchored proteins are recognized either directly by the membrane-embedded components of the TOM core complex or by a yet unidentified outer membrane protein. The first possibility appears more likely, as we found that the purified TOM core complex can facilitate the insertion of Tom20 into proteoliposomes. Moreover, our results do support an involvement of Tom40 in the insertion process. This notion is in line with a previous report (19Schneider H. Sollner T. Dietmeier K. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Trulzsch B. Neupert W. Pfanner N. Science. 1991; 254: 1659-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) where antibodies against the pore protein Tom40 inhibited the membrane integration of newly synthesized Tom20. Still, additional factors may assist the insertion process. Two different scenarios seem possible for the steps following the initial recognition by the TOM complex (Fig. 6). In the first, the signal-anchored domain is inserted into the lumen of the translocation pore formed by Tom40, after which the β-barrel structure opens and the protein is laterally released into the lipid core of the membrane (Fig. 6, pathway b). Such an opening of a β-barrel structure, however, is thermodynamically unfavorable (22Gabriel K. Buchanan S.K. Lithgow T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 36-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We favor a model where the precursor protein is inserted at the interface between the TOM core complex and the lipid phase of the membrane (Fig. 6, pathway a). In such a mechanism some parts of the Tom40 molecule, with the potential involvement of the membrane-embedded segments of other components of the TOM core complex, mediate the insertion of signal-anchored proteins, whereas other segments are forming the import channel. A recent report on the involvement of Tom40 in sorting of various precursor proteins would support such a model. A Tom40 variant that is ineffective in transfer of presequence-containing preproteins, but can support normal insertion of outer membrane proteins, was characterized (23Gabriel K. Egan B. Lithgow T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2380-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, cytochrome c, which resides in the mitochondrial IMS, was also suggested to be imported by a TOM complex-dependent pathway that does not use the general import pore (24Diekert K. de Kroon A.I.P.M. Ahting U. Niggemeyer B. Neupert W. de Kruijff B. Lill R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5626-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Hence, it appears that some mitochondrial precursors can be imported by the TOM complex in a process that is distinct from that followed by most mitochondrial precursors. This hypothesis is in line with a recent report on the insertion of outer membrane proteins in chloroplasts. The insertion of a model outer membrane protein, OEP14, was found to be mediated by the main component of the TOC complex, Toc75 (25Tu S.L. Chen L.J. Smith M.D. Su Y.S. Schnell D.J. Li H.M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2078-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, similar to our proposal for the mitochondrial system, Tu et al. (25Tu S.L. Chen L.J. Smith M.D. Su Y.S. Schnell D.J. Li H.M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2078-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) suggested that two different sites on Toc75 may be involved in binding to either signal sequence-containing precursors or to precursors of outer membrane proteins. Thus, the capacity of the pore-forming component of the translocases of endosymbiont organelles to mediate distinct ways of import into either internal compartments or the outer membrane seems to be an evolutionary conserved function. The question of whether a lateral opening of the TOM channel allows precursors of outer membrane proteins to be inserted into the lipid core of the membrane is still unresolved (22Gabriel K. Buchanan S.K. Lithgow T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 36-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Johnson A.E. Jensen R.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 113-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that β-barrel precursors are crossing the outer membrane to the IMS via the general import pore of the TOM complex before the TOB complex mediates their insertion into the outer membrane (18Paschen S.A. Waizenegger T. Stan T. Preuss M. Cyrklaff M. Hell K. Rapaport D. Neupert W. Nature. 2003; 426: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 26Johnson A.E. Jensen R.E. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Nature. 2003; 424: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Hence, a lateral opening of the TOM channel appears not to occur during insertion of β-barrel proteins. Our present results suggest that the import of signal-anchored proteins does not occur by a lateral opening of the general import pore of the TOM complex. It is not excluded, however, that in certain cases the dynamics of the TOM complex does allow such a reaction. We thank P. Heckmeyer and U. Staudinger for technical assistance and Dr. H.

A large part of this response is mediated by the stress responsive transcription factor Msn2. During glucose exhaustion, Msn2 is activated and concentrated in the nucleus. Simultaneously, Msn2 protein levels also drop significantly under this condition. Here we show that the decrease in Msn2 concentration is due to its increased degradation. Moreover, Msn2 levels are also reduced under chronic stress or low protein kinase A (PKA) activity, both conditions that cause a predominant nuclear localization of Msn2. Similar effects were found in msn5 mutant cells that block Msn2 nuclear export. To approximate the effect of low PKA activity on Msn2, we generated a mutant form with alanine substitutions in PKA phosphorylation sites. High expression of this Msn2 mutant is detrimental for growth, suggesting that the increased degradation of nuclear Msn2 might be necessary to adapt cells to low PKA conditions after the diauxic shift or to allow growth under chronic stress conditions.

In budding yeast, two redundant stress-inducible transcription factors, Msn2 and Msn4, play an important role in the response to environmental cues (1Estruch F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 469-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these highly related zinc finger transcription factors mediate the induction of stress protective genes whenever cells encounter a shift toward suboptimal growth conditions (2Gasch A.P.

Krapf G. Schuster M. Bauer B.E. Piper P.W. Kuchler K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Msn2 and Msn4 are activated during diauxic shift, a transition from fermentative growth on glucose to respiratory growth, causing a transient increase of stress inducible transcripts (5DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar, 6Cameroni E. Hulo N. Roosen J. Winderickx J. De Virgilio C. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Activation of Msn2 usually occurs through a series of complex steps that increase its nuclear concentration and promoter recruitment. It is thought that Msn4 is mechanistically regulated in similar ways. Exposure to stress conditions such as high osmolarity, rapamycin treatment, heat stress, short chain organic acids, alcohols, and membrane damage throttles Msn2 nuclear export and increases its binding to the stress response element (STRE) (7Kobayashi N. McEntee K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 8Marchler G. Schüller C. Adam G. Ruis H.

However, in all these cases the nature of the signaling events leading to Msn2 activation is still largely obscure.In contrast to our lack in understanding Msn2 activating signals, it is well established that protein kinase A (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PKI, protein kinase A inhibitor.1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PKI, protein kinase A inhibitor. activity plays an overriding role in the negative regulation of Msn2 function. PKA activity imposes itself onto Msn2 nuclear import, nuclear export, and possibly DNA binding (9Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Low PKA activity has been found to increase the expression level of Msn2-dependent genes, whereas high PKA activity has been described to cause the opposite effect (11Jones D.L. Petty J. Hoyle D.C. Hayes A. Ragni E. Popolo L. Oliver S.G. Stateva L.I. Physiol. Genomics. 2003; 16: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consequently, the question emerged whether environmental stresses activate Msn2 function simply by antagonizing or modulating PKA signaling. In fact, genetic interactions have been described between the TOR (target of rapamycin) pathway and the Ras-PKA pathway that are consistent with this assumption (12Schmelzle T. Beck T. Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 338-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Moreover, TOR-mediated nutrient signals have been shown to affect Msn2 function (13Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Other studies, however, rather support the conclusion that the Ras-PKA pathway does not mediate acute stress responses (14Görner W. Durchschlag E. Wolf J. Brown E.L. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Schüller C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Of all tested stress treatments only glucose starvation appeared to induce changes in the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of serine 620 in the Msn2 NLS (14Görner W. Durchschlag E. Wolf J. Brown E.L. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Schüller C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), whereas all other acute stresses do not change a PKA-dependent modification of this site. These findings might reflect differences between short term and long term responses to environmental fluctuations. For example, during the post diauxic shift, Msn2 is probably mainly activated due to an extended drop in protein kinase A activity.The distinct transcriptional response to acute stress exposure is usually transient, suggesting that adaptive systems are in operation that help a cell to resume its support for growth and cell division rather than invest into damage protection. Indeed, during stress relief, and during stress adaptation, Msn2 is rapidly relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The situation is different, however, when glucose is exhausted in a growing culture after the diauxic shift with constantly low PKA activity. Since genetic evidence has shown that under low PKA activity Msn2 becomes detrimental for growth, the question arises by which mechanism Msn2 is inactivated after the diauxic shift to avoid growth arrest. Here we provide evidence that this adaptive effect might be achieved through different degradation rates of nuclear versus cytoplasmic Msn2. Further analysis showed that Msn2 protein levels are always reduced under conditions that cause prolonged nuclear localization of the protein. In comparison to other transcription factors, for which degradation has been shown as a means of regulation, the overall rates of Msn2 degradation are relatively slow in all cases. This observation might suggest that protein degradation is unimportant for Msn2 regulation under short term fluctuating conditions. As shown through the use of a hyperactive allele of MSN2, however, nuclear degradation of the factor might be important for avoiding prolonged growth arrest under sustained stress conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—All strains are derivatives of W303–1A (MATa, ura3–1, leu2–3, his3–11, trp1–1, ade2–1, can1–1000) (Table I).

Catalase activity was calculated in micromolar H2O2 per minute per mg total protein (ϵ = 43.75).GFP Fluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence microscopy experiments were performed as described previously (9Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 14Görner W. Durchschlag E. Wolf J.

Nuclei were stained by addition of 2 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol dye to the cultures 10 min prior to microscopy. All cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope. Images were captured with a Quantix CCD camera using IP-Lab or Lightview software.RESULTSMsn2 Levels Are Diminished after the Diauxic Shift—Under logarithmic growth conditions yeast cells maintain a balanced level of Msn2 protein that does not change under acute stress conditions (9Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Similarly, according to Chi et al. (18Chi Y. Huddleston M.J. Zhang X. Young R.A. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Deshaies R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1078-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) adaptation to heat shock had no effect on Msn2 levels, leading to the proposal that an increase in the nuclear export rate of Msn2 was the main stress adaptive feature. However, an analysis of Msn2 behavior during the diauxic shift made us re-evaluate the possibility of Msn2 regulation by protein degradation. A Western blot analysis showed that an epitope tagged version of Msn2, which was expressed from a centromeric plasmid under the control of the native promoter (pYMSN2-myc), revealed a dramatic reduction of Msn2 protein levels at later growth stages between A600 of 6 and 8 (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly this effect was not accompanied by a similar reduction in MSN2 transcript levels. 2E. Durchschlag, W. Reiter, G. Ammerer, and C. Schüller, unpublished data. Moreover, similar results were obtained with native Msn2 2E. Durchschlag, W. Reiter, G. Ammerer, and C. Schüller, unpublished data. and with Msn2 expressed from a heterologous promoter. 2E. Durchschlag, W. Reiter, G. Ammerer, and C. Schüller, unpublished data. Since Msn2 disappeared within a short time in the early diauxic shift, it was most likely that Msn2 was degraded at higher rates during this period of growth. The localization of Msn2 during the diauxic shift was followed by fluorescence microscopy of a Msn2-GFP fusion driven by the ADH1 promoter. Msn2-GFP accumulates in the nucleus when glucose is exhausted in the culture (Fig. 1B). However, we noticed reduction of the GFP signal at later growth stages, an impression that conformed with our Western blot analysis. This observation also suggested a connection between Msn2 localization and protein stability.Cells under Chronic Stress Exhibit a Reduction in Msn2 Levels—To address the question whether it is nuclear localization per se or stress and starvation signals that caused enhanced Msn2 degradation, we analyzed different conditions known to relocate Msn2 to the nucleus. Exponentially growing cells were exposed to prolonged treatments with ethanol, mild osmotic stress, and heat shock. Msn2 protein levels decreased noticeably during growth at high temperature and after the addition of stressful amounts of ethanol to the culture (Fig. 2A). In contrast, osmotic stress had no effect on Msn2 levels. Analysis of the localization pattern of Msn2-GFP during stress treatments indicated that both chronic ethanol and chronic heat stress lead to the permanent nuclear localization of Msn2-GFP. On the contrary, osmotic stress caused only transient nuclear localization of Msn2-GFP, and Msn2-GFP began to reappear in the cytosol after 1 h (Fig. 2B). These observations support the hypothesis that prolonged nuclear accumulation of Msn2-GFP leads to a reduction of Msn2 protein levels.Fig. 2Nuclear accumulation under stress conditions diminishes Msn2 levels. A, Western blot showing the steady state levels of Msn2 during long term exposure to different stress conditions. Wild type (W303–1A) cultures were diluted to A600 of 0.1 and grown to logarithmic phase. When cultures reached A600of 1, stress treatments were applied, and samples were taken in 90-min intervalls. Msn2 levels were determined by Western blot analysis with antibodies directed against Msn2. Kar2 levels served as loading control. B, W303-1A cells carrying an ADH1 promoter-driven MSN2-GFP fusion construct were subjected to the same stress conditions as described for A. Localization of Msn2-GFP was visualized by fluorescence microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reduction of Protein Kinase A Causes a Decrease in Msn2 Protein Levels—Since PKA is a potent modulator of Msn2 localization and activity, we tested whether low PKA activity has a similar effect as glucose depletion and stress on Msn2 stability (9Görner W.

Brown E.L. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Schüller C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To manipulate PKA activity we used a strain lacking both the adenylylcyclase gene (CDC35) and the high affinity phosphodiesterase gene (PDE2), causing a prolonged stability of cAMP in the cells, a requirement for manipulation of the intracellular cAMP pool. After cAMP removal, Msn2 protein levels dropped significantly over a period of 2 h (Fig. 3A). To verify effective Msn2 activation under these conditions, we analyzed nuclear localization of Msn2-GFP (Fig. 3B) and transcriptional induction of the Msn2-dependent CTT1 gene (Fig. 3C) (16Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schüller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the induction of the CTT1 gene and the slow kinetics of nuclear concentration of Msn2 after cAMP removal might be due to the pde2 deletion causing a delayed drop in intracellular cAMP levels (19Wilson R.B. Renault G. Jacquet M. Tatchell K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that in unstressed cells, and in the presence of glucose, reduced cAMP levels, presumably through a drop of PKA acivity, are sufficient to cause a drop of Msn2 levels.Fig. 3cAMP depletion induced nuclear accumulation destabilizes Msn2. Decrease of Msn2 levels after cAMP depletion. A, cultures of W303cdcΔ35pde2Δ were diluted to A600 of 0.1 in medium containing 3 mm cAMP, grown to A600 of 0.8, washed, and resuspended in cAMP-free medium.

Nuclear export of Msn2 is dependent on the nuclear export factor Msn5, which has been implicated in a wide variety of signaling systems (20Hopper A.K. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 803-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Alepuz P.M. Matheos D. Cunningham K.W. Estruch F. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1219-1231PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kaffman A.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To monitor the stability of Msn2 in the nuclear compartment, we determined Msn2 protein levels in msn5Δ strains by Western blotting. We observed that msn5Δ strains exhibit an ∼3-fold reduced steady state level of Msn2 protein (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, msn5Δ cells exhibit a permanently enhanced nuclear signal from a Msn2-GFP fusion. Interestingly, despite the unusual, constitutive nuclear localization of Msn2, environmental stress response gene transcription is still under proper stress regulation (Fig. 4C), suggesting that an increase in nuclear localization of Msn2 alone is normally not sufficient for the induction of its target genes. We used catalase activity as a readout system for CTT1 expression (24Belazzi T. Wagner A. Wieser R. Schanz M. Adam G. Hartig A. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Both the basal CTT1 expression as well as the temperature-induced expression are at comparable levels. The relatively normal basal CTT1 expression observed in the msn5Δ might be explained by the reduction in Msn2 protein levels.Fig. 4Msn2 levels are reduced in msn5Δ cells. A, Msn2 steady state levels were determined by Western blotting in W303-1A and W303msn5Δ cells in the exponential growth phase.

D, Msn2 was expressed under the control of the CUP1 promoter in strain W303msn2Δmsn4Δmsn5Δ and Msn2 protein levels were followed on Western blots after promoter shut-off.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To exclude interference with the de novo synthesis of Msn2, the open reading frame of the MSN2 gene was placed under the control of a conditional promoter. We chose the CUP1 promoter because it is inducible by low (50 μm) amounts of Cu2+ ions, which do not activate any genes known to be under Msn2 control.2 The CUP1 promoter controlled Msn2 construct was introduced on a centromeric plasmid (pCUP1MSN2) in the strains W303msn2Δmsn4Δ and W303msn2Δmsn4Δmsn5Δ. Msn2 synthesis was induced for 30 min followed by removing Cu2+ from the medium. We followed the Msn2 protein levels on Western blots and found a loss of detectable Msn2 protein within 90 min. In contrast, in the wild type strain no such decrease was visible (Figs. 4D and 5A), thus indicating that the reduced Msn2 levels in the msn5Δ mutant are most probably due to enhanced turnover. To avoid the pleiotropic effects of the msn5Δ mutant, we also studied the behavior of Msn2 mutants that show increased nuclear accumulation. To permanently localize Msn2 in the nucleus, we used a mutant version of Msn2 that lacked a sequence required for efficient cytoplasmic localization. This sequence most likely included a Msn5-dependent nuclear export signal (amino acids 246–325) (14Görner W. Durchschlag E. Wolf J. Brown E.L. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Schüller C.

https://openalex.org/W2165724013,"The ""stretch-sensitization"" response is essential to the regulation of heart contractility. An increase in diastolic volume improves systolic contraction. The cellular mechanisms of this modulation, the Frank-Starling law, are still uncertain. Moreover, their alterations in heart failure remains controversial. Here, using left ventricular skinned rat myocytes, we show a nonuniform stretch-sensitization of myofilament activation across the ventricular wall. Stretch-dependent Ca2+ sensitization of myofilaments increases from sub-epicardium to sub-endocardium and is correlated with an increase in passive tension. This passive tension-dependent component of myofibrillar activation is not associated with expression of titin isoforms, changes in troponin I level, and phosphorylation status. Instead, we observe that stretch induces phosphorylation of ventricular myosin light chain 2 isoform (VLC2b) in sub-endocardium specifically. Thus, VLC2b phosphorylation could act as a stretch-dependent modulator of activation tuned within normal heart. Moreover, in postmyocardial infarcted rat, the gradient of stretch-dependent Ca2+ sensitization disappears associated with a lack of VLC2b phosphorylation in sub-endocardium. In conclusion, nonuniformity is a major characteristic of the normal adult left ventricle (LV). The heterogeneous myocardial deformation pattern might be caused not only by the morphological heterogeneity of the tissue in the LV wall, but also by the nonuniform contractile properties of the myocytes across the wall. The loss of a contractile transmural gradient after myocardial infarction should contribute to the impaired LV function."
https://openalex.org/W1990211949,"Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent progenitors for virtually all cell types in our body and thus possess unlimited therapeutic potentials for regenerative medicine. NANOG, an NK-2 type homeodomain gene, has been proposed to play a key role in maintaining stem cell pluripotency presumably by regulating the expression of genes critical to stem cell renewal and differentiation. Here, we provide the evidence that NANOG behaves as a transcription activator with two unusually strong activation domains embedded in its C terminus. First, we identified these two transactivators by employing the Gal4-DNA binding domain fusion and reporter system and named them WR and CD2. Whereas CD2 contains no obvious structural motif, the WR or Trp repeat contains 10 pentapeptide repeats starting with a Trp in each unit. Substitution of Trp with Ala in each repeat completely abolished its activity, whereas mutations at the conserved Ser, Gln, and Asn had relatively minor or no effect on WR activity. We then validated the activities of WR and CD2 in NANOG by constructing a reporter plasmid bearing five NANOG binding sites. Deletion of both WR and CD2 from NANOG completely eliminated its transactivation function. Paradoxically, whereas the removal of CD2 reduced NANOG activity by approximately 30-70%, the removal of WR not only did not diminish but actually enhanced its activity by approximately 50-100% depending on the cell lines analyzed. These data suggest that either WR or CD2 is sufficient for NANOG to function as a transactivator."

These domains consist of α-helices in which two contiguous hydrophobic α-helices form a helical hairpin structure that is surrounded by other helices. The helical hairpin inserts into the membrane in a transmembrane orientation when the toxin molecules bind to the lipid bilayer (41Shin Y.K. Levinthal C. Levinthal F. Hubbell W.L.

In BID, helices H6 and H7 correspond to the “helical hairpin” region of membrane-translocating bacterial toxins and a corresponding region proposed for BCL-XL. However, it is not known whether these BID helices insert into the membrane in the same fashion as the membrane-translocating toxins. In order to better understand the mechanism of BID effector function when inserted in the membrane, we applied the site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) method of EPR spectroscopy (48Columbus L.

We generated 37 single-cysteine mutants between residues 147 and 192 of mouse BID in order to scan nearly the entire sequence of the helices H6-H8 with SDSL (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, we find for full-length BID (p22 BID) in solution that helix 8 is tightly folded against the protein, unlike the NMR model of mouse BID (28McDonnell J.M. Fushman D. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cowburn D. Cell. 1999; 96: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Distance measurements show that for mouse BID the C terminus of helix H8 is very close to helix H3. We also reconstituted spin-labeled p15 BID in membranes resembling the lipid composition of mitochondrial contact sites (52Ardail D. Privat J.P. Egret-Charlier M. Levrat C. Lerme F. Louisot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18797-18802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that p15 BID upon targeting membranes partially unfolds and H6-H8 insert into the bilayer, yet maintaining an α-helical conformation. Most surprisingly, the helices do not adopt a transmembrane orientation but are parallel to the membrane surface with small tilting angles. These results indicate that BID, a Bcl-2 family protein, interacts with the lipid bilayer in a mechanism distinct from membrane-translocating bacterial toxins despite their structural similarity. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (POPG), beef liver phosphatidylinositol (PI), beef heart cardiolipin, beef heart monolysocardiolipin (MCL), cholesterol, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphotempocholine (PC tempo), 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl(5-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (5-doxyl-PC), 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl(7-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (7-doxyl-PC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl(10-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (10-doxyl-PC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. N-Tempoylpalmitamide was synthesized as described (53Shin Y.K. Hubbell W.L. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 1443-1453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mixtures of lipids were prepared in chloroform, divided in 50-mg aliquots, and dried as thin films in glass test tubes under nitrogen gas. These were further dried under vacuum for 16 h and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm KCl (pH 7.0)). The lipid suspensions were freeze-thawed three times and extruded 15 times through two sheets of polycarbonate membrane with a pore size of 100 nm (Avestin) using an extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids), resulting in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) (54Szoka F. Olson F. Heath T. Vail W. Mayhew E. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 601: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Vesicles resembling the lipid composition of the mitochondrial outer membrane contact sites, designated as OMCT vesicles, were made with a mixture of POPC, POPE, PI, cholesterol, and cardiolipin in the weight ratio of 41:22:9:8:20 (9Lutter M. Fang M. Luo X. Nishijima M. Xie X. Wang X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 52Ardail D. Privat J.P. Egret-Charlier M. Levrat C. Lerme F. Louisot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18797-18802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles resembling the mitochondrial outer membrane, designated as OM vesicles, were made without cardiolipin by mixing POPC, POPE, PI, and cholesterol in the weight ratio of 61:22:9:8. Vesicles with 20% POPG or 15% MCL and 5% cardiolipin, designated as OMPG (or OMCL) vesicles, were also made using the same ratio of lipids as in the OMCT except of cardiolipin. For the immersion depth measurements, OMCT vesicles containing trace amounts (1:1000 by weight) of PC tempo, N-tempoylpalmitamide, 5-, 7-, or 10-doxyl-PC were also prepared in buffer A. The phosphate contents of the vesicles were determined as described (55Böttcher C.J.F. van Gent C.M. Pries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Full-length mouse Bid gene was cloned into a modified pET22b vector, which allows the expression of p22 BID as a fusion protein with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (56Oh K.J. Senzel L. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8467-8470Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The complete sequence of the N-terminal tag is “MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH,” in single letter code. The two native cysteine residues Cys-30 and Cys-126 were mutated to serines using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). In this cysteine-less clone, designated as p22BID30S126S, cysteine mutations were introduced. The nucleotide sequences were verified by sequencing the entire gene. The p22 BID proteins were expressed and purified according to the pET system manual (Novagen). Proteins were purified from the periplasmic extracts by Ni2+ affinity and anion-exchange chromatography using an AKTA fast performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were stored at -80 °C in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 16% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm DTT, and ∼200 mm NaCl. The p22 BID proteins with a C-terminal histidine tag (p22BID-Chis) were also produced using the pET22b expression system. The complete sequence of the C-terminal tag is “LEHHHHHH.” A cysteine-less clone, p22BID30S126S-Chis, and its derivative with a Gly to Glu substitution mutation at residue 94, p22BID30S126S94E-Chis, were prepared similarly by following the above procedures. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of BCL-XL (residues 1-212) lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domain, designated as GST-BCL-XLΔC, was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 using pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences) and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-agarose beads from Sigma. Caspase-8 was purified as described (57Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). Full-length human BAX protein was purified as described (30Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (58Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to the BH3 domains of wild type and mutant human BID and human BAD were synthesized at the Tufts Peptide Synthesis Core facility. They were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and masses were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequences for BH3 peptides for the wild type BID, the mutant BID, and BAD are as follows: EDIIRNIARHLAQVGDSMDR; EDIIRNIARHAAQVGASMDR, and NLWAAQRYGRELRRMSDEFVDSFKK, respectively (the underlines indicate substitution mutations in the sequence). The peptides are modified with acetyl and amino groups at the N and C terminus, respectively. The biological activity of BID proteins was assessed by the cytochrome c release assay (5Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). First, recombinant p22 BID proteins were cleaved with caspase-8. Caspase-8 was mixed with p22 BID (1-2 mg/ml) at 1:100 weight ratio in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing ∼200 mm NaCl and 10 mm DTT. The reaction mixture was incubated for 16 h at room temperature, resulting in p7/p15 BID complex. Cleavage was verified by PAGE. All the protein samples were diluted to a final concentration of 17.6 μg/ml. Next, mouse liver mitochondria were isolated at 4 °C according to the procedures in the literature with minor modifications (5Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 59Ellerby H.M. Martin S.J. Ellerby L.M. Naiem S.S. Rabizadeh S. Salvesen G.S. Casiano C.A. Cashman N.R. Green D.R. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6165-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the liver was removed from a mouse after sacrifice, minced with scissors, and homogenized in a glass homogenizer in 20 ml of ice-cold mitochondria isolation buffer (buffer B) containing 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl. Intact cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the mitochondria. The mitochondrial pellets were gently resuspended in 10 ml of buffer B and centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 10 min. The mitochondria were then resuspended gently in 0.3 ml of buffer B. The protein concentration of the mitochondrial preparation was determined after solubilizing the mitochondria in 0.1% deoxycholic acid in phosphate-buffered saline solution. Mitochondria were then diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 mg of mitochondrial protein per ml in buffer C (10 mm Tris-Mops (pH 7.4), 1 mm KH2PO4, 10 μm Tris-EGTA, 5 mm glutamate, 2 mm malate, and 125 mm KCl). Finally, 2 μl of p7/p15 BID was added to 100 μl of the diluted mitochondria, resulting in the BID/mitochondrial protein ratio of 32 pmol/mg. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 40 min. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the mitochondria. The supernatants were quickly removed, and the pellets were resuspended in the same volume of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The amount of cytochrome c in the supernatants or in the pellet fractions was determined in duplicate by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Quantikine M kit, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cysteine mutant proteins of p22 BID (1-2 mg) were reacted with 10-20-fold excess of (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSL) to result in R1 side chain (Fig. 1C) immediately after removing DTT by gel filtration chromatography in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm KCl (pH 7.0)). Unreacted spin label was removed by gel filtration chromatography in buffer A. Proteins were concentrated with centrifugal concentrators with the molecular weight cut-off of 5 kDa (Millipore). In order to spin label p15 BID, p22 BID single-cysteine mutants (∼5 mg) were first cleaved by incubation with caspase-8 in the presence of 10 mm DTT as described above. DTT was then removed by passing the reaction mixture through a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) after pre-equilibrating it with buffer A. MTSL was added at 10-fold excess to the eluted protein solution and reacted for 40-60 min. Unreacted spin label was removed by passing the reaction mixture through a second PD-10 column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The spin-labeled p7/p15 BID was then loaded onto a column containing 0.5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) and washed with 10 ml of buffer A. Spin-labeled p15 BID was eluted with 40 ml of buffer A containing 2% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG, Calbiochem). The eluted spin-labeled p15 BID solution was then concentrated by using a centrifugal concentrator (molecular weight cut-off of 5 kDa, Millipore) to a final volume of ∼2.5 ml. Protein concentration was determined by using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (BCA, Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (60Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Large unilamellar vesicles prepared as described above were then added to the concentrated tBID solution at the lipid to protein ratio of 1:10 (w/w). The protein/lipid mixture was placed in a dialysis cassette with a 10-kDa molecular weight cut-off (Pierce) and dialyzed for 16-24 h at 4 °C against 1 liter of buffer A four times to remove the detergent. Protein aggregates that did not incorporate into the membranes were removed by a sucrose step gradient. Briefly, sucrose stock solutions of 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, and 15% (w/v) were prepared in buffer A containing 0.05% NaN3. A volume of 1 ml of the sucrose stock solutions was successively layered in an ultracentrifuge tube, and the reconstituted p15 BID vesicles were placed on top. This was subjected to centrifugation at 210,000 × g for 7-16 h at 4 °C. Fractions containing reconstituted p15 BID were collected from 5 to 7.5% sucrose bands. These fractions were shown by electron microscopy to contain large and round vesicles, whereas fractions in 10-12.5% sucrose layers contained protein/lipid aggregates. Collected fractions were further centrifuged to pellet the vesicles at 150,000 × g for ∼5 h after diluting the sample in buffer A in a 5-ml ultracentrifuge tube. For immersion depth measurements, p15 BID prepared with BID30S126S was reconstituted in OMCT vesicles containing a trace amount of spin-labeled fatty acid or lipids as described above. After reconstitution, the phosphate content of the vesicles and the protein concentrations were determined as described (55Böttcher C.J.F. van Gent C.M. Pries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (854) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were obtained on a Bruker EMX spectrometer using a Bruker High Sensitivity resonator at room temperature. All spectra were recorded at 2-milliwatt incident microwave power using a field modulation of 1.0-1.5 G at 100 kHz. For power saturation experiments, NiEDDA was synthesized as described (45Oh K.J. Altenbach C. Collier R.J. Hubbell W.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 145: 147-169PubMed Google Scholar, 61Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In order to measure the accessibility parameters, Π, of O2 and NiEDDA, power saturation experiments were carried out with a loop-gap resonator (JAGMAR, Krakow, Poland) (45Oh K.J. Altenbach C.

N2 gas was used to purge O2 when necessary. In order to measure the immersion depths of membrane-inserted R1 residues, air O2 and 50 mm NiEDDA were used as collision reagents. The range of the incident microwave power was 0.2 to 80 milliwatts for power saturation experiments. Power saturation data were analyzed using the R program (version 1.5.1) (67Ihaka R. Gentleman R.

https://openalex.org/W2027452961,"An embryo of an enantiornithine bird has been recovered from the Lower Cretaceous rocks of Liaoning, in northeast China. The bird has a nearly complete articulated skeleton with feather sheet impressions and is enclosed in egg-shaped confines. The tucking posture of the skeleton suggests that the embryo had attained the final stage of development. The presence of well-developed wing and tail feather sheets indicates a precocial developmental mode, supporting the hypothesis that precocial birds appeared before altricial birds."
https://openalex.org/W2168251712,"Human embryonic stem cells (ESC) are undifferentiated and are endowed with the capacities of self-renewal and pluripotential differentiation. Adult stem cells renew their own tissue, but whether they can transdifferentiate to other tissues is still controversial. To understand the genetic program that underlies the pluripotency of stem cells, we compared the transcription profile of ESC with that of progenitor/stem cells of human hematopoietic and keratinocytic origins, along with their mature cells to be viewed as snapshots along tissue differentiation. ESC gene profiles show higher complexity with significantly more highly expressed genes than adult cells. We hypothesize that ESC use a strategy of expressing genes that represent various differentiation pathways and selection of only a few for continuous expression upon differentiation to a particular target. Such a strategy may be necessary for the pluripotency of ESC. The progenitors of either hematopoietic or keratinocytic cells also follow the same design principle. Using advanced clustering, we show that many of the ESC expressed genes are turned off in the progenitors/stem cells followed by a further down-regulation in adult tissues. Concomitantly, genes specific to the target tissue are up-regulated toward mature cells of skin or blood."
https://openalex.org/W2165959813,"Protein Ser/Thr phosphatase-1 (PP1) is a ubiquitous eukaryotic enzyme that controls numerous cellular processes by the dephosphorylation of key regulatory proteins. PP1 is expressed in various cellular compartments but is most abundant in the nucleus. We have examined the determinants for the nuclear localization of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged PP1 in COS1 cells. Our studies show that PP1γ1 does not contain a functional nuclear localization signal and that its nuclear accumulation does not require Sds22, which has previously been implicated in the nuclear accumulation of PP1 in yeast (Peggie, M. W., MacKelvie, S. H., Bloecher, A., Knatko, E. V., Tatchell, K., and Stark, M. J. R. (2002) J. Cell Sci. 115, 195-206). However, the nuclear targeting of PP1 isoforms was alleviated by the mutation of their binding sites for proteins that interact via an RVXF motif. Moreover, one of the mutants with a cytoplasmic accumulation and decreased affinity for RVXF motifs (PP1γ1-F257A) could be re-targeted to the nucleus by the overexpression of nuclear interactors (NIPP1 (nuclear inhibitor of PP1) and PNUTS (PP1 nuclear targeting subunit)) with a functional RVXF motif. Also, the addition of a synthetic RVXF-containing peptide to permeabilized cells resulted in the loss of nuclear enhanced green fluorescent protein-PP1γ1. Finally, NIPP1-/- mouse embryos showed a nuclear hyperphosphorylation on threonine, consistent with a role for NIPP1 in the nuclear targeting and/or retention of PP1. Our data suggest that both the nuclear translocation and the nuclear retention of PP1 depend on its binding to interactors with an RVXF motif.

Moreover, one of the mutants with a cytoplasmic accumulation and decreased affinity for RVXF motifs (PP1γ1-F257A) could be re-targeted to the nucleus by the overexpression of nuclear interactors (NIPP1 (nuclear inhibitor of PP1) and PNUTS (PP1 nuclear targeting subunit)) with a functional RVXF motif. Also, the addition of a synthetic RVXF-containing peptide to permeabilized cells resulted in the loss of nuclear enhanced green fluorescent protein-PP1γ1. Finally, NIPP1-/- mouse embryos showed a nuclear hyperphosphorylation on threonine, consistent with a role for NIPP1 in the nuclear targeting and/or retention of PP1. Our data suggest that both the nuclear translocation and the nuclear retention of PP1 depend on its binding to interactors with an RVXF motif.

Rev. 2004; 84: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). PP1 does not exist freely in the cell but is associated with a large variety of polypeptides that determine when and where the phosphatase acts. Currently, ∼70 mammalian genes are already known to encode interactors of PP1 (4Cohen P.T.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Some of these function as targeting subunits and bring PP1 in close proximity to its substrates. Others (also) modulate the activity and substrate specificity of PP1 or are themselves substrates for associated PP1. The available information suggests that proteins interact with PP1 via multiple short sequence motifs. These PP1-binding motifs can be shared among PP1 interactors, accounting for the ability of PP1 to form stable complexes with a large number of structurally unrelated proteins. The best characterized and most common PP1-binding motif conforms to the consensus sequence RKX0-1VI{P}FW in which X denotes any residue and {P} any residue except Pro; it is often referred to as the RVXF motif (6Wakula P. Beullens M. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18817-18823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The RVXF motif binds to a hydrophobic channel near the C terminus of PP1 (7Egloff M-P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The binding of the RVXF motif not only has a PP1 anchoring function but also promotes the interaction of secondary, lower affinity binding sites, often resulting in an altered activity and/or substrate specificity of PP1 (1Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Mammalian genomes contain three genes that together encode four isoforms of PP1, namely PP1α, PP1β/δ, and the splice variants PP1γ1 and PP1γ2 (1Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 5Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). These isoforms are ∼90% identical at the protein level and differ mainly in their extremities. With the exception of PP1γ2, which is only expressed in the testis and the brain, the mammalian PP1 isoforms are ubiquitously expressed. PP1α, PP1β/δ, and PP1γ1 show an overlapping but distinct subcellular localization (8Andreassen P.R. Lacroix F.B. Villa-Moruzzi E. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus PP1α is mainly associated with the nuclear matrix, PP1β/δ is enriched in the non-nucleolar chromatin fraction, and PP1γ1 is predominantly targeted to the nucleoli. However, the overexpression of the nuclear interactor NIPP1, which is normally associated mainly with PP1β/δ (9Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), also results in a re-targeting of other PP1 isoforms to nuclear sites that contain NIPP1 (10Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Sleeman J.E. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the steady-state subnuclear localization of PP1 isoforms is at least partially determined by their relative affinities for various targeting proteins. In accordance with this view, it was recently demonstrated that at least some interactors of PP1 contain isoform-specific binding sites (11Carmody L.C. Bauman P.A. Bass M.A. Mavila N. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21714-21723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although PP1 is very abundant in the nucleus, the mechanism underlying its nuclear translocation is unknown. PP1 (36-38 kDa) is sufficiently small to enter the nucleus passively. Yet, this is an unlikely mechanism for its nuclear translocation, because PP1 does not appear to exist in the cell as a free monomer (12Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). PP1 isoforms contain classical polybasic or bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that mediate transport by importins (13Okano K. Heng H. Trevisanato S. Tyers M. Varmusa S. Genomics. 1997; 45: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but the functionality of these NLSs has never been explored. Another possible mechanism for nuclear translocation is piggyback transport involving the co-transport with an interactor that contains an NLS (14Zhao L.J. Padmanabhan R. Cell. 1988; 55: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Turpin P. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2627-2636PubMed Google Scholar). At least four nuclear interactors of PP1 have putative (PNUTS and Sds22) or established (NIPP1 and SIPP1) NLSs, making them candidate co-transporters of PP1 (17Allen P.B. Kwon Y-G. Nairn A.C.

Also, strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that carried temperature-sensitive sds22 alleles showed a rapid loss of nuclear PP1 under restrictive conditions, providing additional evidence for a role of Sds22 in maintaining the normal nuclear localization of PP1 (21Peggie M.W. MacKelvie S.H. Bloecher A. Knatko E.V. Tatchell K. Stark M.J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 195-206PubMed Google Scholar). We have explored the mechanism of the nuclear transport and nuclear retention of EGFP-tagged PP1γ1 by site-directed mutagenesis of a putative NLS and interactor binding sites. The results revealed that the nuclear targeting as well as the nuclear retention of PP1γ depends on proteins such as NIPP1 and PNUTS that contain both an NLS and an RVXF-binding motif. Sds22, which lacks an RVXF motif, does not appear to be involved in the nuclear targeting of PP1γ. Consistent with a role for NIPP1 in the nuclear targeting and function of PP1, we also show that nuclear proteins in NIPP1-/- mouse embryos are hyperphosphorylated. Plasmids and Recombinant Proteins—The full-length sequences of rabbit PP1α and PP1β/δ and rat PP1γ1 were introduced between the XhoI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), yielding expression vectors for EGFP-PP1 isoforms. NIPP1 and NIPP1-(143-224) were subcloned in the pGMEX-T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) downstream of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) encoding cassette. In this vector the EcoRV sites were used for the cloning of NIPP1 and the XmaI/NotI sites for NIPP1-(143-224). Sds22 was subcloned in the BamHI site of the pSG5 vector (Stratagene) with a triple FLAG tag cassette inserted in its EcoRI site. The pcDNA1Neo plasmid (Invitrogen) encoding FLAG-tagged PNUTS was a kind gift of Dr. Y.-G. Kwon (22Kim Y-M. Watanabe T. Allen P.B. Kim Y.-M. Lee S.-J. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kwon Y.-G J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13819-13828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), whereas the pTactac vector encoding human PP1γ1 was kindly provided by Dr. D. Barford (23Egloff M-P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The indicated mutants of PP1γ1, EGFP-PP1, and GST-NIPP1-(143-224) were made according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) with the appropriate primers and templates. All constructs and mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Polyhistidine-tagged NIPP1-(143-224) was expressed in bacteria and purified on Ni2+-Sepharose (24Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed human PP1γ1 and PP1γ1-F257A were purified as described by Egloff et al. (23Egloff M-P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and assayed with glycogen phosphorylase a as the substrate (24Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cell Cultures, Immunoprecipitations, and GST Pull-downs—COS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. 48 h after transfection with the indicated plasmids and FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the cells were washed twice with PBS (1.8 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and harvested in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 5 μm leupeptin. Following centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g), the supernatants (cell lysates) were used either for the immunoprecipitation of the EGFP-PP1γ1 fusion proteins with anti-EGFP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-TSK-Sepharose (Affiland) or for the pull-down of GST-NIPP1-(143-224) with glutathione-agarose (Sigma). Before immunoblotting, the EGFP immunoprecipitates were washed once with PBS containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1 m LiCl and twice with PBS plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Following GST pull-down, the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or EGFP (Fig. 4). The EGFP immunoprecipitates were used for immunoblotting with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against PNUTS, NIPP1 (25Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W.

For the production of anti-PNUTS antibodies, a synthetic peptide (CGDPNQLTRKGRKRKTVTWPEEGKL) comprising residues 384-407 of PNUTS and an additional N-terminal cysteine was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to raise antibodies in rabbits. The antibodies were affinity-purified on albumin-coupled peptide linked to CNBr-activated-Sepharose-4B (Amersham Biosciences).Fig. 2Mutation of the RVXF-binding channel of PP1γ1 affects its binding to protein interactors. A, EGFP-tagged PP1γ1, PP1γ1-(Δ285-323), and PP1γ1-F257A were immunoprecipitated from COS1 cell lysates. The immunoprecipitates were used for immunoblotting using anti-EGFP, anti-PNUTS, anti-NIPP1, and anti-Sds22 antibodies as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” B, purified, bacterially expressed PP1γ1 (open circles) and PP1γ1-F257A (closed circles) were assayed with glycogen phosphorylase a as the substrate in the presence of the indicated concentrations of recombinant NIPP1-(143-224).

Cell permeabilization was performed by a 10-min incubation in PBS supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100. The permeabilized cells were washed three times for 10 min with PBS, pre-incubated for 20 min with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, and then incubated for 90 min with either polyclonal antibodies against GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG tag (Stratagene). After three washes of 10 min each with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with secondary anti-rabbit (for GST detection) or anti-mouse antibodies (for FLAG detection) that were labeled with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC; Sigma). Finally, the cells were washed three times for 10 min in PBS. Confocal images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Jena, Germany) equipped with the Zeiss Axiovert 100 m (Plan Apochromat 40 × 1.30 NA oil immersion objective) using the standard fluorescein isothiocyanate-TRITC filter set. For the simultaneous imaging of EGFP and TRITC fluorescence, both labels were excited in different tracks with the 488-nm line of an argon laser and the 543-nm line of a helium-neon laser, respectively. The emission from each fluorochrome was detected using 505-530-nm (fluorescein thiocyanate) and 560-615-nm (TRITC) band-pass filters. Nuclear Retention Assay—Cells transfected with EGFP-PP1γ1 were washed twice with “transport” buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (27Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the cells were permeabilized for 5 min with digitonin (40 μg/ml) in transport buffer. After a wash with transport buffer, the permeabilized cells were incubated with transport buffer containing 200 μm synthetic peptide NIPP1-(191-200) (KNSRVTFSED) or 200 μm variant peptide KNSRATASED. After 15 min, the green fluorescence was visualized by confocal microscopy. The Nuclear Targeting of PP1γ Requires a Functional RVXF-binding Channel—To study the subcellular localization of PP1γ1, we transfected COS1 cells with a construct encoding a fusion of EGFP and rat PP1γ1. In accordance with published data (10Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Sleeman J.E. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the EGFP-PP1γ1 fusion was largely nuclear and enriched in the nucleoli (Fig. 1A). Two established inactive point mutants of PP1γ1, i.e. EGFP-PP1γ1-D64N and EGFP-PP1γ1-H125A (28Zhang J. Zhang Z. Brew K. Lee E.Y.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6276-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), showed the same subcellular distribution (not shown), demonstrating that the protein phosphatase activity of PP1γ1 is not required for its correct localization. The PSORT II program (29Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1825) Google Scholar) predicts that the C-terminal KKKP sequence (residues 301-304) of PP1γ1 is a candidate NLS. However, the replacement of each of the three lysines in this sequence by an alanine did not affect the nuclear accumulation of EGFP-PP1γ1 (Fig. 1B), indicating that they are not part of a functional NLS. Because PP1γ1 did not appear to contain a functional polybasic or bipartite NLS, we reasoned that PP1γ might be piggyback transported to the nucleus by its association with protein interactors that themselves contain one or more functional NLSs. We therefore generated two PP1γ1 variants that are mutated in the RVXF-binding channel, which is involved in the binding of most interactors of PP1 (see Introduction). EGFP-PP1γ1-Δ286-323, which is truncated just before the last β-strand (β14) that lines the RVXF-binding channel (26Ceulemans H. Vulsteke V. De Maeyer M. Tatchell K. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47331-47337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), was largely cytoplasmic and sometimes showed a speckled distribution in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). A more subtle mutation of the RVXF-binding channel, as in EGFP-PP1γ1-F257A, also largely abolished the nuclear accumulation (Fig. 1D). The corresponding mutations in other PP1 isoforms, as in EGFP-PP1α-F257A and EGFP-PP1β/δ-F256A, also resulted in a nuclear exclusion of these fusions (not shown). These data suggest that the RVXF-binding channel is required for the nuclear targeting of all PP1 isoforms. The cytoplasmic localization of the EGFP-PP1 fusions with a mutated RVXF channel also confirms that PP1 has no NLS that enables importin-mediated transport to the nucleus. Identical data as shown in Fig. 1 were also obtained in HeLa cells (not shown). To examine whether EGFP-PP1γ1-Δ286-323 and EGFP-PP1γ1-F257A indeed display a reduced affinity for RVXF-containing interactors, we performed immunoprecipitations of the EGFP fusions from COS1 cell lysates with anti-EGFP antibodies (Fig. 2A). The immunoprecipitation of EGFP-PP1γ1-Δ286-323 and EGFP-PP1γ1-F257A did not result in the co-immunoprecipitation of two RVXF-containing interactors (NIPP1 and PNUTS) but showed an increased co-immunoprecipitation of Sds22, which does not contain a functional RVXF motif. The increased interaction of EGFP-PP1γ1-Δ286-323 with Sds22 has been reported previously and has been explained by a lack of competition with RVXF-containing interactors of PP1 (26Ceulemans H. Vulsteke V. De Maeyer M. Tatchell K. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47331-47337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our observation that the cytoplasmically retained mutants of EGFP-PP1γ1 show an increased interaction with Sds22 is initial evidence that the nuclear targeting of EGFP-PP1γ1 is not mediated by Sds22. We have also examined the affinity of bacterially expressed PP1γ1 and PP1γ1-F257A for NIPP1-(143-224) (Fig. 2B). The interaction of NIPP1-(143-224) with PP1 is entirely dependent on its RVXF motif and can be easily monitored by phosphatase inhibition assays (24Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2B it is shown that PP1γ1-F257A indeed showed a reduced sensitivity to inhibition by NIPP1-(143-224). Bacterially expressed PP1γ1-Δ286-323 was inactive and could therefore not be tested in this system. Nuclear Re-targeting of EGFP-PP1γ1-F257A by the Overexpression of Nuclear Interactors with an RVXF Motif—The above data are consistent with the view that PP1γ1 is piggyback transported to the nucleus by association with proteins that contain both a PP1-binding RVXF motif and an NLS. In further agreement with this hypothesis we found that the cytoplasmic EGFP-PP1γ1-F257A, which only showed a moderately decreased affinity for RVXF motifs (Fig. 2B), could be re-targeted to the nucleus by the co-expression of a GST fusion of NIPP1-(143-224) (Fig. 3C), a protein with an established NLS as well as a PP1-binding RVXF motif (19Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Boudrez A. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3761-3764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the co-expression of GST-NIPP1-(143-224)-V201A/F203A, which has a mutated RVXF motif but still contains a functional NLS, did not affect the cytoplasmic accumulation of EGFP-PP1γ1-F257A (Fig. 3D). Intriguingly, the expression of GST-NIPP1-(143-224) re-targeted EGFP-PP1γ1-F257A to the nucleus but not to the nucleoli (Fig. 3C). However, wild-type PP1γ1 (EGFP-PP1γ) also was no longer enriched in the nucleoli following the expression of GST-NIPP1-(143-224) (Fig. 3A). A similar subnuclear redistribution of PP1γ1 has been described following the expression of full-length NIPP1 (10Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Sleeman J.E. Lamond A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can be accounted for by the accumulation of NIPP1 outside the nucleoli. As expected, the expression of GST-NIPP1-(143-224) with a mutated RVXF motif did not affect the subcellular distribution of EGFP-PP1γ (Fig. 3B). GST pull-down experiments from COS1 cell lysates confirmed that GST-NIPP1-(143-224) interacted much better with EGFP-PP1γ than with EGFP-PP1γ1-F257A, whereas EGFP-PP1γ1-Δ285-323 had no affinity at all for GST-NIPP1-(143-224) (Fig. 4). These data explain why the overexpression of GST-NIPP1-(143-224) resulted in a nuclear accumulation of EGFP-PP1γ1-F257A (Fig. 3C) but had no clear effect on the subcellular distribution of EGFP-PP1γ1-Δ285-323 (not shown). We have subsequently compared the ability of the major nuclear interactors of PP1 to re-target EGFP-PP1γ1-F257A to the nucleus. EGFP-PP1γ1-F257A was nearly exclusively nuclear following the co-expression of either full-length NIPP1 (Fig. 5A) or PNUTS (Fig. 5B). However, EGFP-PP1γ1-F257A remained cytoplasmic when FLAG-tagged Sds22 was co-expressed despite the fact that this fusion was partially nuclear (Fig. 5C) and bound very tightly to EGFP-PP1γ1-F257A (not shown). These data show that the nuclear targeting of PP1γ is likely to be mediated by various nuclear interactors with an RVXF motif. In contrast, PP1 interactors such as Sds22 that are nuclear but lack an RVXF motif do not seem to be capable of co-transporting PP1 to the nucleus. The Nuclear Retention of PP1γ1Is Dependent on Interactors with an RVXF Motif—To examine whether the nuclear retention of EGFP-PP1γ1 is also dependent on its association with RVXF-containing interactors, we have added the RVXF-containing peptide KNSRVTFSED, corresponding to NIPP1-(191-200), to digitonin-permeabilized cells. Digitonin was added at concentrations (40 μg/ml) known to perforate the plasma membrane without affecting the nuclear envelope or other major intracellular membranes (27Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). In Fig. 6B it is shown that the addition of KNSRVTFSED, which is expected to compete with endogenous RVXF-containing proteins for binding to PP1, resulted in a complete loss of EGFP-PP1γ1 from the nucleus. By contrast, a similar peptide with a mutated RVXF motif (KNSRATASED) did not have any effect on the nuclear localization of EGFP-PP1γ1 (Fig. 6C). Thus, the nuclear retention of PP1γ1 also depends on its interaction with RVXF-containing proteins. A Deficiency of NIPP1 Is Associated with a Hyperphosphorylation of Nuclear Proteins—To examine whether the nuclear targeting and/or retention of endogenous PP1 also depends on proteins with an RVXF motif, we have initially tried to make use of commercially available PP1 antibodies to visualize endogenous PP1 after the overexpression of NIPP1 or PNUTS. However, PP1 antibodies from three different commercial sources could not be used for the immunodetection of endogenous PP1 in intact cells (not shown), in accordance with observations by Trinkle-Mulcahy et al. (30Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Andrews P.D. Wickramasinghe S. Sleeman J. Prescott A. Wah Lam Y. Lyon C. Swedlow J.R. Lamond A.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As an alternative approach, we have therefore examined the consequence of the targeted disruption of the NIPP1 alleles in mice on the phosphorylation level of nuclear proteins, using anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. Indeed, if NIPP1 would be required for the nuclear targeting and/or retention of PP1, one would expect that the substrates of NIPP1-associated PP1 would be hyperphosphorylated in NIPP1-/- cells. The targeted disruption of the NIPP1 alleles is associated with growth retardation and is embryonic lethal at ∼7 dpc (31Van Eynde A. Nuytten M. Dewerchin M. Schoonjans L. Keppens S. Beullens M. Moons L. Carmeliet P. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5863-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In Fig. 7 it is shown that the NIPP1-/- embryos at 6.5 dpc displayed a considerably increased nuclear protein phosphorylation level as compared with that of the wild-type embryos at 6.5 dpc. Wild-type embryos at 5.5 dpc, which correspond in size to the NIPP1-/- embryos at 6.5 dpc, did not show a nuclear hyperphosphorylation on threonine (not illustrated). These data are consistent with a role for NIPP1 in the nuclear targeting and/or retention of PP1 and also show that NIPP1-associated PP1 has nuclear substrates. The latter conclusion also fits in nicely with previous observations that the NIPP1-PP1 complex, albeit inactive when reconstituted in vitro, can become an active protein phosphatase by the phosphorylation of NIPP1 (24Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By far, most proteins enter the nucleus either passively or by importin-mediated transport. However, neither of these mechanisms can account for the nuclear accumulation of PP1. Indeed, there is no evidence for the existence of free PP1, and none of the PP1 holoenzymes are small enough to diffuse through the nuclear pores passively. Also, PP1γ1 contains a consensus NLS, but this motif is not conserved in other PP1 isoforms (13Okano K. Heng H. Trevisanato S. Tyers M. Varmusa S. Genomics. 1997; 45: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and its mutation did not affect the nuclear accumulation of PP1γ1 (Fig. 1B). We have obtained data strongly indicating that PP1 is translocated to the nucleus by the association with proteins that contain both an NLS and a PP1-binding RVXF motif. First, a deletion or point mutation of the RVXF-binding channel of PP1 isoforms abolished the nuclear targeting of the phosphatase. Second, a PP1γ1 mutant with a decreased affinity for the RVXF motif (PP1γ1-F257A) and a cytoplasmic accumulation could be re-targeted to the nucleus by the overexpression of nuclear interactors with a functional RVXF motif (Fig. 3). However, PP1γ1-(Δ286-323), which did not bind at all to RVXF-containing interactors (Fig. 4), could not be re-targeted to the nucleus. Both NIPP1 and PNUTS/R111, which represent the major nuclear interactors of PP1 in mammalian cells (9Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), were able to translocate PP1γ1-F257A to the nucleus, suggesting that they both represent true “nuclear targeting subunits” of PP1. Consistent with this view, we found that the disruption of the NIPP1 genes was associated with a nuclear hyperphosphorylation of proteins on threonine in mouse embryos. Interestingly, the established NLS of NIPP1-(143-224) is just N-terminal to the RVXF motif (19Jagiello I. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Boudrez A. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3761-3764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has also been implicated in the potent inhibition of PP1 by NIPP1 (32Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Connor J. Shenolikar S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14053-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our finding that NIPP1-(143-224) and PP1γ are co-transported (Fig. 3) strongly suggests that the binding of importin-α to this NLS and the binding of PP1 to the RVXF motif are not mutually exclusive. S. cerevisiae only expresses a single PP1 isoform termed Glc7. In accordance with our data, Glc7-F256A, which corresponds to PP1γ1-F257A, also showed a decreased affinity for interactors with an RVXF motif but still interacted with Sds22 (33Wu X. Tatchell K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7410-7420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Glc7-F256A also showed some subcellular localization deficiencies but, at variance with our results, Glc7-F256A was still associated with the nucleoli. We suggest that the cytoplasmic retention of PP1γ1-F257A in mammalian cells is accounted for by the competition of other PP1 isoforms for binding to RVXF-containing interactors. In contrast, for the lack of competing PP1 isoforms Glc7-F256A can still accumulate in the nucleus in yeast. PP1γ1-F257A could not be re-targeted to the nucleus by the overexpression of Sds22 (Fig. 5), which interacts with a fragment of PP1 that is remote from the RVXF-binding channel (26Ceulemans H. Vulsteke V. De Maeyer M. Tatchell K. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47331-47337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This was an unexpected finding, because FLAG-Sds22 is partially nuclear (Fig. 5C), is associated with PP1 in the nucleus (34Dinischiotu A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and interacts even better with PP1γ1-F257A and PP1γ1-(Δ286-323) than with wild-type PP1 (Fig. 2A). Our data therefore suggest that Sds22 migrates to the nucleus either independently of PP1 or as part of a complex that also contains a protein with a PP1-binding RVXF motif. The (sub)nuclear targeting and retention of EGFP-PP1γ1 also appears to be mediated by RVXF-containing interactors, because virtually no EGFP-PP1γ1 was left in the nucleus after a short incubation of permeabilized cells with an RVXF peptide (Fig. 6B). Whereas some EGFP-PP1γ1 may have leaked out of the permeabilized cells, a considerable fraction remained cytoplasmic. These data indicate that there exist one or more cytoplasmic proteins that can bind PP1 independently of an RVXF motif and that are associated with structures (the cytoskeleton?) that do not leak out of permeabilized cells. Preliminary biochemical assays indeed provide evidence for the existence of a cytoplasmic protein or proteins that bind and inhibit exogenous purified PP1 in the presence of an RVXF peptide (not illustrated). We speculate that such inhibitory proteins keep newly synthesized PP1 from accidentally dephosphorylating proteins until it can form a holoenzyme by association with an RVXF-containing interactor.

We have very limited knowledge about the expression and function of these kinases and their ligands in the immune system. In this study we investigated the effect of EFNB1 on mouse T-cells. EFNB1 and the Eph kinases it interacts with (collectively called EFNB1 receptors (EFNB1R)) were expressed on T-cells, B cells, and monocytes/macrophages. Some T-cells were double positive for EFNB1 and EFBB1R. Solid phase EFNB1 in the presence of suboptimal TCR ligation augmented T-cell responses in terms interferon-γ secretion, proliferation, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity but not interleukin-2 production. After T-cell receptor (TCR) ligation, EFNB1R congregated to TCR caps, and then both of them translocated to raft caps. This provides a morphological basis for EFNB1R to enhance TCR signaling. Further downstream of the signaling pathway, EFNB1R stimulation led to increased LAT (linker for activation of T-cells) phosphorylation and p44/42 and p38 MAPK activation. Similar to CD28 costimulation, EFNB1R costimulation was insensitive to cyclosporin A inhibition. On the other hand, unlike the former, EFNB1R costimulation failed to activate Akt, which is essential in triggering interleukin-2 production. Our study suggests that EFNB1 is pivotal in T-cell-T-cell costimulation and in reducing T-cell response threshold to antigen stimulation.

Receptors are important cell surface molecules for communication between cells and their environment. Protein-tyrosine kinases are essential components in lymphocyte signaling pathways. Thus, receptor tyrosine kinases have dual pivotal functions in lymphocytes. The Eph family is the largest receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family. According to sequence homology, Eph kinases are classified into EphAs (EphA1 to EphA9) and EphBs (EphB1 to EphB6) (1Committee Eph Nomenclature Cell. 1997; 90: 403-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). 1cbweb.med.harvard.edu/eph-nomenclature/cell_letter.html. Ephrins (EFNs) 2The abbreviations used are: EFN, ephrin; EFNB1R, EFNB1 receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PE, phycoerythrin; LAT, linker for activation of T-cells; CyA, cyclosporin A; NHIgG, normal human IgG; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TCR, T-cell receptor; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte. are ligands of Eph kinases; they are cell surface molecules as well and can be classified into A and B subfamilies. EFNAs (EFNA1 to EFNA6) are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and bind to EphA members with loose specificity; EFNBs (EFNB1 to EFNB3) are transmembrane proteins and bind to EphBs, again with loose specificity (1Committee Eph Nomenclature Cell. 1997; 90: 403-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). 1cbweb.med.harvard.edu/eph-nomenclature/cell_letter.html. An exception is EphA4, which can bind to EFNB2 in addition to EFNA members (2Gale N.W. Holland S.J. Valenzuela D.M. Flenniken A. Pan L. Ryan T.E. Henkemeyer M. Strebhardt K. Hirai H. Wilkinson D.G. Pawson T. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1996; 17: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). EFNBs can also function as reciprocal receptors for EphB molecules and transduce reversely signals into cells (3Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Mbamalu G. Yancopoulos G.D. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. Nature. 1996; 383: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Most Eph kinases or ephrins have likely already been identified because the sequences from the human genome project have revealed 14 Eph entries and 8 EFN entries (4Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W.

Because Eph kinases and their ligands are all cell surface molecules, they can only interact with each other when expressed on adjacent cells. Not surprisingly, the clearly demonstrated function of these receptors and ligands is to control accurate spatial patterning and cell positioning in the central nervous system (5Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 177-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1998; 93: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). Some of the Eph kinases and their ligands are expressed on immune cells (8Lickliter J.D. Smith F.M.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 777-786PubMed Google Scholar); limited knowledge about their function in immune responses is available and is described as follows. We have previously reported that a kinase-defective Eph family member, EphB6, is capable of transducing signals into T-cells, probably through adaptor molecules (notably Cbl, Grb2, and CrkL) associated with its intracellular tail (12Luo H. Wan X. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Activation of EphB6 with solid phase anti-EphB6 mAb results in Jurkat cell apoptosis (12Luo H. Wan X. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or augmentation of normal human T-cell response to Ag stimulation (13Luo H. Yu G. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, probably due to functional overlap of Eph kinases, no abnormal phenotype in thymocyte structure and subpopulation composition was found in EphB6–/– mice (14Shimoyama M. Matsuoka H. Nagata A. Iwata N. Tamekane A. Okamura A. Gomyo H. Ito M. Jishage K. Kamada N. Suzuki H. Tetsuo N.T. Matsui T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Munoz et al. (15Munoz J.J. Alonso C. Sacedon R. Crompton T. Vicente A. Jimenez E. Varas A. Zapata A.G. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have reported that a few soluble recombinant EphAs and EFNAs interfere with T-cell development in thymic organ culture. Sharfe et al. (16Sharfe N. Freywald A. Toro A. Dadi H. Roifman C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3745-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have reported that several EFNs, notably EFNA-1, inhibit T-cell chemotaxis. In this study, we investigated the expression of EFNB1 and its receptors in the immune system and the role of EFNB1 in modulating T-cell responses. In Situ Hybridization—A 534-bp cDNA fragment of mouse EFNB1 cDNA from positions 336–890 (accession number U12983) was fetched with PCR from a mouse embryonic tissue cDNA library and cloned into pGEM-4Z (Invitrogen). The resulting construct, pGEM-4Z-mB1, served to transcribe antisense probes with SP6 RNA polymerase or to transcribe sense probes with T7 RNA polymerase using digoxigenin RNA-labeling kits (Roche Diagnostics). In situ hybridization was carried out according to instructions from the kit manufacturer. Generation of Mouse EFNB1-Fc—The coding sequence of the extracellular domains of mouse EFNB1 from positions 255–803 (accession number U12983) was cloned in-frame upstream of the human IgG1-Fc-coding sequence in an expression vector pCMVhFc. The constructs and pcDNA3 were then transfected into CHO/dhfr– cells with Lipofectamine. The cells were cultured in selection medium (α-minimum essential medium without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 0.01 mm methotrexate, 0.8 mg/ml G418, and 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin). After 2 weeks of culture, stably transfected clones were handpicked. Fusion proteins were isolated from supernatants by protein A columns and verified by N-terminal peptide sequencing (Sheldon Biotechnology Center, McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Lymphocyte Preparation and Culture—Cells were flushed out from the BALB/c mouse spleen, and red blood cells were lysed with 0.84% NH4Cl, as described elsewhere (17Chen H. Luo H. Xu D. Loh D.Y. Daloze P.M. Veillette A. Qi S. Wu J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4297-4308PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting cells were referred to as spleen cells. Spleen T-cells were purified by deleting mouse IgG (H+L)-positive cells from spleen cells with T-cell columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cedarlane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada); the T-cell purity was about 90%. In some experiments the spleen cells were fractionated into CD4 and CD8 cells using Miltenyi magnetic beads (Miltenyi, Biotec, Auburn, CA), and the purity of CD4 and CD8 cells was about 95%. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. Solid phase EFNB1 and anti-CD3 were prepared by coating 96-well Costar 3595 plates overnight with anti-mouse CD3 (clone 2C11) in PBS at 4 °C followed by incubating EFNB1-Fc or normal human IgG (as a control, Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) of different concentrations at 37 °C for 2 h. The plates were finally incubated on ice for 1–2 additional h before use. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was employed for measurement of EFNB1 receptor expression as well as EFNB1 expression in different cell populations after overnight culture. BALB/c spleen cells were stained with biotinylated EFNB1-Fc/streptavidin-PE or with goat anti-EFNB1 (R&D, Minneapolis, MN)/donkey anti-goat IgG-PE (Cedarlane); for the second color, anti-CD3-FITC (Clone 2C11), anti-B220-FITC (Clone RA3–6B2), anti-F4/80-FITC (Clone CI: A3-1) was used. For EFNB1, EFNB1 receptor (EFNB1R), and CD3 3-color staining, the spleen cells were first reacted with goat anti-EFNB1; after washing, phosphatidylethanolamine-donkey-anti-goat IgG, EFNB1-Fc, and biotin-anti-CD3 were reacted with the cells; after extensive wash again, the cells were finally incubated with FITC-goat-anti-human IgG and Quantum Red-streptavidin. In some experiments, CD4 and CD8 cells were first purified from spleen cells with Miltenyi magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). Normal human IgG was used as a negative control for EFNB1-Fc in EFNB1R staining, and normal goat IgG was used as a negative control for EFNB1 staining. All the gatings in flow cytometry were set according to these negative controls. All these mAbs were from Pharmingen unless indicated otherwise. [3H]Thymidine Uptake Assay—T-cells were cultured in 96-well plates (Costar 3595) coated with different mAb or recombinant proteins, the concentrations of which were indicated in the figure legends. [3H]Thymidine uptake was measured as described previously (18Luo H. Chen H. Daloze P. Chang J.Y. St. Louis G. Wu J. Transplantation. 1992; 53: 1071-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic T-cell Assay—The assay was performed as detailed earlier using spleen cells from TCR transgenic 2C mice (19Zhang J. Salcedo T.W. Wan X. Ullrich S. Hu B. Gregorio T. Feng P. Qi S. Chen H. Cho Y.H. Li Y. Moore P.A. Wu J. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). T-cells in 2C mice (H-2b) are predominantly Ld-specific CD8 cells (more that 85% Thy1.2+ cells are CD8 cells, and less than 3% Thy1.2+ cells were CD4+ cells) (20Sha W.C. Nelson C.A. Newberry R.D. Kranz D.M. Russell J.H. Loh D.Y. Nature. 1988; 336: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Because of such a high frequency of Ld-specific precursors, this assay has high sensitivity and a high signal versus noise ratio and was routinely used to assess CTL activity in our laboratory (17Chen H. Luo H. Xu D. Loh D.Y. Daloze P.M. Veillette A. Qi S. Wu J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4297-4308PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhang J. Salcedo T.W. Wan X. Ullrich S. Hu B. Gregorio T. Feng P. Qi S. Chen H.

Blood. 2002; 100: 3279-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 2C spleen cells (0.4 × 106 cells/well) were stimulated with an equal amount of mitomycin C-treated BALB/c mouse spleen cells (H-2d) in flat-bottomed 96-well plates, which were pre-coated with EFNB1-Fc or normal human IgG (both at 10 μg/ml). The cells were cultured in the presence of 10 units/ml IL-2 for 6 days. On day 6, cells receiving the same treatment were pooled and counted, and their CTL activity was measured by a standard 4-h 51Cr-release assay, using 51Cr-labeled P815 cells (H-2d) as targets at different effector/target ratios. The lysis percentage of the test sample was calculated as follows: % lysis = (cpm of the test sample–cpm of spontaneous release)/(cpm of maximal release–cpm of spontaneous release). Cytokine Measurement—Culture supernatants of T-cells placed in anti-CD3- and/or EFNB1-Fc-coated wells were harvested 1–3 days after initiation of culture. IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ in the supernatants were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R & D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confocal Microscopy—Five million BALB/c T-cells were reacted on ice for 30 min with 5 μg of EFNB1-Fc and 1 μg of biotinylated anti-CD3 (clone 2C11, hamster mAb). After washing, the cells were incubated with goat anti-hamster IgG (5 μg/sample) for 30 min on ice. The cells were washed with cold PBS and transferred to warm PBS to start the cross-linking process at 37 °C. The cells were then immediately fixed with 3.7% formalin. For TCR and EFNB1 receptor staining, the cells were reacted with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594 (1 μg/sample) and goat anti-human IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 (1 μg/106 cells) on ice for 30 min. For raft and EFNB1 receptor staining, the procedure was similar as described above, but cholera toxin-Alexa Fluor 594 (0.5 μg/sample) was used in place of streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594. The slides were examined under a confocal microscope. Immunoblotting—MAPK and Akt activation was assayed using BALB/c spleen T-cells. Twelve-well plates were coated overnight with anti-CD3 (0.8 μg/ml, 500 μl/well) at 4 °C. After washing, the wells were incubated with EFNB1-Fc, anti-CD28, or normal human IgG (NHIgG, both at 10 μg/ml, 500 μl/well) at 37 °C for 1–2 h and then at 0 °C for another 2 h. BALB/c spleen T-cells were seeded in these precoated plates at 5 × 106 cells/well, and the plates were centrifuged at 228 × g for 5 min to achieve rapid contact between the cells and the bottom of the culture wells. The cells were then cultured at 37 °C for 30 min to 120 min, as indicated, before being harvested. The remainder of the immunoblotting procedure was detailed in our previous publication (17Chen H.

Phosphorylated MAPK or Akt was detected with rabbit anti-phospho-p38 MAPK Ab or rabbit anti-phospho-Akt, respectively; total MAPK or Akt was revealed with rabbit anti-p44/42 MAPK Ab or rabbit anti-Akt Ab (all Abs were from New England BioLabs, Mississauga, ON, Canada). LAT (linker for activation of T-cells) phosphorylation was measured in BALB/c spleen T-cells (10 × 106 cells/sample), which were incubated with anti-CD3 (clone 2C11 hamster mAb; 1 μg/ml) plus EFNB1-Fc, anti-CD28, or NHIgG (both at 5 μg/ml) on ice for 1 h followed by 1 wash in cold PBS. Anti-hamster IgG and anti-human IgG (both at 1 μg/ml) were then added, and the cells were incubated for 30 min on ice; cross-linking (2 min) took place by transferring the cells to 37 °C. The cleared cell lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Phosphorylated LAT was detected with polyclonal anti-phospho-LAT (Cell Signaling, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada); total LAT was assayed with anti-LAT mAb (Clone 45, BD Transduction Laboratory, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). All signals were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence. EFNB1 and EFNB1R Expression in Leukocytes—The expression of EFNB1 mRNA in the spleen was assessed by in situ hybridization. In the un-manipulated BALB/c spleen (H-2d), the EFNB1 signal was detected in white pulp and the subcapsule region. We transfused BALB/c × C57BL/6 F1 (H-2dxb) spleen cells intravenously into BALB/c mice and monitored the changes of EFNB1 expression pattern for 168 h. Such transfusion should induce vigorous in vivo anti-H-2b cellular response by the host T-cells (H-2d), whereas the donor cells (H-2dxb) should not be reactive to the host cells. The spleen of the recipient became swollen after 24 h (data not shown), and the in situ hybridization demonstrated EFNB1 expression in enlarged white pulp and the peri-arteriole lymphoid sheath (Fig. 1) at 24, 120, and 168 h after the transfusion. Expression of EFNB1 and its receptor(s) at the protein levels on various leukocytes was investigated by flow cytometry. EFNB1 expression on isolated CD4 T-cells and CD8 cells were similar (Fig. 2A) at about 33% according to anti-EFNB1 staining. B cells (B220+) or monocytes/macrophages (F4/80+) also expressed EFNB1 at 24.8 and 9.5%, respectively (Fig. 2B). Activation of T-cells (CD3+) by solid phase anti-CD3 for 24 h did not increase but moderately reduced the EFNB1 expression (Fig. 2C). The EphBs that EFNB1 bound were collectively referred to as EFNB1Rs (EFNB1 can bind to more than one EphB subfamily member), and their expression was investigated using EFNB1-Fc staining. EFNB1R had similar levels of expression on CD4 and CD8 cells (28.3 and 32.0%, respectively; Fig. 2A). B cells expressed more EFNB1R than macrophages/monocytes (30.8 and 10.2%, respectively; Fig. 2B). After activation by solid phase anti-CD3, CD3+ T-cells moderately reduced their EFNB1R expression (Fig. 2C). Because EFNB1 and EFNB1R are both expressed on T-cells, we wondered whether the same T-cell could express both. Fig. 2D showed the EFNB1 and EFNB1R expression on CD3+ cells; about 13% of the T-cells are EFNB1 and EFNB1 double-positive, with about 8 and 38% T-cells single positive for EFNB1 and EFNB1R, respectively. It is to be noted that the whole T-cell population is a continuum for EFNB1 and EFNB1R expression with each T-cell expressing different level of EFNB1 and/or EFNB1R. These results revealed that among the leukocytes examined, a significant percentage of T and B cells and small percentages of macrophages/monocytes expressed EFNB1+ and EFNB1R+. This provides a molecular basis for EFNB1R on T-cells to receive EFNB1 signaling from other T-cells as well as from non-T-cells such as B cells and monocytes/macrophages. T-cell activation did not lead to enhanced expression of EFNB1 at the protein level; the expression of EFNB1 mRNA in the dense spleen white pulp and peri-arteriole lymphoid sheath after the F1 spleen cell transfusion most likely reflected increased density of leukocytes in these regions. EFNB1 Enhances T-cell Proliferation—Because about 20–30% T-cells were EFNB1R+ in culture, it was logical to assume that EFNB1 might modulate T-cell function. To examine this possibility, both anti-CD3 mAb and EFNB1-Fc were anchored on solid phase. Anti-CD3 (at a suboptimal concentration) or EFNB1-Fc (at an optimal concentration) alone caused negligible T-cell proliferation (Fig. 3C), but EFNB1-Fc dose-dependently induced the proliferation in the presence of suboptimal anti-CD3 (Fig. 3A). Next, T-cells were cultured in wells coated with an optimal amount of EFNB1-Fc and various amounts of anti-CD3. As shown in Fig. 3B, EFNB1-Fc but not NHIgG (a negative control for EFNB1-Fc) augmented T-cell proliferation when anti-CD3 was used at different concentrations. This result suggests that EFNB1R cross-linking reduces the T-cell response threshold and that cell surface EFNB1 on B cells, monocytes/macrophages, and T-cells might be able to enhance T-cell responses to antigens. We also compared the costimulation by EFNB1-Fc with that by anti-CD28 mAb (Fig. 3C). The costimulation mediated by EFNB1R was in the same order of magnitude as that mediated by the classical costimulatory molecule CD28. CD4 and CD8 cells responded to EFNB1 costimulation with similar magnitude (Fig. 3D), and this is consistent with the similar levels of EFNB1R expression on these two populations of cells. It is to be mentioned that the peak of EFNB1-Fc-enhanced proliferation was at day 3 after the culture, similar to that stimulated by optimal anti-CD3 (data not shown), indicating that observed EFNB1-costimulation was not due to a kinetics shift of proliferation. The results from this section suggest that EFNB1 receptors can enhance T-cell activation to antigen stimulation. EFNB1 Enhances Lymphokine Production and CTL Activity—We next examined the effect of EFNB1 on T-cell effector functions, such as lymphokine production and CTL activity. Again, T-cells were stimulated with solid phase anti-CD3 alone (at a suboptimal concentration) or in combination with EFNB1-Fc or anti-CD28 (both at optimal concentrations and on solid phase). Three representative lymphokines, IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ, were measured from day 1 to day 3 after the stimulation. Anti-CD3 with or without NHIgG did not trigger lymphokine production. Anti-CD28 costimulation drastically induced IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ, as expected (Fig. 4A); the IL-2 level declined since day 2 and the IL-4 level, since day 3, reflecting consumption of the lymphokines by the cells. EFNB1-Fc costimulation moderately increased IL-4 secretion and resulted in IFN-γ secretion at a level comparable with that achieved by anti-CD28 costimulation; however, it did not stimulate IL-2 production at all. The lack of IL-2 production was not due to a shift of secretion kinetics during EFNB1 costimulation because no production of IL-2 was observed during any time between days 1 and 3 after culture. This again demonstrated the qualitative difference between costimulation mediated by CD28 and EFNB1R. When mixed lymphocyte reaction was elicited in EFNB1-Fc-coated wells, CTL development was greatly enhanced (Fig. 4B), whereas control normal human IgG had no such effect. The enhancement was due to better T-cell activation but not due to better effector cell function or effector-target cell interaction because the solid phase EFNB1 was only present during the 5-day stimulation stage but not in the 4-h 51Cr release assay. The results of this section demonstrate that EFNB1 can selectively enhance T-cell functions such lymphokine secretion and CTL activity. Signaling Events in T-cells Stimulated by EFNB1—To understand the mechanism of EFNB1 costimulation, we first examined translocation of EFNB1R and TCR on the cell surface and their relationship to membrane lipid rafts immediately after TCR-cross-linking, which was achieved using biotinylated anti-CD3 followed by goat anti-hamster IgG. The TCR complex was stained by streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594, in red; EFNB1R, was stained by EFNB1-Fc followed by antihuman IgG-Alexa Fluor 488, in green; and the lipid rafts in the T-cell membrane was stained by cholera toxin-Alexa Fluor 594, in red. In resting T-cells, rafts, TCR, and EFNB2 were evenly distributed throughout the cell surface (Fig. 5). After 10-min of cross-linking with anti-CD3, TCR rapidly polarized and formed a cap in one end of the cell. EFNB1R also congregated, and they co-localized with TCR. Such co-capping lasted more than 20 min (data not shown). Control human IgG (in place of EFNB1-Fc) followed by anti-human IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 detected no signals in these cells (data not shown). After CD3 cross-linking, rafts underwent congregation and formed caps, but this process was slower than TCR capping and became obvious at 20 min. EFNB1R congregation preceded raft congregation, but eventually at 20 min, EFNB1R translocated into the raft caps. Taken together, these data indicate that TCR and EFNB1R first co-cap and then both congregate to a raft cap on the cell surface after TCR-cross-linking. This provides a morphological base for EFNB1 to enhance TCR signaling, since now both TCR and EFNB1R are closely associated and located in aggregated rafts, which are scaffolds accommodating many signaling molecules. We next examined a couple of signaling molecules involved in T-cell activation. LAT is a transmembrane protein, which is phosphorylated after T-cell activation, and its phosphorylation enables it to recruit additional signaling molecules (22Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). We found that EFNB1R cross-linking resulted in augmented LAT phosphorylation in spleen T-cells over that caused by TCR cross-linking (Fig. 6A). As expected, anti-CD28 costimulation also enhanced LAT phosphorylation but with stronger strength. Total LAT protein in each treatment showed no change, suggesting that EFNB1R could enhance the LAT function. MAPK activity is modulated in other cell types when some Eph kinases are activated (22Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E.

We have studied the solution structures of the Clostridium cellulolyticum cellulosomal enzyme Cel48F in the free and complexed states with cohesins from Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum by small angle x-ray scattering in order to investigate the conformational events likely to occur upon complexation. The solution structure of the free cellulase indicates that the dockerin module is folded, whereas the linker connecting the catalytic module to the dockerin is extended and flexible. Remarkably, the docking of the different cohesins onto Cel48F leads to a pleating of the linker. The global structure determined here allowed modeling of the atomic structure of the C. cellulolyticum dockerin-cohesin interface, highlighting the local differences between both organisms responsible for the species specificity.

Cellulosomes are large (0.7-2 MDa) multiproteic complexes that efficiently degrade crystalline cellulose and related plant cell wall polysaccharides (1Bayer E.A. Bélaïch J.-P. Shoham Y. Lamed R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). They are produced by anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria, such as Clostridium cellulolyticum and Clostridium thermocellum, which are to date the best characterized. The cellulosomes enable these micro-organisms to grow on cellulose and to play a crucial role in the anaerobic recycling of carbon. The organization of these cellulolytic complexes has been investigated over the past decade and revealed very unusual and original features compared with the well known multiproteic complexes of similar mass, such as proteasomes (2Adams J. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2003; 29: 3-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) or ribosomes (3Wilson D.N. Nierhaus K.H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 3464-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Typically, clostridial cellulosomes are composed of a number of cellulases, or related enzymes, tenaciously bound to a scaffolding protein devoid of enzymatic activity (1Bayer E.A. Bélaïch J.-P. Shoham Y. Lamed R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The latter is composed of a powerful cellulose binding module (CBM), 1The abbreviations used are: CBM, cellulose binding module; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; coheCt, cohesin 2 from C. thermocellum; coheCc, cohesin 1 from C. cellulolyticum; Fc, native full-length Cel48F; Ft, Cel48F variant with dockerin domain of Cel48S from C. thermocellum; Fccoh and Ftcoh, Fc and Ft, respectively, in complex with their cognate cohesin; NMA, normal mode analysis.1The abbreviations used are: CBM, cellulose binding module; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; coheCt, cohesin 2 from C. thermocellum; coheCc, cohesin 1 from C. cellulolyticum; Fc, native full-length Cel48F; Ft, Cel48F variant with dockerin domain of Cel48S from C. thermocellum; Fccoh and Ftcoh, Fc and Ft, respectively, in complex with their cognate cohesin; NMA, normal mode analysis. which anchors the whole complex at the surface of the crystalline substrate, and generally of 3-11 “cohesin” modules that bind noncovalently to the catalytic subunits via a complementary module named “dockerin.” The cohesin/dockerin interaction is of high affinity (Ka ≥ 109m-1) and calcium-dependent (4Fierobe H.P. Pages S. Belaich A. Champ S. Lexa D. Belaich J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12822-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 5Fierobe H.P. Mechaly A. Tardif C. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several reports have shown that at least within C. cellulolyticum and C. thermocellum, the cohesins are not specialized (i.e. any enzyme dockerin can bind to any cohesin of the scaffoldin with similar affinity) (6Yaron S. Morag E. Bayer E.A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Pages S. Belaich A. Fierobe H.P. Tardif C. Gaudin C. Belaich J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, conversely to ribosomes or proteosomes, where each protein occupies a specific location in the complex, the cellulosomal enzymes are randomly incorporated into the multiprotein complex (8Perret S. Belaich A. Fierobe H.P. Belaich J.P. Tardif C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For instance more than 20 different enzymes participate in the cellulosomes produced by C. cellulolyticum (9Maamar H. Valette O. Fierobe H.P. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. Tardif C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and C. thermocellum (1Bayer E.A. Bélaïch J.-P. Shoham Y. Lamed R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), whereas their scaffoldins only contain 8 and 9 cohesins, respectively (7Pages S. Belaich A. Fierobe H.P. Tardif C. Gaudin C. Belaich J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gerngross U.T. Romaniec M.P. Kobayashi T. Huskisson N.S. Demain A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, these bacteria concurrently secrete a whole population of cellulosomes with various enzyme compositions, stoichiometries, and arrangements (8Perret S. Belaich A. Fierobe H.P. Belaich J.P. Tardif C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Maamar H. Valette O. Fierobe H.P. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. Tardif C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Nevertheless, the main paradox regarding the cellulosomes resides in their drastic enhanced catalytic efficiency, since the individual cellulosomal cellulases characterized to date display very low specific activity on crystalline cellulose. Therefore, exploring the mechanism of this synergy is a challenge for biologists. Recently, some evidence was obtained by exploiting the species specificity of the cohesin/dockerin interaction between C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum (11Pages S. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. Morag E. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Synthetic minicellulosomes were built containing two cellulases appended with either a C. thermocellum or a C. cellulolyticum dockerin bound in specific locations onto a hybrid miniscaffoldin, containing one cohesin from each species (5Fierobe H.P.

The incorporation of most tested enzyme pairs in these well defined minicellulosomes resulted in significant increase in activity toward model crystalline cellulose, such as Avicel. Analysis showed that the complexation of most cellulase pairs triggered synergies (up to 3.5-fold) between the two enzymes, whereas in the free state no or very low synergy was detected (12Fierobe H.P. Bayer E.A. Tardif C. Czjzek M. Mechaly A. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Belaich J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49621-49630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the binding to the cognate cohesin(s) induces a structural arrangement of the enzyme(s), leading to optimal activity and cooperation with the other catalytic subunits. The structural basis of this arrangement, leading to the synergistic properties observed upon binding to the cellulosome, is yet to be discovered.The structures of a number of isolated cellulosomal modules or enzymes have been solved including the CBM (13Shimon L.J.

Biol. 2000; 304: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) of the scaffoldins, produced by C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum. Recently, the crystal structure of a C. thermocellum dockerin-cohesin complex has been established (17Carvalho A.L. Dias F.M. Prates J.A. Nagy T. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Ferreira L.M. Romao M.J. Fontes C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13809-13814Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), providing precious information on the residues interacting in both modules. Nevertheless, to gain further insight into conformational events, likely to occur during the complexation of a cellulosomal enzyme with its cognate cohesin, structural studies have to be performed on an entire enzyme bound to the corresponding cohesin. So far, only truncated forms of cellulosomal enzymes lacking their dockerin domain have been successfully crystallized, and to our knowledge, crystals of entire cellulosomal enzymes bound to the corresponding cohesin have not been obtained yet, despite numerous attempts. Most probably, internal flexibility and conformational heterogeneity prevent the entire free cellulases or entire cellulases in the complexed state from crystallizing.In the present study, a different approach, using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), has been used to investigate the mechanisms of formation of these complexes by analyzing the structure of an entire cellulosomal enzyme in free and complexed states. This technique is indeed a fundamental tool for the study of biological molecules in solution. The originality of this method is that it can provide structural information on molecules exhibiting some intrinsic disorder, flexibility, or heterogeneity, which usually constitute a major obstacle for the other classical structural methods (for a review, see Ref. 18Svergun D.I. Koch M.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The probable flexibility of cellulosomal enzymes therefore incited us to resort to SAXS to elucidate their structural properties. The major cellulosomal cellulase Cel48F from C. cellulolyticum was chosen for this study, since the crystal structure of the catalytic module is available (19Parsiegla G. Juy M. Reverbel-Leroy C. Tardif C. Belaich J.P. Driguez H. Haser R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5551-5562Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have examined different variants of the cellulase by SAXS: a truncated form lacking the dockerin domain, the wild-type entire form containing the native C. cellulolyticum dockerin at the C terminus, and an engineered cellulase appended with a C. thermocellum dockerin. The two types of Cel48F appended with either a C. cellulolyticum or a C. thermocellum dockerin were also studied in complex with their respective cognate cohesins. These constructs correspond to those used in minicellulosomes (5Fierobe H.P. Mechaly A. Tardif C. Belaich A. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Belaich J.P. Bayer E.A. J. Biol.

The three-dimensional rearrangements of the domains of the cellulosomal enzymes in free and complexed states were investigated according to the low resolution models restored from SAXS data, and the dynamic properties of these enzymes were explored, using normal mode analysis. Finally, a model for the three-dimensional atomic structure of the dockerin-cohesin complex of C. cellulolyticum was constructed based on our results. The physiological implication of these outcomes for the mechanisms of cellulosome formation and of their elevated synergy is then discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProduction and Purification of Recombinant ComponentsThe construction of the plasmids pQE-Coh2 encoding cohesin 2 from C. thermocellum (coheCt), pET-coh1A encoding cohesin 1 from C. cellulolyticum (coheCc), pETFc encoding the native full-length Cel48F (Fc) from C. cellulolyticum, and pETFt encoding a modified Cel48F (Ft), in which the native dockerin domain is replaced by the dockerin domain from Cel48S of C. thermocellum, have already been described (5Fierobe H.P.

Production and two-step purification using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands), followed by chromatography on Q-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences), was performed essentially as formerly published (5Fierobe H.P.

In the case of the catalytic module of Cel48F, this was generated and purified from Fc; after the first chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, the protein sample was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 10 mg/ml and incubated at room temperature to promote the cleavage that occurs in the linker between the catalytic and the dockerin domains. Samples were periodically analyzed by SDS-PAGE to estimate the yield of the truncated form of the enzyme, and after 8 days of incubation, the proportion of truncated form was ∼80%. The sample was loaded again on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin to remove the traces of the entire form and the dockerin domain. The purification of the catalytic module was finally achieved as described above (4Fierobe H.P. Pages S. Belaich A. Champ S. Lexa D. Belaich J.P.

The concentration of the purified proteins was estimated by quantitative amino acid analysis on a Beckman 6300 system (Fullerton, CA) using ninhydrin detection.Preparation of Protein Samples for SAXSAll protein samples were prepared by dilution of the protein solutions to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml in 9.2 mm Tris-HCl, 1.84 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol. The complexes Fccoh and Ftcoh were prepared by mixing stoichiometric amounts of Fc and coheCc and of Ft and coheCt in the same buffer and at a final protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. Total complexation was checked by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a Phast system apparatus (Phast gel gradient 4-15%, Amersham Biosciences). Immediately before the measurements, the protein samples were filtered through a Millex Microfilter membrane (pore size 0.22 μm) to eliminate existing large aggregates.SAXS ExperimentsSAXS measurements of isolated Cel48F catalytic module were carried out on a Kratky compact camera (HECUS Graz x-ray Systems, Austria) according to the procedure described by Hammel et al. (20Hammel M. Kriechbaum M. Gries A. Kostner G.M. Laggner P. Prassl R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Synchrotron SAXS experiments were performed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) on beamline ID02. The wavelength λ was 1.0 Å. The sample-to-detector distances were set at 4.0 and 1.0 m, resulting in scattering vectors q ranging from 0.015 to 0.15 Å-1 and 0.03 to 0.46 Å-1, respectively. The scattering vector is defined as q = 4π/λ sin θ, where 2θ is the scattering angle. The detector was an x-ray-intensified optically coupled CCD camera, and 50 successive frames of 0.5-s exposure time (5-s interval between each frame) were recorded for each sample. To avoid radiation-induced protein damage, the enzyme solution was circulated through a quartz capillary. Each frame was carefully checked for possible bubble formation or radiation-induced aggregation. If such effects were not observed, the individual frames were averaged. Absolute calibration was made with a Lupolen sample. Background scattering was quantified before or after measurement of the protein sample and then subtracted from the protein patterns. All experiments were performed at 20 °C. The data acquired at both sample-to-detector distances of 4 and 1 m were merged for the calculations using the entire scattering spectrum.Data EvaluationThe experimental SAXS data for all samples were linear in a Guinier plot in the low q region, indicating that the proteins do not undergo any aggregation. The radius of gyration, RG, was derived by the Guinier approximation I(q)=I(0) exp(−q2RG2/3) up to qRG < 1.0. The radii of gyration, RG, calculated for different protein concentrations display no concentration dependence and indicate the absence of interaction in solution. The programs GNOM (21Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2910) Google Scholar) and GIFT (22Bergmann A. Fritz G. Glatter O. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 1212-1216Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar) were used to compute the pair-distance distribution functions P(r). This approach gives the maximum dimension of the macromolecule Dmax and offers an alternative calculation of RG, which is based on the entire scattering curve. The program CRYSOL (23Svergun D. Baraberato C. Koch M.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2723) Google Scholar) was used to calculate SAXS profiles of the atomic structures and to compare them with the experimental scattering profile. The goodness of fit for all atomic models, as well as the low resolution models, with the experimental data was determined using the discrepancy χ, defined according to Konarev et al. (24Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2301) Google Scholar).Ab Initio ModelingModeling of the Overall Shapes—The overall shapes of the entire assemblies were restored from the experimental data by two independent programs: DAMMIN (25Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar) and GASBOR (26Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). The scattering profiles were used up to qmax = 0.46 Å-1 for the fit. The DAMMIN method calculates the scattering intensities of a particle built up from a finite number of dummy beads and minimizes the surface between the particle and the solvent. GASBOR searches a chain-compatible spatial distribution of an exact number of dummy residues, which corresponds to the Cα atoms of protein amino acids. Five low resolution models obtained from different runs were averaged using the program DAMAVER (27Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1590) Google Scholar) to construct the average model representing the general structural features of all the reconstruction.Modeling of the Missing Domains and Loops—The program package CREDO (28Petoukhov M.V. Eady N.A. Brown K.A. Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3113-3125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was used for adding missing domains or loops by fixing a known structure and building the unknown regions to fit the experimental scattering data obtained from the entire particle. This program was applied to all of our data to restore the low resolution models of the dockerin and the dockerin-cohesin complex and to fit the experimental data obtained for the entire assemblies, in which the crystal structure of the catalytic module was used as the fixed starting point.Construction of Solution StructuresFree Entire Enzymes Fc and Ft—To construct the solution structure of Fc and Ft, we used the crystal structure of the catalytic module of Cel48F attached to the low resolution model of the linker/dockerin region as modeled by the program CREDO. The atomic structure of the dockerin domain was superimposed with the CREDO model. The atomic coordinates of the missing linker between the dockerin and the catalytic module of Cel48F were modeled with the program TURBO starting from the Cα trace of the CREDO model as a template for the complete final model. Finally, to attest for the reliability of our modeling approaches, the theoretical scattering profiles obtained for the final atomic models were compared with the experimental SAXS data.Overall Structure of the Entire Complexes Fccoh and Ftcoh—The atomic structures of the individual domains were positioned into the average overall shape of Fccoh and Ftcoh obtained by GASBOR using the program SUPCOMB (29Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). This arrangement was further refined and controlled using the program MASSHA (30Konarev P.V. Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 527-532Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The program package CREDO was used to model the missing fragments corresponding to the linker between the catalytic module and the dockerin, and the loops in the cohesin, absent from the crystal structure, as well as the His tag fragments. Constructions of the final atomic models and the evaluation of these constructions were done by the same procedures as for Ft and Fc.Dockerin-Cohesin Complex from C. cellulolyticum—The solution structure of the dockerin-cohesin complex from C. cellulolyticum was modeled using a three-step approach. First, the dockerin domain from C. cellulolyticum was generated with Swiss modeler (31Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9472) Google Scholar) using the dockerin domain from C. thermocellum as template. The high identity (37%) between the dockerin sequences from C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum (Fig. 1) allows the assumption that they have a highly similar structure. Then the crystal structure of the cohesin from C. cellulolyticum (16Spinelli S. Fierobe H.P. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. Henrissat B. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the dockerin atomic model were positioned into the low resolution shape. Finally, the overall arrangement of the domains has been refined by molecular dynamics using the program CHARMM (32Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13842) Google Scholar). While the cohesin of C. cellulolyticum was kept fixed, the dockerin domain was allowed to find its optimal position.Normal Mode AnalysisWe submitted the solution structures of Fc, Ft, Fccoh, and Ftcoh to the World Wide Web interface of the Elastic Network modeling (El-Némo) that provides a fast and simple tool to analyze low frequency normal modes of large protein assemblies (33Suhre K. Sanejouand Y.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W610-W614Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). To analyze the overall motion of our proteins, we examined the B-factors derived from the mean square displacements, 〈R2〉, of all atoms in the 100 lowest frequency normal modes. The B-factors are computed using the relation B=(8π2/3) 〈R2〉.To detect differences between the domains, the B-factors calculated for each protein were normalized to unity at their minimal values.RESULTSSolution Structure of the Isolated Catalytic Module of Cel48F—Initially, we measured the solution scattering profile of the isolated catalytic module of Cel48F in order to check whether there might be any difference between the conformation in solution and the crystal structure, as proposed by Parsiegla et al. (19Parsiegla G. Juy M. Reverbel-Leroy C. Tardif C. Belaich J.P. Driguez H. Haser R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5551-5562Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The experimental scattering data led to a radius of gyration of RG = 24.8 ± 0.3 Å. The distance distribution function P(r) has a bell-shaped appearance that is typical of spherical molecules, with a maximum diameter Dmax of 74 ± 2 Å (data not shown). We compared the experimental scattering profile with the calculated SAXS profile of the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank access code 1G9G). The calculated scattering profile is identical to the experimental one, fitting the data with a discrepancy χ of 1.1 and giving a theoretical radius of gyration RG = 24.7 Å similar to the experimental value (Table I). These results suggest that the overall structure of isolated catalytic module of Cel48F in solution is identical to that in the crystal structure.Table IExperimental and model SAXS parametersConstructM raPredicted from the sequence.R GbRG, RGP(r), and RGAtomic, radius of gyration given by the Guinier approximation, derived from the distance distribution function and calculated for the final atomic model using the program CRYSOL, respectively.R GP(r)bRG, RGP(r), and RGAtomic, radius of gyration given by the Guinier approximation, derived from the distance distribution function and calculated for the final atomic model using the program CRYSOL, respectively.R GAtomicbRG, RGP(r), and RGAtomic, radius of gyration given by the Guinier approximation, derived from the distance distribution function and calculated for the final atomic model using the program CRYSOL, respectively.D maxχ(Over)cχ(Over), χ(CREDO), and χ(Sol), discrepancies between the experimental SAXS profile and the fits calculated for the overall shapes-models, the fits calculated for the models restored by the program CREDO (the values given are the single fit and the average fits calculated by the program OLIGOMER), and the calculated scattering curve of the final solution structure, respectively.χ(CREDO)cχ(Over), χ(CREDO), and χ(Sol), discrepancies between the experimental SAXS profile and the fits calculated for the overall shapes-models, the fits calculated for the models restored by the program CREDO (the values given are the single fit and the average fits calculated by the program OLIGOMER), and the calculated scattering curve of the final solution structure, respectively.χ(Sol)cχ(Over), χ(CREDO), and χ(Sol), discrepancies between the experimental SAXS profile and the fits calculated for the overall shapes-models, the fits calculated for the models restored by the program CREDO (the values given are the single fit and the average fits calculated by the program OLIGOMER), and the calculated scattering curve of the final solution structure, respectively.ÅÅÅÅsingle/averageCel48F catalytic module70.824.8 ± 0.324.7 ± 0.124.774 ± 21.1Fc78.634.9 ± 0.833.4 ± 2.428.2142 ± 61.02.2/1.82.4Ft80.536.0 ± 0.936.4 ± 1.529.2147 ± 41.02.0/1.72.0Fccoh96.234.8 ± 0.635.2 ± 0.535.2122 ± 30.70.8/0.61.6Ftcoh98.537.3 ± 0.937.9 ± 1.735.8128 ± 40.71.5/1.31.7a Predicted from the sequence.b RG, RGP(r), and RGAtomic, radius of gyration given by the Guinier approximation, derived from the distance distribution function and calculated for the final atomic model using the program CRYSOL, respectively.c χ(Over), χ(CREDO), and χ(Sol), discrepancies between the experimental SAXS profile and the fits calculated for the overall shapes-models, the fits calculated for the models restored by the program CREDO (the values given are the single fit and the average fits calculated by the program OLIGOMER), and the calculated scattering curve of the final solution structure, respectively.

Maspin 1The abbreviations used are: Maspin, mammary serine proteinase inhibitor; RCL, reactive center loop; PEDF, pigment epithelium-derived factor. (mammary serine proteinase inhibitor) was first identified as a tumor suppressor protein in mammary epithelial cells (1Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J.C. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Its expression levels correlated negatively with tumor progression in cases in which the expression was highest in normal epithelial cells and absent in most mammary carcinoma cell lines (2Maass N.

Maspin was also found to have tumor suppressor activity against prostate tumor cells (4Zhang M. Magit D. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4089-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Maspin also has antiangiogenic activity that contributes to its tumor suppression ability (8Zhang M. Volpert O. Shi Y.H. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Intentional overexpression of Maspin in mammary carcinoma cell lines leads to a decreased cell motility, invasion, and metastasis (9Schaefer J.S. Zhang M. Curr. Mol. Med. 2003; 3: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Shi H.Y. Zhang W. Liang R. Abraham S. Kittrell F.S. Medina D. Zhang M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6945-6951PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of Maspin expression in prostate cancer cells is under the control the p53 tumor suppressor protein (11Zou Z. Gao C. Nagaich A.K. Connell T. Saito S. Moul J.W. Seth P. Appella E.

Maspin levels are regulated in part through epigenetic processes, indicating a role for DNA methylation in the control of cell type-specific Maspin expression (13Domann F.E. Rice J.C. Hendrix M.J.C. Futscher B.W. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Futscher B.W. Oshiro M.M. Wozniak R.J. Holtan N. Hanigan C.L. Duan H. Domann F.E. Nat.

Maspin (SERPINB5) is a member of the serpin superfamily, related to the ov-serpins, a centrally conserved clade that includes, among others, equine leukocyte inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, and ovalbumin (1Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J.C. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 16Remold-O'Donnell E. FEBS Lett. 1973; 315: 105-108Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). All true inhibitory serpins rely on an exposed reactive center loop (RCL) to inhibit their target proteinase, in which the proteinase binds and cleaves the RCL and becomes incorporated into a serpin-proteinase complex after a large scale conformational transformation (17Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G.W. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33293-33296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Maspin is an unusual serpin in that its RCL is necessary for activity, but there is no cleavage or rearrangement of the molecule (18Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30988-30993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the RCL of Maspin alone is sufficient to inhibit cell migration and induce cell adhesion (6Ngamkitidechakul C.

The RCLs of intact serpins have been observed in a variety of conformations, ranging from the “canonical” extended β-strand that is ready for recognition by its target proteinase (e.g. α1PI) (21Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 22Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to a compact, three-turn α-helix as seen in the noninhibitory serpin ovalbumin (23Stein P.E. Leslie A.G. Finch J.T. Turnell W.G. McLaughlin P.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1990; 347: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Because of the demonstrated importance of the RCL of Maspin in conferring the antitumor properties of the molecule, we determined the three-dimensional structure of Maspin and herein describe the structural relationship of its RCL to the rest of the molecule. Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Human Maspin cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Olga Volpert of Northwestern University and cloned into a pQE30 vector (Qiagen) for expression in Escherichia coli strain sg13009. Maspin with an amino-terminal His tag was overexpressed in the form of inclusion bodies at 37 °C. The cells were grown for 5 h after isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and then spun down and sonicated. The inclusion bodies were isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min, dissolved in 8 m guanidine hydrochloride, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and renatured by a 20× dilution into an ice-cold solution of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The refolded protein was dialyzed twice against 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and then concentrated and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal chelate (Qiagen) and Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column chromatography circular dichroism and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy verified that the product was Maspin, folded and uncleaved. The wild-type form of the Maspin protein had very poor solubility properties as measured by dynamic light scattering and did not show any promise in preliminary crystallization screens. Suspecting that the high cysteine content of Maspin was the cause, all eight cysteines of the molecule were changed to serine/alanine (C20S, C34A, C183S, C205S, C214S, C287S, C323S, and C373S) by site-specific mutagenesis using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene), and the cysteine-free mutant form was overexpressed and purified as before. With the protein concentration at 18 mg/ml–1, optimized sparse matrix (24Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2079) Google Scholar) crystallization trials (Screen 1, Screen 2, and polyethylene glycol/ion kits from Hampton) yielded crystals under the conditions of 45% polyethylene glycol 400 in 0.2 m sodium citrate and 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.21. Rod-shaped crystals grew to an average dimension of 50 × 50 × 500 μm within 1 week. Diffraction experiments showed that the crystals were tetragonal, of either space group P4212 or I422, with basically the same unit cell parameters of a = b = 147.0 and c = 118.0 Å. The two crystal forms were optically identical. A Matthews' coefficient (25Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar) of 3.9 Å3/kDa indicated two molecules/asymmetric unit in the primitive form and one in the body-centered form, corresponding to 68% solvent for each. The crystals diffracted very well despite their high solvent content, which can be explained by the unusual molecular packing (see below). The 45% polyethylene glycol 400 content in the Maspin crystals sufficiently protected them from ice formation during crystal cooling so that no additional cryoprotectant was necessary. Diffraction data were measured on a MAR225 charge-coupled device detector at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team synchrotron radiation source of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. A total of seven data sets were collected from seven crystals. The data were processed with the HKL2000 software (26Otwinoski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For the P4212 form, the best quality data set had an Rmerge of 8.0% for 116,205 observations of 23,502 unique reflections, 97.5% complete to 3.1 Å resolution. For the I422 form, the best set had an Rmerge of 12.1% for 62,800 observations of 11,544 unique reflections, 96.1% complete to 3.1 Å (Table I).Table IRefinement summaries for maspin at 3.1 Å resolutionCrystal formP4212I422Resolution (Å)aNumbers in parentheses represent highest resolution shell.3.1 (3.2-3.1)3.1 (3.2-3.1)Number of reflections23,50211,544Completeness (%)97.5 (95.6)96.1 (98.0)R merge8.00 (28.2)12.1 (64.4)Number of protein atoms5,9242,966Number of solvent atoms15263Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0070.008Bond angles (°)1.291.36Rcryst (%)bRcryst = Σ[|Fo| - |Fc|]/Σ|Fo |, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively, and the summations are over all unique reflections used in the refinement.19.420.0Rfree (%)cRfree is calculated as for Rcryst except the summation is over a test set of 1% of the unique reflections omitted from refinement.25.224.7a Numbers in parentheses represent highest resolution shell.b Rcryst = Σ[|Fo| - |Fc|]/Σ|Fo |, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively, and the summations are over all unique reflections used in the refinement.c Rfree is calculated as for Rcryst except the summation is over a test set of 1% of the unique reflections omitted from refinement. Open table in a new tab The Maspin structure was solved using molecular replacement. Initial phases were obtained using a model constructed from the three ov-serpin homologues: equine leukocyte inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, and ovalbumin (1HLE, 1BY7, and 1OVA, respectively) (Fig. 1). The I422 crystal form was solved and refined first because it had only one molecule/asymmetric unit and was later used to solve the P4212 crystal form. The molecular replacement and refinement calculations were carried out using crystallography NMR software (27Brünger A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Manual rebuilding was performed on an Octane workstation (Silicon Graphics) using the program QUANTA (28Inc Molecular Simulations QUANTA: Basic Operations. Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA1997Google Scholar). Statistics for the final data sets and refinements are shown in Table I. The Entire Maspin Structure Is Well Defined—The two different crystal forms of human Maspin provided three independent final models of the molecule (the P4212 crystal form had two molecules/asymmetric unit). The backbone of each model was complete (Fig. 2), containing all 375 amino acids of Maspin plus three additional residues on the amino terminus from the partially interpretable electron density of the His tags. The RCLs had interpretable density (Fig. 3), with all ϕ/φ angles in α or β geometries. Least squares α-carbon superpositions of the full-length models in all combinations yielded an average root mean square deviation of 0.37 Å, indicating that the three models were essentially equivalent at this resolution. Molecule A of the P4212 crystal form will be used as the representative model in all further discussions.Fig. 3Stereo diagram of the |Fo – Fc| omit map of residues 330–346 of the RCL of Maspin, contoured at 2σ.

Maspin, the first example of a serpin with an RCL of defined function other than proteinase inhibition, is different. The RCL of Maspin is shorter by four residues and lies closer to the serpin core of the molecule. It is positioned farther “back” than all of the other known serpin RCL structures, bent toward the amino end of s2C (Fig. 4). The RCL is held in place through a number of stabilizing bonding interactions with amino acid side chains on the surface of β-sheet C. Specifically, the Glu-335 side chain has three potential interactions: with Lys-173, the amide backbone nitrogen of Thr-203 of s3C, and Lys-268 of s2C. The side chain of residue Gln-343 extends back to bond to the Oγ of Thr-203 of s2C. There are also additional antiparallel β-sheet backbone hydrogen bonds on the P′ stem with strand s2C, starting at residue His-344. These stabilizing interactions together with the shorter length of the RCL cause the RCL of Maspin to be more rigid in position and conformation than the RCLs of inhibitory serpins. The RCL of Maspin Is Accessible—Reactive center loops can adopt a variety of conformations, ranging from the extended β-strand as seen for α1PI (21Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 22Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to α-helical as in ovalbumin (23Stein P.E. Leslie A.G. Finch J.T. Turnell W.G. McLaughlin P.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1990; 347: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The RCL of Maspin is an intermediate case, with most of the backbone in a β-strand configuration except for three residues, Pro-337, Arg-340, and Ile-341, all of which have right-handed helical conformations (Fig. 4). The half-turn helix at 340–341 affords maximum solvent exposure of the arginine and isoleucine residues. Although there was no electron density for the Arg-340 side chain past Cβ, the positions of the backbone atoms dictate that the Arg-340 side chain points away from the body of the molecule, into solution. The arginine-isoleucine pair is accessible and cleavable by trypsin and thrombin (20Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30988-30993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic Residues Are Prominent in the RCL of Maspin—As shown in Fig. 4, the exposed portion of the RCL of Maspin has a large hydrophobic content. Not only are the side chains of Ile-334, Val-336, Ile-341, and Leu-342 entirely accessible by solvent, but the hydrophobic surfaces of Pro-337 and adjacent residues are also completely exposed. As discussed below, the Maspin molecules associate intermolecularly through these hydrophobic surfaces of the RCLs. RCLs of Maspin Associate to Form Octamers—The Maspin molecules pack as octamers in the crystalline lattice, formed by dimers of tetramers, with 422 symmetry (Fig. 5A). The intermolecular contacts are predominantly from the RCLs. The side by side contacts within each tetramer depend entirely on residues Gly-331 to Glu-335 of one RCL associating with residues in the hydrophobic crevice between hH and s1B of the adjacent molecule. The strongest hydrophobic interaction is the insertion of the Ile-334 side chain into each neighboring crevice. The forces that seem to complete the tetramer formation and drive the octamer assembly are the hydrophobic associations between groups of residues Ile-341 and Leu-342 on the most exposed surfaces of the α-helical turns in the RCLs. As shown in Fig. 5B, the eight turns all face each other and form a tight hydrophobic cluster in the center of the octamer. The only other intermolecular interactions are minor salt links and hydrogen bonds between the s3C and s4C strands of molecules in the opposing tetramers (Fig. 5). The RCL of Maspin has been identified as the sole locus of activity for the induction of cell matrix adhesion and inhibition of cell invasion (6Ngamkitidechakul C. Warejcka D.J. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 267: 31796-31806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar), so it is most likely that the hydrophobic nature of the RCL is functionally important. It is unknown whether Maspin occurs as a monomer or larger oligomers in vivo. In this work, dynamic light scattering measurements showed that the cysteine-free mutant form of Maspin aggregates at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml with an estimated molecular mass of 378 kDa, approximating that of a Maspin octamer. The RCL-dependent oligomerization of Maspin characterized here could explain the polymerization phenomena observed previously by others (18Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29628-29632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Maspin Has Non-standard Hinge and Breach Regions—Inhibitory serpins undergo a large conformational change, including insertion of the RCL into the existing β-sheet A. The mechanism involves the “hinge” portion of the RCL (P15-P9) and the “breach” region, a partial separation between the parallel β-strands s3A and s5A at the top center of β-sheet A. All of the inhibitory serpins retain a consensus sequence in the hinge region that consists of a conserved serine/threonine at P14 and small volume side chains such as alanine or glycine occupying the P11-P9 sites. The hinge region (P15–P9) of Maspin differs by having a glycine at P14, and the larger volume side chains Ile, Glu, and Val in P11-P9. Furthermore, P8 is a proline. The presence of these bulky residues makes it highly unlikely that Maspin acts as a proteinase inhibitor using the standard serpin loop insertion mechanism (30Hopkins P.C.R. Whisstock J. Science. 1994; 265: 1893-1894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The structural results here affirm these interpretations. Additional evidence is that the breach region of the Maspin molecule was closed. This point of initial insertion for the RCL is always partially open in inhibitory serpins. Even in the noninhibitory serpins, ovalbumin and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), the parallel β-strand hydrogen bond pattern is disrupted in the breach region. The bonding pattern of that region is most complete in Maspin (up to the Gly-169 nitrogen to Glu-325 oxygen–hydrogen bond), consistent with the higher stability and complete absence of a loop insertion process. The RCL of Maspin Is Compatible with the Serpin Body of Ovalbumin—The evidence that the RCL of Maspin conveys the regulation of cell invasion by the molecule was obtained through chimeric RCL exchange experiments with ovalbumin (6Ngamkitidechakul C. Warejcka D.J. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 267: 31796-31806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The sections exchanged were residues 330–345 of Maspin with residues 344–361 of ovalbumin (see Fig. 1). In comparing the superimposed Maspin and ovalbumin structures, the termini of these two sections overlap almost perfectly, and even though the two RCLs are quite different in length, composition, and conformation, they are capable of sharing some of the same stabilizing interactions with side chains on β-sheet C. These fortuitous structural commonalities probably contributed to the success of the RCL exchange experiments by minimizing folding problems for the chimeras. Maspin and PEDF May Utilize Different Molecular Surfaces— Maspin and PEDF are both antiangiogenic serpins (8Zhang M. Volpert O. Shi Y.H. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 31Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). As discussed previously, the RCL of Maspin is critical for its regulation of cell matrix adhesion and tumor cell invasion (6Ngamkitidechakul C. Warejcka D.J. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 267: 31796-31806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the part of Maspin that confers its antiangiogenic activity has not yet been identified. It may not be the RCL because mutants in the RCL are still able to block angiogenesis (8Zhang M. Volpert O. Shi Y.H. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). PEDF does not require its RCL for antiangiogenesis or for any known function. The known activities of PEDFs (neurotropism, antiangiogenesis, and vascular permeability) have been ascribed to helices C and D and the surrounding area (32Alberdi E. Aymerich M.S. Becerra S.P. J.

Shroff, and O. V. Volpert, submitted for publication. Maspin and PEDF share no common solvent-accessible features in that region such as charge or functional group distribution. Thus, it is likely that the two proteins utilize different surfaces for their antiangiogenic activity. Which surfaces are employed by other antiangiogenic serpins such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (36Stefansson S. Petitclerc E. Wong M.K.K. McMahon G.A. Brooks P.C. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8135-8141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and kallistatin remains to be seen (37Miao R.Q. Agata J. Chao L. Chao J. Blood. 2002; 100: 3245-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Collagen-binding Surface of Maspin Is Structurally Ill-defined—Maspin has been shown to bind collagen types I and III (38Blacque O.E. Worrall D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10783-10788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This is thought to enhance cell adhesion in the suppression of tumor cell migration and angiogenesis. The two-hybrid studies suggest that the collagen-binding region of Maspin is located between residues Tyr-84 and Tyr-112, and this region is thought to constitute a general collagen-binding motif (38Blacque O.E. Worrall D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10783-10788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These interpretations are not supported by the structural results. The Tyr-84 to Tyr-112 sequence of the Maspin molecule is extended, defining the secondary structure component s2A-loop-hE. s2A is buried largely behind hF and its accompanying loop, and the remaining accessible surfaces of s2A and hE are not contiguous. Furthermore, the exposed surface of s2A-loop-hE does not contain the complement of acidic residues that are expected for a collagen-binding region. The largest concentrations of acidic residues in Maspin are in the approximate regions of hG and hC, but there is no well defined acidic collagen-binding motif as found in PEDF (33Simonovic M.

Conclusions and Implications—The RCL of Maspin, the primary component of the molecule responsible for its antitumor properties, assumes a fixed conformation. Its central Arg-340 residue and neighboring hydrophobic surfaces are likely to be the principal determinants of the unique activities of Maspin. The antiangiogenic surface of Maspin remains to be identified. A Maspin-based anticancer strategy might be feasible through the development of small molecule mimics of the functional groups on the RCL of Maspin and the surrounding area. We thank Dr. O.

Although the PCNA sliding clamp tethers DNA ligase I to nicked duplex DNA circles, the interaction does not enhance DNA joining. This suggests that other factors may be involved in the joining of Okazaki fragments. In this study, we describe an association between replication factor C (RFC), the clamp loader, and DNA ligase I in human cell extracts. Subsequently, we demonstrate that there is a direct physical interaction between these proteins that involves both the N- and C-terminal domains of DNA ligase I, the N terminus of the large RFC subunit p140, and the p36 and p38 subunits of RFC. Although RFC inhibited DNA joining by DNA ligase I, the addition of PCNA alleviated inhibition by RFC. Notably, the effect of PCNA on ligation was dependent on the PCNA-binding site of DNA ligase I. Together, these results provide a molecular explanation for the key in vivo role of the DNA ligase I/PCNA interaction and suggest that the joining of Okazaki fragments is coordinated by pairwise interactions among RFC, PCNA, and DNA ligase I.

Mammalian cells contain multiple species of DNA ligase that are encoded by the LIG1, LIG3, and LIG4 genes (1Tomkinson A.E. Mackey Z.B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). There is compelling evidence linking the product of the LIG1 gene, DNA ligase I, with the joining of Okazaki fragments generated during lagging strand DNA synthesis. For example, DNA ligase I co-localizes with DNA replication foci, co-purifies with a multisubunit DNA replication complex, and efficiently joins Okazaki fragments when DNA replication is reconstituted with purified replication factors (2Waga S.

Moreover, a DNA ligase I-deficient human cell line 46BR1G1 is defective in the conversion of Okazaki fragments into larger DNA replication intermediates (5Prigent C. Satoh M.S. Daly G. Barnes D.E.

The identification and characterization of a specific interaction between DNA ligase I and the homotrimeric sliding clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), 1The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FEN-1, flap endonuclease 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RFC, replication factor C. provided the first evidence physically linking DNA ligase I with a component of the DNA replication machinery (9Levin D.S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that the 20-amino acid sequence at the N terminus of DNA ligase I is necessary and sufficient to bind to PCNA and that this sequence is homologous to the canonical PCNA binding motif that has been found in a growing number of PCNA-interacting proteins (7Levin D.S.

BioEssays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Amino acid changes that inactivate the PCNA binding site of DNA ligase I prevent the recruitment of DNA ligase I to DNA replication foci and abolish the ability of this enzyme to efficiently join Okazaki fragments (7Levin D.S.

The interactions of PCNA with other DNA replication enzymes such as replication factor C (RFC), the heteropentameric clamp loader, the replicative DNA polymerases, polymerases δ and ϵ, and the 5′ flap endonuclease (FEN-1) suggest that this homotrimer plays a central role in coordinating and regulating the actions of these enzymes during gap-filling DNA synthesis and ligation (12Warbrick E.

Biochemical assays measuring DNA synthesis and ligation in reactions either reconstituted with purified replication factors or catalyzed by cell extracts have shown that the ability of DNA ligase I to bind to PCNA is critical for efficient ligation and that the extent of strand displacement DNA synthesis is limited by the functional interaction between DNA ligase I and PCNA (7Levin D.S.

Although DNA ligase I stably associates with PCNA trimers that are topologically linked to duplex DNA circles (9Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), PCNA only weakly stimulates DNA joining at very high concentrations (16Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24817-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This suggests that additional replication factors may be involved in the functional interaction between DNA ligase I and PCNA. In this study, we describe a physical interaction between DNA ligase I and the large subunit of the clamp loader RFC that is conserved among eukaryotes. Furthermore, we show that RFC modulates DNA joining by DNA ligase I in a reaction that is dependent upon the interaction between DNA ligase I and PCNA.

After collection by centrifugation, the beads were washed with binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against RFC p37 (GeneTex Inc.) and RFC p140 (a gift from Dr. Bruce Stillman). Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells (8 × 106) were lysed in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4). Approximately 1 mg of the clarified extract was used for each immunoprecipitation. The extracts were precleared by incubation for 1 h at 4°C with 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose and Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with IP buffer, prior to the addition of antibodies against DNA ligase I, RFC p37, or Cdc25 (all from GeneTex Inc.). After incubation at 4°C for 2 h, 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose and Protein G-Sepharose beads were added, and the incubation continued for 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with IP buffer lacking ethidium bromide, and then resuspended in SDS-sample buffer. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were detected by immunoblotting.

Sequences encoding residues 1–584 and 479–1148 of RFC p140 were amplified from pET16a-p140 (19Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) by the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned in frame with the GST open reading frame in the pGEX vector to generate pGST-Np140 and pGST-Cp140, respectively. Similarly, the open reading frame encoding Cdc9 DNA ligase was amplified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned in frame with the GST open reading frame in the pGSTag vector (23Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-868PubMed Google Scholar). After expression in E. coli, GST fusion proteins were purified from cell extracts by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose beads. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Coupled in vitro transcription and translation reactions were performed using the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). The plasmids for the in vitro transcription and translation of human RFC subunits have been described previously (19Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The open reading frame encoding Rfc1 was amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pET-28b for coupled in vitro transcription and translation. Labeled in vitro translated polypeptides were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (24Bardwell L. Cooper A.J. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Pull-down Assays—To prepare GST and GST-Np140, GST-Cp140, GST-N Lig 1–118, and GST-C Lig1 beads, 5 μg of each purified protein was incubated with a 20-μl slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in binding buffer for 30 min at 4 °C with constant agitation. After washing with binding buffer, the beads were resuspended in 500 μl of binding buffer containing a labeled in vitro translated polypeptide and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min with constant agitation. Next the beads were collected by centrifugation and then washed extensively in binding buffer prior to being resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After separation by SDS-PAGE, labeled polypeptides were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Biotin-labeled Linear DNA Joining Substrate—A 5′-biotinylated 90-mer oligonucleotide, Bio-5–90, with a sequence corresponding to nucleotide positions 4881 and 4971 of M13mp19 single-stranded DNA was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Bio15-1 5′-TGAGGCGGTCAGTAT-3′ and Bio15-2 5′-AAGATAAAACAGAGG-3′ (Integrated Technologies, Inc.) are complementary to Bio-5-90. Bio15-1 was 5′-end-labeled with 150 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (New England Biolabs). After purification on Micro Bio-Spin 30 column (Bio-Rad), labeled Biol5-1 and Bio15-2 were annealed to Bio-5-90 to generate a partial duplex of 30 bp containing a single ligatable nick in the middle flanked by single-stranded regions of 30 nucleotides. DNA Joining Reaction with Biotin-labeled Linear Substrate— Streptavidin-agarose beads (10 μl; Pierce) were incubated with 1.6 pmol of the biotinylated linear DNA substrate in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing three times in ligation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 100 μm ATP, and 100 mm NaCl), the beads were incubated with 2 pmol of RPA/pmol of DNA in the same buffer for 15 min at room temperature. This substrate was then incubated with 2 pmol of RFC or 2 pmol of ΔNRFC in the presence and absence of PCNA (2 pmol of trimer) at 30 °C for 2 min. DNA ligase I (2 pmol), either wild type or mutant, was added, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The beads were then spun down, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of stop mix (50% glycerol, 1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). The beads were heated at 100 °C for 3 min to denature DNA. A 2-μl aliquot was mixed with 2 μl of denaturing PAGE dye (80% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). The samples were electrophoresed through a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. After drying, the gel was exposed to a Storage Phosphor screen and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Circular DNA Joining Substrate—The oligonucleotides, 5′-CGTACGGGGAAGGACGTCAA-3′ and 5′-CATGAAACCAACATAAACGTTATTGCCCGG-3′ (100 pmol of each), were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 3.2 μm ATP and 70 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After purification from free nucleotides by passage through a 1-ml G25 spin column, both of the labeled oligonucleotides were annealed to 25 μg of circular ΦX174 single-stranded DNA by heating at 100 °C for 15 min in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 300 mm NaCl (200-μl total volume), followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The labeled partial duplex circles were purified from free oligonucleotides by passage through a 5-ml Bio-Gel A15m (Bio-Rad) column. Peak fractions were ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA, and then run on a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide to verify the presence of the substrate DNA. When annealed to their complementary sequences in ΦX174 single-stranded DNA, the oligonucleotides formed a partial duplex region containing a single ligatable nick. DNA Joining Reaction with Circular Substrate—The labeled circular DNA substrate DNA (100 fmol) was incubated with RFC (0.6 pmol) in the presence or absence of PCNA (1.2 pmol of trimer) at 30 °C for 1 min in ligation buffer. Human DNA ligase I (90 fmol), either wild type or a mutant version with a disrupted PCNA binding site (7Levin D.S. McKenna A. Motycka T. Matsumoto Y. Tomkinson A.E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), was then added. Aliquots were taken after 0, 30, 90, and 300 s and added directly to DNA termination dye. After boiling, samples were electrophoresed through a 6% denaturing acrylamide gel. Labeled oligonucleotides in the dried gel were detected and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Previously, we have shown that DNA ligase I forms a stable complex with PCNA molecules that are topologically linked to a nicked DNA circle (9Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Since this interaction did not significantly increase the efficiency of DNA joining (9Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), we suspected that additional DNA replication factors may be involved in promoting DNA joining by DNA ligase I. To identify such factors, we fractionated a HeLa nuclear extract by DNA ligase I-affinity chromatography. As reported previously, PCNA was specifically retained by the DNA ligase I resin (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 3 and 4). Analysis of the same fractions by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for the p37 subunit and p140 subunit of the clamp loader RFC revealed that these proteins were also present in the 150 mm NaCl eluates from the DNA ligase I column but not in the equivalent eluates from the BSA column (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 3 and 4). PCNA and the RFC subunits, p37 and p140, were also present in the 300 mm NaCl eluate from the DNA ligase I but not from the BSA column (data not shown). Since RFC also binds to PCNA (25Zhang G. Gibbs E. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1869-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), it is possible that DNA ligase I-bound PCNA acts as a binding site for other PCNA binding proteins. However, FEN-1, another PCNA-binding replication protein (26Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), was not retained by the DNA ligase I resin (Fig. 1A), indicating that the binding of PCNA to the DNA ligase I beads does not result in the nonspecific retention of other PCNA binding proteins. To provide further evidence for the specific association between RFC and DNA ligase I in HeLa cell lysates, we performed immunoprecipitations in the presence of ethidium bromide. As shown in Fig. 1B, the DNA ligase I antibody co-immunoprecipitated the p37 subunit of RFC (Fig. 1B, lane 3), and, in reciprocal experiments, the RFC p37 antibody co-immunoprecipitated DNA ligase I (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Since RFC p37 and DNA ligase I can be co-immunoprecipitated in the presence of ethidium bromide, it appears likely that the association between these factors is mediated by protein-protein interactions. To determine whether there is a direct interaction between DNA ligase I and RFC, we performed pull-down assays with DNA ligase I affinity beads and purified recombinant human RFC (20Podust V.N. Fanning F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, lane 2). The binding of RFC to DNA ligase I- but not BSA-beads (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 3), demonstrates that there is a direct interaction between RFC and DNA ligase I. RFC is composed of a large subunit, p140 and four smaller subunits p40, p38, p37, and p36 (27Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lee S.H. Kwong A.D. Pan Z.Q. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 594-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, several different variants of RFC, in which p140 has been replaced by different polypeptides, have been described (29Bermudez V.P. Maniwa Y. Tappin I. Ozato K. Yokomori K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10237-10242Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Bermudez V.P. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11236-11241Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Since p140 is the unique component of the replicative clamp loader, we reasoned that the specific association with RFC is likely to involve an interaction with p140. To test this idea, we expressed the N-terminal domain of p140, which can be removed without loss of catalytic activity (19Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal domain of p140, which is required for complex formation with the four small subunits (19Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), as GST fusion proteins. In pull-down assays, in vitro translated DNA ligase I was specifically retained on glutathione beads liganded by the noncatalytic N-terminal domain of p140 (Fig. 3A). If the interaction between the clamp loader and the DNA ligase plays a critical role in lagging strand DNA synthesis, then it should be conserved in other eukaryotes. This prompted us to examine whether Cdc9, the S. cerevisiae DNA ligase I homolog, interacts with the large subunit of S. cerevisiae RFC, Rfc1. As shown in Fig. 3B, in vitro translated Rfc1 was specifically retained on glutathione beads liganded by GST-Cdc9, indicating that the interaction between the large subunit of the replicative clamp loader and DNA ligase is conserved in eukaryotes. Since previous studies have shown that the N-terminal 118 amino acid residues of DNA ligase I contain the binding sites for both PCNA and DNA polymerase β (11Montecucco A. Rossi R. Levin D.S. Gary R. Park M.S. Motycka T.A. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. Tomkinson A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3786-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 31Dimitriadis E.K. Prasad R. Vaske M.K. Chen L. Tomkinson A.E. Lewis M.S. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 32: 20540-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we examined whether the same region was involved in the interaction with RFC p140. As shown in Fig. 4A, this fragment did bind specifically to the N-terminal domain of RFC p140. This interaction was not disrupted by the substitution of the adjacent phenylalanine residues by alanine residues in the PCNA binding site at the N terminus of DNA ligase I (data not shown). Unexpectedly, the N-terminal domain of RFC p140 interacted more efficiently with a fragment encompassing the catalytic domain of DNA ligase I (Fig. 4A). This is the first example of a protein-protein interaction involving this region of DNA ligase I. The observation that more than one region of DNA ligase I binds to the N-terminal domain of RFC p140 prompted us to examine whether DNA ligase I also interacts with the small RFC subunits. As expected, in vitro translated RFC p140 bound specifically to both the N-terminal (Fig. 4B, lane 19) and C-terminal (Fig. 4B, lane 20) fragments of DNA ligase I expressed as GST fusion proteins. Similar, albeit weaker, interactions were observed with in vitro translated p36 (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4) and p38 (Fig. 4B, lanes 11 and 12). The results of our protein-protein interaction experiments described above, together with published studies, have identified a series of pairwise interactions among PCNA, RFC, and DNA ligase I (7Levin D.S. McKenna A. Motycka T. Matsumoto Y. Tomkinson A.E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 9Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Montecucco A. Rossi R. Levin D.S. Gary R. Park M.S. Motycka T.A. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. Tomkinson A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3786-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of RFC on DNA ligase I catalytic activity, we constructed a partial duplex linear substrate containing a single ligatable nick (Fig. 5A). Preincubation of this substrate with RFC inhibited the extent of DNA joining by about 50% (Fig. 5B). In accord with previous studies (9Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), PCNA had essentially no effect on the DNA joining activity of DNA ligase I (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, when PCNA was preincubated with RFC, the inhibitory effect of RFC on DNA joining was alleviated (Fig. 5B). Since we have shown earlier that the N-terminal region of p140 is involved in the interaction with DNA ligase I (Fig. 3), we asked whether the catalytically active RFC complex containing a truncated version of p140 lacking the N-terminal region had a similar effect on DNA ligase I activity. As shown in Fig. 5C, the RFC complex containing a truncated version of p140 inhibited DNA joining by about 50%, but, as with the intact complex, this inhibition was alleviated in the presence of PCNA. Under these reaction conditions, the RFC complex containing a truncated version of p140 was still specifically retained by DNA ligase I beads (Fig. 5D), presumably because of the interactions between DNA ligase I and one or more of the small RFC subunits (Fig. 4B). The simplest explanation for the observations described above is that the ATP-dependent loading of PCNA by RFC induces the dissociation of RFC from the nicked DNA, thereby making the nick accessible for ligation. Preincubation of a circular ligatable substrate (Fig. 6A) with RFC also caused an inhibition of DNA ligase I activity (Fig. 6B). In this assay, the initial rate of DNA joining was reduced by about 4-fold, but this inhibition was alleviated by the inclusion of PCNA (Fig. 6B). However, in similar experiments with a mutant variant of DNA ligase I in which the PCNA binding site had been inactivated (7Levin D.S. McKenna A. Motycka T. Matsumoto Y. Tomkinson A.E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), preincubation of PCNA with RFC did not alleviate the inhibitory effect of RFC (Fig. 6C). A similar result was obtained in an assay with the linear ligatable substrate (data not shown). Thus, the ability of DNA ligase I to efficiently join DNA in the presence of RFC and PCNA is dependent upon its ability to bind to PCNA. There is substantial evidence supporting the notion that multiprotein DNA transactions such as DNA replication are coordinated by protein-protein interactions among the participating factors. Notably, PCNA, which is a homotrimeric sliding clamp, interacts with multiple DNA replication factors, indicating that it plays a central role in directing the sequential actions of these proteins (12Warbrick E. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 13Jonsson Z. Hubscher U. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have shown that the interaction between DNA ligase I and PCNA is critical for the efficient joining of Okazaki fragments and the completion of the repair of DNA lesions by long patch BER (7Levin D.S. McKenna A. Motycka T. Matsumoto Y. Tomkinson A.E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 9Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Our failure to find conditions under which PCNA stimulated the catalytic activity of DNA ligase I (9Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) prompted us to look for additional protein factors that may contribute to DNA joining events involving DNA ligase I and PCNA. In this study, we describe a direct interaction between DNA ligase I and RFC, the clamp loader. Unlike PCNA binding, which is dependent on a 20-amino acid sequence at the N terminus of DNA ligase I (11Montecucco A. Rossi R. Levin D.S. Gary R. Park M.S. Motycka T.A. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. Tomkinson A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3786-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the interaction with RFC involves residues from both the noncatalytic N-terminal and the catalytic C-terminal domains of DNA ligase I. Moreover, DNA ligase I not only interacts with the noncatalytic N-terminal region of the large subunit of p140 but also with two of the smaller RFC subunits. Together, these results indicate that there are multiple sites of contact between DNA ligase I and RFC. Previously, we had shown that PCNA tethered DNA ligase I to a nicked circular DNA duplex but did not stimulate ligation (9Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This suggested that the free-sliding DNA ligase I-PCNA complex required an additional factor(s) to position it at a nick. In this regard, it is intriguing that RFC binds to the 3′-hydroxyl termini of primer-template junctions (27Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and so could potentially recruit DNA ligase I to nicks. However, the recent structures of prokaryotic and eukaryotic RFC complexes determined by electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography suggest that the binding of RFC would prevent DNA ligase I from gaining access to the nick (32Miyata T. Oyama Y. Mayanagi K. Ishino S. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Nat. Struct. Cell Biol. 2004; 11: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2004; 429: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Consistent with this prediction and a previous biochemical study (2Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), RFC inhibited joining by DNA ligase I. This inhibitory effect was alleviated when PCNA was included in the reaction, but only when DNA ligase I had a functional PCNA binding site. Thus, it appears that the pairwise interactions among RFC, PCNA, and DNA ligase I coordinate the joining step that links Okazaki fragments and completes certain DNA excision repair pathways. The conservation of the interaction between the functionally homologous S. cerevisiae proteins supports the notion that the interaction between the replicative DNA ligase and the replicative clamp loader is functionally and biologically significant. Although PCNA is a ring-shaped molecule, the two faces of the ring are not equivalent. RFC loads PCNA onto DNA in a particular orientation and all of the replication proteins appear to bind to the same face of the PCNA ring (12Warbrick E. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 13Jonsson Z. Hubscher U. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Since PCNA is a homotrimer, it is possible that up to three replication factors can bind to the same PCNA trimer. Alternatively, the factors may bind sequentially with the DNA structure presumably dictating their sequential action. Only 1 molecule of DNA ligase I was bound per PCNA trimer topologically linked to DNA (9Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have been unable to detect formation of a ternary complex of PCNA, DNA ligase I and FEN-1, 2J. Varkey and A. E. Tomkinson, unpublished results. suggesting that the binding of one molecule of DNA ligase I to a PCNA trimer occludes the other binding sites and that the binding of DNA ligase I and FEN-1 to a PCNA trimer are mutually exclusive. In Okazaki fragment maturation, the removal of flaps by FEN-1 linked to PCNA generates the nicked DNA substrate for DNA ligase I. We propose that flap removal is the signal for the dissociation of the FEN-1-PCNA complex. Since PCNA is then free to slide away from the nick, we suggest that RFC acts to maintain PCNA at the nick site by binding to both the nick and PCNA. It should be noted that, based on the structure of yeast RFC (33Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2004; 429: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), it appears likely that the interaction of RFC with a 3′-OH terminus will differ, depending on whether or not there is an adjacent strand. Since there are pairwise interactions among PCNA, RFC, and DNA ligase I, we suggest that DNA ligase I initially interacts with a ternary complex of RFC and PCNA bound at a DNA nick via its interaction with the N-terminal region of the large subunit of RFC. This protein-protein interaction may induce a conformational change in RFC, enabling DNA ligase I to contact the PCNA ring and catalyze DNA ligation. Finally, we speculate that nick ligation is the signal for RFC to unload PCNA and for the dissociation of the ternary complex containing DNA ligase I, PCNA, and RFC. In summary, we have identified a conserved interaction between the replicative clamp loader and the replicative DNA ligase. Moreover, we have shown that the interaction between DNA ligase I and PCNA is required for PCNA to overcome the inhibitory effect of RFC on DNA ligation, suggesting that pair-wise physical and functional interactions among RFC, PCNA, and DNA ligase I coordinate the DNA joining step that links adjacent Okazaki fragments. Further studies are needed to delineate the functional significance of the protein-protein interaction between RFC and DNA ligase I and the molecular mechanisms involved in this key reaction in lagging strand DNA synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2025739925,"Jade-1 was identified as a protein partner of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor pVHL. The interaction of Jade-1 and pVHL correlates with renal cancer risk. We have investigated the molecular function of Jade-1. Jade-1 has two zinc finger motifs called plant homeodomains (PHD). A line of evidence suggests that the PHD finger functions in chromatin remodeling and protein-protein interactions. We determined the cellular localization of Jade-1 and examined whether Jade-1 might have transcriptional and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) functions. Biochemical cell fractionation studies as well as confocal images of cells immunostained with a specific Jade-1 antibody revealed that endogenous Jade-1 is localized predominantly in the cell nucleus. Tethering of Gal4-Jade-1 fusion protein to Gal4-responsive promoters in co-transfection experiments activated transcription 5-6-fold, indicating that Jade-1 is a possible transcriptional activator. It was remarkable that overexpression of Jade-1 in cultured cells specifically increased levels of endogenous acetylated histone H4, but not histone H3, strongly suggesting that Jade-1 associates with HAT activity specific for histone H4. Deletion of the two PHD fingers completely abolished Jade-1 transcriptional and HAT activities, indicating that these domains are indispensable for Jade-1 nuclear functions. In addition, we demonstrated that TIP60, a known HAT with histone H4/H2A specificity, physically associates with Jade-1 and is able to augment Jade-1 HAT function in live cells, strongly suggesting that TIP60 might mediate Jade-1 HAT activity. Thus, Jade-1 is a novel candidate transcriptional co-activator associated with HAT activity and may play a key role in the pathogenesis of renal cancer and von Hippel-Lindau disease."

https://openalex.org/W2035862085,"LdNT2 is a member of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family, which possesses several conserved residues located mainly within transmembrane domains. One of these residues, Asp389 within LdNT2, was shown previously to be critical for transporter function without affecting ligand affinity or plasma membrane targeting. To further delineate the role of Asp389 in LdNT2 function, second-site suppressors of the ldnt2-D389N null mutation were selected in yeast deficient in purine nucleoside transport and incapable of purine biosynthesis. A library of random mutants within the ldnt2-D389N background was screened in yeast for restoration of growth on inosine. Twelve different clones were obtained, each containing secondary mutations enabling inosine transport. One mutation, N175I, occurred in four clones and conferred augmented inosine transport capability compared with LdNT2 in yeast. N175I was subsequently introduced into an ldnt2-D389N construct tagged with green fluorescent protein and transfected into a Δldnt1/Δldnt2 Leishmania donovani knockout. GFP-N175I/D389N significantly suppressed the D389N phenotype and targeted properly to the plasma membrane and flagellum. Most interestingly, N175I increased the inosine Km by 10-fold within the D389N background relative to wild type GFP-LdNT2. Additional substitutions introduced at Asn175 established that only large, nonpolar amino acids suppressed the D389N phenotype, indicating that suppression by Asn175 has a specific size and charge requirement. Because multiple suppressor mutations alleviate the constraint imparted by the D389N mutation, these data suggest that Asp389 is a conformationally sensitive residue. To impart spatial information to the clustering of second-site mutations, a three-dimensional model was constructed based upon members of the major facilitator superfamily using threading analysis. The model indicates that Asn175 and Asp389 lie in close proximity and that the second-site suppressor mutations cluster to one region of the transporter. LdNT2 is a member of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family, which possesses several conserved residues located mainly within transmembrane domains. One of these residues, Asp389 within LdNT2, was shown previously to be critical for transporter function without affecting ligand affinity or plasma membrane targeting. To further delineate the role of Asp389 in LdNT2 function, second-site suppressors of the ldnt2-D389N null mutation were selected in yeast deficient in purine nucleoside transport and incapable of purine biosynthesis. A library of random mutants within the ldnt2-D389N background was screened in yeast for restoration of growth on inosine. Twelve different clones were obtained, each containing secondary mutations enabling inosine transport. One mutation, N175I, occurred in four clones and conferred augmented inosine transport capability compared with LdNT2 in yeast. N175I was subsequently introduced into an ldnt2-D389N construct tagged with green fluorescent protein and transfected into a Δldnt1/Δldnt2 Leishmania donovani knockout. GFP-N175I/D389N significantly suppressed the D389N phenotype and targeted properly to the plasma membrane and flagellum. Most interestingly, N175I increased the inosine Km by 10-fold within the D389N background relative to wild type GFP-LdNT2. Additional substitutions introduced at Asn175 established that only large, nonpolar amino acids suppressed the D389N phenotype, indicating that suppression by Asn175 has a specific size and charge requirement. Because multiple suppressor mutations alleviate the constraint imparted by the D389N mutation, these data suggest that Asp389 is a conformationally sensitive residue. To impart spatial information to the clustering of second-site mutations, a three-dimensional model was constructed based upon members of the major facilitator superfamily using threading analysis. The model indicates that Asn175 and Asp389 lie in close proximity and that the second-site suppressor mutations cluster to one region of the transporter. Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis, a disease that is invariably fatal if untreated. The genus is digenetic, existing as the extracellular promastigote in the phlebotomine sandfly vector and as the intracellular amastigote within the phagolysosome of macrophages in the infected mammalian host. The current arsenal of drugs employed to treat leishmaniasis is far from ideal, and drug efficacy is compromised by both toxicity and therapeutic failure. The need for additional drugs is therefore acute. Rational approaches to drug development dictate exploitation of novel targets within the parasite. Perhaps the most striking metabolic disparity between protozoan parasites and their mammalian hosts is the inability of the former to synthesize purine nucleotides de novo (1Carter N.S. Rager N. Ullman B. Marr J.J. Nilsen T.W. Komuniecki R.W. Molecular Medical Parasitology. Academic Press, San Diego2003: 197-223Google Scholar). Thus, purine acquisition from the host is an indispensable nutritional function for all protozoan parasites, and many unique purine salvage enzymes have been identified and characterized (1Carter N.S. Rager N. Ullman B. Marr J.J. Nilsen T.W. Komuniecki R.W. Molecular Medical Parasitology. Academic Press, San Diego2003: 197-223Google Scholar). The initial component of purine uptake involves the translocation of purines into the parasite, a process that is mediated by nucleoside and nucleobase transporters. Nucleoside permeation into L. donovani is mediated by two high affinity transporters with nonoverlapping ligand specificity, LdNT1 and LdNT2, both of which are members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) 1The abbreviations used are: ENT, equilibrative nucleoside transporter; TM, transmembrane domain; hENT1, human ENT1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MIT, myo-inositol transporter; MFS, major facilitator superfamily. family. LdNT1 transports adenosine and pyrimidine nucleosides, whereas LdNT2 is selective for inosine and guanosine (2Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Sanchez M. Vasudevan G. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20935-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Essentially nothing is known about the permeation mechanism of the ENTs, and only a few amino acids that govern ligand recognition have been identified. Conserved Gly residues within transmembrane domains (TM) 4 and 5 of human ENT1 (hENT1) and TM5 of LdNT1 have been shown to be critical for transport function and ligand selectivity (4Vasudevan G. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6092-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5SenGupta D.J. Lum P.Y. Lai Y. Shubochkina E. Bakken A.H. Schneider G. Unadkat J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1512-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and a Leu within TM2 of hENT1 has also been revealed as a ligand specificity determinant (6Endres C.J. Sengupta D.J. Unadkat J.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Additional studies have supported a role for TMs 3–6 (7Sundaram M. Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Griffiths M. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21519-21525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and Met33 within TM1 of hENT1 in the binding of dipyridamole and dilazep (8Visser F. Vickers M.F. Ng A.M. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Dipyridamole and dilazep are potent inhibitors of hENT1 but do not significantly affect the majority of parasite nucleoside transporters (9Baldwin S.A. Beal P.R. Yao S.Y. King A.E. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Multisequence alignments of ENT family members reveal a number of conserved or “signature” residues, located predominantly in predicted TMs (10Carter N.S. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 142-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The most striking among these signatures are two charged residues, an Asp and an Arg, that are located within TM8. The evolutionary conservation of these charged residues within a TM implies their significance in transporter structure or function. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that although Asp389 mutants of LdNT2 are produced and localize normally to the cell surface, they are severely compromised in function. Thus, Asp389 is essential for both inosine and guanosine permeation supporting a functional role of this residue in nucleoside translocation (11Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To elucidate further the role of Asp389 in the translocation mechanism of LdNT2, a screen for second-site suppressors was implemented using the nonfunctional ldnt2-D389N mutant. The screen was performed with ade2 Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are mutationally deficient in purine biosynthesis and naturally incapable of purine nucleoside transport, although they maintain the capacity to transport purine nucleobases and can therefore survive with exogenous adenine (6Endres C.J. Sengupta D.J. Unadkat J.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A number of second-site suppressor mutations were identified. However, one mutation, N175I, occurred with considerable frequency and was subsequently shown to significantly suppress the D389N phenotype in yeast and Leishmania. The distribution of mutations throughout the TMs 1–8 underscores the premise that Asp389 is a conformationally sensitive residue, because diverse mutations suppress the D389N null phenotype. Finally, a tertiary topology prediction of LdNT2 is presented, a model that is supported by previously reported biochemical and genetic data. This model indicates that the second-site suppressor mutations cluster in one region of the transporter and, perhaps most significantly, that Asn175 and Asp389 are located proximal to each other. Strains and Culture Methods—The S. cerevisiae strain YPH499 (Mata ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2Δ1) was constructed by Sikorski and Hieter (12Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rich (YPD) and minimal (SC) medium plates were prepared as described, and standard methods were used for genetic manipulation of yeast (13Guthrie C.F. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1991Google Scholar). All Escherichia coli transformations were performed in the DH5α strain (Invitrogen) by using usual methodologies (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). L. donovani promastigotes were cultured at 26 °C in DME-L medium (Invitrogen) as described (15Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The construction and phenotypic characterization of the Δldnt1/Δldnt2 L. donovani null mutant in which both copies of LdNT1 and LdNT2 were eliminated by targeted gene replacement followed by loss-of-heterozygosity will be described elsewhere. The Δldnt1/Δldnt2 strain was cultured continuously in 50 μg/ml hygromycin (Roche Applied Science) and 50 μg/ml phleomycin (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL) for which the selective markers hygromycin phosphotransferase and phleomycin-binding protein, used in the gene replacement strategy, confer resistance. Cell lines generated by transfection of Δldnt1/Δldnt2 with pXG-GFP+2′ (16Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) were selected and maintained in 25 μg/ml geneticin (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) as well as 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 50 μg/ml phleomycin. Generation of pRS424-Cu-ldnt2-D389N for the Second-site Suppressor Screen—LdNT2 was subcloned into the pRS424-Cu yeast-E. coli shuttle vector (17Labbe S. Thiele D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 306: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This vector contains the TRP1 gene for selection in yeast, an ampicillin resistance gene for selection in E. coli, and a polylinker flanked by the CUP1 copper-inducible promoter and CYC1 transcriptional terminator. LdNT2 was amplified by PCR using primers that introduced a BamHI site immediately upstream of the translational start site, a His6 tag immediately downstream of the translational start site, and an EcoRI site downstream of the stop codon. The PCR product was then ligated into the pCR2.1-TOPO® pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). LdNT2 was subsequently excised with BamHI/EcoRI from the pCRII-TOPO construct and subcloned into pRS424-Cu to generate pRS424-Cu-LdNT2. The D389N mutation was introduced into the pRS424-Cu-LdNT2 construct by site-directed mutagenesis to generate pRS424-Cu-ldnt2-D389N using the QuikChange® (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) protocol (11Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mutagenic Library Construction for Second-site Suppressor Screen—A library of mutant ldnt2 constructs within pRS424-Cu-ldnt2- D389N was prepared by mutagenic PCR of pXG-GFP+2′-ldnt2-D389N (11Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), followed by in vivo reconstitution of the yeast expression vector encompassing the PCR amplicons in the YPH499 strain (18Colon M. Walworth N.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 241: 175-187PubMed Google Scholar). The open reading frame of ldnt2-D389N was amplified from pXG-GFP+2′-ldnt2-D389N, a leishmanial expression construct, to provide a PCR template devoid of yeast sequences. Mutagenic PCR was conducted using the Diversify PCR random mutagenesis kit (BD Biosciences) and pXG-GFP+2′-ldnt2-D389N as template under conditions that were expected to produce ∼2.0 base changes per open reading frame. Two independent PCRs were pooled, fractionated on agarose gel, and the PCR amplicons isolated. To construct the mutagenic library in the yeast shuttle vector, two unique restriction sites were engineered into pRS424-Cu-ldnt2-D389N. Silent mutations were introduced at Pro16 and Trp17 to generate an NcoI site and Arg470 and Ser471 to generate a BglII site. The engineered construct was subsequently digested with NcoI and BglII, and the resulting linearized DNA, designated pRS424-Cu-ldnt2-D389NΔ1200 bp, containing only 45 bp of 5′ and 60 bp of 3′ LdNT2 coding sequence, was gel-purified. DNA isolation was performed with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and the concentration of DNA was determined on a DU® series 640 Spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments, Seattle, WA). Second-site Suppressor Screen in Yeast—To screen the library of random mutants by in vivo recombination in yeast, YPH499 cells were transformed with 0.25–1.0 μg of the PCR-mutagenized pXG-GFP+2′-ldnt2-D389N and 1 μg RS424-Cu-ldnt2-D389NΔ1200 bp using the TRAFO method (19Yang B.C. Kuo T.T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Transformants were plated on SC trp- ade- + 100 μm inosine + 100 μm CuSO4 media. An aliquot of cells was plated on SC trp- to allow quantitation of the transformation efficiency. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days and colonies capable of growing in inosine were isolated. Colonies were restreaked on SC trp- ade- + 100 μm inosine + 100 μm CuSO4 media to verify the phenotype. Confirmation and Sequencing of Candidate Plasmids—Plasmids containing mutant ldnt2 genes were recovered from yeast colonies that grew on SC trp- + 100 μm inosine + 100 μm CuSO4 plates by the smash and grab method (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The recovered DNA was electroporated into ElectroMAX™ DH5α-E™ cells (Invitrogen) in 0.2-cm cuvettes with a Gene Pulser™ (Bio-Rad) with electroporation parameters of 1.8 kV, 25 microfarads, and 200 ohms. The amplified plasmids in E. coli were harvested and retransformed into YPH499 cells using the lithium acetate method. Transformants were plated on SC ade- trp- plates containing 100 μm inosine and 100 μm CuSO4 to confirm the contribution of the plasmid to the transport phenotype. The plasmids were sequenced in both directions at the Vollum Institute sequencing core facility at the Oregon Health and Science University. All transport data reported in yeast were obtained with retransformed strains. Transport Capabilities of the Second-site Suppressor Clones—Nucleoside transport measurements in yeast were performed by a previously described oil-stop method with some modifications (20Aronow B. Kaur K. McCartan K. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). YPH499 transformants were grown overnight in SC trp- media after which they were diluted to an absorbance at 600 nm (A600) of 0.25 per ml. CuSO4 to a concentration of 100 μm was added to induce transporter expression, and cells were grown to mid-log phase (A600 ∼1). For each time point, 5.0 ml of culture at an A600 ∼1 were sedimented by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 μl of yeast nitrogen base supplemented with 0.5% glucose. Transport capability was then assessed at 10 μm [3H]inosine (0.2 Ci/mmol) (Moravek Biochemicals, Inc., Brea, CA). Nucleoside transport measurements in L. donovani promastigotes were performed by the oil-stop method described previously (20Aronow B. Kaur K. McCartan K. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Transport was measured using 10 μm [3H]inosine (0.2 Ci/mmol) and 10 μm [3H]guanosine (0.15 Ci/mmol), and kinetic data were obtained by measuring rates of inosine transport at concentrations between 0.2 and 15 μm for the N175I mutant and 1 and 50 μm for the N175I/D389N mutant. [3H]Inosine (19.5 Ci/mmol) and [3H]guanosine (15 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. Transport rates were calculated by linear regression analysis and kinetic parameters determined by the method of Hanes (21Hanes C.S. Biochem. J. 1932; 26: 1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of Site-directed Mutations into ldnt2—Mutations within LdNT2 and D389N-ldnt2 were introduced by the QuikChange® method described above. Mutations were inserted within the LdNT2 open reading frame in the previously described pXG-GFP+2′-LdNT2 vector (11Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, and the wild type and mutant constructs were then transfected into the Δldnt1/Δldnt2 cell line using standard electroporation parameters (22Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Integral Membrane Protein Preparations—Crude membrane fractions were prepared as reported previously (11Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The pattern of expression of mutant ldnt2 proteins in L. donovani was determined by immunoblotting (11Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cell Surface Labeling—Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described (11Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), with the exception that the beads were ImmunoPure® immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce). For analysis, all samples were fractionated on 10% SDS gel by electrophoresis, and biotinylated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged LdNT2 protein was detected by immunoblotting using mouse anti-GFP (living colors A.V. monoclonal JL-8, BD Biosciences) as reported (11Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine the relative amount of GFP-tagged LdNT2/ldnt2 at the cell surface, the immunoblots were scanned by using an Epson Perfection 3200 Photo Scanner (Epson America, Inc., Long Beach, CA), and the intensity of each band corresponding to GFP-tagged transporter was assessed by the UNSCAN-IT gel™ version 4.3 (Silk Scientific, Inc., Orem, UT). The percentage of relative cell surface expression for each mutant GFP-tagged ldnt2 transporter to wild type GFP-tagged LdNT2 was determined as described (11Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Equal loading in each lane was ensured using polyclonal antisera to the leishmanial myo-inositol transporter (MIT) (11Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Drew M.E. Langford C.K. Klamo E.M. Russell D.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5508-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MIT antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Scott M. Landfear of the Oregon Health and Science University. Fluorescence Microscopy—Leishmania cells expressing transporter tagged with GFP were prepared and affixed to slides for microscopy by a method related previously (11Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope, and deconvolution was carried out using Axiovision 3.1 software (Carl Zeiss Optical, Chesterfield, VA). Threading Analyses and Tertiary Topology Prediction—Initially, the LdNT2 amino acid sequence (2Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Sanchez M. Vasudevan G. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20935-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was submitted to PSI-BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) to identify other related sequences. The top 48 hits from the PSI-BLAST query of LdNT2, all of which were ENT family members, were incorporated into a text file and submitted to ModWeb (alto.compbio.ucsf.edu/modweb-cgi/main.cgi), a web-adapted version of the MODELLER software developed for protein modeling by Sali and Blundell (24Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) and available as freeware through the University of California, San Francisco. In addition, the LdNT2 sequence was also submitted to the web-based programs mGenThreader (bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/) and 3DPSSM (www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~3dpssm/). The mGenThreader, 3DPSSM, and ModWeb programs each generated a consensus secondary structure profile of the ENT family, and this profile was used by these programs to screen the available protein data bases in order to identify proteins whose three-dimensional structures have been determined and that best fit the predicted secondary structure profile. Each program then threads the consensus secondary structure profile onto the three-dimensional structure of the proteins that best fit the predicted consensus secondary structure for the ENT family. Isolation of Suppressor Mutants—Previous data have shown that the D389N mutation in LdNT2 abolishes both inosine and guanosine transport in parasites and imply that this residue is part of a generalized ENT translocation mechanism (11Arastu-Kapur S. Ford E. Ullman B. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33327-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To examine further the role of Asp389 in LdNT2 function, a screen for second-site suppressor mutations was developed for ldnt2-D389N. This screen was implemented in the YPH499 strain of S. cerevisiae, which is incapable of both purine biosynthesis and purine nucleoside transport. In initial experiments, YPH499 cells transformed with pRS424-Cu-LdNT2 were shown to be capable of forming colonies on plates containing 100 μm inosine as the sole purine source, whereas YPH499 cells transformed with pRS424-Cu-ldnt2-D389N did not grow even after 7 days of incubation (data not shown). A library of random mutants within ldnt2-D389N was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and a total of 5 × 105 transformants was screened for growth on inosine. A total of 24 colonies were obtained after 5 days on inosine plates; however, plasmids from only 16 clones restored the ability of growth on inosine following retransformation in YPH499 cells. Sequence of the Second-site Suppressor Mutations—Sequence analysis of the 16 clones revealed that two had reverted back to Asp389 from the D389N mutation, and three were identical, each containing a single N175I second-site mutation. Of the 12 unique clones (Table I), three harbored single mutations that suppressed the D389N phenotype (S50T, Y213C, and N175I), whereas the remaining nine contained either two or three secondary mutations, as well as the starting D389N alteration. These “suppressor” mutations spanned TMs 1–8, excluding TM5 (Fig. 1 and Table I).Table ISecond-site suppressor clones of D389N-ldnt2Clone no.Mutations1N175I2N175I, I345V3N175I, L123Q4N175I, D205G, W339R5Y213C6Y213C, R393Q7D159N, I220T8P52H, I209V9V124G, I218T, W339R10N84S, I118P, F214C11S50T12I327T, G365V, M378T Open table in a new tab Transport Capability of the Second-site Suppressor Clones—To verify the transport phenotype of each positive clone that grew on inosine, transport measurements were conducted at 10 μm [3H]inosine (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, all 12 clones that suppressed the D389N growth phenotype were capable of transporting inosine, and 6 (shaded gray in Fig. 2) exhibited a transport capacity significantly greater than YPH499 cells transformed with wild type LdNT2. Because of the frequency of N175I within the 12 clones and the robust transport capacity that it conferred to the transformants, it was chosen for further investigation. Creation and Evaluation of ldnt2 Mutants in Leishmania—To ensure that the suppression of the D389N mutation could be reproduced in other expression systems, the N175I mutation was inserted into both pXG-GFP2′+-ldnt2-D389N and pXG-GFP2+′-LdNT2, and the resulting constructs were transfected into nucleoside transport-deficient Δldnt1/Δldnt2 L. donovani. These lines were designated Δldnt1/Δldnt2[GFP-N175I/D389N] and Δldnt1/Δldnt2[GFP-N175I]. Δldnt1/Δldnt2-[GFP-LdNT2] and Δldnt1/Δldnt2[GFP-D389N] were also generated as positive and negative controls, respectively. To verify the function of the selected second-site suppressor mutations in intact parasites, each transfectant was evaluated for both [3H]inosine and [3H]guanosine transport at a concentration of 10 μm, a ligand concentration determined previously to be saturating for LdNT2 transport (2Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Sanchez M. Vasudevan G. Landfear S.M. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20935-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Whereas the Δldnt1/Δldnt2[GFP-N175I/D389N] and Δldnt1/Δldnt2[GFP-N175I] cells incorporated inosine and guanosine at levels comparable with the wild type Δldnt1/Δldnt2[GFP-LdNT2] transfectant, as expected, the Δldnt1/Δldnt2[GFP-D389N] line did not take up nucleosides (Fig. 3). Kinetics of the Asn175 Mutants—To determine whether the mutation at Asn175 affected the kinetic parameters of ldnt2, the rates of inosine transport were measured in the Δldnt1/Δldnt2[GFP-N175I] and Δldnt1/Δldnt2[GFP-N175I/D389N] transformants at a range of ligand concentrations.

It can be mediated by the up-regulated expression of different proteins within the tumor cell membrane. Here, we used murine multidrug resistance-1 (MDR-1) as a target-antigen for the immunotherapy of cancer. We successfully demonstrated that peripheral T cell tolerance can be broken by oral administration of a DNA vaccine encoding MDR-1 and carried by attenuated Salmonella typhimurium to secondary lymphoid organs. Thus, mice, immunized orally three times at 2-wk intervals and challenged 2 wk thereafter with either MDR-1 expressing CT-26 colon carcinoma cells or MDR-1 expressing Lewis lung carcinoma cells, revealed a significant increase in life span. This was evident, when compared with animals either vaccinated with the empty control vector or challenged with the parental cell lines lacking overexpression of MDR-1. The immune response induced was antigen-specific and CD8+ T cell-mediated. The presence of the target antigen led to up-regulation of activation markers on CD8+ T cells and resulted in a strong cytotoxic T cell response as well as lysis of tumor target cells in vitro. We furthermore established the vaccine to be an effective treatment for established multi-drug-resistant tumor metastases, resulting in a significantly increased life span of experimental animals. Absence of CD8+ T cells due to in vivo depletion led to abrogation of effectiveness. Taken together, our results demonstrate that T cell tolerance against the MDR-1 self-antigen can be broken. It is anticipated that the combination of such an approach with chemotherapy could lead to more effective treatments of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2112625700,"Copper is an essential cellular cofactor that becomes toxic at high levels. Copper homeostasis is tightly regulated by opposing mechanisms that control copper import, export, and copper binding capacity within the cell. High levels of copper induce the expression of metallothioneins, small sulfhydryl-rich proteins with high metal binding capabilities that serve as neutralizers of toxic levels of metals. In yeast, the CUP1 gene encodes a copper metallothionein that is strongly induced in response to metals and other stress and is subsequently rapidly down-regulated. Activation of CUP1 is mediated by the copper-responsive transcriptional activator AceI, and also requires the histone acetylase Spt10 for full induction. We have examined the role of histone H2A in the normal regulation of the CUP1 gene. We have shown that specific H2A mutations in combination with spt10 deletions result in aberrant regulation of CUP1 expression. Certain lysine mutations in H2A alleviate the transcriptional defect in spt10Δ strains, though CUP1 activation is still delayed in these mutants; however, CUP1 shutdown is normal. In contrast, serine mutations in H2A prevent CUP1 shutdown when combined with spt10 deletions. In addition, swi/snf mutants exhibit both impaired CUP1 induction and failure to shut down CUP1 normally. Finally, different Spt10-dependent histone acetylation events correlate with induction and shutdown. Taken together, these data indicate that CUP1 transcriptional shutdown, like induction, is an active process controlled by the chromatin structure of the gene.

These results provide new insights for the role of chromatin structure in metal homeostasis. All cells must be capable of responding rapidly and specifically to a variety of external stressors, such as sudden changes in temperature, oxygen starvation, DNA-damaging agents, or heavy metals. Metals such as copper, iron, and zinc are essential in enzyme catalysis, protein structure, and respiration. However, these key elements become toxic at high levels. Metal ion homeostasis is tightly controlled, with excess ions exported or sequestered while maintaining sufficient cellular stores to satisfy the cofactor requirements of essential enzymes. Much of this regulation occurs at the level of transcription. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful model for understanding cellular mechanisms of metal ion homeostasis (1Rutherford J.C. Bird A.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 2Winge D.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 60: 51-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 3Winge D.R. Jensen L.T. Srinivasan C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All transcription occurs in the context of chromatin, a complex structure in which the DNA is wrapped around histone octamers to form nucleosomes. The nucleosome consists of approximately two turns of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. Two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 comprise the core histone octamer. Each core histone contains an N-terminal domain that extends from the surface of the octamer, histone H2A has an additional C-terminal domain. The histone tails are the targets of the majority of the known post-translational modifications of the core histones. These modifications include lysine acetylation and methylation, serine phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and ADP-ribosylation (4Vaquero A. Loyola A. Reinberg D.

Dev. 2003; 13: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Tail modifications of histones H3 and H4 have been extensively characterized and have been shown to be critical in multiple cellular processes, particularly in transcription (7Wang C. Fu M. Pestell R.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 241: 207-216PubMed Google Scholar, 8Torok M.S. Grant P.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 67: 181-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9Lo W.S. Henry K.W.

Med. 2004; 199: 1671-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and histone H2A/H2AX modifications have primarily been investigated in the process of DNA double strand break repair (14Sedelnikova O.A.

Dev. 2002; 12: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). In one case yeast H2A modification has been implicated in transcription: specific H2A modification sites are required for normal gene silencing at telomeres (16Wyatt H.R. Liaw H. Green G.R. Lustig A.J. Genetics. 2003; 164: 47-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have investigated the role of the H2A tails in the regulation of the copper-inducible CUP1 gene. The yeast CUP1 gene encodes a copper metallothionein, which is strongly and rapidly induced in the presence of copper (17Hottiger T. Furst P. Pohlig G. Heim J. Yeast. 1994; 10: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CUP1 is an excellent model for understanding the role of histone modifications in inducible gene expression. The chromatin organization of the CUP1 promoter has been extensively characterized (18Shen C.H. Clark D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35209-35216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Shen C.H. Leblanc B.P. Alfieri J.A. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 534-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the uninduced state, nucleosomes are organized into defined clusters of positions. The binding of copper to the activator Ace1p leads to its folding and subsequent binding to UASs in the CUP1 promoter. Ace1p binding results in the repositioning of nucleosomes throughout the CUP1 promoter and open reading frame, potentially via recruitment of a chromatin remodeling enzyme, leading to increased promoter accessibility. Subsequently, histones H3 and H4 are acetylated (20Krebs J.E. Fry C.J. Samuels M.L. Peterson C.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21Shen C.H. Leblanc B.P. Neal C. Akhavan R. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6406-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This acetylation is dependent on the Spt10p acetyltransferase (21Shen C.H. Leblanc B.P. Neal C. Akhavan R. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6406-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Spt10p is required for maximal levels of CUP1 induction, but CUP1 expression is not eliminated in spt10 deletion strains. One possibility is that Spt10-dependent acetylation is partially redundant with the putative remodeling activity. Alternatively, other histone modifications in addition to Spt10-dependent acetylation may be important for CUP1 activation. We have investigated the roles of the H2A tails in CUP1 regulation, and have studied the interaction between H2A and Spt10 in regulation of CUP1. We show that N- and C-terminal mutations in H2A impair CUP1 induction in response to copper. Furthermore, H2A C- and N-terminal mutations combined with spt10 deletions result in striking alterations in the kinetics of CUP1 regulation. Specific lysine, serine, and threonine mutants impair and/or delay CUP1 activation to varying degrees in spt10Δ strains. Even more strikingly, particular serine mutants prevent normal shutdown of CUP1, suggesting that an active process of autoregulation is perturbed in these strains that may depend on histone phosphorylation. Consistent with this, phosphorylation of H2A Ser-129 is detected at the CUP1 promoter coincident with down-regulation. Finally, CUP1 kinetics are similarly perturbed in a swi/snf mutant strain. Taken together, these data indicate that active chromatin modification/remodeling is involved in both the activation and autoregulation of CUP1, facilitating the dynamic control of copper homeostasis. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Knockout Constructs—Most strains used in this study are derived from FY406 (MATa, hta1-htb1::LEU2, hta2-htb2::TRP1, leu2-1, ura3-52, trp1-63, his3-200) and contain either the wild-type HTA1-HTB1 locus on a CEN-ARS plasmid (URA3, JKY28; or HIS3, JKY38), or a mutant hta1 allele + wild type HTB1 on a CEN-ARS plasmid (HIS3). The swi1Δ strain (JKY20) has the genotype MATα, swi1::LEU2, lys2-801, ade2-101, leu2-1, his3-200, ura3-99). The isogenic wild-type strain for the swi1Δ strain behaved equivalently to the FY406-derived wild-type strain; the wild-type data reported are from the FY406-derived strain. Mutant hta1 alleles were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutant hta1 alleles are exchanged for the wild-type allele by a plasmid shuffle method, in which the strain carrying the URA3-marked HTA1-HTB1 plasmid (JKY29) is transformed with the HIS3-marked plasmid containing the mutant hta1 allele. HIS+ transformants that have lost the wild-type HTA1 plasmid are selected for using medium supplemented with 5-FOA, which selects against cells expressing URA3. SPT10 was deleted directly in strains containing hta1 alleles (HIS3 marked) using a URA3 gene flanked by 50 bp of SPT10 homology. This construct was generated via PCR using the following primers to amplify URA3 from pRS406: 5′-GGATGAGTAAAAAGTGTACC GATCAAGAACAACTCTAGACCTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCG-3′ and 5′-TATTAGAATTGTGCTCTGTAAATGTATTAGATTCGTTGTTAAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCAC-3′. CUP1 Induction and Detection—To induce CUP1, yeast strains are grown to mid-log phase (OD600 of ∼0.5–0.7) in YEPD, then CuSO4 is added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells are incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times, then harvested, and total RNA is isolated using glass bead lysis. Northern blots are performed by standard methods. Signal is detected using a Cyclone Phosphorimager. All blots are simultaneously probed for ACT1 as a loading control, and data are normalized by dividing the CUP1 signal by the ACT1 signal. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 1The abbreviation used is: ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. —ChIPs were performed as described previously (22Krebs J.E. Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Peterson C.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1412-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), except that the quenching step was not included. Cross-linked, sonicated chromatin was immunoprecipitated using antibodies against either acetylated histone H3 (K9 or K14) or hyperacetylated histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnologies). Input and immunoprecipitated material was detected by slot blot. H2A Tails Are Involved in CUP1 Induction—CUP1 transcription is induced 10–20-fold within 5 min of addition of 1 mm copper. CUP1 subsequently autoregulates its own expression, and transcription levels drop to a much lower steady-state level by 30–40 min after copper exposure (23Hamer D.H. Thiele D.J. Lemontt J.E. Science. 1985; 228: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Pena M.M. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2514-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We initially measured CUP1 expression at three points: in the absence of copper, at 10 min after addition of 1 mm CuSO4, when expression is maximal for wild type, and at 30 min after addition of CuSO4, when CUP1 is down-regulated. The amount of CUP1 mRNA is detected by Northern blot and quantitated by phosphorimager. All CUP1 expression levels are normalized to expression of ACT1 as a loading control. The average normalized data for at least three independent experiments are presented in each graph, and standard errors are shown. We have analyzed CUP1 expression in strains containing a variety of alanine substitutions in the H2A C and N termini (Fig. 1). Most single mutations in the H2A C terminus have minimal effects on CUP1 induction at 10 min, though alanine substitutions at lysines 120 or 121 show a 2-fold reduction in CUP1 levels at 10 min (Fig. 1A). However, most C-terminal mutations show a reduction in levels of CUP1 at 30 min after copper addition (Fig. 1A). Because CUP1 expression changes so rapidly, we confirmed these effects by measuring CUP1 levels every 5 min in several of these strains, in case we had missed a peak of expression. Fig. 1B shows the results of the short time course for two H2A lysine mutants, htaK120A and htaK127A, compared with wild type. CUP1 induction is rapid and strong in the wild-type strain, with strong signal within 5 min of copper addition, reaching maximum induction levels by 10 min, and beginning to decrease by 25–30 min (Fig. 1B, top panel). Both htaK120A (middle panel) and htaK127A (bottom panel) exhibit similar induction kinetics compared with wild type, while showing a CUP1 induction level consistent with that shown in Fig. 1A; i.e. a 2-fold reduction in CUP1 mRNA in the htaK120A strain versus nearly wild-type levels in the htaK127A strain. We have also examined the effects of mutations in the H2A N terminus on CUP1 expression. This tail appears to play a role in CUP1 induction comparable to the C terminus, in that alanine substitutions at serine and lysine residues in the N terminus result in reduced levels of CUP1 mRNA. Induction data for two of these mutants, htaS2A and htaK5A, are shown in Fig. 1C. Both of these strains exhibit ∼40% reduction in CUP1 mRNA levels compared with wild type. Similar results are obtained for other residues in the N terminus (data not shown). These results indicate that both the N- and C-terminal tails of histone H2A are required for normal induction of CUP1. Because all of the residues chosen are sites of potential modification (lysines, serines, and threonine), an obvious question is whether specific modifications of these residues are involved in CUP1 induction. Indeed, substitution of a glutamine for the lysine at position 127 (a substitution commonly used to mimic lysine acetylation) appears to alleviate the minor CUP1 induction defect of the alanine mutation at this site (data not shown). Since it is already known that modifications of histones H3 and H4 also occur during CUP1 induction (20Krebs J.E. Fry C.J. Samuels M.L. Peterson C.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21Shen C.H. Leblanc B.P. Neal C. Akhavan R. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6406-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine whether H2A modifications do occur, and cooperate with H3/H4 modifications at CUP1. Different Histone Modifications Coincide with CUP1 Induction and Autoregulation—Previous work has shown that the Spt10 histone acetyltransferase is required for normal induction of CUP1 (21Shen C.H. Leblanc B.P. Neal C. Akhavan R. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6406-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). spt10Δ mutants exhibit delayed induction, reduced levels of CUP1 mRNA, and sensitivity to high levels of copper. These mutants also result in loss of acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at CUP1. We wished to understand the different contributions of Spt10 and H2A to CUP1 regulation. To address this, we knocked out the SPT10 gene in strains containing different mutations in H2A. In looking at genetic interactions between H2A and SPT10, it is important to note that Spt10 itself is involved in transcription of certain histone genes (25Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5223-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Hess D. Liu B. Roan N.R. Sternglanz R. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Spt10 is required for expression of the HTA2-HTB2 locus; fortunately, our mutant histones are expressed solely from HTA1 promoters, and their expression is not impacted by the deletion of SPT10. We first compared the expression of CUP1 in spt10Δ cells in the presence of wild-type H2A. Consistent with previous reports (21Shen C.H. Leblanc B.P. Neal C. Akhavan R. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6406-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we observe both delayed induction and significantly reduced levels of CUP1 mRNA in the absence of Spt10 (Fig. 2A). It has been shown that histones are acetylated at CUP1 upon exposure to copper (20Krebs J.E. Fry C.J. Samuels M.L. Peterson C.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21Shen C.H. Leblanc B.P. Neal C. Akhavan R. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6406-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and that this acetylation requires Spt10 (21Shen C.H. Leblanc B.P. Neal C. Akhavan R. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6406-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, in another study, AceI-dependent CUP1 induction resulted in no change in H3 acetylation and a decrease in H4 acetylation (27Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These differences could be attributable to different strain backgrounds used in these studies. However, another possibility is that histone modifications at CUP1 are as dynamic as CUP1 expression itself, and these different studies were measuring histone acetylation at different relative time points in the CUP1 expression cycle. We have performed ChIPs to measure the dynamics of acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in the strains shown in Fig. 2A, both to confirm Spt10-dependent acetylation in these strains, and to determine the dynamics of histone acetylation during CUP1 induction. The results of three independent ChIP experiments are shown in Fig. 2B, expressed as the level of immunoprecipitated material normalized to the input levels. These results show that Spt10-dependent H3 and H4 acetylation does occur at CUP1 in these strains. However, the kinetics of H3 and H4 acetylation are quite different in the wild-type strain. Acetylation of H3 (H3ac9/14) occurs within 10 min of copper addition, coinciding with maximum CUP1 expression, and decreases coincident with CUP1 down-regulation (Fig. 2B, top panel). The extent of H3 acetylation at 10 min is consistent with that observed at a similar time point (15 min) by Shen et al. (21Shen C.H. Leblanc B.P. Neal C. Akhavan R. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6406-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, H4 acetylation (measured at all sites, H4hyper) shows a decrease 10 min after copper addition, and a striking increase at 30 min after copper addition, when CUP1 transcription is down-regulated (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). The decrease in H4 acetylation after 10 min resembles that observed at 15 min by Deckert and Struhl (27Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These results suggest that some of the discrepancies seen in previous studies could be explained by the dynamic changes in acetylation during CUP1 expression. These results also indicate that opposing acetylation and deacetylation may be involved in both the activation and subsequent down-regulation of CUP1. If Spt10 is responsible for acetylation at both stages of CUP1 regulation, this protein may be in the unique position of mediating both induction and autoregulation of a single gene. Spt10 has been implicated in both gene activation and repression (25Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5223-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Yamashita I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Natsoulis G. Winston F. Boeke J.D.

We therefore decided to further explore the role of Spt10 in CUP1 regulation. spt10Δ-hta1 Double Mutants Alter CUP1 Expression Kinetics—The results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that both H2A and Spt10 are involved in the normal induction of CUP1. We decided to examine the effect of combining H2A mutations with spt10 deletion. We selected a number of strains containing H2A mutants in either the C or N terminus, and deleted the SPT10 gene in these strains. All of the double mutants were viable, though certain combinations (spt10Δ combined with htaS2A, htaS122A, or htaS129A) exhibit slow growth phenotypes; in these cases each of the single mutants shows moderately slow growth compared with wild type, which appears to be additive when these mutations are combined. Combining spt10Δ and H2A mutations results in surprising changes in the patterns of CUP1 expression (Fig. 3). There were changes in the maximum levels of CUP1 mRNA, and in the autoregulation of CUP1 transcription. The most striking trend is that in every case, CUP1 transcription fails to shut down at 30 min after copper addition. In several instances, CUP1 mRNA levels are still increasing at 30 min.Fig. 1Histone H2A point mutations impair CUP1 induction.

This mechanism of autoregulation predicts that CUP1 shutoff simply requires that a sufficient level of Cup1p be synthesized to compete with Ace1p for copper binding. However, several of the mutants shown in Fig. 3 clearly accumulate large amounts of CUP1 mRNA without shutting down CUP1 expression. This suggests that CUP1 autoregulation may instead be a more active process dependent on Spt10 and/or H2A. To explore this possibility, we performed more extensive analyses of the kinetics of CUP1 expression in the spt10-hta1 double mutant strains. We took samples for Northern analysis every 10 min after copper addition, for 1–2 h. The results of 1 h time course are shown in Fig. 4. Representative blots are shown on the left, and the averages of at least three independent experiments are presented in the graphs on the right. The results from the long time course confirmed that CUP1 regulation is significantly altered in these strains, and further revealed different patterns of expression in different mutants. Fig. 4A shows that significant (though not complete) CUP1 shutoff occurs with only a slight delay in the spt10Δ strain, despite the low levels of CUP1 mRNA actually produced. This is consistent with the severe sensitivity to copper exhibited by spt10Δ cells (21Shen C.H. Leblanc B.P. Neal C. Akhavan R. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6406-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), in that these cells do not appear to synthesize sufficient CUP1 mRNA for protection from the excess copper. When the spt10 deletion is combined with mutations in H2A, the delay in induction observed in spt10Δ cells is preserved; however, most of these double mutants produce wild-type levels of CUP1 mRNA. Fig. 4B shows the results for spt10Δ-htaK5A and spt10Δ-htaK127A, which combine the spt10 deletion with a lysine-to-alanine mutation in each tail of H2A. Both of these strains show a peak of CUP1 expression at 20 min, coincident with the peak of expression in the spt10Δ mutant alone. However, these strains produce wild type or nearly wild-type levels of CUP1 mRNA, and exhibit a normal pattern of autoregulation. Spt10 (presumably via Spt10-dependent histone acetylation) is required for rapid induction of CUP1 within 5–10 min of copper exposure, and this rapid response is still absent in the double mutants. However, elimination of a positive charge on either H2A tail appears to alleviate the defect in the level of CUP1 induction in spt10Δ, possibly by mimicking an acetylation event that can partially substitute for an acetylation event that has been lost. In contrast, the spt10Δ-htaT126A double mutant exhibits kinetics indistinguishable from spt10Δ alone (Fig. 4C). The nearby htaS129A mutation combined with spt10Δ, however, exhibits delayed (and incomplete) CUP1 shutoff, despite the accumulation of levels of CUP1 mRNA comparable to wild type. The most striking misregulation of CUP1 occurs in spt10Δ-htaS2A and spt10Δ-htaS122A strains, shown in Fig. 4D. These strains show delayed induction (peaking at 20–30 min), but achieve wild-type levels of induction. What is surprising about these mutants is that they completely fail to autoregulate CUP1, but rather continue to express CUP1 at close to peak levels. This level of expression continues for at least 2 h (data not shown and Fig. 5, below). These results strongly suggest that an active mechanism for CUP1 shutoff has been lost in these mutants. This regulatory mechanism is presumably not dependent on Ace1p displacement due to copper binding by Cup1p. The accumulation of CUP1 mRNA in these mutants far exceeds that of wild-type cells at the time of CUP1 shutoff in wild type; presumably a concomitant accumulation of Cup1p metallothionein also occurs. It is formally possible that translation of CUP1 mRNA is impaired in these mutants, though there is no general translational defect apparent in these mutants (with or without copper) when total proteins are run on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Cup1p protein itself is known to be quite stable, persisting well after CUP1 transcription shutdown (24Pena M.M. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2514-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). What might be the mechanism of this active shutoff? Several possibilities present themselves. A specific repressor could bind to CUP1 and displace RNA polymerase or other positive factors (besides Ace1p) required for sustained transcription. Deacetylation of Spt10-acetylated histones H3 and H4 could be required to reset the “off” state for CUP1. A chromatin remodeler could act to return the nucleosomes at CUP1 to the positions normally occupied in the uninduced state. Whatever the mechanism, it is clear that this shutoff can be mediated by Spt10 or by serines in the H2A tails; loss of either alone does not impair shutoff, but the double mutants can. Any of the activities proposed could, for example, be recruited by Spt10p and stabilized at CUP1 by binding to (phosphorylated?) serines in H2A. swi/snf Mutants Also Alter CUP1 Expression Kinetics—One explanation for the loss of autoregulation in certain spt10Δ-hta1 double mutants is that Spt10 and H2A (possibly phosphorylated H2A) are required to recruit chromatin remodeling activity to “reset” the CUP1 chromatin to the off state. To test this possibility, we measured CUP1 expression in a swi/snf mutant strain. It has been shown previously that the SWI/SNF complex is not required for histone H3 acetylation at the CUP1 promoter, and that significant CUP1 transcription is detected at 30 min after copper addition in swi2Δ cells (20Krebs J.E. Fry C.J. Samuels M.L. Peterson C.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, this earlier study did not examine the kinetics of CUP1 regulation. We have therefore extended these earlier studies to measure both the induction and autoregulation of CUP1 in a swi1Δ strain, shown in Fig. 5. Surprisingly, CUP1 expression in the swi1Δ strain reveals kinetics reminiscent of a combination of both the spt10Δ strain and the spt10Δ-htaS2A, spt10Δ-htaS122A strains (Fig. 5A; compare with Fig. 4). swi1Δ cells exhibit delayed CUP1 induction and reduced overall levels of CUP1 mRNA, similar to that seen for spt10Δ cells. However, as is the case for spt10Δ-htaS2A and spt10Δ-htaS122A strains, the swi1Δ cells also fail to shut off CUP1 transcription. This suggests two roles for SWI/SNF in CUP1 regulation. First, SWI/SNF may be involved in the initial Ace1p-dependent repositioning of nucleosomes that occurs during CUP1 induction (19Shen C.H. Leblanc B.P. Alfieri J.A. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 534-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This repositioning is independent of Spt10-dependent histone acetylation (21Shen C.H. Leblanc B.P. Neal C. Akhavan R. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6406-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); therefore, Spt10-dependent acetylation and nucleosome repositioning may be partially redundant mechanisms facilitating access to the CUP1 promoter. Loss of either mechanism delays induction and reduces transcription efficiency; we predict that loss of both mechanisms might result in failure to induce CUP1. Experiments are currently underway to test this prediction. The results shown in Fig. 5A also suggest a second role for SWI/SNF, in CUP1 shutoff. While CUP1 mRNA levels in the swi1Δ strain never achieve wild-type levels, the ongoing transcription eventually leads to combined levels of CUP1 mRNA in excess of wild type. This is even more apparent in 2-h time courses; examples of which are shown in Fig. 5B. After ∼90 min of copper exposure, wild-type cells begin to reactivate CUP1, though at less than half the level of the initial burst of CUP1 expression (Fig. 5B, top panel). This is similar to previous observations of the CUP1 response to 1 mm copper ion (24Pena M.M. Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2514-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In contrast, the swi1Δ (Fig. 5B, middle panel) and spt10Δ-htaS2A (Fig. 5B, bottom panel) strains maintain steady-state CUP1 expression at close to the maximum level achieved by the respective strains. One model to explain these results is that Spt10 is required to recruit SWI/SNF to CUP1, while interactions with H2A are required to maintain SWI/SNF at CUP1,or perhaps phosphorylation of H2A triggers the “resetting” activity needed to turn off CUP1 expression. We have shown that the normal kinetics of CUP1 induction and autoregulation depend on a complex interplay between chromatin modifying enzymes and their histone targets. We have also shown that the shutoff of CUP1 may be a more active, regulated process than was previously suspected. The fact that different mutations in chromatin modifiers (spt10Δ + hta1 alleles versus swi1Δ) result in similar alterations in shutdown kinetics argues that chromatin remodeling plays an active role in turning off CUP1 shortly after its initial activation. Shut off may normally involve the concerted action of several activities: the acetylation of histone H4 by Spt10, the deacetylation of H3, phosphorylation of H2A, and resetting of nucleosome positions by SWI/SNF. Some of these effects could be indirect; for example, SWI/SNF could be required for normal expression or recruitment of a repressor needed for CUP1 regulation. Detection of SWI/SNF at CUP1 by ChIP, and measurement of nucleosome positioning during shut off, would support a direct role for SWI/SNF remodeling. The sensitivity of yeast cells to copper toxicity varies with respect to cell cycle stage, with cells in G2/M being more sensitive to killing by copper than cells in G1/S (32Howlett N.G. Avery S.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 379-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sensitivity has been linked to variations in basal levels of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Sod1) activity throughout the cell cycle (33Sumner E.R. Avery A.M. Houghton J.E. Robins R.A. Avery S.V. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the differences in CUP1 expression observed in the present study could be that different mutants have different cell cycle rates or different distributions of cell cycle stage occupancies, resulting in differential responses to copper. By monitoring budding, we do observe that a larger percentage of logarithmically growing spt10Δ-htaS2A cells occupy G2/M compared with wild type or spt10Δ alone (∼85% versus ∼40–60%). Because this is the most copper-sensitive stage of the cell cycle, this suggests that 1 mm copper could be more stressful for this strain, perhaps triggering a specific bypass of the normal CUP1 autoregulation process. This “extra” stress could activate non-AceI-dependent pathways, such as the oxidative stress response, which could activate or maintain CUP1 expression in parallel with the AceI-dependent response. Future experiments will test whether alternate stress pathways are contributing to the response to copper in these strains. We do observe phosphorylation of histone H2A at Ser-129 in copper-treated cells, 2H.-C. Kuo and J. E. Krebs, unpublished data. a modification normally associated with DNA double strand breaks (34Downs J.A. Lowndes N.F. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). H2A phosphorylation has not been reported for other types of DNA damage; Drosophila H2Av, which is phosphorylated in response to double strand breaks, is not phosphorylated in response to oxidative stress (35Madigan J.P. Chotkowski H.L. Glaser R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3698-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It will be important to test whether yeast H2A is phosphorylated at Ser-129 (or Ser-2, Ser-122) in response to oxidative stress per se. Numerous studies have addressed the roles of histone modification and chromatin remodeling in gene silencing or repression, particularly in epigenetic silencing (for some recent reviews, see Refs. 8Torok M.S. Grant P.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 67: 181-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and 36Czermin B. Imhof A. Genetica. 2003; 117: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 37Mellor J.

Dev. 2003; 13: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 39Rusche L.N. Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 481-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). However, there have been very few studies of the role of chromatin modifications in the process of shutting down an active gene. For many genes it is clear that shutdown is rapid and regulated, such as for genes transiently expressed during the cell cycle, or genes that are autoregulated by their own products (such as CUP1). For genes for which rapid shutdown is important, it is likely that removal of specific activator(s) is only one part of the shutdown process. Besides their roles in repression or silencing, histone deacetylases have been implicated in transcription shutoff/chromatin resetting in some cases (22Krebs J.E. Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Peterson C.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1412-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 40Kemper J.K. Kim H. Miao J. Bhalla S. Bae Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7707-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 41Kim M.K. Carroll W.L. Cancer. 2004; 101: 2106-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One of these studies also implicated SWI/SNF in feedback repression (40Kemper J.K. Kim H. Miao J. Bhalla S. Bae Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7707-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, a dependence of normal shutdown kinetics on chromatin has not been addressed prior to this study. One question that arises from this study is what is the role of rapid CUP1 shutoff in normal copper metabolism? High levels of Cup1 are known to protect cells in high copper conditions; regulated shut off of CUP1 suggests that overexpression of CUP1 could have serious repercussions for copper homeostasis. Cells may have evolved a rapid response to high copper levels, followed by a shut down for “reassessment.” If high copper levels persist, AceI is reactivated and appropriate levels of CUP1 transcription can resume. If the initial burst of Cup1 production was sufficient to bind the free copper, then it would be advantageous to not make excess Cup1, which could begin to compete with copper-dependent enzymes for their essential cofactor. This model leads to two possible testable outcomes for the mutants that do not shut down CUP1 appropriately: 1) that excess copper ion depletion might lead to induction of genes involved in copper uptake (i.e. simulation of a copper-starved state), and 2) that these strains might show decreased viability over time, as essential copper reserves are depleted. This research emphasizes the complexity of copper homeostasis. Defects in copper homeostasis are responsible for serious disease in humans, including diseases of copper overload (Wilson's disease), copper deficiency (Menkes disease), and carcinogenesis (42Daniel K.G. Harbach R.H. Guida W.C. Dou Q.P. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 2652-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 43Theocharis S.E. Margeli A.P. Koutselinis A. Int. J. Biol. Markers. 2003; 18: 162-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed understanding of the regulation of the genes responsible for copper homeostasis provides not only insight into the complex interactions of chromatin remodeling in transcriptional control, but also provides critical understanding of processes essential to human health."
https://openalex.org/W2078735665,"Activation of latent proteinases ensures that the timing of proteolysis is regulated precisely, a process that generally involves proteolytic excision of a pro-region or a tightly bound inhibitor. Here we define the activation mechanism for Lit, a dormant suicide proteinase in Escherichia coli K-12. Previous work has shown that Gol, a short sequence within the major capsid protein gp23, activates Lit during the latter stages of T4 phage infection. This results in cell death and exclusion of the phage from the culture. The Lit site specifically cleaves the host translation factor EF-Tu (elongation factor Tu) after it has formed a weak complex with Gol, which can be supplied as a 29-residue peptide. Gol is absolutely required for Lit activation. but its role in proteolysis is unknown. Using a purified three-component system and kinetic analysis, we demonstrate that under physiological conditions Lit hydrolyzes its substrate very slowly (k(cat) of approximately 1 s(-1)). Given the abundance of EF-Tu in the cell, this finding is consistent with a cell-killing mechanism in which a few cleaved EF-Tu proteins are able block translating ribosomes from functioning. We also demonstrate that less than half of the 29 Gol residues are needed for Lit activation and that the role of the peptide is not to provide catalytic groups but to influence catalysis indirectly through stabilization of the ternary Lit.Gol.EF-Tu complex. Hence, phage-elicited suicide of E. coli K-12 by Lit is a variant form of cofactor-induced activation, a mechanism of protease activation that has only been documented previously in pathogen subversion of mammalian hemostasis cascades."

Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5163) Google Scholar) first demonstrated in the 1960s that the amino acid sequence of a protein determines its three-dimensional structure, significant advances have been made in the understanding of protein folding through experimental and theoretical approaches (2Dill K.A.

However, the folding mechanism, such as how a linear polypeptide strand starts and walks along what pathway to fold into a protein molecule, is still poorly understood. In the investigations of the protein folding pathway, the proteins with disulfide linkages are frequently chosen as models, because the formation of disulfide bridges is always coupled with folding and assembly, which can be used as a unique probe for the study of protein folding and assembly (5Creighton T.E.

AILP deduced from the cDNA sequence is a polypeptide that displays structural characteristics of both mammalian insulin and IGF-1. The deduced AILP contains B-, C-, A-, and D-domains similar to those of IGF-1, whereas there are potential prohormone convertase cleavage sites at the two ends of the C-domain similar to proinsulin, and its A- and B-domains bear considerable sequence homology to the A- and B-chains of insulin as well as to the A- and B-domains of IGF-1 (28Chan S-J. Cao Q.-P. Steiner F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9319-9323Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Previously, a recombinant single-chain AILP (rAILP) has been constructed (29Shen L. Guo Z-Y. Chen Y. Liu L.-Y. Feng Y.-M Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue Bao (Shanghai). 2001; 33: 629-633PubMed Google Scholar), in which the D-domain of AILP was deleted; the C-domain was replaced by the Ala-Lys dipeptide. rAILP could be successfully expressed in yeast cells with high yield and was found to retained α-helix content similar to that of PIP. Furthermore, when the residues of rAILP were substituted with corresponding residues at insulin receptor binding sites, the rAILP mutant acquired moderate insulin receptor binding activity (30Guo Z-Y. Shen L. Gu W. Wu A.-Z. Ma J.-G. Feng Y.-M Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10603-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It demonstrated that rAILP can be used as a molecular scaffold of the insulin superfamily, from which it is reasonable to assume that rAILP could adopt similar three-dimensional structure as insulin and IGF-1. Most interesting, the folding behavior of rAILP was found to show characteristics of both insulin and IGF-1. Like IGF-1, two thermodynamically stable disulfide isomers of rAILP have been identified; like insulin, the isomer with native disulfide pairing is more favorable than the isomer with nonnative disulfide pairing (31Wang S. Guo Z-Y. Shen L. Zhang Y.-J. Feng Y.-M Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9687-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This suggested that the different folding behavior of insulin and IGF-1 might evolve from their common ancestor molecule, AILP. Therefore, detailed studies on the in vitro refolding and unfolding pathways of rAILP are needed to gain more insight into not only the folding pathway of AILP but also the common folding mechanism of insulin superfamily. Taking into consideration that cyclization of the N terminus Gln of rAILP to pyroglutamate will complicate the refolding/unfolding studies, [Gly]rAILP (Fig. 1A) was constructed, in which Gln was substituted by Gly. Here we report the investigation of the in vitro refolding/unfolding pathway of [Gly]rAILP. Based on our current results, we sketched out a possible folding/unfolding pathway of [Gly]rAILP and proposed some common features of the insulin superfamily folding pathway. Materials—The Escherichia coli strain used was DH12S. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain XV700–6B (leu2, ura3, pep4) was kindly provided by Michael Smith (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada). Plasmid pVT102-U/αMFL-AILP was previously constructed in our laboratory (29Shen L. Guo Z-Y. Chen Y. Liu L.-Y. Feng Y.-M Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue Bao (Shanghai). 2001; 33: 629-633PubMed Google Scholar). The chemical reagents used in experiments were analytical grade. The Amersham Biosciences reverse-phase column (Sephasil Peptide C8 5μ ST 4.6/250), Gilson 306 HPLC system, and Gilson 115 UV detector were used. In HPLC analysis, a gradient elution was used. Solvent A was 0.15% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B was 60% acetonitrile containing 0.125% trifluoroacetic acid. The elution gradient was as follows: 0 min, 0% solvent B; 1 min, 0% solvent B; 5 min, 45% solvent B; 32 min, 90% solvent B; 33 min, 100% solvent B; 35 min, 100% solvent B; 38 min, 0% solvent B; 42 min, 0% solvent B. During analysis, the flow rate is 0.5 ml/min, and the detection wavelength is 230 nm. DNA Manipulation—The expression plasmid encoding [Gly]rAILP was constructed using a gapped duplex DNA approach (32Kramer W. Drusta V. Jansen H.W. Kramer B. Pflugfelder M. Frits H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9441-9454Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) for site-directed mutagenesis on the basis of pVT102-U/αMFL-AILP. The expected mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid constructed was designated as pVT102-U/αMFL-[Gly]rAILP Expression, Purification, and Identification of [Gly]rAILP—The plasmid pVT102-U/αMFL-[Gly]rAILP was transformed into the yeast cells XV700–6B (leu2, ura3, pep4). The transformed yeast cells were cultured in a 16-liter fermenter, and the secreted target protein was purified from the medium with four steps as previously reported (29Shen L. Guo Z-Y. Chen Y. Liu L.-Y. Feng Y.-M Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue Bao (Shanghai). 2001; 33: 629-633PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, first, the target protein was precipitated from the medium supernatant by trichloroacetic acid; second, the precipitant was dissolved with 1 m acetic acid and applied to a Sephadex G-50 column; third, the product was purified by ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column; fourth, the product was further purified by C8 reverse-phase HPLC using a gradient elution described under “Materials” and detected at 280 nm. The purity was characterized by analytical C8 reverse-phase HPLC and native pH 8.3 PAGE. The molecular mass was measured by ESI-MS. Oxidative Refolding of fr[Gly]rAILP—[Gly]rAILP was dissolved in a reduction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm DTT, pH 9.5) at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The reduction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. Thereafter, the refolding reaction was initiated by adding one-tenth volume of fr[Gly]rAILP into the refolding buffer that consists of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and different concentrations of GSSG. The reactions were performed in a 16 °C water bath for 16 h and terminated by making it in 2% trifluoroacetic acid. Then, to optimize the refolding condition of [Gly]rAILP, refolding yields in different pH and redox ratio, respectively, were estimated by reverse-phase HPLC analysis. Trapping and Fractionation of Refolding Intermediates—Refolding of fr[Gly]rAILP was carried out in the optimized refolding condition (0.1 mg/ml fr[Gly]rAILP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSSG, and 1 mm DTT, pH 9.5, 16 °C). The refolding reaction was quenched by adding one-fourth volume of freshly prepared 0.5 m IAA and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. To monitor the refolding process, at different time points, 100 μl of sample was removed and quenched and then applied to the analytical C8 reverse-phase HPLC column under the conditions described under “Materials.” For large scale preparation of intermediates, we quenched the folding reaction by IAA after 15 min of refolding. The sample was first dialyzed against 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 4 °C and then applied to a semiprepared C8 RP-HPLC column (Sephasil peptide, ST 4.6/250 mm) (Amersham Biosciences). The HPLC conditions were as described under “Materials” except that the flow rate was 1.5 ml/min. The individual fractions were collected manually and then lyophilized for further use. Identification of the Disulfide Linkage of Folding Intermediates—To illustrate their disulfide linkage, the intermediates were dissolved in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) and applied to V8 endoproteinase digestion at 25 °C for 16 h. The ratio of enzyme to sample was around 1:20. The reaction was terminated by making the solution in 2% trifluoroacetic acid. The sample was then loaded onto a C8 reverse-phase HPLC column for analysis and separation. The fractions were collected manually and lyophilized. Their molecular masses were measured by ESI-MS. Circular Dichroism Analysis of Refolding Intermediates—The samples were each dissolved in 10 mm HCl. The protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 276 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.2 ml mg-1 cm–1 and diluted to 0.2 mg/ml, respectively. The analysis was performed on a Jasco-715 CD spectropolarimeter at room temperature. The spectra were scanned from 200 to 250 nm using a cell with a 0.1-cm path length in the far-UV region and scanned from 300 to 245 nm using a cell with a 1.0-cm path length in near-UV region. The data were expressed as molar ellipticity. The software J-700 for Windows Secondary Structure Estimation, Version 1.10.00, was used for secondary structural content estimation from the CD spectra. Reductive Unfolding of [Gly]rAILP—[Gly]rAILP was dissolved in an alkaline buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.7) at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Reductive unfolding was initiated by adding the same volume of 10 mm DTT. The final reaction solution contains 0.5 mg/ml [Gly]rAILP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm DTT. The unfolding reaction was quenched by adding one-fourth volume of freshly prepared 0.5 m IAA and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. To monitor the unfolding process, at different time points, 100 μl of sample was removed and quenched and then applied to the analytical C8 reverse-phase HPLC column under the conditions described under “Materials.” For large scale purification of intermediates, the reaction was quenched by IAA after reductive unfolding for 4 min and then applied to a semiprepared C8 HPLC column (Sephasil peptide, ST 4.6/250 mm) (Amersham Biosciences). The HPLC conditions were as described under “Materials” except that the flow rate was 1.5 ml/min. The individual fractions were collected manually and then lyophilized. Native pH 8.3 PAGE and V8 digestion were applied, respectively, to the purified unfolding intermediates for identification. Oxidative Refolding and Reductive Unfolding of Swap [Gly]rAILP— Refolding of swap [Gly]rAILP was carried out at 16 °C. Refolding buffer was composed of 0.1 mg/ml swap [Gly]rAILP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm GSSG, pH 9.5. At different time points, the refolding was quenched by IAA and analyzed by HPLC analysis. Unfolding of swap [Gly]rAILP was carried out at 16 °C with the unfolding buffer composed of 0.5 mg/ml swap [Gly]rAILP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm DTT, pH 8.7. At different time points, unfolding was quenched by IAA and analyzed by HPLC analysis. Expression and Purification of [Gly]rAILP—The plasmid pVT102U/α-MFL-[Gly]rAILP was constructed with correct DNA sequence (data not shown), transformed into the yeast cells, and expressed in a 16-liter fermenter. The expression product of the single-chain [Gly]rAILP was purified from the fermentation supernatant as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C8 reverse phase HPLC profile and pH 8.3 PAGE analysis show that the purified [Gly]rAILP is homogenous (Fig. 1B). The molecular mass of [Gly]rAILP measured by ESI-MS is 5631, agrees with the expected value. Oxidative Refolding of [Gly]rAILP in Vitro—Refolding of [Gly]rAILP was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To optimize the refolding condition, we tested different concentration of GSSG and values of pH. There was a big jump in refolding yields of [Gly]rAILP when the concentration of GSSG increased from 0.5 to 1 mm and the refolding yields stayed at around 80% after the concentration of GSSG reached 1 mm. However, the refolding yields increased slightly as the pH value increased from 8.5 to 9.5 (data not shown). Therefore, the oxidative folding was carried out under the optimized condition: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm GSSG, pH 9.5, 16 °C. In the present study, we use the IAA quenching method to trap the folding intermediates. We found that there was no change in the distribution of intermediates when the concentration of IAA used in trapping free thiols varied from 50 to 200 mm (data not shown), thus indicating that the quenching method with 100 mm IAA was suitable for our work. On the other hand, the acid-quenching method was also applied in comparison with the IAA quenching method. However, acid quenched refolding intermediates cannot be resolved well in HPLC (data not shown). In fact, here the IAA quenching method is convenient for separation, purification, and further characterization of folding intermediates. As Fig. 2A shows, the refolding process was quenched by IAA at different times and analyzed by HPLC. Fig. 2B shows the magnified HPLC profile of [Gly]rAILP refolding quenched at the time of 15 min. Besides native (PN) and fully reduced form (R), seven obvious disulfide intermediates were detected in IAA-trapped refolding process. The first peak was proved by ESI-MS to contain three disulfides; thus, since it is the disulfide isomer of native [Gly]rAILP, we designated this peak as swap [Gly]rAILP (PS). The other six peaks were designated P1–P6, respectively. Capture and purification of folding intermediates were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Their patterns in native pH 8.3 PAGE are shown in Fig. 2C, which indicates that each fraction contains mainly one component except for P6. P6 is a mixture of disulfide species and has not been further analyzed. ESI-MS analysis was then applied to elucidate the number of disulfides pairing in each fraction, because, compared with the native form, the molecular mass of IAA-modified intermediates with two disulfide bonds should increase by 118 Da, and those with one disulfide bond should increase by 236 Da. Therefore, both PS and PN have three disulfide bonds (3SS) without IAA modification. P1, P2, and P3 have two disulfide bonds (2SS) with two thiol groups modified by IAA. Both P4 and P5 have only one disulfide bond (1SS) with four free thiol groups modified by IAA. Fig. 3 shows the kinetics of oxidative refolding of [Gly]rAILP. When refolding was carried out in 1 mm GSSG, the recovery time course of [Gly]rAILP is shown in Fig. 3A. As time went by, the yield of both native and swap [Gly]rAILP increased. After 2 h, the refolding process reached thermodynamic equilibrium, and the ratio of native/swap is about 9:1. The recovery time course of 2SS disulfide species was shown in Fig. 3B. Obviously, the recovery time course curves of P1, P2, and P3 were similar; all reach their peaks in 20 min and drop to zero after 120 min. Most interestingly, the proportion of P1, P2, and P3 to their total amount seems to remain unchanged during the whole refolding process under a given redox condition, suggesting that there is a quick balance between the three 2SS intermediates. Furthermore, the change of redox condition can change the distribution of 2SS intermediates. Fig. 3C shows the proportion of P1, P2, and P3 to their total amount under different refolding conditions. When the concentration of GSSG was 1, 2, or 4 mm, the relative content of P1/P2/P3 during the refolding process is 32:10:56, 30:12:57, or 24:12:62, respectively.Fig. 3Kinetics of oxidative refolding of [Gly]rAILP. Shown is the recovery time course of [Gly]rAILP (A) and 2SS (B) refolding intermediates in the presence of 1 mm GSSG. The recovery percentages indicate the ratios of recovered proteins relative to the fr[Gly]rAILP used for the refolding (0.1 mg/ml fr[Gly]rAILP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm GSSG, and 1 mm DTT, pH 9.5, 16 °C). C, proportion of P1, P2, and P3 during the refolding process. For refolding carried out under 1 mm GSSG, the height of each bar reflects the average proportion of a specific refolding intermediate (P1, P2, or P3) in the total amount of the three 2SS refolding intermediates, which was averaged from nine different time points according to B. The error bar represents S.D. For refolding carried out under 2 mm GSSG or 4 mm GSSG, the same method was used to calculate the proportion of P1, P2, and P3 according to their time-dependent recovery of 2SS intermediates (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Disulfide Linkage Elucidation of Folding Intermediates— Endoproteinase V8 can specifically cleave the peptide bond at the carboxyl terminus of Glu and Asp residues; there are six potential V8 digestion sites in [Gly]rAILP. As shown in Fig. 1A, the digestion of fully reduced [Gly]rAILP should generate seven fragments, designated A–G, respectively. Because native [Gly]rAILP contains two inter-AB-chain disulfide bonds (A7-B7 and A20-B19) (each links two pieces of fragments as indicated in Fig. 1A), fragments linked by disulfides would be obtained after V8 digestion. Thus, disulfide linkage information of the intermediates could be deduced by measuring the molecular weight of V8-digested fragments. To elucidate the disulfide linkage in the folding intermediates, the mixture of V8 digest was separated by HPLC, the major peaks were collected, and their molecular weight was measured by ESI-MS and listed in Table I. The 1SS intermediate P4 has the disulfide linkage between fragment C and fragment D; thus, P4 contains disulfide A20-B19. The 1SS intermediate P5 contains IAA-modified fragments B and C; thus, P5 does not have any inter-AB-chain disulfide linkage. P5 might have an intra-E disulfide, which should be A6-A7, A6-A11, or A7-A11. The 2SS intermediate P1 contains disulfide A20-B19. In addition, P1 has another disulfide paring between fragment B and fragment E; thus, it contains one inter-AB-chain disulfide besides A20-B19, which should be B7-A6, B7-A7, or B7-A11. Like P1, the 2SS intermediate P2 also contains A20-B19 disulfide and another disulfide among B7-A6, B7-A7, and B7-A11. The 2SS intermediate P3 contains disulfide A20-B19 and one intra-E disulfide, as P5 does. The 3SS species PS contains disulfide A20-B19. The native disulfide pairi"
