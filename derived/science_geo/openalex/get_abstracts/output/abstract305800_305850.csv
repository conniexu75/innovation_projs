https://openalex.org/W1980824691,Competition and cooperation are thought to represent the opposite extremes of organism interactions. I here show that the formation of aggregations in a sessile organism requires cooperation between individuals and that the gregarious pattern of habitat selection generating these aggregations is a response to a density dependence in the outcome of interference competition.

The dates are supported by internal concordancy between thorium-230 and protactinium-231 decay systems. These ages are significantly younger than the estimates of 48,000 and 70,000 years based on amino acid racemization, and indicate that the individuals could derive from the population waves that came across the Bering Strait during the last sea-level low."

There was a linear correlation (correlation coefficient = â€“.99) between increasing concentrations of sulfur dioxide and the yields of snap beans. Synergism was indicated for the mixtures of ambient ozone plus sulfur dioxide, leading to threefold greater yield losses in nonfiltered air than in charcoal-filtered air (to remove the ozone). Even the lowest sulfur dioxide dose in nonfiltered air reduced the yields of Astro, a cultivar that exhibited no visible pollutant-induced foliar injury."

The average water content of normal domal salt is on the order of 0.003 percent by weight, but anomalous zones within salt stocks can have more than ten times this amount. From the average value, the minimum amount of water in liters, W, available to collect around a radioactive waste repository is given as W = 0.28 r3, where r is the radius in meters of the sphere in which water may be thermally activated to migrate completely to the repository."

When this dissolved material and the acid diffuse into the solid's pores, they can precipitate more solid. If the acid is buffered, the diffusing species can bring about precipitation in some regions and dissolution in others. When the porous solid contains several chemical species, the diffusion can precipitate one species and dissolve another. The results have implications for the demineralization of teeth."

https://openalex.org/W2086681988,"To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE: My attention has been attracted to an article in your columns by Professor H. A. Surface relative to the use of cyanide of potassium for eliminating insect attacks on trees. While I have not investigated the claim of the firm at Allentown, Pennsylvania, referred to in his article, and know nothing about their process, however, from my own results with cyanide of potassium, especially on elms and black locusts, I am convinced it is a valuable remedy. The article above referred to gives the general impression that cyanide of potassium is the cause of death as well as various staining effects found in the bark, cambium, etc. My opinion is that the staining comes from the reaction between the tannic acid found in all trees and the iron found in this so-called tree food in the form of iron sulphate. It is well known that when solutions of tannic acid are brought into contact with iron or any iron salt, dark colored compounds resembling ink are formed. These are very permanent dyes and no doubt account for the dark color observed. The cyanide of potassium as I have used it for years in eliminating borers from various trees has never caused any staining, nor have I ever known of its killing or in any way injuring a tree. I have been using it and prescribing it for the use of others for about twelve years in connection with my forestry work, and we have saved the lives of thousands of trees by means of it. Large groves of thrifty elms and black locusts in Kansas and other parts of the west have been completely rescued from the attacks of boring and girdling insects by means of cyanide of potassium, and this article is the first intimation I have ever had to the effect that it is deleterious to growth. I am strongly inclined to feel that the blame is not properly placed and that a highly useful chemical for insect eradication is being condemned because of damages produced by other substances. C. H.

The time between the warning and the clear air turbulence event varies with the flight altitude of the aircraft. In turbulence-free areas, the incidence of false alarms is found to be less than one in 3.4 hours of flight time compared to less than one per 10 hours of flight time in areas with turbulence."
