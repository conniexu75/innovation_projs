https://openalex.org/W2955480378,"Net anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) must approach zero by mid-century (2050) in order to stabilize the global mean temperature at the level targeted by international efforts1-5. Yet continued expansion of fossil-fuel-burning energy infrastructure implies already 'committed' future CO2 emissions6-13. Here we use detailed datasets of existing fossil-fuel energy infrastructure in 2018 to estimate regional and sectoral patterns of committed CO2 emissions, the sensitivity of such emissions to assumed operating lifetimes and schedules, and the economic value of the associated infrastructure. We estimate that, if operated as historically, existing infrastructure will cumulatively emit about 658 gigatonnes of CO2 (with a range of 226 to 1,479 gigatonnes CO2, depending on the lifetimes and utilization rates assumed). More than half of these emissions are predicted to come from the electricity sector; infrastructure in China, the USA and the 28 member states of the European Union represents approximately 41 per cent, 9 per cent and 7 per cent of the total, respectively. If built, proposed power plants (planned, permitted or under construction) would emit roughly an extra 188 (range 37-427) gigatonnes CO2. Committed emissions from existing and proposed energy infrastructure (about 846 gigatonnes CO2) thus represent more than the entire carbon budget that remains if mean warming is to be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius (°C) with a probability of 66 to 50 per cent (420-580 gigatonnes CO2)5, and perhaps two-thirds of the remaining carbon budget if mean warming is to be limited to less than 2 °C (1,170-1,500 gigatonnes CO2)5. The remaining carbon budget estimates are varied and nuanced14,15, and depend on the climate target and the availability of large-scale negative emissions16. Nevertheless, our estimates suggest that little or no new CO2-emitting infrastructure can be commissioned, and that existing infrastructure may need to be retired early (or be retrofitted with carbon capture and storage technology) in order to meet the Paris Agreement climate goals17. Given the asset value per tonne of committed emissions, we suggest that the most cost-effective premature infrastructure retirements will be in the electricity and industry sectors, if non-emitting alternatives are available and affordable4,18."
https://openalex.org/W2953406703,"Traversing sensory environments requires keeping relevant information in mind while simultaneously processing new inputs. Visual information is kept in working memory via feature-selective responses in early visual cortex, but recent work has suggested that new sensory inputs obligatorily wipe out this information. Here we show region-wide multiplexing abilities in classic sensory areas, with population-level response patterns in early visual cortex representing the contents of working memory alongside new sensory inputs. In a second experiment, we show that when people get distracted, this leads to both disruptions of mnemonic information in early visual cortex and decrements in behavioral recall. Representations in the intraparietal sulcus reflect actively remembered information encoded in a transformed format, but not task-irrelevant sensory inputs. Together, these results suggest that early visual areas play a key role in supporting high-resolution working memory representations that can serve as a template for comparison with incoming sensory information. People often remember visual information over brief delays while also seeing new images in their immediate visual surroundings. Areas of the brain known to process visual information are shown to juggle these memory and sensory demands."

This study aimed to predict the suicidal behavior of Chinese university students by studying psychological measures such as hopelessness, orientation to happiness, meaning in life, depression, anxiety, stress, and coping styles. In November 2016, a stratified-clustered-random sampling approach was utilized to select subjects from two large public medical-related universities in Shandong province, China. This sample consisted of 2,074 undergraduate students (706 males, 1,368 females; mean age = 19.79±1.39 years). The students' major risk factors for suicide were depression, anxiety, stress, and hopelessness, and the students' minor risk factors included orientation to happiness and coping styles (including self-distraction, self-blame and substance use). Notably, the presence of meaning in life had a positive effect on preventing suicide and acted as a protective factor, which suggests that it is important to identify risk factors as well as protective factors relevant to the target population group in order to increase the effectiveness of counseling and suicide prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W2955591694,"Microbial communities are ubiquitous and often influence macroscopic properties of the ecosystems they inhabit. However, deciphering the functional relationship between specific microbes and ecosystem properties is an ongoing challenge owing to the complexity of the communities. This challenge can be addressed, in part, by integrating the advances in DNA sequencing technology with computational approaches like machine learning. Although machine learning techniques have been applied to microbiome data, use of these techniques remains rare, and user-friendly platforms to implement such techniques are not widely available. We developed a tool that implements neural network and random forest models to perform regression and feature selection tasks on microbiome data. In this study, we applied the tool to analyze soil microbiome (16S rRNA gene profiles) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) data from a 44-day plant litter decomposition experiment. The microbiome data includes 1709 total bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTU) from 300+ microcosms. Regression analysis of predicted and actual DOC for a held-out test set of 51 samples yield Pearson’s correlation coefficients of.636 and.676 for neural network and random forest approaches, respectively. Important taxa identified by the machine learning techniques are compared to results from a standard tool (indicator species analysis) widely used by microbial ecologists. Of 1709 bacterial taxa, indicator species analysis identified 285 taxa as significant determinants of DOC concentration. Of the top 285 ranked features determined by machine learning methods, a subset of 86 taxa are common to all feature selection techniques. Using this subset of features, prediction results for random permutations of the data set are at least equally accurate compared to predictions determined using the entire feature set. Our results suggest that integration of multiple methods can aid identification of a robust subset of taxa within complex communities that may drive specific functional outcomes of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2955563250,"Objectives Neonicotinoid insecticides are widely used systemic pesticides with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist activity that are a concern as environmental pollutants. Neonicotinoids in humans and the environment have been widely reported, but few studies have examined their presence in fetuses and newborns. The objective of this study is to determine exposure to neonicotinoids and metabolites in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Methods An analytical method for seven neonicotinoids and one neonicotinoid metabolite, N-desmethylacetamiprid (DMAP), in human urine using LC-ESI/MS/MS was developed. This method was used for analysis of 57 urine samples collected within 48 hours after birth from VLBW infants of gestational age 23–34 weeks (male/female = 36/21, small for gestational age (SGA)/appropriate gestational age (AGA) = 6/51) who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Dokkyo Hospital from January 2009 to December 2010. Sixty-five samples collected on postnatal day 14 (M/F = 37/22, SGA/AGA = 7/52) were also analyzed. Results DMAP, a metabolite of acetamiprid, was detected in 14 urine samples collected at birth (24.6%, median level 0.048 ppb) and in 7 samples collected on postnatal day 14 (11.9%, median level 0.09 ppb). The urinary DMAP detection rate and level were higher in SGA than in AGA infants (both p<0.05). There were no correlations between the DMAP level and infant physique indexes (length, height, and head circumference SD scores). Conclusion These results provide the first evidence worldwide of neonicotinoid exposure in newborn babies in the early phase after birth. The findings suggest a need to examine potential neurodevelopmental toxicity of neonicotinoids and metabolites in human fetuses."
https://openalex.org/W2955571358,"Objectives Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy, including mother-to-child HIV transmission. Yet there are limited data on the prevalence and correlates of STI in pregnant women by HIV status in low- and middle-income countries, where syndromic STI management is routine. Methods Between November 2017 and July 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional study of consecutive pregnant women making their first visit to a public sector antenatal clinic (ANC) in Cape Town. We interviewed women ≥18 years and tested them for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoea (NG) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) using Xpert assays (Cepheid, USA); results of syphilis serology came from routine testing records. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify correlates of STI in pregnancy. Results In 242 women (median age 29 years [IQR = 24–34], median gestation 19 weeks [IQR = 14–24]) 44% were HIV-infected. Almost all reported vaginal sex during pregnancy (93%). Prevalence of any STI was 32%: 39% in HIV-infected women vs. 28% in HIV-uninfected women (p = 0.036). The most common infection was CT (20%) followed by TV (15%), then NG (5.8%). Of the 78 women diagnosed with a STI, 7 (9%) were identified and treated syndromically in ANC. Adjusting for age and gestational age, HIV-infection (aOR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.02–3.67), being unmarried or not cohabiting with the fetus’ father (aOR = 2.19; 95% CI = 1.16–4.12), and having STI symptoms in the past three days (aOR = 6.60; 95% CI = 2.08–20.95) were associated with STI diagnosis. Conclusion We found a high prevalence of treatable STIs in pregnancy among pregnant women, especially in HIV-infected women. Few women were identified and treated in pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2955164475,"Intimate partner violence is a thoughtful public health concern and human rights violation towards pregnant women for it has a significant negative health effect on the life of both the mother and her fetus. However, there is a scanty of information about the extent of intimate partner violence during pregnancy in Ethiopia, particularly in the study area. Therefore, the current study was conducted to determine the prevalence of intimate partner violence among pregnant women attending antenatal care and identify associated factors that cause it.An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted on 409 pregnant women who were attending antenatal care service in Debre Markos town from March 17, 2018 -April 28, 2018. Systematic random sampling technique was used to select study participants. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. Bivariable and Multivariable logistic regression models were done. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used to identify factors associated with intimate partner violence during pregnancy.The prevalence of intimate partner violence during current pregnancy was found to be 41.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 36.0-46.0). Of this, the prevalence of psychological, physical, and sexual violence was 29.1%, 21%, 19.8% respectively. Lower educational status of partners (AOR = 3.26, 95%CI: 1.45-7.36), rural residency (AOR = 4.04, 95%CI: 1.17-13.93), frequent alcohol abuse by partner (AOR = 4.79, 95% CI: 2.08-11.04), early initiation of antenatal care (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.24-0.81), the age of women between 17-26 years (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.21, 95%CI: 0.09-0.49),choice of partner by the women only (AOR = 3.26,95% CI:1.24-8.57) were statistically significant factors associated with intimate partner violence towards pregnant women.In this study, the prevalence of intimate partner violence during pregnancy is found to be high. As a result, interventions that would address the above mentioned factors need to be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2955332455,"Background Numerous studies have evaluated the association between dietary factors and cardiovascular risk among patients with chronic disease. It is worthwhile to assess these associations in a combination model rather than in an isolated form. In the current study, we aimed to use structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess the association of adherence to a healthy eating index (HEI)-2015 with socio-demographic factors, psychological characteristics, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and other cardio-metabolic risk factors among obese individuals. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 188 healthy obese adults (96 males and 92 females) aged 20–50 years in Tabriz. A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to record dietary intake and to estimate HEI-2015. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure and biochemical measurements were evaluated according to standard protocols. Interrelationships among socio-demographic parameters and HEI with cardio-metabolic risk factors were analyzed using SEM. Results The results of SEM analysis revealed that HEI mediated the association between age and several cardio-metabolic risk factors including fat mass (FM), fat free mass (FFM), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (p < 0.05). Moreover, adherence to Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) appears to mediate association between gender and waist circumference (B = -9.78), SBP (B = -4.83), triglyceride (B = -13.01) and HDL (B = 4.31). HEI also mediated indirect negative effects of socioeconomic status on FM (B = -0.56), FFM (B = -0.25), SBP (B = -0.55) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (B = -0.3). Additionally, depression and age had indirect unfavorable effects on some insulin resistance indices such as homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (B = 0.07; p<0.05, for age) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (p<0.05, for age and depression) via HEI. High adherence to HEI was found to be inversely associated with MetS risk (p<0.05). Conclusion Adherence to HEI-2015 seems to mediate the effect of socio-demographic parameters and mental health on cardio-metabolic risk factors as well as MetS risk. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2953455628,"Introduction Open defecation is ongoing in Nepal despite the rise in efforts for increasing latrine coverage and its use. Understanding the reasons for open defecation would complement the ongoing efforts to achieve the ‘open defecation free’ status in Nepal. This study aimed at exploring different motivations of people who practice open defecation in a village in Nepal. Methods This study was conducted among the people from the Hattimudha village in Morang district of eastern Nepal, who practiced open defecation. Maximum variation sampling method was used to recruit participants for 20 in-depth interviews and 2 focus group discussions. We adopted a content analysis approach to analyze the data. Results We categorized different reasons for open defecation as motivation by choice and motivation by compulsion. Open defecation by choice as is expressed as a medium for socializing, a habit and an enjoyable outdoor activity that complies with spiritual and religious norms. Open defecation by compulsion include reasons such as not having a latrine at home or having an alternative use for the latrine structures. Despite having a private latrine at home or access to a public latrine, people were compelled to practice open defecation due to constraints of norms restricting latrine use and hygiene issues in general. For women the issues with privacy and issues refraining women to use the same latrine as men compelled women to look for open defecation places. Conclusion Open defecation is either a voluntary choice or a compulsion. This choice is closely linked with personal preferences, cultural and traditional norms with special concerns for privacy for women and girls in different communities. The ongoing campaigns to promote latrine construction and its use needs to carefully consider these factors in order to reduce the open defecation practices and increase the use of sanitary latrines."
https://openalex.org/W2953476943,"Background Adolescents living in sub-Saharan Africa constitute a vulnerable population at significant risk of HIV infection. This study aims to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and accuracy of home-based, supervised HIV self-testing (HIVST) as well as their predictors among adolescents living in Kisangani, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Methods A cross-sectional, door-to-door survey using a blood-based HIV self-test and a peer-based supervised HIVST approach was conducted from July to August 2018 in Kisangani, DRC. The acceptability and feasibility of HIVST were assessed among adolescents’ consenting to use and interpret HIV self-test. The accuracy of HIVST was estimated by the sensibility and specificity of adolescent-interpreted HIV self-test. Factors associated with acceptability and feasibility of HIVST were analyzed with logistic regression. Results A total of 628 adolescents (including 369 [58.8%] females) aged between 15 and 19 years were enrolled. Acceptability of HIVST was high (95.1%); 96.1% of participants correctly used the self-test, and 65.2% asked for verbal instructions. The majority of adolescents (93.5%) correctly interpreted their self-test results. The Cohen’s κ coefficient between the results read by adolescents and by supervisors was 0.62. The correct interpretation decreased significantly when adolescents had no formal education or attended primary school as compared to those currently attending university (37.0% versus 100%; adjusted OR: 0.01 [95% CI: 0.004–0.03]). In the hands of adolescents at home, the sensitivity of the Exacto Test HIV Self-test was estimated at 100%, while its specificity was 96.0%. The majority of participants (68.0%) affirmed that post-test counseling was essential, and that face-to-face counseling (78.9%) was greatly preferred. Conclusions Home-based, supervised HIVST using a blood-based self-test and peer-based approach can be used with a high degree of acceptability and feasibility by adolescents living in Kisangani, DRC. Misinterpretation of test results is challenging to obtaining good feasibility of HIVST among adolescents with poor educational level. Face-to-face post-test counseling seems to be preferred among Kisangani’s adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2954719724,"Macrophage-mediated inflammation is an explicitly robust biologic response that plays a critical role in maintaining tissue homeostasis by eliminating deleterious agents. These tissue macrophages tailor appropriate responses to external cues by altering inflammatory gene expression. Therefore, transcription factors and regulators that modulate inflammatory gene expression play an essential role in shaping the macrophage inflammatory response. Here, we identify that Kruppel-like factor (KLF)6 promotes inflammation by restraining microRNA-223 (miR-223) expression in macrophages. We uncovered that pro- and anti-inflammatory agents oppositely regulate KLF6 and miR-223 expression in macrophages. Using complementary gain- and loss-of-function studies, we observed that overexpression of KLF6 attenuates and deficiency of KLF6 elevates miR-223 expression in macrophages. Furthermore, heightened miR-223 expression in KLF6-deficient macrophages significantly attenuates inducible proinflammatory gene expression. Concordantly, myeloid-KZ/6 deficiency significantly curbs diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation, obesity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. At the molecular level, KLF6 directly represses miR-223 expression by occupying its promoter region. More importantly, genetic inhibition of miR-223-3P in KLF6-deficient macrophages completely reversed attenuated proinflammatory gene expression in macrophages. Collectively, our studies reveal that KLF6 promotes proinflammatory gene expression and functions by repressing miR-223 expression in macrophages.—Kim, G.-D., Ng, H. P., Patel, N., Mahabeleshwar, G.

https://openalex.org/W2954727754,"The primary mode of visualization during transcatheter procedures for structrural heart disease is fluoroscopy, which suffers from low contrast and lacks any depth perception, thus limiting the ability of an interventionalist to position a catheter accurately. This paper describes a new image guidance system by utilizing augmented reality to provide a 3D visual environment and quantitative feedback of the catheter’s position within the heart of the patient. The real-time 3D position of the catheter is acquired via two fluoroscopic images taken at different angles, and a patient-specific 3D heart rendering is produced pre-operatively from a CT scan. The spine acts as a fiduciary land marker, allowing the position and orientation of the catheter within the heart to be fully registered. The automated registration method is based on Fourier transformation, and has a high success rate (100%), low registration error (0.42 mm), and clinically acceptable computational cost (1.22 second). The 3D renderings are displayed and updated on the augmented reality device (i.e., Microsoft HoloLens), which can provide pre-set views of various angles of the heart using voice-command. This new image-guidance system with augmented reality provides a better visualization to interventionalists and potentially assists them in understanding of complicated cases. Furthermore, this system coupled with the developed 3D printed models can serve as a training tool for the next generation of cardiac interventionalists."
https://openalex.org/W2954605886,"The present study aimed to evaluate the association between influenza vaccination and the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among elderly persons. This retrospective cohort study used the Geriatric Dataset of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database (2000–2013). Patients aged ≥ 65 years who had been hospitalized for the first episodes of myocardial infarction were eligible. The vaccinated cohort comprised patients who received one dose of influenza vaccine within 180 days after discharge. The unvaccinated cohort included those who did not receive influenza vaccination and was propensity score–matched (1:1) for known CVD risk factors. All-cause death, acute myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure were assessed 1 year after the 181st day after hospital discharge. Compared with the matched cohort (n = 4,350), the vaccinated cohort (n = 4,350) had significantly lower incidences of all-cause death (hazard ratios [HR] 0.82, 95% CI [confidence interval] 0.73–0.92), myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.96), and hospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74–0.92). The association between influenza vaccination and reduction of CVDs was similar across different subgroups. Cumulative incidence curves of the CVDs of interest for the two cohorts separated within the initial 3 months of follow-up (P < 0.05). Influenza vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of CVD in the elderly population with previous myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2954371785,"The influence of curing mode and shade of resin cements on the color stability of minimum-thickness ceramic veneers after a three-year storage time in distilled water was evaluated in this study. Ninety-six 0.5-mm-thick feldspathic ceramic veneers (Mark II) were luted onto resin composite substrates (Filtek Z350 XT, shade A2E) with two light-cured (NX3 Light-cure and AllCem Veneer) and dual-cured resin cements (NX3 dual-cure and AllCem) in various shades. The specimens were stored in distilled water at 37°C. Color measurements were performed with a spectrophotometer at the following times: 1h and 24h; 7, 30, and 180 days; and 1, 2, and 3 years. Data for color difference (ΔEab) light-cured and dual-cured resin cements were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Tukey’s test (α = 0.05). For the light-cured cements, the ΔEab values were as follows: NX3-Yellow (2.37±1.35) = ACV-A1 (2.40±1.21) = ACV-Trans (2.52±1.46) = ACV-E-Bleach M (2.56±1.42) = NX3-White (2.69±1.49) = NX3-Clear (2.98±1.68). The lowest ΔE values were found for 1 h (0.61±0.36)a, followed by 24 h (1.15±0.55)b and 30 days (2.48±1.11)c. One year, 180 days, and 2 and 3 years presented higher ΔEab values (3.34±0.94, 3.52±1.04, 3.52±0.95 and 3.55±1.14, respectively)d. For the dual-cured cements, the ΔEab values varied as follows: NX3-Clear (2.32±1.24)a = NX3-Yellow (2.37±1.32)a = NX3-White (2.76±1.43)a < AC-Trans (3.77±1.91)b = AC-A3 (4.13±2.11)b < AC-A1 (5.38±2.92)c. Considering time, the lowest ΔEab values were found for 1 h (0.48±0.25)a, followed by 24 h (2.13 ±0.83)b, 30 days (3.54±1.31)c, and 180 days (3,70±1.73)c. The follow-up times of 1 (4.43±2.15)d, 2 (5.02±1.74)e, and 3 years (4.90±2.12)e presented higher ΔEab values. This study demonstrated that light-cured resin cements were less susceptible to color change than dual-cured cements. After 2 years of follow-up, all cements presented ΔEab values above the acceptability threshold."
https://openalex.org/W2954161365,"Worldwide, roads are a main driver of deforestation and degradation as they increase forest access along the forest edge. In many tropical areas, unofficial roads go unreported and unrecorded, resulting in inaccurate estimates of intact forested areas. This is the case in central Sumatra, which boasts populations of critically endangered Sumatran elephants (Elephas maximus sumatrensis), tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae) and other endemic flora and fauna that make the area globally unique. However, maps do not reflect the reality of forest loss in the area. Here we present new maps from 2002 and 2016 of digitized and ground-truthed roads in one of Sumatra's unique lowland tropical protected areas, Tesso Nilo National Park. Using our newly created roads dataset, we examine the distribution of forest with respect to distance to roads. Our data show >2,400 km of roads within the national park in 2016 -nearly a 10-fold increase from roads known in 2002. Most forest (82-99%) within Tesso Nilo falls within 100 m, 500 m, and 1000 m of road edges. Length of road increased 157% and road density increased from 1.06 km/km2 to 2.63 km/km2 from 2002-2016. Our results suggest that this endemic ecosystem is facing substantial threat from roads and their associated impacts. Without swift management action, such as road closures and increased enforcements by park management, this ecosystem, and its endemic wildlife, could be lost. It is imperative that protected areas worldwide more rigorously consider roads and road effects on ecosystem fragmentation in their conservation plans."
https://openalex.org/W2955706648,"Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) are environmental bacteria found worldwide with a propensity to produce skin and soft-tissue infections. Among them, the most clinically relevant species is Mycobacterium abscessus. Multiple resistance to antibiotics and the ability to form biofilm contributes considerably to the treatment failure. The search of novel anti-mycobacterial agents for the control of biofilm growth mode is crucial. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the activity of carvacrol (CAR) against planktonic and biofilm cells of resistant RGM strains. The susceptibility of RGM strains (n = 11) to antibiotics and CAR was assessed by MIC/MBC evaluation. The CAR activity was estimated by also vapour contact assay. The effect on biofilm formation and preformed biofilm was measured by evaluation of bacterial growth, biofilm biomass and biofilm metabolic activity. MIC values were equal to 64 μg/mL for most of RGM isolates (32–512 μg/mL), MBCs were 2–4 times higher than MICs, and MICs of vapours were lower (16 μg/mL for most RGM isolates) than MICs in liquid phase. Regarding the biofilm, CAR at concentrations of 1/2 × MIC and 1/4 × MIC showed a strong inhibition of biofilm formation (61–77%) and at concentration above the MIC (2–8 × MIC) produced significant inhibition of 4- and 8-day preformed biofilms. In conclusion, CAR could have a potential use, also in vapour phase, for the control of RGM."
https://openalex.org/W2953896354,"Introduction To reach pre-elimination levels of tuberculosis (TB) incidence in the Netherlands, prevention of TB among immigrants through diagnosis and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) is needed. We studied the feasibility of a LTBI screening and treatment program among newly arriving immigrants for national implementation. Methods We used mixed methods to evaluate the implementation of LTBI screening and treatment in five Public Health Services (PHS) among immigrants from countries with a TB incidence >50/100,000 population. We used Poisson regression models with robust variance estimators to assess factors associated with LTBI diagnosis and LTBI treatment initiation and reported reasons for not initiating or completing LTBI treatment. We interviewed five PHS teams using a semi-structured method to identify enhancing and impeding factors for LTBI screening and treatment. Results We screened 566 immigrants; 94 (17%) were diagnosed with LTBI, of whom 49 (52%) initiated and 34 (69%) completed LTBI treatment. LTBI diagnosis was associated with male gender, higher age group, higher TB incidence in the country of origin and lower level of education. Treatment initiation was associated with PHS (ranging from 29% to 86%), lower age group, longer intended duration of stay in the Netherlands, and lower level of education. According to TB physicians, clients and their consulted physicians in the home country lacked awareness about benefits of LTBI treatment. Furthermore, TB physicians questioned the individual and public health benefit of clients who return to their country of origin within the foreseeable future. Conclusions Doubt of physicians in both host country and country of origin about individual and public health benefits of LTBI screening and treatment of immigrants hampered treatment initiation: the high initiation proportion in one PHS shows that if TB physicians are committed, the LTBI treatment uptake can be higher."
https://openalex.org/W2953530906,"Self-renewal and differentiation are essential for intestinal epithelium absorptive functioning and adaptation to pathological states such as short gut syndrome, ulcers, and inflammatory bowel disease. The rodent Slfn3 and its human analog Slfn12 are critical in regulating intestinal epithelial differentiation. We sought to characterize intestinal function in Slfn3 knockout (KO) mice. Male and female pair-fed Slfn3KO mice gained less weight with decreased food efficiency than wild type (WT) mice, with more pronounced effects in females. RNA sequencing performed on intestinal mucosa of Slfn3KO and WT mice showed gene ontology decreases in cell adhesion molecule signaling, tumor necrosis factor receptor binding, and adaptive immune cell proliferation/functioning genes in Slfn3KO mice, with greater effects in females. qPCR analysis of fatty acid metabolism genes, Pla2g4c, Pla2g2f, and Cyp3c55 revealed an increase in Pla2g4c, and a decrease in Pla2g2f in Slfn3KO females. Additionally, adipogenesis genes, Fabp4 and Lpl were decreased and ketogenesis gene Hmgcs2 was increased in female Slfn3KO mice. Sequencing did not reveal significant changes in differentiation markers, so qPCR was utilized. Slfn3KO tended to have decreased expression of intestinal differentiation markers sucrase isomaltase, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, villin 1, and glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) vs. WT males, although these trends did not achieve statistical significance unless data from several markers was pooled. Differentiation markers, Glut2 and sodium-glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1), did show statistically significant sex-dependent differences. Glut2 mRNA was reduced in Slfn3KO females, while SGLT1 increased in Slfn3KO males. Notch2 and Cdx2 were only increased in female Slfn3KO mice. Although Slfn3KO mice gain less weight and decreased food efficiency, their biochemical phenotype is more subtle and suggests a complex interplay between gender effects, Slfn3, and another regulatory pathway yet to be identified that compensates for the chronic loss of Slfn3."
https://openalex.org/W2955633253,"Our previous study demonstrated that predominant feeding inhibitory effects were found in the crude extracts of foregut and midgut of the silkworm Bombyx mori larvae. To address the entero-intestinal control crucial for the regulation of insect feeding behavior, the present study identified and functionally characterized feeding inhibitory peptides from the midgut of B. mori larvae. Purification and structural analyses revealed that the predominant inhibitory factors in the crude extracts were allatotropin (AT) and GSRYamide after its C-terminal sequence. In situ hybridization revealed that AT and GSRYamide were expressed in enteroendocrine cells in the posterior and anterior midgut, respectively. Receptor screening using Ca2+-imaging technique showed that the B. mori neuropeptide G protein-coupled receptor (BNGR)-A19 and -A22 acted as GSRYamide receptors and BNGR-A5 acted as an additional AT receptor. Expression analyses of these receptors and the results of the peristaltic motion assay indicated that these peptides participated in the regulation of intestinal contraction. Exposure of pharynx and ileum to AT and GSRYamide inhibited spontaneous contraction in ad libitum-fed larvae, while exposure of pharynx to GSRYamide did not inhibit contraction in non-fed larvae, indicating that the feeding state changed their sensitivity to inhibitory peptides. These different responses corresponded to different expression levels of their receptors in the pharynx. In addition, injection of AT and GSRYamide decreased esophageal contraction frequencies in the melamine-treated transparent larvae. These findings strongly suggest that these peptides exert feeding inhibitory effects by modulating intestinal contraction in response to their feeding state transition, eventually causing feeding termination."
https://openalex.org/W2955916615,"Introduction Opioids constitute a cornerstone of pain relief treatment. However, opioid safety during pregnancy has not been well established. Recent studies reported an association between in utero opioid exposure and spina bifida. Methods In order to further evaluate the association of opioids exposure during pregnancy with adverse pregnancy outcomes, we conducted a large historical cohort by linking four databases: medications dispensations, births, pregnancy terminations for medical reasons and infant hospitalizations during the years of 1999–2009. Confounders that were controlled for included maternal age, ethnicity, maternal diabetes, smoking status, parity, obesity, year and folic acid intake. A secondary analysis for total major malformations and for spina bifida was performed using propensity score matching for first trimester exposure. Results Of the 101,586 women included in the study, 3003 were dispensed opioids during the first trimester. Intrauterine exposure to opioids was not associated with overall major malformations (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.83–1.13), cardiovascular malformations (aOR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.70–1.13) other malformations by systems or spina bifida in particular. However, the risk for spina bifida among newborns and abortuses who were exposed to codeine was four times higher than that of the unexposed (aOR = 4.42, 95% CI 1.60–12.23). This association remained significant in a secondary analysis using propensity score matching. Third trimester exposure to opioids was not associated with low birth weight (aOR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.77–1.52), perinatal death (aOR = 1.38, 95% CI 0.64–2.99) and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions These findings suggest that opioids exposure (as a homogenous group) is not a significant risk factor for overall major malformations. Exposure to codeine during the first trimester was found to be associated with increased risk of spina bifida. However, this finding was based on a small number of cases and need to be verified in future work."
https://openalex.org/W2954028472,"Numerical simulations have been used in this paper to study the propulsion device of a wave glider based on an oscillating hydrofoil, in which the profile of the pitching and heaving motion have been prescribed for the sake of simplicity. A grid model for a two-dimensional NACA0012 hydrofoil was built by using the dynamic and moving mesh technology of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT and the corresponding mathematical model has also been established. First, for the sinusoidal pitching, the effects of the pitching amplitude and the reduced frequency were investigated. As the reduced frequency increased, both the mean output power coefficient and the optimal pitching amplitude increased. Then non-sinusoidal pitching was studied, with a gradual change from a sinusoid to a square wave as the value of β was increased from 1. It was found that when the pitching amplitude was small, the trapezoidal pitching profile could indeed improve the mean output power coefficient of the flapping foil. However, when the pitching amplitude was larger than the optimal value, the non-sinusoidal pitching motion negatively contributed to the propulsion performance. Finally, the overall results suggested that a trapezoidal-like pitching profile was effective for the oscillating foil of a wave glider when the pitching amplitude was less than the optimal value."
https://openalex.org/W2955726365,"Background The immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV-infected infants and young children is relatively understudied in regions endemic for HIV and TB. We aimed to describe incidence, clinical features and risk factors of pediatric IRIS in Sub-Saharan Africa and India. Methods and findings We conducted an observational multi-centred prospective clinical study from December 2010 to September 2013 in children <72 months of age recruited from public antiretroviral programs. The main diagnostic criterion for IRIS was a new or worsening inflammatory event after initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). Among 198 participants, median age 1.15 (0.48; 2.21) years, 38 children (18.8%) developed 45 episodes of IRIS. Five participants (13.2%) had two IRIS events and one (2.6%) had 3 events. Main causes of IRIS were BCG (n = 21; 46.7%), tuberculosis (n = 10; 22.2%) and dermatological, (n = 8, 17.8%). Four TB IRIS cases had severe morbidity including 1 fatality. Cytomegalovirus colitis and cryptococcal meningitis IRIS were also severe. BCG IRIS resolved without pharmacological intervention. On multivariate logistic regression, the most important baseline associations with IRIS were high HIV viral load (likelihood ratio [LR] 10.629; p = 0.0011), recruitment at 1 site (Stellenbosch University) (LR 4.01; p = 0.0452) and CD4 depletion (LR 3.4; p = 0.0654). Significantly more non-IRIS infectious and inflammatory events between days 4 and 17 of ART initiation were noted in cases versus controls (35% versus 15.2%: p = 0.0007). Conclusions IRIS occurs commonly in HIV-infected children initiating ART and occasionally has severe morbidity. The incidence may be underestimated. Predictive, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are needed."

In this study, we have compared the transcriptomes of four primary APCs from human thymus (mTECs, CD19+ B cells, CD141+ and CD123+ DCs). We investigated a set of genes including the HLA genes, genes encoding transcriptional regulators and finally, tissue-enriched genes, i.e, genes with a five-fold higher expression in a particular human tissue. We show that thymic CD141+ DCs express the highest levels of all classical HLA genes and 67% (14/21) of the HLA class I and II pathway genes investigated in this study. CD141+ DCs also expressed the highest levels of the transcriptional regulator DEAF1, whereas AIRE and FEZF2 expression were mainly found in primary human mTECs. We found expression of “tissue enriched genes” from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) in all four APC types, but the mTECs were clearly dominating in the number of uniquely expressed tissue enriched genes (20% in mTECs, 7% in CD19+ B cells, 4% in CD123+ DCs and 2% in CD141+ DCs). The tissue enriched genes also overlapped with reported human autoantigens. This is, to our knowledge, the first study that performs RNA sequencing of mTECs, CD19+ B cells, CD141+ and CD123+ DCs isolated from the same individuals and provides insight into the transcriptomes of these human thymic APCs."

The majority of refugees and migrants were rescued in the Central Mediterranean and disembarked at ports in the Sicily region. Rapid on-spot active TB screening intervention at the point of arrival will cover most migrants arriving in EU and by detecting TB prevalent cases will limit further transmission of the disease. Material and methods Between November 2016 and December 2017 newly arrived migrants at point of arrivals in Sicily, were screened for active Tuberculosis using a smartphone application, followed in symptomatic individuals by fast molecular test, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, on collected sputum samples. Results In the study period 3787 migrants received a medical evaluation. Eight hundred and ninety-one (23.5%) reported at least one protocol-defined Tuberculosis symptom. Fifteen (2.7%) were positive to at least one microbiological test revealing a post-entry screening prevalence rate of 396 per 100.000 individuals screened (95% CI: 2.22–6.53). In logistic regression analysis, those with cough and at least one other symptom had an increased probability of testing positive compared to persons with symptoms other than cough. Whole-genome-sequencing demonstrate two separate cases of transmission. Discussion To our knowledge this study reports first-time results of an active TB case finding strategy based on on-spot symptom screening using a smartphone application, followed by fast molecular test on collected sputum samples. Our preliminary findings reveal a post-entry screening prevalence rate of 396 per 100.000 individuals screened (95% CI: 2.22–6.53)."
https://openalex.org/W2955959415,"Polyploidy is one of the major forces of plant evolution and widespread mixed-ploidy species offer an opportunity to evaluate its significance. We therefore selected the cosmopolitan species Urtica dioica (stinging nettle), examined its cytogeography and pattern of absolute genome size, and assessed correlations with bioclimatic and ecogeographic data (latitude, longitude, elevation). We evaluated variation in ploidy level using an extensive dataset of 7012 samples from 1317 populations covering most of the species’ distribution area. The widespread tetraploid cytotype (87%) was strongly prevalent over diploids (13%). A subsequent analysis of absolute genome size proved a uniform Cx-value of core U. dioica (except for U. d. subsp. cypria) whereas other closely related species, namely U. bianorii, U. kioviensis and U. simensis, differed significantly. We detected a positive correlation between relative genome size and longitude and latitude in the complete dataset of European populations and a positive correlation between relative genome size and longitude in a reduced dataset of diploid accessions (the complete dataset of diploids excluding U. d. subsp. kurdistanica). In addition, our data indicate an affinity of most diploids to natural and near-natural habitats and that the tetraploid cytotype and a small part of diploids (population from the Po river basin in northern Italy) tend to inhabit synanthropic sites. To sum up, the pattern of ploidy variation revealed by our study is in many aspects unique to the stinging nettle, being most likely first of all driven by the greater ecological plasticity and invasiveness of the tetraploid cytotype."
https://openalex.org/W2954557460,"The traditional herb medicine Ferula sinkiangensis K. M. Shen (F. sinkiangensis) has been used to treat stomach disorders in Xinjiang District for centuries. Umbelliprenin is the effective component isolated from F. sinkiangensis which is particularly found in plants of the family Ferula. We previously reported the promising effects of Umbelliprenin against gastric cancer cells, but its anti-migration effect remained unknown. Here we investigated the anti-migration effect and mechanism of Umbelliprenin in human gastric cancer cells. In SRB assay, Umbelliprenin showed cytotoxic activities in the gastric cancer cell lines AGS and BGC-823 in a dose-and-time-dependent manner, while it showed lower cytotoxic activity in the normal gastric epithelium cell line GES-1. During transwell, scratch and colony assays, the migration of tumor cells was inhibited by Umbelliprenin treatment. In gelatin zymography assay, Umbelliprenin could inhibit the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in tumor cells The expression levels of the Wnt-associated signaling pathway proteins were analyzed with western blots, and the results showed that Umbelliprenin decreased the expression levels of proteins of the Wnt signalling pathway, such as Wnt-2, β-catenin, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β, Survivin and c-myc. The translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus was also inhibited by Umbelliprenin treatment. In TCF reporter assay, the transcriptional activity of T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) was decreased after Umbelliprenin treatment. The in vivo results suggested that Umbelliprenin induced little to no harm in the lung, heart and kidney. Overall, these data provided evidence that Umbelliprenin may inhibit the growth, invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells by disturbing the Wnt signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2953964312,"Background Patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) often develop moderate to severe pain. This study compared the analgesic effect of low-dose epidural morphine vs. a comparable saline injection in patients following TKA surgery. Methods This randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Beijing between July 1, 2017 and May 30, 2018. One hundred and ten patients following TKA under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia were randomized to receive either epidural morphine (2 mg diluted to 5 ml normal saline, the epidural morphine group) or placebo (5 ml normal saline, the placebo group). For all patients, single-injection femoral nerve block was performed, and a supplementary patient-controlled intravenous analgesia pump was provided. The severity of pain was assessed with the numerical rating scale (NRS, an 11-point scale where 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst pain) at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after surgery. The primary endpoint was moderate to severe pain (NRS pain score ≥4) within 48 hours after surgery. Results The percentage with moderate to severe pain within 48 hours was lower in the epidural morphine group than in the placebo group (58.2% [32/55] with epidural morphine vs. 76.4% [42/55] with placebo; OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19–0.98; p = 0.042). Furthermore, the cumulative morphine consumption within 48 hours was lower (18.4±6.1 mg vs. 22.4±7.3 mg; p = 0.002) whereas the mental component summary score of 30-day quality of life was higher (63.8±2.9 vs. 61.9±4.2; p = 0.008) in the epidural morphine group than in the placebo group. Conclusions For patients following TKA, the addition of epidural morphine to single-injection femoral nerve block improves the quality of analgesia within 48 hours, without increasing adverse events.

https://openalex.org/W2954949014,"Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) signaling is essential for normal biological processes and disruption of this regulation can lead to tumor initiation and progression. Cbl proteins (Cbl, Cbl-b and Cbl-c) are a family of RING finger (RF) ubiquitin ligases that negatively regulate a variety of RTKs, including EGFR, MET, and RET. Recent studies have identified Cbl mutations associated with human myeloid neoplasias in approximately 5% of the cases. Cbl-c is the most recently identified human Cbl protein and is expressed exclusively in epithelial cells. We identified a novel cDNA that was isolated from a mouse mammary cancer from the C3(1) Large T Antigen transgenic model. This mutant cDNA encodes a protein that has a deletion in the RF domain of Cbl-c, thereby resembling known Cbl family mutations associated with myeoloid neoplasias. Genomic analysis of both parental and transgenic lines shows no evidence of germline mutation indicating that this mutation is likely a somatic mutation. The mutant protein enhances transformation of NIH 3T3 cells when expressed in combination with SV40 Large T antigen. Together these data are consistent with a second hit mutation. In overexpression studies, this mutant Cbl-c protein fails to mediate ubiquitination of activated EGFR and acts in a dominant negative fashion to prevent ubiquitination and downregulation of the activated EGFR by wild type Cbl proteins. Mechanistically, the mutant Cbl-c binds to the EGFR and prevents recruitment of the wild type Cbl protein. Furthermore, data mining reveals Cbl-c mutations associated with solid tumors in humans. Subsequent cell-based analysis demonstrates a similar loss of E3 function and dominant negative effects for one of these human mutations. These data suggest that like Cbl mutations in myeloid neoplasms, loss of Cbl-c function may contribute to the pathogenesis of solid tumors in murine models and in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2954871667,"Newborn infants have a high disposition to develop systemic inflammatory response syndromes (SIRSs) upon inflammatory or infectious challenges. Moreover, there is a considerable trafficking of hematopoietic cells to tissues already under noninflammatory conditions. These age-specific characteristics suggest a hitherto unappreciated crucial role of the vascular endothelium during the neonatal period. Here, we demonstrate that healthy neonates showed already strong endothelial baseline activation, which was mediated by a constitutively increased production of TNF-α. In mice, pharmacological inhibition of TNF-α directly after birth prevented subsequent fatal SIRS but completely abrogated the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of infection. Importantly, in healthy neonates, blocking TNF-α at birth disrupted the physiologic leukocyte trafficking, which resulted in persistently altered leukocyte profiles at barrier sites. Collectively, these data suggest that constitutive TNF-α—mediated sterile endothelial activation in newborn infants contributes to the increased risk of developing SIRS but is needed to ensure the postnatal recruitment of leukocytes to organs and interfaces.—Bickes, M.

https://openalex.org/W2955435177,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a brain tumor that remains largely incurable because of its highly-infiltrative properties. Nuclear factor I (NFI)-type transcription factors regulate genes associated with GBM cell migration and infiltration. We have previously shown that NFI activity depends on the NFI phosphorylation state and that calcineurin phosphatase dephosphorylates and activates NFI. Calcineurin is cleaved and activated by calpain proteases whose activity is, in turn, regulated by an endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin (CAST). The CAST gene is a target of NFI in GBM cells, with differentially phosphorylated NFIs regulating the levels of CAST transcript variants. Here, we uncovered an NFIB–calpain 1-positive feedback loop mediated through CAST and calcineurin. In NFI-hyperphosphorylated GBM cells, NFIB expression decreased the CAST–to–calpain 1 ratio in the cytoplasm. This reduced ratio increased autolysis and activity of cytoplasmic calpain 1. Conversely, in NFI-hypophosphorylated cells, NFIB expression induced differential subcellular compartmentalization of CAST and calpain 1, with CAST localizing primarily to the cytoplasm and calpain 1 to the nucleus. Overall, this altered compartmentalization increased nuclear calpain 1 activity. We also show that nuclear calpain 1, by cleaving and activating calcineurin, induces NFIB dephosphorylation. Of note, knockdown of calpain 1, NFIB, or both increased GBM cell migration and up-regulated the pro-migratory factors fatty acid–binding protein 7 (FABP7) and Ras homolog family member A (RHOA). In summary, our findings reveal bidirectional cross-talk between NFIB and calpain 1 in GBM cells.

The best-characterized calpains, calpain 1 (μ-calpain) and calpain 2 (m-calpain), are named based on the amount of calcium required for their activation in vitro: micro (μ)- or milli (m)-molar Ca2+ concentrations (21Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83 (12843408): 731-80110.1152/physrev.00029.2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). Both calpains 1 and 2 function as heterodimers, composed of a distinct large subunit, CAPN1 (for μ-calpain) or CAPN2 (for m-calpain), and a shared smaller subunit (CAPSN1) (22Storr S.J. Carragher N.O. Frame M.C. Parr T. Martin S.G. The calpain system and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11 (21508973): 364-37410.1038/nrc3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Calpain can either promote or inhibit cell migration depending on cell type. For example, inhibition of calpain 1 activity results in reduced platelet cell spreading (23Croce K. Flaumenhaft R. Rivers M. Furie B. Furie B.C. Herman I.M. Potter D.A. Inhibition of calpain blocks platelet secretion, aggregation, and spreading.J. Biol.

In contrast, inhibition of calpain 1 activity promotes random neutrophil migration (24Lokuta M.A. Nuzzi P.A. Huttenlocher A. Calpain regulates neutrophil chemotaxis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100 (12649322): 4006-401110.1073/pnas.0636533100Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, calpain 1 has been shown to prevent endothelial cell spreading as the result of calpain 1-mediated proteolysis of RhoA, a key factor in cell migration (25Kulkarni S. Goll D.E. Fox J.E. Calpain cleaves RhoA generating a dominant-negative form that inhibits integrin-induced actin filament assembly and cell spreading.J. Biol.

Soon after its discovery, calpain was shown to undergo autoproteolysis (or autolysis) (21Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83 (12843408): 731-80110.1152/physrev.00029.2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). Autolyzed calpain requires lower calcium to reach half-maximal activity and thus is more active compared with full-length calpain (26Li H. Thompson V.F. Goll D.E. Effects of autolysis on properties of μ- and m-calpain.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1691 (15110990): 91-10310.1016/j.bbamcr.2003.12.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, autolyzed calpain is also more unstable and prone to degradation and/or aggregation, the latter resulting in its inactivation (26Li H. Thompson V.F. Goll D.E. Effects of autolysis on properties of μ- and m-calpain.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1691 (15110990): 91-10310.1016/j.bbamcr.2003.12.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This instability may protect cells from detrimental effects associated with hyperactive calpain. Calpain activity is also regulated by its highly-specific endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin (27Wendt A. Thompson V.F. Goll D.E. Interaction of calpastatin with calpain: a review.Biol. Chem. 2004; 385 (15255177): 465-47210.1515/BC.2004.054Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Binding of calpastatin to calpain not only inhibits its activity, but also prevents full autolysis of calpain leading to accumulation of the full-length form (28Melloni E. Michetti M. Salamino F. Minafra R. Pontremoli S. Modulation of the calpain autoproteolysis by calpastatin and phospholipids.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229 (8954105): 193-19710.1006/bbrc.1996.1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because calpastatin and calpain are ubiquitously expressed, their ratio and/or subcellular distributions may determine the level of calpain proteolytic activity within a cell. Calpains can be inhibited by a wide array of exogenous inhibitors, including calpain inhibitor I (ALLN), a membrane-permeable synthetic peptide that specifically targets both calpain 1 and 2 in vitro (29Donkor I.O. Calpain inhibitors: a survey of compounds reported in the patent and scientific literature.Expert Opin. Ther.

By differentially regulating the usage of CAST canonical and alternative promoters, NFI can alter the relative levels of CAST variants encoding full-length versus truncated calpastatin in GBM cells, with accompanying changes in the subcellular localization of calpastatin (33Vo T.M.

Here, we show that NFIB regulation of CAST variants, and therefore calpastatin isoforms, affects calpain 1 levels and calpain 1 subcellular distribution in GBM cells. In turn, calpain 1 induces NFIB dephosphorylation through activation of calcineurin. This NFIB–calpain 1-positive feedback loop suppresses GBM cell migration but does not affect GBM cell survival. We have previously shown that the expression of CAST variants in GBM cells depends on the NFI phosphorylation state (33Vo T.M. Burchett R. Brun M. Monckton E.A. Poon H.Y. Godbout R.

To examine how differentially-phosphorylated NFI affects calpastatin protein levels, we transiently transfected T98 (NFI-hyperphosphorylated) and U251 (NFI-hypophosphorylated) GBM cells (13Bisgrove D.A.

Knocking down individual NFIs in NFI-hypophosphorylated U251 cells resulted in increased levels of calpastatin (Fig. 1A, left panel), with NFI overexpression having no effect on calpastatin (data not shown). In contrast, NFI depletion in NFI-hyperphosphorylated T98 GBM cells had no effect on calpastatin levels (data not shown). However, NFI overexpression reduced calpastatin levels (Fig. 1A, right panel). These data indicate that all four NFIs, through regulation of CAST variants, suppress the expression of calpastatin in GBM cells. Of note, the calpastatin antibody used for these experiments is specific to full-length calpastatin (∼145 kDa), which has four calpain inhibitory domains (I–IV), the XL and the L N-terminal domains. Calpastatin is an endogenous inhibitor of calpain. Because NFIs affect levels of calpastatin, we were interested in whether NFIs might also affect calpain activity through a calpastatin feedforward loop. First, however, we wanted to ensure that NFI did not directly regulate calpain genes, as this would negate the need for a calpastatin-mediated feedforward loop. To address this possibility, we transiently transfected U87 and U251 GBM cells with siRNAs targeting each NFI member and carried out RT-qPCR using primers flanking the large subunit of calpain 1 (CAPN1), the large subunit of calpain 2 (CAPN2), and the small subunit (CAPSN1) that is shared by both calpains. Depletion of NFIs did not significantly affect CAPN1, CAPN2, and CAPSN1 RNA levels (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, NFI does not appear to regulate the transcription of calpain genes. In line with these results, we did not identify NFI-binding sites in the promoter regions of CAPN1, CAPN2, and CAPSN1, based on in silico analysis. Of the four NFIs, the role of NFIB in cancer is the best documented (35Stringer B.W. Bunt J. Day B.W. Barry G. Jamieson P.R. Ensbey K.S. Bruce Z.C. Goasdoué K. Vidal H. Charmsaz S. Smith F.M.

To determine whether NFIB-mediated regulation of CAST affects calpains 1 and 2, we transiently transfected NFI-hyperphosphorylated U87 and NFI-hypophosphorylated U251 GBM cells (13Bisgrove D.A. Monckton E.A. Packer M. Godbout R. Regulation of brain fatty acid-binding protein expression by differential phosphorylation of nuclear factor I in malignant glioma cell lines.J. Biol.

Because calpain-mediated proteolysis of downstream effectors depends on the subcellular location of calpain, we carried out nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation to investigate whether NFIB differentially affects calpain levels in these two cellular compartments. Knocking down NFIB in U87 GBM cells had no effect on either the cytoplasmic or nuclear levels of calpain 2 (Fig. 2, A and B, left panels) but resulted in increased levels of full-length calpain 1 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A, left panel). Levels of calpain 1 in the nucleus were not affected (Fig. 2B, left panel). As depletion of NFIB in GBM cells increased overall levels of calpastatin (Fig. 1A), and calpastatin binds and inhibits calpain autolysis, our combined results suggest that hyperphosphorylated NFIB in U87 cells promotes activation of cytoplasmic calpain 1. In contrast, depletion of NFIB in NFI-hypophosphorylated U251 cells had no effect on cytoplasmic calpain 1 (Fig. 2A, right panel) but led to a decrease in levels of an ∼55-kDa autolyzed form of calpain 1 in the nucleus (Fig. 2B, right panel). Of note, we did not detect full-length calpain 1 in the nucleus of either U87 or U251 cells, suggesting that either autolysis of calpain 1 is required for its nuclear translocation or calpain 1 autolysis occurs with higher efficacy in the nucleus. These data suggest that hypophosphorylated NFIB can indirectly influence levels of nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, calpain 1. We used α-tubulin and lamin A/C as the loading controls for the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively. NFIB knockdown efficiency is shown in both cell lines (Fig. 2C). Because NFIB depletion affected calpain 1, but not calpain 2, we focused on calpain 1 in subsequent experiments. Next, we used immunostaining analysis to examine the effect of NFIB depletion on the subcellular distribution of calpastatin and calpain 1. In NFI-hyperphosphorylated U87 cells, calpastatin was found throughout the cytoplasm with little to no calpastatin in the nucleus. NFIB depletion resulted in increased aggregation of calpastatin surrounding the nucleus, with no apparent effect on nuclear calpastatin (Fig. 3A, arrow). These two patterns of localization have been reported for calpastatin in other systems (38Averna M. De Tullio R. Capini P. Salamino F. Pontremoli S. Melloni E.

Similarly, NFIB depletion in U87 cells resulted in increased cytoplasmic aggregation of calpain 1 to one side of the cell (see arrow, Fig. 3, A and C, left panel). These observations suggest an association between hyperphosphorylated NFIB and disaggregation of cytoplasmic calpastatin and calpain 1. We have previously shown that calpastatin has a perinuclear distribution in NFI-hypophosphorylated U251 cells, with NFIB depletion resulting in increased levels of nuclear calpastatin (33Vo T.M.

Here, we show that calpain 1 is primarily in the nucleus of U251 cells (Fig. 3B). NFIB knockdown resulted in decreased levels of nuclear calpain 1 (Fig. 3C, right panel), presumably the autolyzed form of calpain 1 based on our Western blottings (Fig. 3B). These results point to a role for hypophosphorylated NFIB in the differential localization of calpastatin (to the cytoplasm) and calpain 1 (to the nucleus).

To evaluate the pertussis burden and vaccine efficacy, diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance should be based on accurate and valid diagnostic methods. Recently, the serodiagnostic tests Novagnost Bordetella pertussis IgA and IgM were approved in Japan for pertussis diagnostics. Although the anti-pertussis toxin (PT) IgG assay has been used for pertussis diagnosis worldwide, little is known about the anti-B. pertussis IgA and IgM assays. In this study, serum samples from 460 healthy donors were examined to determine the seroprevalence of anti-B. pertussis IgA and IgM in a Japanese population, and its correlation with donor age. Our data demonstrated that anti-B. pertussis IgA and IgM are positively and negatively correlated with age (r = 0.27, r = -0.37; P < 0.001, respectively). Age-specific analysis revealed high titers of anti-B. pertussis IgA in adults (46-50 years), while anti-B. pertussis IgM titers were high in schoolchildren (6-10, 11-15 years). When applying the arbitrary cut-off values for these ages, 17.6% and 39.5% of healthy donors were interpreted as pertussis-positive or indeterminate with anti-B. pertussis IgA (46-50 years) and IgM (11-15 years) titers, respectively. Overall, our findings indicated that the Novagnost Bordetella pertussis IgA and IgM testing could be greatly affected by subject age, limiting its value for pertussis diagnosis."

Retesting for verification of all HIV-positive cases prior to antiretroviral therapy initiation can reduce HIV misdiagnosis, yet this practice has not been not widely implemented. Methods We evaluated and compared the cost of retesting for verification of HIV seropositivity (retesting) to the cost of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for misdiagnosed cases in the absence of retesting (no retesting), from the perspective of the health care system. We estimated the number of misdiagnosed cases based on a review of misdiagnosis rates, and the number of positives persons needing ART initiation by 2020. We presented the total and per person costs of retesting as compared to no retesting, over a ten-year horizon, across 50 countries in Africa grouped by income level. We conducted univariate sensitivity analysis on all model input parameters, and threshold analysis to evaluate the parameter values where the total costs of retesting and the costs no retesting are equivalent. Cost data were adjusted to 2017 United States Dollars. Results and discussion The estimated number of misdiagnoses, in the absence of retesting was 156,117, 52,720 and 29,884 for lower-income countries (LICs), lower-middle income countries (LMICs), and upper middle-income countries (UMICs), respectively, totaling 240,463 for Africa. Under the retesting scenario, costs per person initially diagnosed were: $40, $21, and $42, for LICs, LMICs, and UMICs, respectively. When retesting for verification is implemented, the savings in unnecessary ART were $125, $43, and $75 per person initially diagnosed, for LICs, LMICs, and UMICs, respectively. Over the ten-year horizon, the total costs under the retesting scenario, over all country income levels, was $475 million, and was $1.192 billion under the no retesting scenario, representing total estimated savings of $717 million in HIV treatment costs averted. Conclusions Results show that to reduce HIV misdiagnosis, countries in Africa should implement the WHO’s recommendation of retesting for verification prior to ART initiation, as part of a comprehensive quality assurance program for HIV testing services."
https://openalex.org/W2953497142,"LL-37 is the only human cathelicidin-family host defense peptide and has been reported to interact with invading pathogens causing inflammation at various body sites. Recent studies showed high levels of LL-37 in the synovial-lining membrane of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a common type of inflammatory arthritis. The present study aims to investigate the role of LL-37 on mechanisms associated with pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis. The effects of LL-37 on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, hyaluronan (HA) metabolism-related genes, cell death-related pathways, and cell invasion were investigated in SW982, a human synovial sarcoma cell line. Time-course measurements of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators showed that LL-37 significantly induced IL6 and IL17A mRNA levels at early time points (3-6 hr). HA-metabolism-related genes (i.e., HA synthase 2 (HAS2), HAS3, hyaluronidase 1 (HYAL1), HYAL2, and CD44) were co-expressed in parallel. In combination, LL-37 and IL17A significantly enhanced PTGS2, TNF, and HAS3 gene expression concomitantly with the elevation of their respective products, PGE2, TNF, and HA. Cell invasion rates and FN1 gene expression were also significantly enhanced. However, LL-37 alone or combined with IL17A did not affect cell mortality or cell cycle. Treatment of SW982 cells with both LL-37 and IL17A significantly enhanced IKK and p65 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that the chronic production of a high level of LL-37 may synchronize with its downstream proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL17A, contributing to the co-operative enhancement of pathogenesis mechanisms of inflammatory arthritis, such as high production of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators together with the activation of HA-metabolism-associated genes and cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2953613635,"The current study measured the influence of milk of subclinically infected glands by different bacteria species on the cow’s milk. The effects of bacterial infection or inflammation on gland milk yield were related to the bacteria species that caused the infection. The volume of milk of the inflamed gland from the cow’s milk yield was significantly lower (P<0.001) for the glands previously infected by Escherichia coli (PIEc) and those infected with Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Coagulation properties, rennet clotting time (RCT) and curd firmness (CF) also depended on the bacteria causing the infection. RCT values of all the inflamed glands were significantly longer (P<0.001) and CF values were significantly lower than that of the healthy ones. Moreover, in the whole milk, CF was also significantly lower and not proportional to the volume of the milk from the inflamed gland of the cow’s milk. Calculation of the predicted 40% dry matter curd weight (PCW) on the cow level, including the healthy and inflamed glands or the healthy glands alone, showed that for 10 of 13 PIEc cows, the presence of the affected gland’s milk in the whole cow milk resulted in a lower PCW value. Likewise, 7 of 20 cows infected by S. dysgalactiae had negative delta values. Unlike the latter bacteria, PCW from milk of glands infected with CNS increased, although in a lower magnitude than in the healthy glands. No correlation was found between logSCC in the whole cow milk (healthy and inflamed glands) and PCW."
https://openalex.org/W2954563413,"Colonization of the oropharynx is the initial step in Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngeal infection. We have previously reported that the highly virulent M1T1 GAS clone attaches to oral epithelial cells via M1 protein interaction with blood group antigen carbohydrate structures. Here, we have identified that colonization of human oral epithelial cells by GAS serotypes M3 and M12 is mediated by human blood group antigens [ABO(H)] and Lewis (Le) antigen expression. Removal of linkage-specific fucose, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, and sialic acid modulated GAS colonization, dependent on host ABO(H) blood group and Le expression profile. Furthermore, N-linked glycans from human salivary glycoproteins, when released and purified, were potent inhibitors of M1, M3, and M12 GAS colonization ex vivo. These data highlight the important role played by human protein glycosylation patterns in GAS attachment to oral epithelial cell surfaces.-De Oliveira, D. M.

https://openalex.org/W2955311757,"The main goal of this study was to investigate the reliability of muscle strength across different levels of obesity. A sample of 142 healthy subjects performed maximum voluntary isometric contractions for shoulder flexion and trunk extension on each of four days. Subjects were recruited into one of three groups, non-obese, overweight, or obese, based on body mass index (BMI). Reliability of the strength measurements within each session and across the four sessions was determined from the intraclass correlation coefficient, coefficient of repeatability, coefficient of variation, and standard error of measurement. For the shoulder flexion measures, the coefficient of variation was 0.75. The absolute reliability of trunk extension strength measurement was rejected due to a high variability across sessions. For both tasks, comparable strengths across the BMI groups were found."
https://openalex.org/W2955355830,"In systems biology, inference of functional associations among genes is compelling because the construction of functional association networks facilitates biomarker discovery. Specifically, such gene associations in human can help identify putative biomarkers that can be used as diagnostic tools in treating patients. Although biomedical literature is considered a valuable data source for this task, currently only a limited number of webservers are available for mining gene-gene associations from the vast amount of biomedical literature using text mining techniques. Moreover, these webservers often have limited coverage of biomedical literature and also lack efficient and user-friendly tools to interpret and visualize mined relationships among genes. To address these limitations, we developed GAIL (Gene-gene Association Inference based on biomedical Literature), an interactive webserver that infers human gene-gene associations from Gene Ontology (GO) guided biomedical literature mining and provides dynamic visualization of the resulting association networks and various gene set enrichment analysis tools. We evaluate the utility and performance of GAIL with applications to gene signatures associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and breast cancer. Results show that GAIL allows effective interrogation and visualization of gene-gene networks and their subnetworks, which facilitates biological understanding of gene-gene associations. GAIL is available at http://chunglab.io/GAIL/."
https://openalex.org/W2955558236,"Inhalation of Bacillus anthracis spores can lead to an anthrax infection that can be fatal. Previously published mathematical models have extrapolated kinetic rates associated with bacterial growth in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits to humans, but to date, actual measurements of the underlying processes associated with anthrax virulence between species have not been conducted. To address this knowledge gap, we have quantified species-specific rate constants associated with germination, proliferation, and immune cell inactivation of B. anthracis Sterne using an in vitro test platform that includes primary lung epithelial and immune cells. The generated data was then used to develop a physiologically based biokinetic model (PBBK) which quantitatively compares bacterial growth and mean time to death under lethal conditions in rabbits and humans. Simulations based upon our in vitro data and previously published in vivo data from rabbits indicate that disease progression is likely to be faster in humans than in NZW rabbits under comparable total deposited dose conditions. With the computational framework established, PBBK parameters can now be refined using experimental data for lethal B. anthracis strains (e.g. Ames) under identical conditions in future studies. The PBBK model can also be linked to existing aerosol dosimetry models that account for species-specific differences in aerosol deposition patterns to further improve the human health risk assessment of inhalation anthrax."
https://openalex.org/W2955921719,"Background Over the past 15 years, scaling up of cost effective interventions resulted in a remarkable decline of under-five mortality rates (U5MR) in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the reduction shows considerable heterogeneity. We estimated the association of child, maternal, and household interventions with U5MR in Burkina Faso at national and subnational levels and identified the regions with least effective interventions. Methods Data on health-related interventions and U5MR were extracted from the Burkina Faso Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2010. Bayesian geostatistical proportional hazards models with a Weibull baseline hazard were fitted on the mortality outcome. Spatially varying coefficients were considered to assess the geographical variation in the association of the health interventions with U5MR. The analyses were adjusted for child, maternal, and household characteristics, as well as climatic and environmental factors. Findings The average U5MR was as high as 128 per 1000 ranging from 81 (region of Centre-Est) to 223 (region of Sahel). At national level, DPT3 immunization and baby post-natal check within 24 hours after birth had the most important association with U5MR (hazard rates ratio (HRR) = 0.89, 95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 0.86–0.98 and HRR = 0.89, 95% BCI: 0.86–0.92, respectively). At sub-national level, the most effective interventions are the skilled birth attendance, and improved drinking water, followed by baby post-natal check within 24 hours after birth, vitamin A supplementation, antenatal care visit and all-antigens immunization (including BCG, Polio3, DPT3, and measles immunization). Centre-Est, Sahel, and Sud-Ouest were the regions with the highest number of effective interventions. There was no intervention that had a statistically important association with child survival in the region of Hauts Bassins. Interpretation The geographical variation in the magnitude and statistical importance of the association between health interventions and U5MR raises the need to deliver and reinforce health interventions at a more granular level. Priority interventions are DPT3 immunization, skilled birth attendance, baby post-natal visits in the regions of Sud-Ouest, Sahel, and Hauts Bassins, respectively. Our methodology could be applied to other national surveys, as it allows an incisive, data-driven and specific decision-making approach to optimize the allocation of health interventions at subnational level."
https://openalex.org/W2767057177,"We explore how the mechanics of collective decision-making, especially of jury deliberation, can be inferred from macroscopic statistics. We first hypothesize that the dynamics of competing opinions can leave a ""fingerprint"" in the joint distribution of final votes and time to reach a decision. We probe this hypothesis by modeling jury datasets from different states collected in different years and identifying which of the models best explains opinion dynamics in juries. In our best-fit model, individual jurors have a ""herding"" tendency to adopt the majority opinion of the jury, but as the amount of time they have held their current opinion increases, so too does their resistance to changing their opinion (what we call ""increasing stubbornness""). By contrast, other models without increasing stubbornness, or without herding, create poorer fits to data. Our findings suggest that both stubbornness and herding play an important role in collective decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2954475687,"The circadian clock is important for cellular and organ function. However, its function in sickle cell disease (SCD), a life-threatening hemolytic disorder, remains unknown. Here, we performed an unbiased microarray screen, which revealed significantly altered expression of circadian rhythmic genes, inflammatory response genes, and iron metabolic genes in SCD Berkeley transgenic mouse lungs compared with controls. Given the vital role of period 2 (Per2) in the core clock and the unrecognized role of Per2 in SCD, we transplanted the bone marrow (BM) of SCD mice to Per2Luciferase mice, which revealed that Per2 expression was up-regulated in SCD mouse lung. Next, we transplanted the BM of SCD mice to period 1 (Per1)/Per2 double deficient [Per1/Per2 double knockout (dKO)] and wild-type mice, respectively. We discovered that Per1/Per2 dKO mice transplanted with SCD BM (SCD → Per1/Per2 dKO) displayed severe irradiation sensitivity and were more susceptible to an early death. Although we observed an increase of peripheral inflammatory cells, we did not detect differences in erythrocyte sickling. However, there was further lung damage due to elevated pulmonary congestion, inflammatory cell infiltration, iron overload, and secretion of IL-6 in lavage fluid. Overall, we demonstrate that Per1/Per2 is beneficial to counteract elevated systemic inflammation, lung tissue inflammation, and iron overload in SCD.—Adebiyi, M.

https://openalex.org/W2955589145,"Background Funding shortages and an ageing population have increased pressures on state or insurance funded end of life care for older people. Across the world, policy debate has arisen about the potential role volunteers can play, working alongside health and social care professionals in the community to support and care for the ageing and dying. Aims The authors examined self-reported levels of care for the elderly by the public in England, and public opinions of community volunteering concepts to care for the elderly at the end of life. In particular, claimed willingness to help and to be helped by local people was surveyed. Methods A sample of 3,590 adults in England aged 45 or more from an online access panel responded to a questionnaire in late 2017. The survey data was weighted to be representative of the population within this age band. Key literature and formative qualitative research informed the design of the survey questionnaire, which was further refined after piloting. Results Preferences for different models of community volunteering were elicited. There was a preference for ‘formal’ models with increased wariness of ‘informal’ features. Whilst 32% of adults said they ‘might join’ depending on whom the group helped, unsurprisingly more personal and demanding types of help significantly reduced the claimed willingness to help. Finally, willingness to help (or be helped) by local community carers or volunteers was regarded as less attractive than care being provided by personal family, close friends or indeed health and care professionals. Conclusion Findings suggest that if community volunteering to care for elderly people at the end of life in England is to expand it may require considerable attention to the model including training for volunteers and protections for patients and volunteers as well as public education and promotion. Currently, in England, there is a clear preference for non-medical care to be delivered by close family or social care professionals, with volunteer community care regarded only as a back-up option."
https://openalex.org/W2955743537,"Previous research findings supporting the advantages of the go/no-go choice over the yes/no choice in lexical decision task (LDT) have suggested that the go/no-go choice might require less cognitive resources in the non-decisional processes. This study aims to test such an idea using the event-related potential method. In this study, the tasks (yes/no LDT and go/no-go LDT) and word frequency (high and low) were manipulated, and the difference between the go/no-go choice and yes/no choice were examined with BP, pN, pN1, P200, N400, and P3 components that were assumed to be closely related with the various parameters in the diffusion model. The results showed that BP, pN and pN1 amplitudes reflecting the preparation stage were not differently affected by word frequency and the task type. However, ERPs after stimulus onset showed differences. The P200 amplitudes were smaller in the go/no-go task than in the yes/no task only for low-frequency words. N400 and P3 amplitudes were only affected by word frequency. The results suggest that the go/no-go task and the yes/no task differ in sub-lexical processes, which is indicated in the Tencoding parameter in the diffusion model. This study is important as it offers the first electrophysiological evidence supporting the assumption in the diffusion model that explains the advantage of the go/no-go choice over the yes/no choice."

https://openalex.org/W2955781944,"Tolvaptan is the only drug approved to slow cyst growth and preserve kidney function in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, its limited efficacy combined with significant side effects underscores the need to identify new and safe therapeutic drug targets to slow progression to end stage kidney disease. We identified Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 (DDR1) as receptor tyrosine kinase upregulated in vivo in 3 mouse models of ADPKD using a novel mass spectrometry approach to identify kinases upregulated in ADPKD. Previous studies demonstrating critical roles for DDR1 to cancer progression, its potential role in the pathogenesis of a variety of other kidney disease, along with the possibility that DDR1 could provide new insight into how extracellular matrix impacts cyst growth led us to study the role of DDR1 in ADPKD pathogenesis. However, genetic deletion of DDR1 using CRISPR/Cas9 failed to slow cyst growth or preserve kidney function in both a rapid and slow mouse model of ADPKD demonstrating that DDR1 does not play a role in PKD pathogenesis and is thus a not viable drug target. In spite of the negative results, our studies will be of interest to the nephrology community as it will prevent others from potentially conducting similar experiments on DDR1 and reinforces the potential of performing unbiased screens coupled with in vivo gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 to rapidly identify and confirm new potential drug targets for ADPKD."
https://openalex.org/W2955724588,"Cul4b-null (Cul4bΔ/Y) mice undergo growth arrest and degeneration during the early embryonic stages and die at E9.5. The pathogenic causes of this lethality remain incompletely characterized. However, it has been hypothesized that the loss of Cul4b function in extraembryonic tissues plays a key role. In this study, we investigated possible causes of death for Cul4b-null embryos, particularly in regard to the role of embryonic Cul4b. First, we show that the loss of embryonic Cul4b affects the growth of the inner cell mass in vitro and delays epiblast development during the gastrulation period at E6.5~E7.5 in vivo, as highlighted by the absence of the epiblastic transcription factor Brachyury from E6.5~E7.5. Additionally, at E7.5, strong and laterally expanded expression of Eomes and Fgf8 signaling was detected. Sectioning of these embryos showed disorganized primitive streak layer cells. Second, we observed that Mash2-expressing cells were present in the extraembryonic tissues of Cul4b-deficient embryos at E6.5 but were absent at E7.5. In addition, the loss of Cul4b resulted in decreased expression of cyclin proteins, which are required for the cell cycle transition from G1 to S. Taken together, these observations suggest that the embryonic expression of Cul4b is important for epiblast growth during E6.5~E7.5, and the loss of Cul4b results in either delayed growth of the epiblast or defective localization of primitive streak layer cells. As a result, the signaling activity mediated by the epiblast for subsequent ectoplacental cone development is affected, with the potential to induce growth retardation and lethality in Cul4bΔ/Y embryos."
