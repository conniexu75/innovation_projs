https://openalex.org/W2920016582,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a common base signal used to monitor brain activity and diagnose sleep disorders. Manual sleep stage scoring is a time-consuming task for sleep experts and is limited by inter-rater reliability. In this paper, we propose an automatic sleep stage annotation method called SleepEEGNet using a single-channel EEG signal. The SleepEEGNet is composed of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract time-invariant features, frequency information, and a sequence to sequence model to capture the complex and long short-term context dependencies between sleep epochs and scores. In addition, to reduce the effect of the class imbalance problem presented in the available sleep datasets, we applied novel loss functions to have an equal misclassified error for each sleep stage while training the network. We evaluated the proposed method on different single-EEG channels (i.e., Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz EEG channels) from the Physionet Sleep-EDF datasets published in 2013 and 2018. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved the best annotation performance compared to current literature, with an overall accuracy of 84.26%, a macro F1-score of 79.66% and Cohen's Kappa coefficient = 0.79. Our developed model is ready to test with more sleep EEG signals and aid the sleep specialists to arrive at an accurate diagnosis.

https://openalex.org/W2944656561,"Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is an increasing burden for global health. The prevalence of ABR in Southeast Asia is among the highest worldwide, especially in relation to hospital-acquired infections (HAI) in intensive care units (ICU). However, little is known about morbidity and mortality attributable to ABR in neonates.This study aimed to assess mortality and the length of hospitalization attributable to ABR in gram-negative bacteria (GNB) causing HAI in a Vietnamese neonatal ICU (NICU).We conducted a prospective cohort study (n = 296) in a NICU in Hanoi, Vietnam, from March 2016 to October 2017. Patients isolated with HAI caused by GNB were included. The exposure was resistance to multiple antibiotic classes, the two outcomes were mortality and length of hospital stay (LOS). Data were analysed using two regression models, controlling for confounders and effect modifiers such as co-morbidities, time at risk, severity of illness, sex, age, and birthweight.The overall case fatality rate was 44.3% and the 30 days mortality rate after infection was 31.8%. For every additional resistance to an antibiotic class, the odds of a fatal outcome increased by 27% and LOS increased by 2.1 days. These results were statistically significant (p < 0.05).ABR was identified as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes in neonates with HAI. These findings are generally in line with previous research in children and adults. However, heterogeneous study designs, the neglect of important confounders and varying definitions of ABR impair the validity, reliability, and comparability of results."
https://openalex.org/W2944014825,"Municipalities are embracing greening initiatives as a key strategy for improving urban sustainability and combatting the environmental impacts of expansive urbanization. Many greening initiatives include goals to increase urban canopy cover through tree planting, however, our understanding of street tree ecosystem dynamics is limited and our understanding of vegetation structure and function based on intact, rural forests does not apply well to urban ecosystems. In this study, we estimate size-specific growth, mortality, and planting rates in trees under municipal control, use a box model to forecast short-term changes in street tree aboveground carbon pools under several planting and management scenarios, and compare our findings to rural, forested systems. We find accelerated rates of carbon cycling in street trees with mean diameter growth rates nearly four times faster in Boston, MA, USA (0.78 ± 0.02 cm yr-1) than in rural forest stands of MA (0.21 ± 0.02 cm yr-1) and mean mortality rates more than double rural forested rates (3.06 ± 0.25% yr-1 in street trees; 1.41 ± 0.04% yr-1 in rural trees). Despite the enhanced growth of urban trees, high mortality losses result in a net loss of street tree carbon storage over time (-0.15 ± 0.09 Mg C ha-1 yr-1). Planting initiatives alone may not be sufficient to maintain or enhance canopy cover and biomass due to the unique demographics of urban ecosystems. Initiatives to aid in the establishment and preservation of tree health are central for increasing street tree canopy cover and maintaining/increasing carbon storage in vegetation. Strategic combinations of planting and maintenance will maximize the viability of greening initiatives as an effective climate mitigation tool."
https://openalex.org/W2943952563,"High performance materials, from natural bone over ancient damascene steel to modern superalloys, typically possess a complex structure at the microscale. Their properties exceed those of the individual components and their knowledge-based improvement therefore requires understanding beyond that of the components’ individual behaviour. Electron microscopy has been instrumental in unravelling the most important mechanisms of co-deformation and in-situ deformation experiments have emerged as a popular and accessible technique. However, a challenge remains: to achieve high spatial resolution and statistical relevance in combination. Here, we overcome this limitation by using panoramic imaging and machine learning to study damage in a dual-phase steel. This high-throughput approach now gives us strain and microstructure dependent insights into the prevalent damage mechanisms and allows the separation of inclusions and deformation–induced damage across a large area of this heterogeneous material. Aiming for the first time at automated classification of the majority of damage sites rather than only the most distinct, the new method also encourages us to expand current research past interpretation of exemplary cases of distinct damage sites towards the less clear-cut reality."
https://openalex.org/W2944390263,"Purpose Maintaining high adherence rates (session attendance and compliance) in exercise programs during breast cancer treatment can be challenging. We aimed to identify adherence rates and predictors to an exercise program during adjuvant breast cancer treatment. Methods Ninety-two patients with localized breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy were randomly assigned to an 18-week supervised moderate-to-high intensity aerobic and resistance exercise program, including two 1-hour sessions/week. Additionally, participants were asked to be physically active for at least 30 minutes/day on at least three other days. We report median percentages for attendance, compliance with the prescribed duration and intensity of aerobic and muscle strength exercises, and the exercise advice given. Predictors included in univariate and multivariable linear regression models were demographical, tumor- and treatment-related factors, constructs of the theory of planned behavior, psychological and physical factors. Results Patients attended 83% (interquartile range: 69–91%) of the supervised sessions. Compliance with the duration of aerobic exercise, high-intensity aerobic exercise (cycling at the ventilatory threshold), muscle strength exercises and the exercise advice were 88%(64–97%), 50%(22–82%), 84%(65–94%) and 61%(33%–79%), respectively. Education, radiotherapy, BMI and physical fatigue were important predictors of adherence to supervised exercise. Beliefs about planned behaviors were important predictors, especially for compliance with the exercise advice. Conclusions Attendance to and compliance with an 18-week aerobic and strength exercise program were high. The lowest compliance was found for high-intensity supervised aerobic exercise. The identified predictors should be considered when designing or adapting exercise programs for patients with localized breast cancer to increase adherence.

https://openalex.org/W2944004210,"While adult white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are apex predators with a circumglobal distribution, juvenile white sharks (JWS) feed primarily on bottom dwelling fishes and tend to be coastally associated. Despite the assumedly easier access to juveniles compared to large, migratory adults, limited information is available on the movements, environments, and distributions of individuals during this life stage. To quantify movement and understand their distribution in the southern California Bight, JWS were captured and fitted with dorsal fin-mounted satellite transmitters (SPOT tags; n = 18). Nine individuals crossed the U.S. border into Baja California, Mexico. Individuals used shallow habitats (134.96 ± 191.1 m) close to shore (7.16 ± 5.65 km). A generalized linear model with a binomial distribution was used to predict the presence of individuals based on several environmental predictors from these areas. Juveniles were found to select shallow habitats (< 1000 m deep) close to land (< 30 km of the shoreline) in waters ranging from 14 to 24°C. Southern California was found to be suitable eight months of the year, while coastal habitats in Baja California were suitable year-round. The model predicted seasonal movement with sharks moving from southern California to Baja California during winter. Additionally, habitat distribution changed inter-annually with sharks having a more northerly distribution during years with a higher Pacific Decadal Oscillation index, suggesting sharks may forego their annual fall migrations to Baja California, Mexico, during El Niño years. Model predictions aligned with fishery-dependent catch data, with a greater number of sharks being captured during periods and/or areas of increased habitat suitability. Thus, habitat models could be useful for predicting the presence of JWS in other areas, and can be used as a tool for potentially reducing fishery interactions during seasons and locations where there is increased susceptibility of incidental catch."
https://openalex.org/W2943902917,"In liver fibrosis, conversion of fibroblasts to profibrogenic myofibroblasts significantly drives the development of the disease. A crucial role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in regulation of fibroblast function has been reported. Increase in cAMP levels has been found to decrease fibroblast proliferation, inhibit their conversion to myofibroblast, and stimulate their death. cAMP is generated by adenyl cyclase (AC), and degraded by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE). In this study, the antifibrotic effect of a PDE inhibitor, cilostazol (Cilo), on a rat model of liver fibrosis induced by thioacetamide (TAA) was investigated. Four groups of rats were used; the first group received the vehicles and served as the normal control group, while liver fibrosis was induced in the other groups using (TAA, 200 mg/kg/biweekly for 8 successive weeks, ip). The last two groups were treated with Cilo (50 and 100 mg/kg/day, po, respectively). Induction of liver fibrosis in TAA-treated rats was observed as evidenced by the biochemical and histopathological findings. On the other hand, a potent antifibrotic effect was observed in the groups treated with Cilo, with preference to the higher dose. In these groups, a significant increase in the liver content of cAMP was demonstrated that was accompanied by reduction in the hepatic expression of key fibrogenic cytokines, growth factors, and inflammatory biomarkers, including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nuclear factor kappa B, and transforming growth factor-beta as compared to TAA group. Moreover, amelioration of TAA-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in the liver has been observed. These findings reveal the antifibrotic effect of Cilo against TAA-induced liver fibrosis in rats, and suggest regulation of cAMP pathway, together with the modulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis as mechanistic cassette underlines this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2944252635,"Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder associated with acute pain crisis and other complications that lead to frequent emergency department (ED) visits. To improve outcomes, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) published recommendations for management of acute pain crisis. NHLBI also funded eight centers across the United States to participate in the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium. This six-year effort consists of two phases. Phase one involved conducting needs assessments of barriers and facilitators to SCD care. The aim of this study was to describe challenges and facilitators to caring for SCD from the perspective of ED providers in central North Carolina (NC). Methods and findings We conducted a needs assessment survey with ED providers throughout NC. We also conducted focus groups and an interview with ED providers from three healthcare facilities in central NC. One hundred and eleven surveys (60.6% physicians, 26% registered nurses, 13.5% physician assistants) were completed and 13 providers participated in 3 focus groups and 1 interview. Slightly more than half (50. 4%) utilized individualized dosing protocols to treat sickle cell pain. Only 32.4% of the providers were aware of the NHLBI SCD recommendations. Barriers to care from the survey included: patient behavior (67.57%), the opioid epidemic (67.57%), overcrowding (64.86%), and concern about addiction (49.55%). Perceived barriers to care identified in the focus groups and interview included: high patient volumes, lack of SCD care protocols, poor communication among providers and stigma. Facilitators to care included: individualized pain plans, comfort prescribing opioids and electronic medical records. Conclusion SCD care is influenced by many factors. Our results illuminate the need for increased use of the NHLBI SCD recommendations, individualized pain protocols, and use of electronic medical records and other care-interventions, specifically geared towards improving provider knowledge and mitigating provider bias."
https://openalex.org/W2944264857,"Soluble klotho (sKlotho), the shed ectodomain of α-klotho, protects the heart by down-regulating transient receptor potential canonical isoform 6 (TRPC6)-mediated calcium signaling. Binding to α2-3-sialyllactose moiety of gangliosides in lipid rafts and inhibition of raft-dependent signaling underlies the mechanism. A recent 3-Å X-ray structure of sKlotho in complex with fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) indicates that its β6α6 loop might block access to the proposed binding site for α2-3-sialyllactose. It was concluded that sKlotho only functions in complex with FGFR and FGF23 and that sKlotho's pleiotropic effects all depend on FGF23. Here, we report that sKlotho can inhibit TRPC6 channels expressed in cells lacking endogenous FGFRs. Structural modeling and molecular docking show that a repositioned β6α6 loop allows sKlotho to bind α2-3-sialyllactose. Molecular dynamic simulations further show the α2-3-sialyllactose-bound sKlotho complex to be stable. Domains mimicking sKlotho's sialic acid-recognizing activity inhibit TRPC6. The results strongly support the hypothesis that sKlotho can exert effects independent of FGF23 and FGFR.-Wright, J. D., An, S.-W., Xie, J., Lim, C., Huang, C.-L. Soluble klotho regulates TRPC6 calcium signaling via lipid rafts, independent of the FGFR-FGF23 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2944575368,"Concussion among athletes is an issue of growing concern, with efforts underway to improve detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Success depends on communication by athletes, as brain-related symptoms are often not outwardly visible. Education programs to increase reporting behavior have not been successful to date. In accordance with the socioecological approach to health, we argue that multiple levels of influence on student athletes must be addressed, and report a multi-dimensional, mixed-methods research project conducted to identify possible points of intervention into changing the culture of concussion-injury reporting among collegiate athletes. Using quantitative, qualitative and interpretive methods, we examine the individual-level vested interests athletes have in reporting or not reporting concussion symptoms, and how these interests interact with community-level team culture and interpersonal relationships, and social-level cultural narratives to influence concussion-reporting behavior. Our findings confirm the viability of this approach, identifying immediacy, separation of responsibility and pain-enduring story systems as particularly salient elements. We conclude that competing performance versus safety value structures, reflected in cultural narratives and team culture, create mixed-messages for athletes, which are resolved in favor of performance because athletes perceive concussion injuries to be of low immediacy."
https://openalex.org/W2944246757,"Based on the calculation of the inclusive financial development level of 22 provinces and 4 municipalities in China from 2004 to 2017, this paper uses the Kernel density estimation method to further analyze the evolution of the inclusive financial index. Based on the above analysis, we make empirical analysis of the impact of China's inclusive financial inclusion development index on farmers' entrepreneurship using static panel and dynamic panel estimation method. The empirical conclusions show that there are certain differences in inclusive financial inclusion development level in various provinces in China. Improving the inclusion development level of inclusive finance can better promote farmers' entrepreneurship. Urbanization level, economic openness and regional economic development level have a significant positive effect on farmers' entrepreneurship, while farmers' income and education level have a significant negative effect on farmers' entrepreneurship. It is possible to promote farmers' entrepreneurship by improving the inclusive development level of inclusive finance, combining urbanization, increasing government investment in productive fixed assets, increasing economic openness and improving regional economic development."
https://openalex.org/W2944215814,"The impact of different types of land tenure in areas with high biodiversity and threats of deforestation remains poorly understood. We apply rigorous quasi-experimental methods and detailed geospatial data to assess the role of tenure regimes-communally held lands (specifically, ejidos), private property, and their impact on the effectiveness of protected areas, in reducing forest loss in a biodiversity hotspot- the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. We find evidence that, while protected areas are effective on average, their impact depends on the underlying type of tenure regime and forest, proxied by biomass levels and biome. Protecting communally held land may reduce deforestation, specifically the loss of medium- and high-biomass forests, compared to forests under private property regimes. Our results have important policy implications for the conservation and climate change mitigation efforts on the Yucatan. However, the high variance in forest loss rates among ejidos indicates that other characteristics of ejidos may be central to understanding community-based forest conservation opportunities."

Previously, we discovered that EFV activates CYP46A1 and improves behavioral performance in 5XFAD mice, an Alzheimer's disease model. Herein, the unbiased omics and other approaches were used to study 5XFAD mice in the amyloid-decreasing paradigm of CYP46A1 activation by EFV. These approaches revealed increases in the brain levels of postsynaptic density protein 95, gephyrin, synaptophysin, synapsin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and CYP46A1 and documented altered expression and phosphorylation of 66 genes and 77 proteins, respectively. The data obtained pointed to EFV effects at the synaptic level, plasmin-depended amyloid clearance, inflammation and microglia phenotype, oxidative stress and cellular hypoxia, autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome systems as well as apoptosis. These effects could be realized in part via changes in the Ca2+-, small GTPase, and catenin signaling. A model is proposed, in which CYP46A1-dependent lipid raft rearrangement and subsequent decrease of protein phosphorylation are central in EFV effects and explain behavioral improvements in EFV-treated 5XFAD mice.-Petrov, A.

Using tadpole morphology, vocalizations, and DNA, a new species is described from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM), an isolated mountain range in northern Colombia. The new taxon is the second known species of the genus Ikakogi and is morphologically identical to I. tayrona (except for some larval characters) but differs by its genetic distance (14.8% in mitochondrial encoded cytochrome b MT-CYB; ca. 371 bp) and by the dominant frequency of its advertisement call (2928–3273 Hz in contrast to 2650–2870 Hz in I. tayrona). They also differ in the number of lateral buccal floor papillae, and the position of the buccal roof arena papillae. Additionally, the new species is differentiated from all other species of Centrolenidae by the following traits: tympanum visible, vomerine teeth absent, humeral spines present in adult males, bones in life white with pale green in epiphyses, minute punctuations present on green skin dorsum, and flanks with lateral row of small, enameled dots that extend from below eye to just posterior to arm insertion. We describe the external and internal larval morphology of the new species and we redescribe the larval morphology of Ikakogi tayrona on the basis of field collected specimens representing several stages of development from early to late metamorphosis. We discuss the relevance of larval morphology for the taxonomy and systematics of Ikakogi and other centrolenid genera. Finally, we document intraspecific larval variation in meristic characters and ontogenetic changes in eye size, coloration, and labial tooth-rows formulas, and compare tadpoles of related species. Ikakogi tayrona has been proposed as the sister taxon of all other Centrolenidae; our observations and new species description offers insights about the ancestral character-states of adults, egg clutches, and larval features in this lineage of frogs."

Here we performed thermal adaptation of two species and three strains of mesophilic microbes for improvement of the survival upper limit of temperature, and the improvement was evaluated by a newly developed method. To understand the limitation and variation of thermal adaptation, experiments with mutators and by multiple cultures were performed. The results of experiments including genome sequencing and analysis of the characteristics of mutants suggest that these microbes bear a genomic potential to endure a 2-3°C rise in temperature but possess a limited variation of strategies for thermal adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2943909013,"Background and objective As of 2016, 43 US states have policies regarding alcohol use during pregnancy. A recent study found that out of eight state-level alcohol/pregnancy policies, six are significantly associated with poorer birth outcomes, and two are not associated with any outcomes. Here we estimate the excess numbers of low birthweight (LBW) and preterm births (PTB) related to these policies and their associated additional costs in the first year of life. Methods Cost study using birth certificate data for 155,446,714 singleton live births in the United States between 1972–2015. Exposures were state- and month/year-specific indicators of having each of eight alcohol/pregnancy policies in place. Outcomes were excess numbers of LBW and PTB and associated costs in the first year of life. Fixed effects regressions with state-specific time trends were used for statistical analyses in 2018. Results In 2015, policies mandating warning signs were associated with an excess of 7,375 LBW; policies defining alcohol use during pregnancy as child abuse/neglect were associated with an excess of 12,372 PTB; these excess adverse outcomes are associated with additional costs of $151,928,002 and $582,698,853 in the first year of life, respectively. Conclusions Multiple state-level alcohol pregnancy policies lead to increased prevalence of LBW and PTB, which cost hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Policymakers should consider adverse public health impacts of alcohol/pregnancy policies before expanding extant policies to new substances or adopting existing policies in new states."
https://openalex.org/W2944471260,"The selection of optimal enzyme concentration in multienzyme cascade reactions for the highest product yield in practice is very expensive and time-consuming process. The modelling of biological pathways is a difficult process because of the complexity of the system. The mathematical modelling of the system using an analytical approach depends on the many parameters of enzymes which rely on tedious and expensive experiments. The artificial neural network (ANN) method has been successively applied in different fields of science to perform complex functions. In this study, ANN models were trained to predict the flux for the upper part of glycolysis as inferred by NADH consumption, using four enzyme concentrations i.e., phosphoglucoisomerase, phosphofructokinase, fructose-bisphosphate-aldolase, triose-phosphate-isomerase. Out of three ANN algorithms, the neuralnet package with two activation functions, ""logistic"" and ""tanh"" were implemented. The prediction of the flux was very efficient: RMSE and R2 were 0.847, 0.93 and 0.804, 0.94 respectively for logistic and tanh functions using a cross validation procedure. This study showed that a systemic approach such as ANN could be used for accurate prediction of the flux through the metabolic pathway. This could help to save a lot of time and costs, particularly from an industrial perspective. The R-code is available at: https://github.com/DSIMB/ANN-Glycolysis-Flux-Prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2943911670,"Background The autonomic response to acute emotional stress can be highly variable, and pathological responses are associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. We evaluated the autonomic response to stress reactivity of young healthy subjects and aging subjects with coronary artery disease to understand how the autonomic stress response differs with aging. Methods Physiologic reactivity to arithmetic stress in a cohort of 25 young, healthy subjects (< 30 years) and another cohort of 25 older subjects (> 55 years) with CAD was evaluated using electrocardiography, impedance cardiography, and arterial pressure recordings. Stress-related changes in the pre-ejection period (PEP), which measures sympathetic activity, and high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV), which measures parasympathetic activity, were analyzed as primary outcomes. Results Mental stress reduced PEP in both groups (p<0.01), although the decrease was 50% greater in the healthy group. Mean HF HRV decreased significantly in the aging group only (p = 0.01). Discussion PEP decreases with stress regardless of health and age status, implying increased sympathetic function. Its decline with stress may be attenuated in CAD. The HF HRV (parasympathetic) stress reactivity is more variable and attenuated in younger individuals; perhaps this is related to a protective parasympathetic reflex.

https://openalex.org/W2943918793,"Protein substrates are targeted to the 26S proteasome through several ubiquitin receptors. One of these receptors, RPN13, is recruited to the proteasome by binding of its N-terminal pleckstrin-like receptor of ubiquitin (PRU) domain to C-terminal residues of the scaffolding protein RPN2. The RPN13 PRU domain is followed by a flexible linker and a C-terminal deubiquitylase adaptor (DEUBAD) domain, which recruits and activates the deubiquitylase UCH37. Both RPN13 and UCH37 have been implicated in human cancers, and inhibitors of the RPN2-RPN13 interaction are being developed as potential therapeutic anticancer agents. Our current study builds on the recognition that a residue central to the RPN2-RPN13 interaction, RPN2 Tyr-950, is phosphorylated in Jurkat cells. We found that the Tyr-950 phosphorylation enhances binding to RPN13. The crystal structure of the RPN2-RPN13 pTyr-950-ubiquitin complex was determined at 1.76-Å resolution and reveals specific interactions with positively charged side chains in RPN13 that explain how phosphorylation increases binding affinity without inducing conformational change. Mutagenesis and quantitative binding assays were then used to validate the crystallographic interface. Our findings support a model in which RPN13 recruitment to the proteasome is enhanced by phosphorylation of RPN2 Tyr-950, have important implications for efforts to develop specific inhibitors of the RPN2-RPN13 interaction, and suggest the existence of a previously unknown stress-response pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2944409067,"The present investigation was made to generate information on the heterotic pools amongst pearl millet hybrid parents. A set of 17 representative parents was selected from a diverse set of 147 hybrid parents using SSR based genetic distance (GD) and clustering pattern; 136 hybrids were developed in diallel fashion and evaluated at two locations in India. Moderate positive significant correlation (r = 0.37, p<0.01) and (r = 0.33, p<0.01) was found between GD and mid-parent heterosis (MPH) and better-parent heterosis (BPH), respectively, for grain yield for all the hybrids. Higher correlation between genetically closer individuals was observed for grain yield heterosis when the parents of B- and R- crosses had lesser genetic distance (<0.68 GD) in comparison to those parental combinations having GD higher than 0.68, indicating that the GD based predictions for grain yield are better when the parents are genetically related than when they are genetically diverse. In this study, all the pearl millet hybrid parents seems to exist in two broad-based heterotic pools; one each represented by seed and restorer parents as B × R hybrids showed highest mean heterosis for grain yield than either of B × B or R × R crosses. Further, four heterotic pools have been identified in this diverse set of hybrid parents of pearl millet, two each for seed parents (HPB1 and HPB2) and for restorer parents (HPR3 and HPR4). Among these, HPB1 × HPR3 was identified having the highest heterotic level, and could be further used to develop higher yielding pearl millet hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W2943920279,"Managing rivers in society’s best interest requires data on river condition. However, the complexity of river ecosystems, combined with finite budgets for river monitoring and modeling, mean difficult choices are necessary regarding what information will be available. Typically, decisions of ""what to measure"" are left to natural scientists. However, knowledge of public appetite for different types of information helps ensure river data is useful to society. We investigated public interest in rivers directly, engaging nearly one hundred urban and rural participants in a combination of focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Drawing on concepts of ""final"" ecosystem services developed in environmental economics, we moved discussions past commonly mentioned stressors, such as pollution, to actual river features important in and of themselves. Participant feedback reflected extensive thought on river issues, in contrast to a stereotype that the public is ambivalent about environmental conditions. Interests were also broad, encompassing water quality and quantity, fish and wildlife, vegetation, and human features. Results show consolidation around relatively few themes despite diverse sociodemographics. Themes were interpreted into distilled, specific metrics to make public feedback as useful as possible for water resources monitoring, modeling, and management. Our research provides detailed, methodically generated hypotheses regarding river themes and metrics of public interest that should be considered as part of the tradeoffs inherent in river monitoring design. Results compared reasonably well to river attributes emphasized in river restoration environmental valuation reviews, with some differences. Future research could test our hypotheses with large-sample surveys."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical use of an automated modified EWS (MEWS) for patients after surgery.This study conducted retrospective before-and-after comparative analysis of non-automated and automated MEWS for patients admitted to the surgical high-dependency unit in a tertiary hospital. Operational outcomes included number of recorded assessments of the individual MEWS elements, number of complete MEWS assessments, as well as adherence rate to related protocols. Clinical outcomes included hospital length of stay, in-hospital and 28-day mortality, and ICU readmission rate.Recordings in the electronic medical record from the control period contained 7929 assessments of MEWS elements and were performed in 320 patients. Recordings from the intervention period contained 8781 assessments of MEWS elements in 273 patients, of which 3418 were performed with the automated EWS system. During the control period, 199 (2.5%) complete MEWS were recorded versus 3991 (45.5%) during intervention period. With the automated MEWS systems, the percentage of missing assessments and the time until the next assessment for patients with a MEWS of ≥2 decreased significantly. The protocol adherence improved from 1.1% during the control period to 25.4% when the automated MEWS system was involved. There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes.Implementation of an automated EWS system on a surgical high dependency unit improves the number of complete MEWS assessments, registered vital signs, and adherence to the EWS hospital protocol. However, this positive effect did not translate into a significant decrease in mortality, hospital length of stay, or ICU readmissions. Future research and development on automated EWS systems should focus on data management and technology interoperability."

The diversity of reef-building organisms decreases as seawater CO2 increases along natural gradients, yet soft-bodied animals, such as sea anemones, are often resilient. We sequenced the polyA-enriched transcriptome of adult sea anemone Anemonia viridis and its dinoflagellate symbiont sampled along a natural CO2 gradient in Italy to assess stress levels in these organisms. We found that about 3.1% of the anemone transcripts, but <1% of the Symbiodinium sp. transcripts were differentially expressed. Processes enriched at high seawater CO2 were linked to cellular stress and inflammation, including significant up-regulation of protective cellular functions and down-regulation of metabolic pathways. Transposable elements were differentially expressed at high seawater CO2, with an extreme up-regulation (> 100-fold) of the BEL-family of long terminal repeat retrotransposons. Seawater acidified by CO2 generated a significant stress reaction in A. viridis, but no bleaching was observed and Symbiodinium sp. appeared to be less affected. These observed changes indicate the mechanisms by which A. viridis acclimate to survive chronic exposure to ocean acidification conditions. We conclude that many organisms that are common in acidified conditions may nevertheless incur costs due to hypercapnia and/or lowered carbonate saturation states."
https://openalex.org/W2944272553,"The DOHaD (developmental origins of health and disease) hypothesis claims that fetal malnutrition or exposure to environmental pollutants may affect their lifelong health. Epigenetic changes may play significant roles in DOHaD; however, access to human fetuses for research has ethical and technical hurdles. Umbilical cord blood (CB) has been commonly used as an epigenetic surrogate of fetuses, but it does not provide direct evidence of fetal exposure to pollutants. Here, we propose umbilical cord tissue (UC), which accumulates substances delivered to fetuses during gestation, as an alternative surrogate for epigenetic studies on fetuses. To explore the feasibility to examine UC epigenome by deep sequencing, we determined CpG methylation profiles of human postnatal UC by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Principal component analysis clearly separated the DNA methylomes of UC and CB pairs isolated from the same newborn (n = 10). Although all UC chromosomes were modestly hypomethylated compared to CB chromosomes, GO analysis revealed strong enrichment of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at promoter-associated CpG islands in the HOX gene clusters and other genes encoding transcription factors involved in determination of the body pattern. DNA methylomes of UC autosomes were largely comparable between males and females. Deficiency of folate during pregnancy has been suggested to affect fetal DNA methylation to cause congenital anomalies. Whereas DNA methylome of UC was not significantly affected by early-gestational (12 weeks) low levels of maternal plasma folate (< 8 ng/ml, n = 10) compared to controls (>19 ng/mL, n = 10), two specific loci of LTR12C endogenous retroviruses in chromosome 12 were significantly hypermethylated in the low-folate group. Our study suggests that UC is useful as an alternative surrogate for studying environmental effects on DNA methylation in human fetuses, compensating CB by providing additional information about epigenetic regulation of genes involved in developmental body patterning and endogenous retroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2944208833,"Recently, innovation has been a key driver of brand equity. However, the emerging economies provide a dynamic institutional environment that makes it difficult to explore the relationship between innovation and brand equity. By combining the brand equity literature and institutional theory, our research investigates the effects of technical and non-technical innovation on brand equity and how the effects vary within different institutional factors (product market development, regional legal environment). A sample composed of 124 listed companies in China from 2009 to 2014 was analyzed empirically and provides strong support for the theoretical predictions. The results confirm the positive effect of the two innovations on brand equity and the contingent effect of institutional factors as follows: the regional legal system positively moderates the relationship between the two innovations and brand equity, and product market development positively moderates the relation of technical innovation and brand equity; there was found to be no significant influence of non-technical innovation on brand equity. This study provides crucial theoretical and managerial implications for managers."
https://openalex.org/W2944491262,"Introduction The Government of Kenya instituted the free maternity services (FMS) policy to improve utilization of maternal healthcare services and thus improve maternal health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the FMS policy on the uptake of maternal health services in Nyamira County in western Kenya. Methods An interrupted time series study design was used to design the study and to analyze the collected data. Forty-two data sets were collected for each outcome variable i.e. 24 pre- and 18 post-intervention. Monthly data was abstracted from the District Health Information System-2 (DHIS-2) and verified using facility data. The collected data was then keyed into SPSS-17, cleaned and analyzed. Results During the study period, there was a significant increase in births attended by skilled attendants up to the 12th month (p<0.05) and caesarean section up to the ninth month (p<0.05). There was a decrease in obstetric complications up to the 12 month (p<0.05). In addition there was a significant increase in institutional maternal mortality ratio (iMMR) in the 12th and 18th months (p<0.05) following the implementation of free maternity service policy. There was a significant increase in deliveries in hospitals from the 1st to the 18th month (p<0.05) whereas in primary health care facilities the increase in deliveries was only significant up to the 6th month (p<0.05). Conclusions The FMS policy led to progress towards improving maternal health by improving access to maternal health services. The improved utilization of maternal health services was more marked in hospitals. There was a worsening of institutional maternal mortality ratio."

In the nucleus, the cdc2-like kinases (CLKs) phosphorylate SR proteins on their intrinsically disordered Arg–Ser (RS) domains, mobilizing them from storage speckles to the splicing machinery. The CLKs have disordered N termini that bind tightly to RS domains, enhancing SR protein phosphorylation. The N termini also promote nuclear localization of CLKs, but their transport mechanism is presently unknown. To explore cytoplasmic–nuclear transitions, several classical nuclear localization sequences in the N terminus of the CLK1 isoform were identified, but their mutation had no effect on subcellular localization. Rather, we found that CLK1 amplifies its presence in the nucleus by forming a stable complex with the SR protein substrate and appropriating its NLS for transport. These findings indicate that, along with their well-established roles in mRNA splicing, SR proteins use disordered protein–protein interactions to carry their kinase regulator from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.

https://openalex.org/W2944765338,"The mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling (MtRS) pathway aids in cellular adaptation to stress. We earlier reported that the Ca2+- and calcineurin-dependent MtRS induces macrophage differentiation to bone-resorbing osteoclasts. However, mechanisms through which macrophages sense and respond to cellular stress remain unclear. Here, we induced mitochondrial stress in macrophages by knockdown (KD) of subunits IVi1 or Vb of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). Whereas both IVi1 and Vb KD impair CcO activity, IVi1 KD cells produced higher levels of cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species with increased glycolysis. Additionally, IVi1 KD induced the activation of MtRS factors NF-κB, NFAT2, and C/EBPδ as well as inflammatory cytokines, NOS 2, increased phagocytic activity, and a greater osteoclast differentiation potential at suboptimal RANK-L concentrations. The osteoclastogenesis in IVi1 KD cells was reversed fully with an IL-6 inhibitor LMT-28, whereas there was minimal rescue of the enhanced phagocytosis in these cells. In agreement with our findings in cultured macrophages, primary bone marrow-derived macrophages from MPV17-/- mice, a model for mitochondrial dysfunction, also showed higher propensity for osteoclast formation. This is the first report showing that CcO dysfunction affects inflammatory pathways, phagocytic function, and osteoclastogenesis.-Angireddy, R., Kazmi, H.

https://openalex.org/W2944125425,"Nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1) is a multifunctional stress-induced protein involved in regulating tumorigenesis, apoptosis, and autophagy. Bone homeostasis is maintained by bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts and osteocytes. We aimed to determine the role of NUPR1 in bone metabolism. Using microcomputed tomography, we found that mice lacking Nupr1 exhibited increased bone volume. Histologic analysis showed that Nupr1 deficiency decreased osteoclast numbers but increased osteoblast numbers and osteoid formation. In vitro culture of bone marrow macrophages showed that receptor activator of NF-κB ligand-induced osteoclastogenesis was down-regulated in Nupr1-deficient mice. In contrast, primary osteoblasts from Nupr1-deficient mice revealed that proliferation of osteoblasts and expression of bone matrix proteins were markedly enhanced. In addition, expression of autophagy-related genes, formation of autophagosomes, and cell survival were up-regulated in Nupr1-deficient osteoblasts. In contract, deletion of Nupr1 reduced the formation of osteocyte cellular projection, which is an indicator of mature osteocytes. Importantly, we found that the expression of sclerostin (Sost), an inhibitor of bone formation, was down-regulated in the osteoblasts and osteocytes of Nupr1-deficient mice. Conversely, Nupr1 overexpression enhanced Sost expression in primary osteoblasts. Collectively, these results indicate that Nupr1 deficiency increases bone volume by attenuating production of Sost and osteoclastogenesis and enhancing differentiation of osteoblasts.-Shiraki, M., Xu, X., Iovanna, J.

https://openalex.org/W2944175562,"Campylobacter is the leading cause of food-borne bacterial disease in Canada and many developed countries. One of the most common sources of human campylobacteriosis is considered to be the consumption or handling of raw or undercooked poultry. To date, few Canadian studies have investigated both the prevalence of Campylobacter on retail poultry and its potential impact on human clinical cases. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. at the retail level and the correlation between subtypes recovered from chicken and those recovered from human clinical cases within the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. From this study 354 human clinical isolates were obtained from provincial hospital laboratories and a total of 480 packages of raw poultry cuts were sampled from retail outlets, yielding 312 isolates (65%), of all which were subtyped using comparative genomic fingerprinting (CGF). Of the 312 chicken isolates, the majority of isolates were C. jejuni (91.7%), followed by C. coli (7.7%) and C. lari (0.6%). Using CGF to subtype C. jejuni and C. coli isolates, 99 and 152 subtypes were recovered from chicken and clinical cases, respectively. The most prevalent human and chicken subtypes found in NS are similar to those observed nationally; indicating that the Campylobacter from this study appear to reflect of the profile of Campylobacter subtypes circulating nationally. Of the subtypes observed, only 36 subtypes were common between the two groups, however, these subtypes represented 48.3% of the clinical isolates collected. The findings from this study provides evidence that in Nova Scotia, retail poultry can act as a reservoir for Campylobacter subtypes that have been implicated in human illness."

Furthermore, human αII spectrin loss-of-function variants cause neurological disease. As global αII spectrin knockout mice are embryonic lethal, the in vivo roles of αII spectrin in adult heart are unknown and untested. Here, based on pronounced alterations in αII spectrin regulation in human heart failure we tested the in vivo roles of αII spectrin in the vertebrate heart. We created a mouse model of cardiomyocyte-selective αII spectrin-deficiency (cKO) and used this model to define the roles of αII spectrin in cardiac function. αII spectrin cKO mice displayed significant structural, cellular, and electrical phenotypes that resulted in accelerated structural remodeling, fibrosis, arrhythmia, and mortality in response to stress. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that αII spectrin plays a nodal role for global cardiac spectrin regulation, as αII spectrin cKO hearts exhibited remodeling of αI spectrin and altered β-spectrin expression and localization. At the cellular level, αII spectrin deficiency resulted in altered expression, targeting, and regulation of cardiac ion channels NaV1.5 and KV4.3. In summary, our findings define critical and unexpected roles for the multifunctional αII spectrin protein in the heart.

C. f. H. Health, United States, 2014. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, MD2015Google Scholar). Although significant initiatives in both prevention and therapeutics have reduced cardiovascular mortality, the field lacks effective solutions for a host of cardiovascular phenotypes. Furthermore, the literature is just beginning to address the striking complexity of organ, cell, and molecular pathways linked with human cardiovascular disorders. Thus, there remains a clear need to understand the fundamental cellular and molecular pathways associated with normal cardiac function as well as dysfunction of critical pathways in cardiovascular disease. Cardiac function requires finely tuned integration of myocyte mechanical and electrical pathways. Membrane-associated ion channels, transporters, receptors, signaling proteins, and cell adhesion molecules are important for cardiac function. The organization of these proteins within the vertebrate myocyte is essential for normal excitation-contraction coupling. In fact, decades of research have illustrated the role of the submembrane cytoskeleton and cytoskeletal-associated proteins in excitable cell biology (2Perkins E. Suminaite D. Jackson M.

Rep. 2012; 1 (23710421): 85-9310.1007/s13670-012-0009-2Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, αII spectrin is proteolytically cleaved by both caspase and calcium-activated calpain, forming ∼120- and ∼150-kDa degradation products, respectively (27Yan X.X. Jeromin A. Jeromin A. Spectrin breakdown products (SBDPs) as potential biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases.Curr. Transl. Geriatr. Exp. Gerontol.

Notably, the ∼150-kDa (calpain-mediated) cleavage product of αII spectrin was significantly increased in both ischemic and nonischemic heart failure (HF) samples compared with samples from nonfailing hearts (Fig. 1, A–D). Furthermore, levels of the ∼120-kDa (caspase-mediated) cleavage were increased in human HF samples compared with samples from nonfailing hearts (p < 0.05, n = 3 nonfailing, 6 HF). Levels of full-length αII spectrin were similar between samples likely due to the observed trend toward a significant transcriptional up-regulation of αII spectrin in disease (Fig. S1). In summary, cardiac αII spectrin degradation products are significantly increased in human heart failure. Based on the critical role of spectrins in excitable cells and dysregulation in heart failure (Fig. 1), we investigated the role of αII spectrin for in vivo cardiac function. To date, due to the embryonic lethality of global αII spectrin knockout mice (29Stankewich M.C. Cianci C.D. Stabach P.R. Ji L. Nath A. Morrow J.S. Cell organization, growth, and neural and cardiac development require αII-spectrin.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124 (22159418): 3956-396610.1242/jcs.080374Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the role of αII spectrin in the adult heart is unknown and unstudied. Thus, we generated a cardiomyocyte-specific αII spectrin mouse knockout model (αII spectrin cKO) using the Cre-lox system in which exon 8 of Sptan1 is flanked by LoxP sites (30Huang C.Y. Zhang C. Ho T.S. Oses-Prieto J. Burlingame A.L. Lalonde J. Noebels J.L. Leterrier C. Rasband M.N. αII-Spectrin forms a periodic cytoskeleton at the axon initial segment and is required for nervous system function.J.

Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. Tissue-specific regulation of the α-myosin heavy chain gene promoter in transgenic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (1722208): 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). αII spectrin cKO mice are viable, showed no gross visible phenotypes, and reproduced normally. As expected, cardiomyocyte preparations from αII spectrin cKO mouse myocytes displayed near-complete loss of αII spectrin protein expression (Fig. 2, B–D). This loss was selective for cardiomyocytes as αII spectrin protein levels were similar between control and αII spectrin cKO cerebellum (Fig. 2, E–G) and skeletal muscle. In the control mouse heart, αII spectrin is highly expressed and localizes to the Z-disc, lateral membrane, and intercalated disc (Fig. 2, H and I). Notably, this intracellular distribution does not completely overlap with αI spectrin (localized to the Z-disc and lateral membrane, absent from the intercalated disc (25Baines A.J. Pinder J.C. The spectrin-associated cytoskeleton in mammalian heart.Front. Biosci. 2005; 10 (15970557): 3020-303310.2741/1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) suggesting potential unique roles for αII spectrin versus αI spectrin. Consistent with immunoblot data, αII spectrin cKO mice displayed complete loss of αII spectrin in the cardiomyocyte by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2J). Thus, the newly generated knockout mouse line provides a viable model to study in vivo αII spectrin deficiency in cardiomyocytes. To test the in vivo role of αII spectrin in vertebrate heart, we performed detailed cardiac structural and functional phenotyping of αII spectrin cKO mice and control littermates. In adult mice (20–24 weeks of age), we observed a significant decrease in stroke volume, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening, indicative of early stages of heart failure and/or cardiac remodeling (Fig. 3, A–F). Furthermore, αII spectrin cKO mice displayed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, as assessed by histologic analysis of cross-sectional cardiomyocyte size (Fig. 3L, Fig. S2). However, this did not translate into gross increases in heart weight, even when normalized to body weight or to tibia length (Fig. S3). Histologically, we observed increased cardiac fibrosis in αII spectrin cKO mice, as assessed by automated quantification of Masson’s Trichrome-stained heart samples (Fig. 3, I–K). Fibrosis was not accompanied by an increase in apoptosis, as assayed by TUNEL staining (Fig. S4). Notably, this dysfunction develops with age, as αII spectrin hearts from younger mice (12–16 weeks of age) displayed no significant changes in cardiac structure or function and no fibrosis, necrosis, or hypertrophic phenotypes (Fig. S5). Thus, αII spectrin deficiency promotes an age-dependent decline in cardiac ejection fraction and increased cardiac fibrosis. We next tested the impact of αII spectrin deficiency on cardiac excitability. We observed electrical dysfunction in αII spectrin cKO mice, regardless of age. In young 12–16–week-old mice, prior to structural dysfunction, we observed ECG phenotypes in αII spectrin cKO mice compared with control mice including minor, but significant increases in P wave and QRS duration by conscious recordings (Table S1; no change in QRS by DSI telemetry), indicating slowed conduction through the atria and ventricles. Notably, this slowed conduction is not associated with reduced levels or altered localization of connexin 43 (Fig. S6). Treatment of conscious αII spectrin cKO, but not control animals with epinephrine revealed significant differences in heart rate as well as PR, QT, and rate corrected QT (QTc) intervals when compared with control littermates (Table S1). Furthermore, epinephrine-treated αII spectrin cKO mice (but not control littermates) displayed arrhythmia phenotypes including sustained runs of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) (Fig. 4, A–C). In summary, 12–16–week-old αII spectrin cKO mice display defects in electrical activity that precede cardiac structural and functional phenotypes. Furthermore, electrical phenotypes are increased by catecholamine treatment. Based on in vivo αII spectrin cKO mouse phenotypes, we investigated electrical properties at the individual myocyte level. Compared with control myocytes, we observed statistically significant changes in action potential duration (APD) at 50, 75, and 90% repolarization (APD50, APD75, and APD90, respectively) or in maximum upstroke velocity (dV/dT) in αII spectrin cKO myocytes (Fig. S7, A–C; 0.5 Hz). Furthermore, we observed a statistically significant increase in action potential amplitude (APA) in αII spectrin cKO myocytes compared with control cells (Fig. S7D). These changes occurred in the absence of changes in resting membrane voltage (Fig. S8). Notably, we observed a failure of αII spectrin cKO myocytes to initiate an action potential at higher stimulation frequencies (Fig. S7, E–G). For example, unlike control myocytes that initiated normal action potentials at frequencies up to 10 Hz, αII spectrin cKO myocytes began failing to excite at just 2 Hz, indicating a key role of αII spectrin in myocyte excitability (Fig. S7G). In summary, αII spectrin cKO myocytes display multiple electrical phenotypes. Our findings support significant in vivo and cellular defects in the absence of cardiac αII spectrin. We therefore directly tested the impact of αII spectrin deficiency on spectrin family regulation in heart. Consistent with our hypothesis, β spectrin proteins (obligate α spectrin-binding partners) were significantly reduced in αII spectrin cKO cardiomyocytes. We observed a 77.9% reduction in βI spectrin protein levels with βII spectrin protein levels reduced 93.2% (Fig. 5, A–D). Remaining βII spectrin was normally localized (Fig. 5H). Normal mRNA expression of βI (Sptb) and βII (Sptbn1) spectrin (Fig. 5G) support that altered protein levels are due to post-transcriptional regulation of β spectrins. αI spectrin, a protein unique to mammals, is structurally similar to αII spectrin, having likely arisen from a gene duplication of αII spectrin (32Baines A.J. Evolution of spectrin function in cytoskeletal and membrane networks.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37 (19614597): 796-80310.1042/BST0370796Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Notably, in cardiomyocytes lacking αII spectrin, αI spectrin is strongly up-regulated at both transcript (Fig. 5G) and protein levels (Fig. 5, E and F). In control cardiomyocytes, αI spectrin localizes to the Z-disc and lateral membrane, and is absent from the intercalated disc (Fig. 5, I and J). However, in αII spectrin cKO cardiomyocytes, αI spectrin is present at the intercalated disc (Fig. 5, I and J), supporting a putative compensatory role of αI spectrin in the αII spectrin cKO model. In summary, our data support a key role of αII spectrin expression for the normal regulation of both βI spectrin and βII spectrin expression in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, our findings support that αI spectrin levels are significantly increased in αII spectrin cKO heart as a potential compensatory mechanism to preserve cardiac function. However, our data suggest that this compensatory pathway is insufficient to restore normal function to αII spectrin cKO mice, potentially due to the inability of αI spectrin to associate with cardiac αII spectrin-binding partners. Spectrin dysfunction is linked with altered voltage-gated Nav channel regulation in the heart and brain (2Perkins E. Suminaite D. Jackson M.

Nav1.5 expression was significantly reduced in αII spectrin cKO hearts compared with hearts from control littermates (Fig. 6, A and B; reduced 59.5% when normalized for total protein expression). This decrease was likely due to post-translational dysregulation, as mRNA levels of Scn5a (encoding NaV1.5) were unchanged between control and αII spectrin hearts (Fig. 6C). In the control heart, Nav1.5, whereas present at multiple membrane domains, is preferentially expressed at the intercalated disc membrane (Fig. 6D). In αII spectrin cKO hearts, we observed modestly decreased intercalated disc staining relative to lateral membrane expression of Nav1.5 (Fig. 6, D and E). However, neither immunoblot nor immunofluorescent microscopy are quantitative measures of functional NaV1.5. To determine the function of the remaining NaV1.5, analysis by single-cell electrophysiology was conducted, which revealed nearly a 2-fold decrease in peak INa in αII spectrin cKO myocytes compared with littermate controls (Fig. 7, A and B). However, we observed no difference in voltage-dependent inactivation or time-dependent recovery from inactivation between myocytes from control and αII spectrin cKO hearts (Fig. 7, C and D). In summary, αII spectrin is required for normal Nav1.5"

Cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) culture is the gold standard method for meningitis diagnosis, but interpretation of biochemical parameters of CSF is essential at the moment of the analysis in order to start the appropriate treatment. The main objective of this study was to determine whether levels of CSF beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) were elevated in preterm infants with CNS infections or other inflammatory processes, and to establish if there were differences in B2M concentrations amongst various inflammatory settings (sepsis, meningitis, and progressive post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD)). Methods This is a retrospective study of all very preterm and extremely preterm infants (< 32 weeks of gestation) admitted to our NICU between 2012 and 2017. All those who underwent a lumbar puncture during their stay as part of a sepsis work-up or PHVD were considered for inclusion. CSF biochemical parameters and B2M were tested in all of the patients. Results Fifty-nine patients were included in the study. In patients with CNS infections, the median value of B2M was 8.69 mg/L (3.92–18.5). B2M levels above 3.92 mg/L showed greater sensitivity and specificity than leukocyte levels in discriminating between patients with CNS infections or other inflammatory processes and those without CNS inflammation. Conclusions In this population, CSF B2M proved to be an effective biomarker to discriminate between patients with CNS infections and other inflammatory processes and those without CNS inflammation."

Methods We enrolled 1320 pregnant Malawian women in a randomized trial and treated them with two doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (control) or monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine as IPTp against malaria, or monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and two doses of azithromycin (AZI-SP) as IPTp against malaria and reproductive tract infections. Child weight, mid-upper arm circumference, head circumference and weight-for-height Z-score were recorded at one, six, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months. Results Throughout follow-up, the mean child weight was approximately 100 g higher (difference in means 0.12 kg, 95% CI 0.04–0.20, P = 0.003 at one month; 0.19 kg, 95% CI 0.05–0.33, P = 0.007, at six months), mean head circumference 2 mm larger (0.3 cm, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.5, P = 0.004 at one month) and the cumulative incidence of underweight by five years of age was lower (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.90, P = 0.002) in the AZI-SP group than in the control group. The 2 mm difference in the mean mid-upper arm circumference at one month (0.2 cm, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.3, P = 0.007) disappeared after three years of age. There was no difference in mean weight-for-height Z-score at any time point. Conclusion In Malawi, IPTp with azithromycin and monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has a modest, 3-5-year positive impact on child weight, mid-upper arm circumference and head circumference, but not on weight-for-height Z-score."

The methods were applied on daily air temperature in the Qazvin Plain, Iran that were collected at 24 weather stations and 150 ECMWF ERA-interim grid cells from a single month (June) over 11 years. We compared the methods with the commonly applied conditional expectation and conditional median methods. Leave-k-out cross-validation and correlation scores show that the new methods reduced the bias with 44-68% for the full data set and with 34-74% on a homogeneous subarea. We conclude that the two methods are able to locally improve ECMWF air temperatures in a data-scarce area."
https://openalex.org/W2944355573,"The number of outlaw bikers is growing globally. Despite this, little research exists on these groups and their alleged violent tendencies. To address this, the current paper uses unique data to examine whether gang violence causes outlaw biker violence. The period examined runs from mid-2008 until early 2012 during which violent clashes occurred between outlaw bikers and street gang members involved in an alleged conflict in Copenhagen, Denmark. A precise description of each individual act of violence would make it possible to identify whether specific acts were carried out in furtherance of the alleged conflict. This would allow one to determine whether outlaw bikers commit violence on behalf of their club. However, such knowledge is unavailable. The paper therefore takes a different approach by examining whether acts of violence committed by the two groups are statistically associated. In other words, it considers whether one or more acts can be described as retaliatory during the observation periods. The sample consists of 640 individuals involved with the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club or with non-biker street gangs-both of which are present in Copenhagen. Statistical models are used to predict 143 violent events committed by 196 outlaw bikers. The results suggest that violence committed by gang members predicts violence committed by outlaw bikers. This indicates that violent acts committed by outlaw bikers are at least partly a form of retaliation carried out on behalf of their club. The paper expands the literature on the kinds of inter-group, micro-level processes that can lead to reciprocal violence by including outlaw bikers in a literature that has previously focused on non-biker street gangs."

The main objective was to assess the vertical equity of outpatient out-of-pocket payments for lymphedema patients in France. Twenty-seven centres, among which 11 secondary care hospitals and 16 primary care practices participated in this prospective national multicenter study. We measured the lymphedema-specific outpatient out-of-pocket payments over 6 months. The vertical equity of out-of-pocket payments was examined using concentration curves, the Gini coefficient for income, the Kakwani index, and the Reynolds-Smolensky index. We included 231 lymphedema patients aged 7 years or more, living in metropolitan France, and being able to use Internet and email. After voluntary health insurance reimbursement, the mean out-of-pocket payment was equal to 101.4 Euros per month, mainly due to transport (32%) and medical devices (26%). Concentration curves indicated regressivity of out-of-pocket payments. Total out-of-pocket payments represented 10.1% of the income by consumption unit for the poorest quintile and 3.5% for the wealthiest (p<0.05). The Kakwani index for out-of-pocket payments was equal to -0.18. Regarding outpatient health care, French lymphedema patients face significant and regressive out-of-pocket payments, associated with an increased risk of unmet medical needs. Such results shed light on significant socioeconomic inequalities and bring into question the current financing arrangements of outpatient health care in France.

This study explored the potential use of PTI as a biomarker of oxidative stress in patients with LVH. Methods We recruited 70 consecutive patients (n = 35 LVH and n = 35 non-LVH) based on an echocardiography study in our institution (left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area). Plasma levels of both S-thiolated protein and total thiols were measured as biomarkers of oxidative stress by spectrophotometry, and PTI was calculated as the molar ratio between S-thiolated proteins and the total thiol concentration. Results Values for plasma S-thiolated proteins were higher in patients with LVH than in the control group (P = 0.01). There were no differences in total thiols between the LVH group and the control group. Finally, PTI was higher in patients with LVH than in the control group (P = 0.001). The area under the ROC curve was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.63–0.86; P<0.001), sensitivity was 70.6%, and specificity was 68.6%, thus suggesting that PTI could be used to screen for LVH. A multivariable logistic regression model showed a positive association (P = 0.02) between PTI and LVH (OR = 1.24 [95% CI, 1.03–1.49]) independently of gender (OR = 3.39 [95% CI, 0.60–18.91]), age (OR = 1.03 [95% CI, 0.96–1.10]), smoking (OR = 5.15 [95% CI, 0.51–51.44]), glucose (OR = 0.99 [95% CI, 0.97–1.01]), systolic arterial pressure (OR = 1.10 [CI 1.03–1.17]), diastolic arterial pressure (OR = 0.94 [CI 0.87–1.02]), dyslipidemia (OR = 1.46 [95% CI, 0.25–8.55]), estimated glomerular filtration rate (OR = 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96–1.01]), body mass index (OR = 1.03 [95% CI, 0.90–1.10]), and valvular and/or coronary disease (OR = 5.27 [95% CI, 1.02–27.21]).

https://openalex.org/W2953003515,"Exposure to loud sounds is related to harmful mental and systemic effects. The hippocampal function can be affected to either high-intensity sound exposure or long-term sound deprivation. We previously showed that hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) is inhibited after ten days of daily exposure to 2 minutes of high-intensity noise (110 dB), in the hippocampi of Wistar rats. Here we investigated how the glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission mediated by ionotropic receptors is affected by the same protocol of high-intensity sound exposure. We found that while the glutamatergic transmission both by AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors in the Schaffer-CA1 synapses is unaffected by long-term exposure to high-intensity sound, the amplitude of the inhibitory GABAergic currents is potentiated, but not the frequency of both spontaneous and miniature currents. We conclude that after prolonged exposure to short periods of high-intensity sound, GABAergic transmission is potentiated in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. This effect could be an essential factor for the reduced LTP in the hippocampi of these animals after high-intensity sound exposure. We conclude that prolonged exposure to high- intensity sound could affect hippocampal inhibitory transmission and consequently, its function."

The Tekman palaeolake was a part of an unrecognized extended late Miocene to Pliocene palaeolake system in the present-day Armenian Highland, which has been disrupted by Pliocene tectonic activities.

https://openalex.org/W2944128766,"Aging and dopamine modulation have both been independently shown to influence the functional connectivity of brain networks during rest. Dopamine modulation is known to decline during the course of aging. Previous evidence also shows that the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) influences the re-uptake of dopamine and the anyA9 genotype of this gene is associated with higher striatal dopamine signaling. Expanding these two lines of prior research, we investigated potential interactive effects between aging and individual variations in the DAT1 gene on the modular organization of brain acvitiy during rest. The graph-theoretic metrics of modularity, betweenness centrality and participation coefficient were assessed in 41 younger (age 20–30 years) and 37 older (age 60–75 years) adults. Age differences were only observed in the participation coefficient in carriers of the anyA9 genotype of the DAT1 gene and this effect was most prominently observed in the default mode network. Furthermore, we found that individual differences in the values of the participation coefficient correlated with individual differences in fluid intelligence and a measure of executive control in the anyA9 carriers. The correlation between participation coefficient and fluid intelligence was mainly shared with age-related differences, whereas the correlation with executive control was independent of age. These findings suggest that DAT1 genotype moderates age differences in the functional integration of brain networks as well as the relation between network characteristics and cognitive abilities."

Our aims were to identify the phylogeographic pattern and mtDNA structure of the population and to evaluate the role of environmental conditions in shaping the spatial pattern of mtDNA diversity. We found out that three European haplogroups occurred sympatrically in north-eastern Poland. Inferences based on mtDNA haplotype distribution and frequency defined five subpopulations. The mtDNA-based structure of mice significantly correlated with winter temperature: frequency of Haplogroup 1 was positively, and that of Haplogroup 3 negatively correlated to mean temperature of January in the year of trapping. Synthesis of the published pan-European data on the species phylogeography also showed that the possibly 'thermophilous' Haplogroup 1 has the westernmost occurrence, whereas the more 'cold-resistant' Haplogroup 3 occurs much further to north-east than the other haplogroups. The observed patter may be a byproduct of the tight coevolution with nuclear genes, as we have earlier found that - in mice population in NE Poland - the spatial pattern of nuclear DNA was best explained by January temperature. Alternatively, the observed association of mitochondrial genetic variation with temperature is possible to be adaptive as cytochrome b is involved in the process of ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2944352210,"In this study, a complexity-quality analysis with transcoding architectures is proposed for reducing inverse quantization numbers. This architecture is different from conventional transcoding scheme, which neglects the relationship between previous and current quantizer step size. However, the proposed transcoding architecture depends on the modulus of the ratio of the current and previous quantization parameter. By analyzing the quantized area of the previous and current quantization parameter, we concluded the part of undoing first inverse quantization, to reduce computing complexity. From computer simulation, we verify the merits of the proposed scheme over the conventional transcoding approaches, in terms of achieving better performance based on the computing complexity and objective (e.g., the peak signal-to-noise ratio) analysis."
