https://openalex.org/W2056831005,"Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) requires the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). In a yeast two-hybrid screen for NIK-interacting proteins, we have identified a protein kinase previously known as CHUK. Overexpression of CHUK activates a NF-κB-dependent reporter gene. A catalytically inactive mutant of CHUK is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-, IL-1-, TRAF-, and NIK-induced NF-κB activation. CHUK associates with the NF-κB inhibitory protein, IκB-α, in mammalian cells. CHUK specifically phosphorylates IκB-α on both serine 32 and serine 36, modifications that are required for targeted degradation of IκB-α via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This phosphorylation of IκB-α is greatly enhanced by NIK costimulation. Thus, CHUK is a NIK-activated IκB-α kinase that links TNF- and IL-1-induced kinase cascades to NF-κB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2061738087,"Previous models for signal transduction via the Notch pathway have depicted the full-length Notch receptor expressed at the cell surface. We present evidence demonstrating that the Notch receptor on the plasma membrane is cleaved. This cleavage is an evolutionarily conserved, general property of Notch and occurs in the trans-Golgi network as the receptor traffics toward the plasma membrane. Although full-length Notch is detectable in the cell, it does not reach the surface. Cleavage results in a C-terminal fragment, NTM, that appears to be cleaved N-terminal to the transmembrane domain, and an N-terminal fragment, NEC, that contains most of the extracellular region. We provide evidence that these fragments are tethered together on the plasma membrane by a link that is sensitive to reducing conditions, forming a heterodimeric receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2011257584,"Vertebrate organogenesis is initiated at sites that are often morphologically indistinguishable from the surrounding region. Here we have identified Pax9 as a marker for prospective tooth mesenchyme prior to the first morphological manifestation of odontogenesis. We provide evidence that the sites of Pax9 expression in the mandibular arch are positioned by the combined activity of two signals, one (FGF8) that induces Pax9 expression and the other (BMP2 and BMP4) that prevents this induction. Thus it appears that the position of the teeth is determined by a combination of two different types of signaling molecules produced in wide but overlapping domains rather than by a single localized inducer. We suggest that a similar mechanism may be used for specifying the sites of development of other organs."
https://openalex.org/W1986763150,"Four INK4 proteins can prevent cell proliferation by specifically inhibiting cyclin D-dependent kinases. Both p18INK4c and p19INK4d were widely expressed during mouse embryogenesis, but p16INK4a and p15INK4b were not readily detected prenatally. Although p15INK4b, p18INK4c and p19INK4d were demonstrated in many tissues by 4 weeks after birth, p16INK4a protein expression was restricted to the lung and spleen of older mice, with increased, more widespread mRNA expression during aging. Transcripts encoding the INK4a alternative reading frame product p19ARF were not detected before birth but were ubiquitous postnatally. Expression of p16INK4a and p15INK4b was induced when mouse embryos were disrupted and cultured as mouse embryo 'fibroblasts' (MEFs). The levels of p16INK4a and p18INK4c, but not p15INK4b or p19INK4d, further increased as MEFs approached senescence. Following crisis and establishment, three of four independently-derived cell lines became polyploid and expressed higher levels of functional p16INK4a. In contrast, one MEF line that sustained bi-allelic deletions of INK4a initially remained diploid. Therefore, loss of p16INK4a and other events predisposing to polyploidy may represent alternative processes contributing to cell immortalization. Whereas p18INK4c and p19INK4d may regulate pre- and postnatal development, p16INK4a more likely plays a checkpoint function during cell senescence that underscores its selective role as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W1976271632,"Certain cell types undergo apoptosis when they lose integrin-mediated contacts with the extracellular matrix (""anoikis""). The Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is activated in and promotes anoikis. This activation requires caspase activity. We presently report that a DEVD motif-specific caspase that cleaves MEKK-1 specifically is activated when cells lose matrix contact. This cleavage is required for the activation of the kinase activity. When overexpressed, the MEKK-1 cleavage product stimulates apoptosis; the wild-type, full-length MEKK-1 sensitizes cells to anoikis; and a cleavage-resistant mutant of MEKK-1 partially protects cells against anoikis. The cleavage-resistant or kinase-inactive mutants also prevent caspase-7 from being activated completely. Thus, caspases can induce apoptosis by activating MEKK-1, which in turn activates more caspase activity, comprising a positive feedback loop."
https://openalex.org/W2074584250,"Notch and the disintegrin metalloprotease encoded by the kuzbanian (kuz) gene are both required for a lateral inhibition process during Drosophila neurogenesis. We show that a mutant KUZ protein lacking protease activity acts as a dominant-negative form in Drosophila. Expression of such a dominant-negative KUZ protein can perturb lateral inhibition in Xenopus, leading to the overproduction of primary neurons. This suggests an evolutionarily conserved role for KUZ. The Notch family of receptors are known to be processed into smaller forms under normal physiological conditions. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence that Notch is an in vivo substrate for the KUZ protease, and that this cleavage may be part of the normal biosynthesis of functional Notch proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2004756723,"Two signaling molecules have been implicated in the modulation of immune receptor activation by inhibitory coreceptors: an inositol polyphosphate 5'-phosphatase, SHIP, and a tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1. To address the necessity, interaction, or redundancy of these signaling molecules, we have generated SHP-1- or SHIP-deficient B cell lines and determined their ability to mediate inhibitory signaling. Two distinct classes of inhibitory responses are defined, mediated by the selective recruitment of SHP-1 or SHIP. The Fc gammaRIIB class of inhibitory signaling is dependent on SHIP and not SHP-1; conversely, the KIR class requires SHP-1 and not SHIP. The consequence of this selective recruitment by inhibitory receptor engagement is seen in BCR-triggered apoptosis. SHP-1-mediated inhibitory signaling blocks apoptosis, while SHIP recruitment attenuates a proapoptotic signal initiated by Fc gammaRIIB."
https://openalex.org/W2166247822,"Electron microscope immunocytochemistry reveals that both anterograde-directed (proinsulin and VSV G protein) and retrograde-directed (the KDEL receptor) cargo are present in COPI-coated vesicles budding from every level of the Golgi stack in whole cells; however, they comprise two distinct populations that together can account for at least 80% of the vesicles budding from Golgi cisternae. Segregation of anterograde- from retrograde-directed cargo into distinct sets of COPI-coated vesicles is faithfully reproduced in the cell-free Golgi transport system, in which VSV G protein and KDEL receptor are packaged into separable vesicles, even when budding is driven by highly purified coatomer and a recombinant ARF protein."
https://openalex.org/W2087303623,"Microbial superantigens (SAGs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune diseases. Preferential expansion of the Vveta7 T cell receptor positive T cell subset in patients suffering from acute-onset type I diabetes has indicated the presence of a surface membrane-bound SAG. Here, we have isolated a novel mouse mammary tumor virus-related human endogenous retrovirus. We further show that the N-terminal moiety of the envelope gene encodes an MHC class II-dependent SAG. We propose that expression of this SAG, induced in extrapancreatic and professional antigen-presenting cells, leads to beta-cell destruction via the systemic activation of autoreactive T cells. The SAG encoded by this novel retrovirus thus constitutes a candidate autoimmune gene in type I diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2166088282,"Kinesin and myosin are motor proteins that share a common structural core and bind to microtubules and actin filaments, respectively. While the actomyosin interface has been well studied, the location of the microtubule-binding site on kinesin has not been identified. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we have found that microtubule-interacting kinesin residues are located in three loops that cluster in a patch on the motor surface. The critical residues are primarily positively charged, which is consistent with a primarily electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged tubulin molecule. The core of the microtubule-binding interface resides in a highly conserved loop and helix (L12/α5) that corresponds topologically to the major actin-binding domain of myosin. Thus, kinesin and myosin have developed distinct polymer-binding domains in a similar region with respect to their common catalytic cores."
https://openalex.org/W2072714763,"The hedgehog gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a secreted protein (HH) that plays a vital role in cell fate and patterning. Here we describe a protein complex that mediates signal transduction from HH. The complex includes the products of at least three genes: fused(a protein-serine/threonine kinase), cubitus interruptus(a transcription factor), and costal2(a kinesin-like protein). The complex binds with great affinity to microtubules in the absence of HH, but binding is reversed by HH. Mutations in the extracatalytic domain of FU abolish both the biological function of the protein and its association with COS2. We conclude that the complex may facilitate signaling from HH by governing access of the cubitus interruptus protein to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2171802796,"The Hedgehog (HH) signaling proteins control cell fates and patterning during animal development. In Drosophila, HH protein induces the transcription of target genes encoding secondary signals such as DPP and WG proteins by opposing a repressor system. The repressors include Costal2, protein kinase A, and the HH receptor Patched. Like HH, the kinase Fused and the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (CI) act positively upon targets. Here we show that costal2 encodes a kinesin-related protein that accumulates preferentially in cells capable of responding to HH. COS2 is cytoplasmic and binds microtubules. We find that CI associates with COS2 in a large protein complex, suggesting that COS2 directly controls the activity of CI."
https://openalex.org/W2036545911,"Ceruloplasmin is a copper-binding protein, which is the major ferroxidase in plasma of hepatic origin. We now provide evidence for a novel membrane-bound form of ceruloplasmin expressed by astrocytes in the mammalian central nervous system. Using a monoclonal antibody (1A1), we show that the cell surface antigen recognized by this antibody is ceruloplasmin and that it is directly anchored to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Our peptide mapping and other immunochemical studies indicate that, except for the GPI anchor, the membrane-bound and secreted plasma forms are similar. We also show that the membrane-bound form of ceruloplasmin has oxidase activity. These studies therefore suggest that the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin may play a role similar to the secreted form in oxidizing ferrous iron. The GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin expressed by astrocytes is likely to be the major form of this molecule in the central nervous system because serum ceruloplasmin does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Lack of this form of ceruloplasmin in the central nervous system could lead to the generation of highly toxic free radicals, which can cause neuronal degeneration as seen in aceruloplasminemia and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.

Lack of this form of ceruloplasmin in the central nervous system could lead to the generation of highly toxic free radicals, which can cause neuronal degeneration as seen in aceruloplasminemia and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Iron plays an important role as a cofactor for various enzymes, such as the cytochromes of the electron transport chain and ribonucleotide reductase. On the other hand, free iron can generate highly toxic free radicals because it is a redox-active transition metal (1De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A number of enzymes, binding proteins, and transporters have been identified that are involved in mobilizing, transporting, and sequestering iron (1De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 2Jefferies W.A. Gabathuler R. Rothenberger S. Food M. Kennard M.L.

Recent studies on the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae have resulted in the identification of several proteins, such as Fet3 and Ftr1, which directly participate in iron transport in this organism (4Askwith C.

Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologues of many of these proteins have yet to be identified. Ceruloplasmin, the major ferroxidase of plasma (300–450 μg/ml), is required for iron transport by transferrin. The oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe(II)) to ferric iron (Fe(III)) mediated by ceruloplasmin is necessary for iron incorporation into transferrin, since transferrin only binds the ferric form of iron. As a ferroxidase, ceruloplasmin might also play a role in a transferrin-independent iron uptake system, such as the one identified by Kaplan and colleagues (7Sturrock A. Alexander J. Lamb J. Craven C.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3139-3145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which requires reduction of iron at the cell surface (reviewed in Ref. 1De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Direct evidence for the role of ceruloplasmin in iron metabolism comes from studies of individuals with aceruloplasminemia, a hereditary deficiency of ceruloplasmin (8Miyajima H.

These individuals have very little or undetectable levels of ceruloplasmin and severe intracellular iron accumulation in a number of organs, including the brain, particularly in the deep extrapyramidal motor nuclei, where it is associated with neurodegeneration. The neurodegeneration is likely to be a consequence of oxidative stress induced by the oxidation of ferrous iron by agents such as hydrogen peroxide (1De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In support of this, Miyajima et al. (16Miyajima H. Takahashi Y. Serizawa M. Kaneko E. Gitlin J.D. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported a dramatic increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation in the plasma of individuals with aceruloplasminemia. A number of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and Hallervorden-Spatz disease are also associated with altered brain iron metabolism and free radical injury (17Gerlach M. Ben-Shachar D. Riederer P. Youdim M.B.H. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that ceruloplasmin might contribute to the pathology seen in these neurodegenerative diseases as well.Although generally considered a soluble plasma protein of hepatic origin, we now provide evidence using a monoclonal antibody, mAb 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBSS, Tris-buffered saline solution; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein. 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBSS, Tris-buffered saline solution; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein. 1A1, of a novel GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin that is localized to the surface of astrocytes in the central nervous system. The cell surface localization of ceruloplasmin is not seen on hepatocytes and cells of the choroid plexus, both of which are known to secrete ceruloplasmin. Since iron deposition occurs in the brain in aceruloplasminemia and because the level of the secreted form of ceruloplasmin in the cerebrospinal fluid is very low, this novel membrane-associated form of ceruloplasmin is likely to play an important role in iron metabolism in the central nervous system.DISCUSSIONWe provide evidence that the 135-kDa cell surface molecule recognized by the mAb 1A1, which is expressed exclusively by astrocytes in the rat central nervous system (18Mittal B. David S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 32Mittal B. David S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), is a novel GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin. The molecule recognized by the mAb 1A1 was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using detergent-solubilized membrane extracts of C6 glioma tumors or cultured C6 glioma cells that also express this molecule. N-terminal microsequence analysis of the immunoaffinity-purified 135-kDa band indicated that the molecule recognized by the mAb 1A1 is identical (or homologous) to ceruloplasmin, which is classically considered a plasma protein of hepatic origin. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of only one 135-kDa polypeptide in the immunoaffinity-purified material, suggesting that mAb 1A1 recognizes only one molecule, namely ceruloplasmin. Additional evidence that the molecule recognized by this monoclonal antibody is ceruloplasmin (or homologous to it) was provided by the following experiments. (i) Western blot analysis demonstrated that the mAb 1A1-purified protein is recognized by a polyclonal anti-ceruloplasmin antibody, (ii) the monoclonal antibody 1A1 immunoprecipitates a 135-kDa protein from rat serum, and (iii) no differences were observed in the peptide fragments generated by Cleveland mapping of ceruloplasmin from serum and that from membrane preparations of C6 glioma cells.We have also shown previously by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine that this 135-kDa molecule is synthesized by astrocytes (18Mittal B. David S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence labeling of cells in vitro and iodination of cell surface proteins followed by immunoprecipitation showed that this molecule is associated with the plasma membrane (18Mittal B. David S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In addition, as shown for ceruloplasmin synthesized by liver cells in vitro (28Fleming R.E. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7701-7707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have shown that there is only a small reduction in the molecular weight of this molecule when astrocyte cultures are treated with tunicamycin (18Mittal B. David S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is poorly glycosylated. We have also reported previously that the 1A1 antigen, which we have shown here to be ceruloplasmin, increases in the cerebellum with postnatal development (32Mittal B. David S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Several earlier studies have reported the presence of ceruloplasmin mRNA in the brain (33Thomas T. Schreiber G. Jaworowski A. Dev. Biol. 1989; 134: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Gaitskhoki V.S. Voronina O.V. Denezhkina V.V. Pliss M.G. Puchkova L.V. Shvartsman A.L. Neifakh S.A.

Cupples R.L. Bonifacio M.J. Sanford J.A. Horton W.A. Bowman B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10780-10785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Klompet al. (37Klomp L.W.J. Farhangrazi Z.S. Dugan L.L. Gitlin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) have reported ceruloplasmin gene expression by astrocytes. We now provide evidence of a novel GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin expressed on the surface of astrocytes in the mammalian central nervous system and that it has oxidase activity.The cell surface localization of ceruloplasmin is unique to astrocytes, since cells of the choroid plexus and hepatocytes, both of which secrete ceruloplasmin, do not show surface labeling with mAb 1A1. Fibroblasts that form the fibroblastic capsule of various organs are the only other cell type to express this molecule on the cell surface (18Mittal B. David S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This cell surface localization of ceruloplasmin cannot be the result of ceruloplasmin spanning the cell membrane, since it does not have a sufficiently long hydrophobic amino acid stretch that could serve as a membrane-spanning domain (27Aldred A.R. Grimes A. Schreiber G. Mercer J.F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2875-2878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Fleming R.E. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7701-7707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our demonstration that the surface labeling with the monoclonal antibody can be removed by PI-PLC treatment shows that ceruloplasmin is anchored to the cell surface by a GPI anchor. Experiments in which immunoaffinity-purified ceruloplasmin, from PI-PLC cleaved material obtained from C6 glioma cells, was labeled on Western blots with an antibody that specifically recognizes the GPI anchor provide direct evidence that it is itself GPI-anchored to the cell surface. These results therefore provide the first evidence of a GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin.Interestingly, near the C-terminal end, plasma ceruloplasmin contains a potential site for GPI anchor attachment, consisting of small amino acids followed by a short hydrophobic sequence, that appears to satisfy the minimal requirement for a GPI anchor addition signal (29Ferguson M.A.J. Williams A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 285-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 30Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). GPI anchor addition would result in a protein with a molecular weight similar to the secreted form since the cleaved C-terminal sequence would be replaced with a GPI-anchor precursor of similar molecular weight (29Ferguson M.A.J. Williams A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 285-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 30Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). PIG-A, a gene that encodes a protein required to initiate GPI anchor assembly, is expressed at a much higher level in the brain than in other tissues (38Yu J. Medof M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Thus, astrocytes that are found in the brain may be able to initiate GPI anchor addition more readily than other cell types, such as hepatocytes. Alternatively, the GPI-anchored and secreted forms of ceruloplasmin might be generated through differential splicing, perhaps in a manner similar to the different isoforms of decay-accelerating factor (39Nonaka M. Miwa T. Okada N. Nonaka M. Okada H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155 (, 3048): 3037PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Mollgard et al. (40Mollgard K. Dziegielewska K.M. Saunders N.R. Zakut H. Soreq H. Dev. Biol. 1988; 128: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have reported that ceruloplasmin expressed by Xenopus oocytes following injection of mRNA from fetal human liver was secreted by the oocytes, whereas injection of mRNA from fetal human brain led to the expression of ceruloplasmin that was retained within the cells. Although these investigators did not localize the ceruloplasmin expressed from brain mRNA to a specific region of the cell, our studies suggest that it is likely to have been the membrane-bound GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin. Whether alternative splicing might be responsible for the different isoforms of ceruloplasmin cannot be determined based on the genomic sequence of ceruloplasmin, since it has not yet been fully characterized, and at present, consists only of the exons and intron/exon boundaries of the human liver cDNA (41Daimon M. Yamatani K. Igarashi M. Fukase N. Kawanami T. Kato T. Tominaga M. Sasaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).An important finding is the evidence that the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin has oxidase activity. This finding suggests that this unique form of ceruloplasmin on the surface of astrocytes in the central nervous system is likely to play a role in iron metabolism (1De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C.

Convincing evidence for a role for this form of ceruloplasmin in iron metabolism comes from studies of individuals with hereditary ceruloplasmin deficiency in which there is marked deposition of iron in various organs including the brain (8Miyajima H.

Since there is no evidence that ceruloplasmin from plasma crosses the blood-brain barrier, and the levels of the secreted form of ceruloplasmin in the cerebrospinal fluid is normally very low (1 μg/ml; Ref. 44Del Principe D. Menichelli A. Colistra C. Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1989; 78: 327-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin on astrocytes, which comprise 25% of the total volume of the brain (45Pope A. Schoffeniels E. Franck G. Hertz L. Tower D.B. Dynamic Properties of Glial Cells. Pergamon Press, Oxford1977: 13-20Google Scholar), is likely to be the major form of ceruloplasmin in the central nervous system. This GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin is similar to a recently identified ferroxidase in yeast called Fet3 (4Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 5De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Fet3, like ceruloplasmin, is a copper-binding ferroxidase. In addition, Fet3 is also attached to the cell surface, but unlike the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin, it has a single transmembrane domain and has a molecular mass of 72 kDa (4Askwith C. Eide D.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies show that Fet3 ferroxidase activity is required for iron transport into the cell via a newly described iron transporter called Ftr1 (6Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Whether the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin in the mammalian central nervous system also functions along with a transporter similar to Ftr1 to transport ferric (Fe(III)) iron from the extracellular compartment into astrocytes is not known at present. Such a mechanism may contribute, along with other non-transferrin uptake systems (1De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 7Sturrock A. Alexander J. Lamb J. Craven C.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3139-3145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to the influx of iron into astrocytes, which lack both the transferrin receptor (46Giometto B. Bozza F. Argentiero V. Gallo P.

Brain Res. 1996; 712: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the egress of ferrous (Fe(II)) iron from neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes may occur via some as yet unidentified transporter, such as that proposed for other mammalian cells (3Kaplan J. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1996; 271: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The Fe(II) iron exiting these cells could become oxidized by the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin on the surface of astrocytes. Since astrocyte processes are distributed throughout the central nervous system, ceruloplasmin located on astrocytes is ideally positioned to effectively oxidize the highly toxic ferrous iron to the ferric form. The latter may then be available for reutilization or cleared from the central nervous system by binding to transferrin or melanotransferrin.Besides aceruloplasminemia, iron deposition has been observed in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease (49Hirsch E.C.

Evidence that iron may contribute to the neurodegeneration in these diseases is provided by the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease, in which the iron chelator desferroxamine protects neurons from injury (56Ben-Shachar D. Eshel G. Finberg J.P.M. Youdim M.B.H. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Increased levels of free radicals, which may underlie the neurodegeneration, have been reported in the brains of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients (57Dexter D.T. Carter C.J. Wells F.R.

Snyder B. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 159: 88-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is possible that damage to astrocytes, resulting in reduced levels of the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin in the affected gray matter regions, might lead to the iron deposition and free radical generation that causes the neuronal degeneration seen in these diseases. This is further supported by the finding that the ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin has been shown to inhibit ferrous iron-catalyzed phospholipid peroxidation in vitro (42Gutteridge J.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 43Gutteridge J.M.C. Quinlan G.J. Biochim. Biophys.

The GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin on astrocytes which has this important ferroxidase activity may regulate iron transport in and out of neurons and glia in the central nervous system, and may help limit lipid peroxidation in a tissue that is highly susceptible to oxidative injury. Iron plays an important role as a cofactor for various enzymes, such as the cytochromes of the electron transport chain and ribonucleotide reductase. On the other hand, free iron can generate highly toxic free radicals because it is a redox-active transition metal (1De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A number of enzymes, binding proteins, and transporters have been identified that are involved in mobilizing, transporting, and sequestering iron (1De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 2Jefferies W.A. Gabathuler R. Rothenberger S. Food M. Kennard M.L.

Recent studies on the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae have resulted in the identification of several proteins, such as Fet3 and Ftr1, which directly participate in iron transport in this organism (4Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 5De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D.

Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologues of many of these proteins have yet to be identified. Ceruloplasmin, the major ferroxidase of plasma (300–450 μg/ml), is required for iron transport by transferrin. The oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe(II)) to ferric iron (Fe(III)) mediated by ceruloplasmin is necessary for iron incorporation into transferrin, since transferrin only binds the ferric form of iron. As a ferroxidase, ceruloplasmin might also play a role in a transferrin-independent iron uptake system, such as the one identified by Kaplan and colleagues (7Sturrock A. Alexander J. Lamb J. Craven C.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3139-3145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which requires reduction of iron at the cell surface (reviewed in Ref. 1De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the role of ceruloplasmin in iron metabolism comes from studies of individuals with aceruloplasminemia, a hereditary deficiency of ceruloplasmin (8Miyajima H"
https://openalex.org/W2060900500,"Ventral midline cells at different rostrocaudal levels of the central nervous system exhibit distinct properties but share the ability to pattern the dorsoventral axis of the neural tube. We show here that ventral midline cells acquire distinct identities in response to the different signaling activities of underlying mesoderm. Signals from prechordal mesoderm control the differentiation of rostral diencephalic ventral midline cells, whereas notochord induces floor plate cells caudally. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is expressed throughout axial mesoderm and is required for the induction of both rostral diencephalic ventral midline cells and floor plate. However, prechordal mesoderm also expresses BMP7 whose function is required coordinately with SHH to induce rostral diencephalic ventral midline cells. BMP7 acts directly on neural cells, modifying their response to SHH so that they differentiate into rostral diencephalic ventral midline cells rather than floor plate cells. Our results suggest a model whereby axial mesoderm both induces the differentiation of overlying neural cells and controls the rostrocaudal character of the ventral midline of the neural tube."

PPARγ exists as two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, that differ only in their N termini. Both isoforms are activated by ligands that include the antidiabetic thiazoladinedione drugs and 15-deoxy-Δ12, 14-prostaglandin J2, and potential differences in their function have yet to be described. We report that, in addition to a ligand-activated transcriptional activity, when studied under conditions of ligand depletion, intact PPARγ has a ligand-independent activation domain. To identify the basis for this ligand-independent activation, we used GAL4-PPARγ chimeric expression constructs and UAS-TK-LUC in CV1 cells and isolated rat adipocytes. In both cell systems, isolated PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 N termini have activation domains, and the activation function of PPARγ2 is 5–6-fold greater than that of PPARγ1. Insulin enhances the transcriptional effect mediated by both PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 N-terminal domains.

Under appropriate conditions, expression of PPARγ through retroviral infection of fibroblastic cell lines is sufficient to cause differentiation along an adipocyte lineage, as assessed by expression of adipocyte-specific genes, accumulation of lipid, and acquisition of adipocyte morphology (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that 15-deoxy-Δ12, 14-prostaglandin J2 (PG J2) is a high affinity ligand for PPARγ (7Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M.

PPARγ resembles other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily in that ligand-dependent receptor activation alters the rates of transcription of genes, specifically those that have peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) within their promoters (e.g. aP2, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and uncoupling protein) (9Tontonoz P Hu E.

PPARγ exists as two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, that differ only in their N termini, with PPARγ2 having an additional 30 amino acids that are encoded by a single exon (9Tontonoz P Hu E. Graves R. Budavari A. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar, 12Zhu Y. Qi C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Noya D Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Expression of mRNA encoding the two isoforms is driven by alternative promoters within a single PPARγ gene (12Zhu Y. Qi C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Noya D Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), and their expression is differentially regulated in a tissue-specific manner. PPARγ2 is most abundantly expressed in adipocytes and is relatively specific for this tissue (9Tontonoz P Hu E. Graves R. Budavari A. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar,13Vidal-Puig A. Jimenez-Lian M. Lowell B.B. Hamann A. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2553-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In contrast, while PPARγ1 is also expressed at a high level in adipocytes, it is also found at significant but lower levels in a number of other tissues, including muscle (13Vidal-Puig A.

Considering the relative abundance of PPARγ1 in many nonadipose tissues, it is likely that this isoform is capable of subserving roles apart from regulation of adipogenesis. In addition, although no functional differences between the γ1 and γ2 isoforms have been described to date, it is possible that these isoforms subserve different functions under some conditions. However, deletion of the N-terminal 129 amino acids of PPARγ did not diminish the adipogenic potency of PPARγ that was introduced into 3T3 fibroblasts by retroviral infection (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar), and it has therefore been viewed as unlikely that the N terminus of PPARγ subserves a functionally important role. Here, we provide evidence that PPARγ, in addition to being activated in a ligand-dependent manner, can also be activated in a ligand-independent manner, and we define a ligand-independent activation domain within the N terminus of PPARγ. We also demonstrate the first potential functional difference between the two PPARγ isoforms, wherein the N terminus of PPARγ2 more potently activates a heterologous promoter than does PPARγ1. We have mapped the overall activation domain to a region common to the two isoforms and demonstrate that the 30 amino acids unique to PPARγ2 can activate a heterologous promoter only in concert with the main N-terminal activation domain. Finally, we provide evidence that the ligand-independent activation function of the N terminus of PPARγ is augmented when cells are treated with insulin. We propose a model for the activation of PPARγ and discuss its possible implications. The PPRE reporter construct consisted of two copies of the DR1 element upstream of the TK109 promoter in the vector pA3Luc (16Hollenberg A.N. Susulic V.S. Madura J.P. Zhang B. Moller D.E. Tontonoz P.

All GAL4 constructs were constructed by inserting a PCR-generated fragment into the GAL4 vector (17Moghal N. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3945-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The γ1 N terminus, γ2 N terminus, each of the GAL4 constructs made to map the activation domain, and the PPARδ N terminus were constructed in a similar manner. 5′ primers were designed to contain an EcoRI (GAATTC) site after a random pentamer (CGCGG) to ameliorate restriction digestion. 3′ primers were designed to contain a stop codon before aPstI (CTATAG) site and the same pentamer. The C-terminal-GAL4 construct was designed in a similar manner except both primers contained a BamHI (GGATCC) site instead ofEcoRI and PstI. All restriction sites were in frame with the template, which kept an open reading frame from GAL4 through the entire PCR fragment. PCR was performed under the following conditions: after heating to 94 °C, buffer and enzyme (Takara) were added, and 30 PCR cycles were performed, each as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. Each PCR was purified from the buffer and enzyme using Qiaquick (Qiagen) and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, run on an agarose gel, purified, and ligated into the GAL4 vector, which has been previously linearized using the same enzymes, thus keeping the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) in frame with the appropriate PCR fragment. UAS-TK-Luc contains five copies of the 17-base pair upstream activating sequence upstream of TK luciferase (14Mukherjee R. Jow L. Croston G.E. Paterniti Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8071-8076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The integrity of each construct was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and dideoxy sequencing. All plasmids for transfection were prepared using column (Qiagen) purification. The murine PPARγ2 plasmid and the murine PPARδ plasmid, which were used as templates for PCR reactions, were a gift from B. M. Spiegelman.

Briefly, epididymal adipose tissue was minced and digested in Krebs Ringer buffer containing 1.5 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington) and 1% bovine serum albumin (Intergen) at 37 °C for 30 min.

After the final wash, cells were resuspended as a 50% solution in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Adipocytes were transfected by electroporation as described previously (19Quon M.J.

Commun. 1993; 194: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), with some modifications (electroporation at 400 V, 500 microfarads). We used 6 μg of UAS-TK-Luc and 1.5 μg of empty GAL4, PPARγ1 N terminus GAL4, or γ2 N terminus GAL4. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 2 h after electroporation, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 3.5% bovine serum albumin (final concentration) was added, and the indicated cells were treated with 10 nm insulin. The cells were harvested for luciferase activity 20 h after transfection. CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented withl-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 0.25 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate technique in six-well plates, with each well receiving 1.60 μg of reporter and 80 ng of the γ1 N terminus, the γ2 N terminus, each of the indicated constructs containing a part of the N terminus, or empty GAL4 vector. 20 h after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fatty acid/growth factor-depleted fetal bovine serum and the indicated concentration of BRL49653. To deplete PPAR ligands and serum growth factors, fetal bovine serum was treated for 24 h at 4 °C with 5 mg/ml of activated charcoal (Sigma) and 30 mg/ml of anion exchange resin (type AGX-8, analytical grade, Bio-Rad). After centrifugation, anion exchange resin was added again for an additional 5 h. The resulting fetal bovine serum was centrifuged again and filtered before use. 44–48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested in extraction buffer and assayed for luciferase activity (20Markham B.E. Tsika R.W. Bahl J.J. Anderson P.G. Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6489-6493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated between 2–6 times. The results shown are the mean ± the S.E. CV-1 cells were passed to six-well dishes the day before transfection and transfected in duplicates as described above. Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection by aspirating the medium, rinsing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and scraping into 250 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 15 min, and finally 125 μl of 3 × Laemmli buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) was added to the supernatant. Proteins were boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), followed by transfer of the resolved polypeptides to nitrocellulose membranes using the system of Towbin et al. (22Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dried milk in Towbin buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with a polyclonal anti-yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) (1:1000) in 5% milk overnight at 4 °C. After removal of unbound antibodies by three washes of 20 min in Towbin buffer at room temperature, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:1000) in 2.5% milk for 1.5 h at room temperature and washed five times in Towbin buffer. The targeted proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) as described by the manufacturer (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, UK). We first assessed the capacity of PPARγ to mediate transcriptional activation under conditions of varying availability of endogenous ligand. To do this, we transfected CV-1 cells with an expression plasmid for PPARγ2 and assayed its ability to activate a reporter plasmid consisting of a PPRE upstream of a thymidine kinase (TK) promoter and the luciferase reporter gene. In an attempt to limit the availability of PPARγ ligand, we charcoal-stripped the serum twice before use (Fig. 1 A). Despite this treatment of the serum, PPARγ transactivated the reporter plasmid in the absence of added ligand. Activity was further enhanced by the addition of the thiazoladinedione BRL49653, which is known to bind to and activate PPARγ (7Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar, 8Kliewer S. Lenhard J. Willson T. Patel I. Morris D. Lehmmann J. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). Since this basal activation could have been due to residual ligand in the serum or to ligand produced by the cells during the course of the experiment, we constructed a plasmid containing the yeast GAL4 DBD upstream of the isolated PPARγ ligand binding domain (amino acids 193–505). This construct was co-transfected with a reporter gene containing the yeast GAL4 response element upstream of the TK promoter and luciferase as a reporter (UAS-TK-LUC), under serum and cell conditions identical to those of the previous experiment (Fig. 1 B). Although BRL was able to activate this construct very efficiently, indicating the intactness of the ligand binding domain, there was no activation in the absence of BRL, suggesting that the cellular level of endogenous ligand was extremely minimal under these conditions. The results additionally suggest that the high level of reporter activation mediated by the full-length PPARγ in the presence of the same stripped serum and without any added ligand was indeed ligand-independent and did not map to the ligand binding domain. To further explore the possible existence of a ligand-independent activation domain in PPARγ, we constructed two separate plasmids containing sequence encoding the N termini of PPARγ1 or -2 (amino acids 1–98 and amino acids 1–128, respectively) downstream of GAL4's DNA binding domain. Upon cotransfecting each of these constructs with UAS-TK-LUC, reporter activation was seen with both N termini, with the activation by the PPARγ2 N terminus being about 5-fold greater than that of PPARγ1 (Fig.2). In Western blotting experiments, using antibodies against the GAL4 DBD of the proteins, the expression levels of the two fusion proteins were the same (Fig.3). PPARγ1 DBD and PPARγ2 DBD migrated with molecular masses of ∼32 and ∼36 kDa, respectively.Figure 2Evidence for an activation domain in PPARγ1 and -2 N termini. A, CV-1 cells transfected with plasmids containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain, either alone or upstream of PPARγ1 and -2 N termini (amino acids 1–99 and 1–129, respectively), and cotransfected with UAS-TK-LUC.

Both A and B represent mean light units or -fold activation of three experiments, each of which was performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Expression of chimeric GAL4 DBD proteins as detected by Western blots. Cells were transiently transfected with nothing (Mock), GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4), or PPARγ1 or -2 N termini downstream of the GAL4 DBD (the latter two in duplicate). Clarified lysates were subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and and then probed with an antibody against yeast GAL4 DBD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is possible that the N-terminal 30 amino acids that are unique to PPARγ2 define a self-contained transactivation domain that might fully account for the difference between the activation potency of the two isoforms. A construct containing amino acids 1–30 of PPARγ2 downstream of the GAL4 DBD was therefore tested by co-transfection with UAS-TK-LUC. This construct failed to show any transactivation ability on its own (Fig. 4). We therefore further dissected the N terminus of PPARγ into several constructs, each containing a unique segment of the PPARγ N terminus in the same GAL4 fusion construct (Fig. 4). The activation domain maps to the region common to the two isoforms. Although the 30 N-terminal amino acids had no activation ability on their own, constructs lacking those 30 amino acids were consistently less active, suggesting a role for this region in the overall active conformation of the domain. Interestingly, amino acids 99–129 seemed to repress the ability of these constructs to activate transcription. Together, these results suggest a complex basis for the structural determinants of the PPARγ ligand-independent activation domain. To test whether N-terminal activation ability was present in a structurally homologous molecule, we constructed a plasmid containing the A/B domain of PPARδ (amino acids 1–72) downstream of GAL4's DBD, and this construct was unable to activate transcription of the reporter gene (Fig. 2 B). Since the extent of transcriptional activation mediated by the PPARγ N termini might be dependent on the presence of tissue-specific co-activators, we transfected the PPARγ2 N-terminal constructs together with UAS-TK-LUC into freshly isolated rat adipocytes (Fig. 5 A). The PPARγ2 N terminus showed a greater fold activation in adipocytes, the cell most relevant for PPARγ2 function, than in CV-1 cells. To determine whether the ligand-independent transcriptional activation mediated by PPARγ2 is regulated by insulin, we added 10 nm insulin to the transfected cells (Fig. 5 B). Insulin enhanced the ligand-independent activation mediated by both PPARγ1 and -2 constructs, while having little or no effect on the vector containing the GAL4 DBD alone. In this report we show that PPARγ resembles other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily in having the capacity to activate transcription in a ligand-independent manner. We have shown this in a number of ways. First, by co-transfecting intact PPARγ with a reporter plasmid under conditions designed to limit the availability of endogenous PPARγ ligand, we found that PPARγ activated transcription constitutively. To determine whether this activation was caused by residual endogenous ligand in the cells or media, and to identify a possible activation domain in the N terminus, we utilized the sensitive GAL4/UAS system. First, we created a construct that included PPARγ's C terminus with both the LBD and its activation domain, but without the DNA binding and N-terminal domains. By cotransfecting this plasmid with the reporter UAS-TK-LUC, we created a sensitive assay for the presence of PPARγ ligand. Using this paradigm, we showed that, under identical cell and serum conditions to those of the experiment with intact PPARγ, this construct showed no transactivation activity. However, the addition to these cell transfectants of the PPARγ ligand BRL49653 produced more than 50-fold activation. Taken together, these results suggest that the activation seen with intact PPARγ in the presence of charcoal-stripped serum and without added ligand is due neither to residual ligand nor to a constitutively active ligand binding domain. To pursue this possibility further, we created chimeras containing the GAL4 DBD with PPARγ1 and -2 A/B domains, in the absence of their DNA binding, ligand-binding, and C-terminal activation domains. Using these constructs, it is apparent that the N termini of both PPARγ1 and -2 do indeed contain activation domains, as assessed by the ability of these constructs to activate transcription of a GAL4-responsive reporter gene. Thus, we have shown that PPARγ can enhance transcription in both a ligand-dependent and ligand-independent manner. The potential importance of this ligand-independent activation is worthy of discussion. Many members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, including receptors for estrogen, progesterone, thyroid hormone, glucocorticoids, vitamin D3, and retinoic acid contain two distinct domains responsible for activating transcription of specific genes (23Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6002) Google Scholar). A critical activation domain is present in the receptor C terminus (the E domain), and this is activated upon binding of the cognate hormone/ligand to the adjacent ligand binding domain (reviewed in Ref. 24Mangelsdorf D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). In addition to this ligand-activated function, these receptors can also activate transcription independent of ligand binding, via an activation domain that resides within their N termini (the A/B domain). This domain can be constitutively active and/or be regulated independently of ligand via phosphorylation (25O'Malley B.W. Schrader W.T. Mani S. Smith C. Weigel N.L. Conneely O.M. Clark J.H. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 333-347PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). Ligand-independent activation (AF-1) domains have been shown to have several attributes. In some cases they act synergistically with the ligand-dependent activation domain, as with the human estrogen receptor in HeLa cells (27Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tassat D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), where neither activation domain in isolation was capable of activating transcription significantly but both domains together produced marked activation. The ligand-independent activation domain may also be necessary for the regulation of complex cellular events, as in the case of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in lymphocytes (28Dieken E.S. Miesfeld R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Transfection of glucocorticoid receptors in which the N terminus was deleted ablated the apoptosis caused by the intact receptor, while the same receptor remained responsive to a number of other dexamethasone effects to induce gene expression, suggesting that regulation of different genes may be mediated by distinct activation domains of the same receptor (29Helmberg A. Auphan N. Caelles C. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the case of the vitamin D3 receptor, it has been shown that mutating serine 51 and thus preventing phosphorylation reduces activity (30Hsieh J.C. Jurutka P.W. Galligan M.A. Terpening C.M. Haussler C.A. Samuels D.S. Shimizu Y. Shimizu N. Haussler M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9315-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation may be involved in regulation of this activation domain. These data also provide evidence that the two PPARγ isoforms may have differential abilities to activate target genes. To date, there have been no reports of functional differences between the PPARγ 1 and 2 isoforms, which have been described as having very similar capacities to be activated by known activators in co-transfection assays (14Mukherjee R. Jow L. Croston G.E. Paterniti Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8071-8076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and to be fully capable of bringing about the adipogenic program of differentiation in 3T3 cells under appropriate conditions. Here, we show that the N terminus of PPARγ2 is much more potent at activating a reporter independent of ligand than is the N terminus of PPARγ1. Interestingly, this difference between the two PPARγ isoforms is even more pronounced after transient transfection into isolated rat adipocytes, cells that normally express markedly higher levels of PPARγ2 than other tissues (1Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 13Vidal-Puig A. Jimenez-Lian M. Lowell B.B. Hamann A. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2553-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Whether this observation is due to higher expression in adipocytes of relevant but currently unknown co-activators is not known at this time. It is interesting to note that in adipocytes from both rodents (13Vidal-Puig A. Jimenez-Lian M. Lowell B.B. Hamann A. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2553-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) and humans (15Vidal-Puig P. Considine R. Jimenez-Linan M. Werman A. Pories W.J. Caro J.F Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2416-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), PPARγ2 is the isoform whose expression is more influenced by obesity and nutritional perturbations, while the expression of PPARγ1 is relatively stable under these conditions in vivo. The preferential regulation of PPARγ2 expression in physiologic states such as starvation is likely to serve a physiologic purpose that would not be evident if the two isoforms had identical profiles of biologic activity. Tontonoz et al. (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar) have shown that deletion of amino acids 1–127 in the N terminus of PPARγ2 does not reduce, but actually increases, the capacity of retrovirally expressed PPARγ2 to induce adipocyte differentiation of NIH-3T3 cells, as assessed by lipid accumulation and expression of adipose-specific genes. This could be viewed as conflicting with our results by suggesting that the N terminus does not play a physiological role in vivo. This apparent conflict can be resolved in several ways, however. First, Tontonoz et al. (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar) performed their studies under conditions of excess ligand, including ETYA, which was at the time the best PPARγ activator, and they used nonstripped serum, another potential source of PPARγ ligand. Thus, while their results demonstrate that under conditions of abundant ligand, the N terminus of PPARγ is not necessary for fat cell differentiation, they do not conflict with the possibility that the N-terminal activation domain of PPARγ plays an important role under distinctly different conditions, i.e.when ligand is not abundant. Studies of differentiation induced by isolated PPARγ N termini using the retroviral approach will be necessary to further resolve the ability of the PPARγ N terminus to bring about the full program of adipogenesis or perhaps reveal an adipogenesis-unrelated role. Finally, we observed in both CV-1 cells and isolated rat adipocytes that insulin is capable of regulating the ligand-independent transcriptional activity of PPARγ through its N-terminal activation domain. To understand the possible mechanism for this finding, it is necessary to review recent observations on the regulation of PPARγ activity by covalent modification. Shalev et al. (31Shalev A. Siegrist-Kaiser C. Yen P. Wahli W. Burger A. Chin W. Meier C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4499-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PPARγ is a phosphoprotein and that phosphorylation is capable of enhancing its transcriptional activation potency, although mapping of the responsible sites was not carried out. Zhanget al. (32Zhang B. Berger J. Zhou G. Elbrecht A. Biswas S. White-Carrington S. Szalkowski D. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31771-31774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) showed that insulin treatment of cells enhanced the ability of full-length PPARγ2 to stimulate aP2 gene expression and speculated that this might be mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation of PPARγ that they also demonstrated. In contrast, Hu et al. (33Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated that mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation of PPARγ2 took place on serine 112 in the N-terminal activation domain in response to mitogens, but this phosphorylation inhibited, rather than stimulated, the ability of full-length PPARγ2 to promote specific gene expression and the process of adipogenesis. Very recently, Adams et al. (34Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) reported that mutation of the consensus mitogen-activated protein kinase site (serine 82) of PPARγ1 to alanine resulted in increased ligand-dependent transcriptional activity. In addition, these authors also described a weak constitutive transcriptional activity of the isolated PPARγ1 N terminus, and this was also increased when serine 82 was mutated. Whether or not the activity of insulin to enhance transcription by intact PPARγ2 (32Zhang B. Berger J. Zhou G. Elbrecht A. Biswas S. White-Carrington S. Szalkowski D. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31771-31774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) or PPARγ2 N terminus as reported here is mediated by phosphorylation of PPARγ2, it is clear that signaling by PPARγ and insulin produce a number of common effects, including the ability to promote adipocyte differentiation (35Guller S. Corin R.E. Mynarcik D.C. London B.M. Sonenberg M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2084-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 36Lowell B.B. Flier J.S. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2898-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Another indication of convergent pathways for these molecules is the fact that the insulin-sensitizing thiazoladinediones are now known to act by binding to and activating PPARγ (7Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar, 8Kliewer S. Lenhard J. Willson T. Patel I. Morris D. Lehmmann J. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest a novel molecular basis for such a link, i.e. through convergence of their signaling pathways by an ability of insulin to enhance the function of the AF-1 activation domain of PPARγ, whether by direct phosphorylation or more likely through some other mechanism, such as an ability of insulin to modify a co-activator protein. Interestingly, our mapping experiments of the N-terminal activation domain provide evidence for a complex mechanism by which PPARγ's N terminus can influence transactivation. Thus, the PPARγ2 GAL4-(1–128) construct was less active than the PPAR γ2 GAL4-(1–99), and the PPARγ2 GAL4-(1–66) construct was less active than the PPARγ2 GAL4-(31–99). Although such results could be the consequence of a number of factors, they could be consistent with the existence of an N-terminal repression moiety under some conditions. Prior to these studies and the report of Adams et al. (34Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), a ligand-independent N-terminal activation domain had not been described in the PPAR gene family. Our results raise many questions about the functional roles of the ligand-independent and -dependent PPARγ activation domains under varying metabolic conditions that are likely to confront adipocytes and other cells that express these receptors. For example, it is possible that, under conditions of abundant PPARγ ligand, PPARγ would favor differentiation by causing growth arrest and transcription of adipocyte genes via the ligand-dependent AF-2 domain, whereas when ligand is limiting, as might be predicted to occur during starvation, PPARγ would act on promoters of genes needed for basal adipocyte homeostasis via the ligand-independent AF-1 domain. Such speculations on the possible functional domains of PPARγ will now need to be tested experimentally. In summary, we have demonstrated that PPARγ, like many other members of the steroid receptor superfamily, contains a ligand-independent activation domain in its N terminus. We have further defined a functional difference between the two PPARγ isoforms; PPARγ2, which is expressed mainly in adipose tissue, activates ∼5–10-fold more potently via its AF-1 activation domain than does PPARγ1. Lastly, we have shown that the N-terminal ligand-independent activation domain can be regulated by insulin, providing a new basis for the convergent signaling pathways of these molecules. Together, these results suggest a more complex regulation of PPARγ action than previously known and raise the possibility that differential regulation of PPARγ isoformsin vivo might account for different molecular activities and phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2062232773,"Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, cancer predisposition, genome instability and radiation sensitivity. The cellular phenotype of A-T points to defects in signal transduction pathways involved in activation of cell cycle checkpoints by free radical damage, and other pathways that mediate the transmission of specific mitogenic stimuli. The product of the responsible gene, ATM, belongs to a family of large proteins that contribute to maintaining genome stability and cell cycle progression in various organisms. A recombinant vector that stably expresses a full-length ATM protein is a valuable tool for its functional analysis. We constructed and cloned a recombinant, full-length open reading frame of ATM using a combination of vectors and hosts that overcame an inherent instability of this sequence. Recombinant ATM was stably expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus vector, albeit at a low level, and in human A-T cells using an episomal expression vector. An amino-terminal FLAG epitope added to the protein allowed highly specific detection of the recombinant molecule by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and immunostaining, and its isolation using immunoaffinity. Similar to endogenous ATM, the recombinant protein is located mainly in the nucleus, with low levels in the cytoplasm. Ectopic expression of ATM in A-T cells restored normal sensitivity to ionizing radiation and the radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin, and a normal pattern of post-irradiation DNA synthesis, which represents an S-phase checkpoint. These observations indicate that the recombinant, epitope-tagged protein is functional. Introduction into this molecule of a known A-T missense mutation, Glu2904Gly, resulted in apparent instability of the protein and inability to complement the A-T phenotype. These findings indicate that the physiological defects characteristic of A-T cells result from the absence of the ATM protein, and that this deficiency can be corrected by ectopic expression of this protein."

When cells are replete with sterols, the SREBPs remain bound to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope and are therefore inactive. When cells are depleted of sterols, a proteolytic process releases the active portions of the SREBPs, which enter the nucleus and stimulate transcription of genes in three pathways of lipid metabolism: 1) cholesterol biosynthesis (HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and squalene synthase) (1Brown M.S.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which sterols control the proteolytic release of SREBPs from cell membranes is beginning to be elucidated through studies of cultured animal cells (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that the SREBPs are tripartite proteins of ∼1150 amino acids that are attached to membranes in a hairpin fashion (8Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal segment of ∼480 amino acids, which faces the cytoplasm, is a classic transcription factor of the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family. This segment is followed by a hairpin-like membrane attachment domain that consists of two membrane-spanning sequences separated by a hydrophilic loop of ∼30 amino acids that projects into the lumen of the ER or nuclear envelope. This is followed by a COOH-terminal segment of ∼590 amino acids that projects into the cytoplasm. In sterol-depleted cells, a protease clips each SREBP at Site-1, which is a Leu-Ser bond in the middle of the lumenal loop (9Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 10Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This breaks the covalent bond between the two membrane-spanning segments and allows a second protease to cleave at Site-2, which appears to be in the middle of the first transmembrane segment (10Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Cleavage at Site-2 releases the NH2-terminal segment, which leaves the membrane, apparently with a portion of the membrane-spanning region still attached. The NH2-terminal segment then enters the nucleus, where it binds to sterol regulatory elements in the enhancers of the genes described above, thereby stimulating transcription (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). When cells are overloaded with sterols, proteolysis at Site-1 is abolished. Cleavage at Site-2 also declines since this cleavage requires prior cutting at Site-1 (9Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 10Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). As a result, the NH2-terminal segments remain bound to membranes, and transcription of the lipid-related genes is diminished. The biochemical identities of the proteases that cut at Sites-1 and -2 are unknown, but certain requirements for substrate recognition have been elucidated. The Site-1 enzyme requires an arginine that is three residues to the NH2-terminal side of the cleaved Leu-Ser bond (9Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 10Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1910-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Even though it cuts on the lumenal side of the membrane, the Site-1 enzyme requires the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain of the SREBP. When this domain in SREBP-2 is shortened through truncation mutations, cleavage by the Site-1 protease is abolished. 2J. Sakai, M. S. Brown, and J. L. Goldstein, unpublished observations. The Site-2 enzyme requires the sequence DRSR, which is immediately external to the first transmembrane domain (10Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Recently, our laboratory described a new protein designated SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) that appears to mediate sterol regulation of cleavage at Site-1 (13Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding a sterol-resistant mutant form of SCAP was isolated by expression cloning from a line of CHO cells with a dominant defect in sterol regulation. In these cells sterols cannot suppress cleavage of SREBPs at Site-1, and thus the cells overproduce cholesterol. Expression cloning traced this defect to a substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at residue 443 of SCAP. When a cDNA encoding the D443N mutant of SCAP is transfected into normal cells, the cells show increased cleavage of SREBPs at Site-1, and sterols no longer down-regulate this cleavage. Overexpression of a cDNA encoding wild-type SCAP can exert a similar effect, but the D443N mutant is at least 10-fold more potent (13Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). We concluded from these data that SCAP normally stimulates cleavage at Site-1 and that its activity is abolished by sterols. The mutant SCAP is both superactive and resistant to inhibition by sterols. The hypothesis regarding the function of SCAP is supported by an analysis of the sequence of the 1276-amino acid protein, which reveals that SCAP is divided into two domains. The NH2-terminal domain of ∼730 amino acids consists of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments that are compatible with approximately eight membrane-spanning domains (13Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This is followed by a COOH-terminal domain of ∼546 amino acids that is more hydrophilic and contains four or five WD repeats of ∼40 amino acids each. WD repeats are found in more than 30 intracellular proteins of diverse function, including the β subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (14Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The latter proteins contain seven WD repeats that are clustered together to form a seven-bladed propeller-like structure, the blades of which mediate contacts between the β subunit and the closely associated α and γ subunits of the trimer (15Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 16Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Indeed, WD repeats are postulated, in general, to mediate protein-protein interactions. The striking feature of SCAP is the resemblance of its membrane domain to the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase, an ER enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis (13Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Like SCAP, HMG-CoA reductase is divided into two portions (17Liscum L. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 522-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal half of the protein contains eight membrane-spanning regions (18Olender E.H. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4223-4235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal half of the protein, which projects into the cytoplasm, contains the entire catalytic domain of the enzyme (17Liscum L. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 522-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane domain is responsible for sterol-regulated degradation of the enzyme (19Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 20Kumagai H. Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19107-19113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In sterol-depleted CHO cells, the enzyme has a long half-life of greater than 10 h. When sterols are added, the enzyme is destroyed with a half-life of 1.5 h (19Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Rapid degradation requires the membrane domain of the enzyme, which has been postulated to have a sterol-sensing function (19Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The membrane domain of SCAP contains a region (postulated membrane-spanning segments 2–6) that shows 25% sequence identity and 55% similarity to the corresponding portion of the sterol-sensing region of HMG-CoA reductase. This region includes aspartic acid 443, which is the site of the activating mutation in SCAP (although this residue is a valine in HMG-CoA reductase) (13Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). These similarities led us to postulate that the membrane domain of SCAP, like that of HMG-CoA reductase, is a sterol sensor. There is no evidence that sterols accelerate the degradation of SCAP, as they do of HMG-CoA reductase. Instead, sterols may interact with the membrane domain of SCAP so as to regulate its ability to stimulate the cleavage of SREBPs at Site-1 (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). In the current studies we have sought to further understand the mechanism by which SCAP may regulate the cleavage of SREBPs. Through use of a co-immunoprecipitation assay, we show that the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of SREBP-2 forms a complex with the COOH-terminal WD repeat domain of SCAP. We postulate that this interaction allows SCAP to recruit a protease that cleaves SREBPs at Site-1. This hypothesis would explain the finding that cleavage at Site-1 requires the COOH-terminal domain of SREBPs. We obtained monoclonal antibodies IgG-HSV-Tag™ and IgG-T7-Tag™ from Novagen; v-Ha-Ras(Ab-1)-agarose-linked monoclonal antibody from Oncogene; affinity-purified donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories; and Protein G-Sepharose® 4 Fast Flow beads from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.

Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) except that the expression vector was switched from pRc/CMV7SB to pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The expression vector pCMV-HSV-BP2(555–1141) encodes amino acids 555–1141 of human SREBP-2 preceded by an initiator methionine, two tandem copies of the HSV epitope (QPELAPEDPED), and two novel amino acids (ID) encoded by a sequence for the BspDI restriction site. pCMV-HSV-BP2(555–1141) was constructed as follows.

The resulting 1.3-kbBspDI-PmlI fragment was ligated to the above 7.0-kb PmlI-BspDI fragment to generate pCMVHSV-BP2(555–1141).

The fragments were ligated to generate an intermediate construct. Second, this intermediate construct was digested withBspDI and PmlI, and the resulting 7.1-kb fragment was ligated with the 1.3-kb BspDI-PmlI PCR fragment described above to generate pCMV-HSV-BP2(555–1141)-Ras-T7. The expression vector pCMV-SCAP(732–1276)-T7 encodes a fusion protein consisting of an initiator methionine, amino acids 732–1276 of hamster SCAP, and three tandem repeats of the T7 epitope. pCMV-SCAP(732–1276)-T7 was constructed as follows. First, the sequence corresponding to amino acids 732–910 of SCAP was amplified by PCR of pCMV-SCAP (13Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

The structures of the above plasmids were confirmed by sequencing all PCR fragments and all ligation joints. Oligonucleotide mutagenesis was carried out with single-stranded uracil-containing DNA (22Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

On day 2, the medium was switched to medium B containing 700 μg/ml G418. The medium was changed every 2nd day until well defined colonies were evident on day 12–14. Colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders in the presence of 350 μg/ml G418. The resulting stable cell lines were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SCAP IgG-9D5, and the highest expressing line was selected for immunofluorescence analysis. Cells from 2 dishes of 293 cells were harvested, and the pooled cell pellet was solubilized with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-HCl at pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 25 μg/ml N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal (ALLN), and 1 mm dithiothreitol), passed through a 22.5-gauge needle 15 times, and extracted by rotating for 1.5 h at 4 °C. All subsequent operations were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. The cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 105 × g for 30 min in a Beckman TLA 120.2 rotor. An aliquot of the supernatant (0.2–1.5 mg of protein in 0.2–0.9 ml) was adjusted to a final volume of 1 ml with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and precleared by rotation for 1 h with either 20 μg of an irrelevant mouse monoclonal antibody IgG-2001 (see Ref. 27Tolleshaug H.

Rotation was carried out with a Cole-Palmer Instrument Co. apparatus (model 7637) at 15–20 rpm in a 4 °C cold room. After centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and immune monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies were added. After rotating for 1.5 h, 50 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads were added, followed by rotation for 1.5–3 h, and centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a new tube and precipitated with five volumes of acetone for 10 min at −20 °C, followed by centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.1 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) SDS, 1 mm sodium EDTA, and 1"
https://openalex.org/W2014326933,"Uterine growth factors are potential effector molecules in embryo growth signaling pathways. Pig uterine luminal flushings contained a heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF) that required 0.8 m NaCl for elution from heparin columns and was termed HBGF-0.8. This factor, which was heat- and acid-labile and of M r 10,000 as assessed by gel filtration, stimulated DNA synthesis in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells but not endothelial cells. Two forms of HBGF-0.8, termed HBGF-0.8-P1 and HBGF-0.8-P2, exhibited differential heparin-binding properties. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that each form of HBGF-0.8 migrated with an apparent M r of 10,000 under reducing conditions. Amino acid sequencing revealed the N-terminal sequence EENIKKGKKXIRTPKI for HBGF-0.8-P1 and ENIKKGKKXIRT for HBGF-0.8-P2. These sequences corresponded, respectively, to residues 247–262 and 248–259 of the 349-residue predicted primary translation product of porcine connective tissue growth factor (pCTGF). 10-kDa CTGF-mediated fibroblast DNA synthesis was modulated by exogenous heparin, and CTGF-immunoreactive proteins of 10, 16, and 20 kDa were present in unfractionated uterine luminal flushings. These data reveal the identity of a novel growth factor in uterine fluids as a highly truncated form of CTGF and show that the N-terminal two-thirds of the CTGF primary translation product is not required for mitogenic activity or heparin binding.

Uterine secretions contain a variety of chemical constituents including ions, vitamins, proteins, and carbohydrates that are proposed to sustain the growth and viability of the early embryo during the preimplantation period and, in species that exhibit noninvasive placentation, development of the conceptus after attachment of the extraembryonic membranes to the uterine epithelium (1Roberts R.M. Bazer F.W. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1988; 82: 875-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Polypeptide growth factors and cytokines are emerging as a class of uterine proteins that may be involved in uterine-embryo growth signaling pathways either through their secretion into the uterine lumen or their localization at the implantation site (2Brigstock D.R.

The pig is a useful model for these studies because the embryos of this species produce extensive extraembryonic membranes, exhibit a high incidence (approximately 30%) of mortality around the time of blastocyst expansion and attachment, produce a diffuse noninvasive placenta, and appear highly dependent on uterine secretory components throughout gestation (1Roberts R.M.

Here we describe the characterization and purification of a principal heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF) in pig uterine secretions that is mitogenic for fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in vitro. The N termini of two microheterogeneous forms of this factor are 100% conserved with residues 247–262 and 248–259 of the 349-residue predicted primary translational products of human and porcine connective tissue growth factor (hCTGF, pCTGF). These data reveal the identity of a novel uterine HBGF and provide new insights into structural and functional properties of CTGF. Uteri were collected at random from slaughterhouse pigs that were approximately 8 months or less in age. Each uterine horn was flushed with cold (4 °C) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described (8Kim G.Y. Besner G.E. Steffen C.L. McCarthy D.W. Downing M.T. Luquette M.H. Abad M.S. Brigstock D.R. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to collect uterine luminal components. These studies involved the use of 323 individual pools of uterine luminal flushings (ULF) (384 liters total volume) obtained from approximately 9,660 pigs; growth factor characterization studies were performed on 1-liter pools of ULF obtained from about 30 individual uteri, and growth factor purification was performed on 4-liter pools of ULF obtained from up to 120 animals. ULF were clarified by centrifugation at 13,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was passed through glass wool. For Western blot analysis of crude ULF samples, pigs (n= 4) of mixed breed (Duroc, Landrace, Yorkshire) were sacrificed on day 14 or 16 of the estrous cycle (day 0 representing the first day of estrus). ULF from both horns of individual animals were pooled and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting as described below. 1- or 4-liter samples of clarified ULF supernatant were applied at 4 °C to a Bio-Rex 70 cation exchange column (5 × 6 cm; Bio-Rad) that had previously been equilibrated in PBS, 0.2 m NaCl. After sample application, the column was washed with 500 ml of PBS, 0.2m NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted using a 500-ml gradient of 0.2–2 m NaCl in PBS. The flow rate was 3.5 ml/min throughout, and fractions of 10 ml were collected during treatment of the column with the NaCl gradient. Fractions demonstrating mitogenic activity for Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts were selected for further use. All subsequent chromatographic steps were performed at room temperature. Biologically active fractions containing the 0.3–0.6 m NaCl eluate from the Bio-Rex column were pooled, diluted 3-fold with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% CHAPS, passed through a 0.45-μm membrane filter, placed in a siliconized polypropylene vessel, and applied with a peristaltic pump to an EconoPac heparin column (0.7 × 3.6 cm; Bio-Rad) at 2 ml/min. The heparin column was then washed with 50 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 0.2 mNaCl, 0.1% CHAPS (pH 7.4) and developed at 1 ml/min with a 40-ml gradient of 0.2–2.0 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% CHAPS (pH 7.4) using a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Fractions (1 ml) were collected into siliconized tubes during NaCl gradient elution and tested for 3T3 cell mitogenic activity. To perform a second heparin affinity purification step, biologically active fractions containing the 0.8 m NaCl eluate from the EconoPac heparin purification step were pooled, diluted 3-fold with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and clarified by passage through a 0.2-μm filter. The sample was applied at 2 ml/min to a TSK heparin 5PW column (0.8 × 7.5 cm; TosoHaas, Philadelphia, PA), which was washed and eluted as described above except that CHAPS was omitted from the buffers and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Fractions containing proteins that were eluted by 0.8 m NaCl and that demonstrated mitogenic activity for 3T3 cells were divided into two pools consisting of fractions 31–34 (peak 1) and fractions 35 and 36 (peak 2). Reverse-phase HPLC was performed on a Hitachi HPLC system (Hitachi Instruments Inc., Danbury CT) using a C8 column (0.46 × 25 cm, 5-μm particle size; Rainin Instrument Co., Woburn, MA) that was equilibrated with water containing 10% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Pooled fractions containing peaks 1 and 2 from the TSK heparin purification step were individually adjusted so that they contained 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and were clarified by passage through a 0.2-μm filter. Conditions for the elution of bound proteins were 10% acetonitrile from 0 to 10 min after sample injection and 10–90% from 10 to 146 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min throughout, and the chromatogram (A 214) was archived as described (16Bray W. Brigstock D.R. Amer. Lab. 1994; 26: 38Google Scholar). The eluate was collected as 0.5-ml fractions in siliconized tubes containing 50 μl of 125 mm NaOH to immediately neutralize the trifluoroacetic acid. 80-μl aliquots of selected fractions were evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY) and reconstituted in 25 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). 10 μl of this concentrate were assayed for their stimulation of 3T3 cell DNA synthesis, and 10 μl were used for analytical SDS-PAGE. For second step C8 HPLC purification, two active fractions from the first HPLC step were pooled (1 ml total volume), diluted 5-fold with water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and subjected to the same chromatographic elution conditions as described above. Fractions containing HPLC-purified growth factors were pooled, dried, and subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gel were transferred for 90 min at 300 mA to a polvinylidene difluoride membrane using 10 mm CAPS buffer (pH 11). The location of the proteins of interest was determined by staining the blots with 0.1% Coomassie R250 in 50% methanol for 2 min, followed by destaining with 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid. Half of each protein band was excised and submitted for N-terminal amino acid sequencing on a model 470A gas phase sequenator (Applied BioSystems, Foster City CA). Phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were identified by C18reverse phase HPLC. Column fractions were tested for their ability to stimulate DNA synthesis as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA of confluent quiescent Balb/c 3T3 cells grown in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% bovine calf serum in 96-well culture plates as described (8Kim G.Y. Besner G.E. Steffen C.L. McCarthy D.W. Downing M.T. Luquette M.H. Abad M.S. Brigstock D.R. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Dose-response curves to purified growth factors from ULF were established by assaying each dose in triplicate, with data computed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance of the effects of 1–100 μg/ml porcine heparin (Sigma) on growth factor activity was determined by Student's t test. Target cell specificity was studied using Balb/c 3T3 cells, bovine capillary endothelial cells (BCECs), and vascular smooth muscle cells. 3T3 cells were utilized as described above. BCECs were obtained from Dr. J. Folkman (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA) and were maintained in gelatinized culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3 ng/ml bFGF and 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum. Smooth muscle cells were isolated from a 2–3-cm length of pig thoracic aorta using established procedures (17Weich H.A. Iberg N. Klagsbrun M. Folkman J. Growth Factors. 1990; 2: 313-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. BCEC and smooth muscle cell DNA synthesis assays were performed in 48- or 96-well plates essentially as described (18Besner G.E. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). BCEC DNA synthesis assays were also performed in the presence of 100 μg/ml porcine heparin. 0.5 ml of a fraction containing the 0.8 m NaCl eluate from EconoPac heparin affinity FPLC of ULF from 30 animals was applied at 0.5 ml/min to a TSK G2000 SW FPLC column (30 cm × 8 mm, 10-μm particle size,M r 500–100,000 fractionation range; TosoHaas) equipped with a SW guard column (4 cm × 8 mm, 10 μm; TosoHaas). Proteins were eluted with PBS containing 0.3 m NaCl. Fractions of 200 μl were collected and tested for their ability to stimulate DNA synthesis in 3T3 cells. Column calibration was performed using EGF (6,000 Da), lactalbumin (14,200 Da), trypsin inhibitor (20,100 Da), and ovalbumin (45,000 Da). SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions using 18% polyacrylamide minigels as described (8Kim G.Y. Besner G.E. Steffen C.L. McCarthy D.W. Downing M.T. Luquette M.H. Abad M.S. Brigstock D.R. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Silver staining of proteins was performed as described (19Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed on (i) HPLC-purified growth factors, (ii) 8 μl of unfractionated ULF, or (iii) 100 μl of ULF after passage through 20-μl beds of heparin-Sepharose in the presence of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5m NaCl (pH 7.4) and subsequent extraction of the heparin beads with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Gels were blotted and blocked as described (8Kim G.Y. Besner G.E. Steffen C.L. McCarthy D.W. Downing M.T. Luquette M.H. Abad M.S. Brigstock D.R. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit preimmune serum or a 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit anti-pCTGF-(247–260) peptide antiserum (rabbit A; see below). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG followed by nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate chromogenic substrates. Eighteen synthetic peptides spanning the entire 103 C-terminal residues of CTGF were synthesized and received as a cleaved PepSetTM from Chiron Mimotopes (Clayton, Victoria, Australia). All peptides were synthesized with acetylated N termini and amidated C termini except CTGF-(247–255) and CTGF-(247–260), which were synthesized with free N-terminal amines, and CTGF-(326–349) and CTGF-(339–349), which were synthesized with acid C termini. All peptides contained one or no Cys residues; Cys292 in CTGF-(285–292) and Cys325 in CTGF-(318–328) were replaced with Ser to prevent intrachain disulfide bridging to Cys287or Cys323 within the respective peptides. Heparin-binding properties were determined using an adaptation of the method of Bairdet al. (20Baird A. Schubert D. Ling N. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2324-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Briefly, 37.5 nmol of each peptide were absorbed in duplicate to nitrocellulose using a dot-blot apparatus. The blot was blocked for 30 min with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15m NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4) and then incubated for 3 h at room temperature in this solution containing 10 μCi/ml [3H]heparin (NEN Life Science Products). The blot was washed four times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15m NaCl, and individual dots were mixed with scintillation fluid for counting of 3H. A four-branched multiple antigenic CTGF-(247–260) peptide comprising the sequence EENIKKGKKCIRTP (residues 247–260) was produced on a Synergy 432A peptide synthesizer (Applied BioSystems) and purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm; Rainin Instruments) that was developed with a 90-min 5–95% acetonitrile gradient in water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions containing the purified peptide were pooled, evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted in sterile water. Two New Zealand White rabbits (rabbits A and B), which had been bled to collect preimmune serum, were injected subcutaneously with 1 mg of peptide in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed 3 weeks later by an intramuscular injection of 250 μg of peptide in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Animals were bled 7 days later for collection of antiserum. Reactivity of the antisera was validated by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Preimmune serum and antiserum from rabbit A were used in these experiments. Total pig endometrial RNA was obtained as described (8Kim G.Y. Besner G.E. Steffen C.L. McCarthy D.W. Downing M.T. Luquette M.H. Abad M.S. Brigstock D.R. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to isolate poly(A+) RNA, 5 μg of which was subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) linker-primer containing XhoI. Second strand synthesis was primed by treating the mRNA-cDNA complex with RNase. Double-stranded cDNA was blunted using Klenow fragment and ligated toEcoRI adaptors that were subsequently phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase. 100 ng of XhoI-digested cDNA, purified on a Sephacryl S-400 column, were ligated into 1 μg of Uni-ZAP XR vector arms at the XhoI-EcoRI multiple cloning site, and the product was packaged using Gigapack II packaging extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primary library was amplified in XL1-Blue MRF′ cells to a titer of 1.4 × 1010plaque-forming units/ml. A verified32P-labeled CTGF probe, corresponding to the 3′ end of the predicted hCTGF primary translational product, was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of RNA from human foreskin fibroblasts using the forward and reverse primers,5′-GCCGTCTAGAGCGGCCGCATGGAAGAGAACATTAAGAAGGG-3′ and 3′-CCTCTGTACCGTACTTAAGCGCCGGCGACC-5′, respectively. The probe was used to screen 106 plaques, two of which showed reproducible hybridization and were isolated using a Rapid Excision Kit (Stratagene). Two ∼5.0-kilobase-pair pBluescript SK pig CTGF clones, termed pBSK-pCTGF1 and pBSK-pCTGF2, were obtained and used for initial sequencing reactions. pBSK-pCTGF1 was then fully sequenced by a combination of manual and automated dideoxy terminator sequencing (21Sanger F. Miklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Sequence data were obtained from both strands of DNA. Ion exchange chromatography of ULF showed the presence of cationic growth factor activity for Balb/c 3T3 cells that was eluted from Bio-Rex 70 columns by 0.3–0.6 m NaCl (data not shown). Although we have previously shown that constituent growth factors in this cationic extract include PDGF, HB-EGF, bFGF, and PTN (2Brigstock D.R. Heap R.B. Brown K.D. J. Reprod.

The elution position of this factor (hereafter termed HBGF-0.8) from heparin affinity columns was clearly distinct from PDGF, HB-EGF, PTN, aFGF, bFGF, and amphiregulin (2Brigstock D.R. Heap R.B.

Stability tests performed by exposing HBGF-0.8 to pH 1.5 for 2 min, 56 °C for 30 min, or 100 °C for 5 min demonstrated that the 3T3 cell mitogenic activity of HBGF-0.8 was highly susceptible to acid or heat inactivation (data not shown). Gel filtration FPLC showed that HBGF-0.8 was of M r∼10,000 under nonreducing and nondenaturing conditions (Fig.2). When compared with other 3T3 cells mitogens, the level of maximum induction of [3H]thymidine incorporation by HBGF-0.8 was comparable with that of calf serum or purified PDGF or bFGF rather than that of weaker mitogens such as IGF or EGF (Table I). Further, the 3T3 cell mitogenic activity of HBGF-0.8 was synergistically potentiated by 10 ng/ml IGF-I, 10 ng/ml PDGF, 3 ng/ml EGF, or 0.3 ng/ml bFGF (data not shown). HBGF-0.8 was also mitogenic for smooth muscle cells and produced a level of stimulation that exceeded that of a maximal amount of EGF but was less than that of bFGF (Table I). HBGF-0.8 lacked mitogenic activity for endothelial cells when tested alone or in the presence of 100 μg/ml heparin (Table I).Figure 2Gel filtration chromatography of HBGF-0.8. 0.5 ml of a peak HBGF-0.8 fraction from heparin affinity FPLC was applied to a TSK G2000 SW FPLC column as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fractions were tested for their ability to stimulate DNA synthesis in 3T3 cells at 40 μl/ml.

Open table in a new tab Growth factors were assayed at maximally mitogenic doses for their stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA of the indicated target cell lines. Fractions that contained HBGF-0.8 activity (i.e. fractions 15–18; see Fig. 1 A) were pooled, diluted, and subjected to a second cycle of heparin affinity FPLC using a TSK heparin 5PW column. As shown in Fig. 1 B, HBGF-0.8 was again eluted by 0.8m NaCl (fractions 31–36) but was resolved as two peaks of mitogenic activity that had distinct heparin-binding properties. These activity peaks were termed HBGF-0.8 peak 1 (HBGF-0.8-P1) and HBGF-0.8 peak 2 (HBGF-0.8-P2) and were present in fractions 31–34 and fractions 35 and 36, respectively (Fig. 1 B). HBGF-0.8-P1 and -P2 were adjusted to 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and individually subjected to C8reverse-phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 3, the elution positions of HBGF-0.8-P1 and -P2 were determined by bioassay of aliquots of fractions containing the column eluate after they had been evaporated and reconstituted in PBS, demonstrating that there was sufficient activity in the purified HBGF-0.8 samples to permit their detection and further characterization despite prolonged (approximately 30–40-min) exposure to pH 2 during the HPLC step. Silver-stained SDS-PAGE analysis of the fractions containing either HBGF-0.8-P1 or -P2 revealed the presence of a 10-kDa band under reducing conditions, the levels of which were directly correlated with the levels of mitogenic activity over the peak fractions (Fig. 3). This and other HPLC separations proved conclusively that the bioactivity was attributable to the 10-kDa moiety only. Second step HPLC purification of HBGF-0.8-P2 resulted in the isolation of a single 10-kDa protein that co-purified with Balb/c 3T3 cell mitogenic activity. The levels of mitogenic activity were directly correlated with those of the 10-kDa protein, which was completely pure as shown by silver staining (data not shown) and Western blotting (see below). Collectively, the results from 18 individual HPLC purifications confirmed a direct, causative relationship between the 10-kDa protein(s) and the mitogenic activity of HBGF-0.8-P1 and -P2. Analysis of the individual purification steps showed that 0.5–1.1 μg of HBGF-0.8-P1 or -P2 were each purified from 342 mg of crude ULF protein and that 10–22 activity units for HBGF-0.8-P1 or P2 were recovered after the first HPLC step as compared with 66,666 units in 1 liter of starting material (Table II). It should be noted that the apparent low recovery of HBGF-0.8 activity was attributable to (i) a major contribution by IGF, EGF, PDGF, bFGF, HB-EGF, and PTN to the overall 3T3 cell mitogenic activity of the crude and partially purified samples (2Brigstock D.R.

However, the obligatory coreceptor of phage infection, postulated from genetic studies, has remained elusive. Here we identify the C-terminal domain of the periplasmic protein TolA as the coreceptor for infection of Escherichia coli by phage fd and the N-terminal domain of the phage minor coat protein g3p as its cognate ligand. The neighboring g3p domain binds the primary receptor of phage infection, the F pilus, and blocks TolA binding in its absence. Contact with the pilus releases this blockage during infection. Our findings support a sequential two-way docking mechanism for phage infection, analogous to infection pathways proposed for a range of eukaryotic viruses including herpes simplex, adenoviruses, and also lentiviruses like HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2038851163,"Kinesin motors convert chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into unidirectional movement. To understand how kinesin motors bind to and move along microtubules, we fit the atomic structure of the motor domain of Ncd (a kinesin motor involved in meiosis and mitosis) into three-dimensional density maps of Ncd–microtubule complexes calculated by cryo-electron microscopy and image analysis. The model reveals that Ncd shares an extensive interaction surface with the microtubule, and that a portion of the binding site involves loops that contain conserved residues. In the Ncd dimer, the microtubule-bound motor domain makes intimate contact with its partner head, which is dissociated from the microtubule. This head–head interaction may be important in positioning the dissociated head to take a step to the next binding site on the microtubule protofilament."

A. 1992; 89: 10331-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The mGluR1a possesses a long COOH-terminal intracellular domain which is homologous to mGluR5 in the amino acid sequence. The COOH-terminal domain of mGluR1b is much smaller than that of mGluR1a since an additional exon containing an in-frame stop codon is inserted into the domain. In mGluR1c, a distinct insertion results in a similar truncation of the COOH terminus. In contrast to the large fast transient responses induced by mGluR1a, the shorter proteins mGluR1b and mGluR1c elicited a small and more slowly generated oscillatory current in Xenopus oocytes (7Pin J.-P. Waeber C. Prezeau L. Bockaert J. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10331-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Moreover, the subcellular distribution of mGluR1b expressed in cells was different from that of mGluR1a (8Pickering D.S. Thomsen C. Suzdak P.D. Fletcher E.J. Robitaille R. Salter M.W. MacDonald J.F. Huang X.-P. Hampson D.R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We previously reported the presence of a variant of mGluR5 and named it mGluR5b (9Minakami R. Katsuki F. Sugiyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An extra 96-base pair exon was inserted into mGluR5a, which had originally been reported as mGluR5. Because of this insertion, the mGluR5b cDNA is able to encode a protein longer than mGluR5a by 32 amino acids. The mRNA levels of the two isoforms were regulated in a development-specific manner (10Minakami R. Iida K. Hirakawa N. Sugiyama H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). No difference of these two isoforms could be seen regarding their pharmacological properties (11Minakami R. Katsuki F. Yamamoto T. Nakamura K. Sugiyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Joly C. Gomeza J. Brabet I. Curry K. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3970-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two mGluR5 variants revealed common functional characteristics with mGluR1a: the generation of the rapid and transient responses when expressed into Xenopus oocytes and the transduction mechanism and subcellular localization in transfected cells (12Joly C. Gomeza J. Brabet I. Curry K. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3970-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it was suggested that the long COOH-terminal domain of these three receptors may play a similar role, their structural determinants for the properties still remain unknown. The identification of proteins which interact with the COOH-terminal domain of mGluR5 may give a clue for the role of the domain and may suggest the biological function of the spliced cassette of mGluR5.In the present study, we created several fusion proteins of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) which possess various portions of the COOH-terminal intracellular region of mGluR5 and used them to detect proteins which could interact with them. A 17-kDa protein associating with them was identified as calmodulin (CaM). To our knowledge, none of the G protein-coupled receptors have been reported to interact with CaM directly although several ion channels are regulated by direct CaM binding (13Saimi Y. Kung C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). We characterized the two distinct CaM binding sites which apparently have different affinities for CaM. The two binding sites are separated by the alternatively spliced exon cassette of mGluR5b. We further showed that protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates the fusion proteins and the peptides which have one of the two CaM binding regions. PKC phosphorylation is inhibited by CaM binding, and conversely the formation of the complex with CaM is blocked by this phosphorylation. These results suggest that the direct binding of CaM on the COOH-terminal region of the mGluR5 may thus affect the PKC-mediated modulation of the receptor while also indicating that the phosphorylation state may regulate the effect of CaM binding on the receptor.DISCUSSIONWe have shown in this study that CaM directly binds the COOH terminus of the mGluR5 in vitro. We identified the two binding sites which are separated by the mGluR5b-specific alternative exon. There is growing evidence that the ion channels can be regulated by CaM through direct binding. In some cases, the binding reduces the channel activities; in others, it activates the channels. The binding of CaM on the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel reduces the channel activity (25Chen T.-Y. Yau K.-W. Nature. 1994; 368: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and in contrast, the ParameciumNa+ channels are activated by CaM (26Saimi Y. Ling K.-Y. Science. 1990; 249: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Direct CaM binding might thus be a general mechanism for the Ca2+-dependent regulation of ion channel properties. There has however been no previous report of direct CaM binding on G protein-coupled receptors as far as we know. In a recent study, a subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, which belongs to the glutamate-gated ion channels, was also reported to be a target of CaM binding (14Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Two CaM binding sites of the subunit NR1 were found which have different affinities for CaM. It was demonstrated by patch-clamp recording techniques that the interaction of CaM with the NR1 subunit causes an inactivation of the channels. We showed in this paper that CaM also interacts with the subtype 5 of the metabotropic glutamate receptors at two distinct sites. It is interesting that direct CaM binding has been demonstrated in members of both categories of glutamate receptors: namely, ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors. The degree of cooperativity between the two CaM binding sites is unknown in both the case of NR1 and the case of mGluR5. Although both of the fusion proteins derived from mGluR5a and mGluR5b associated with CaM in vitro, the affinities for CaM might be different in the two splice variants of the native form. It is also conceivable that a conformational change of the receptor by agonist stimulation might also affect the accessibility of CaM to the receptor. The functional consequences of the direct binding of CaM on mGluR5 thus remain to be elucidated.The eight mGluR subtypes can be classified into three groups (27Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar). The Group I mGluRs, which comprise mGluR1 and mGluR5, are coupled to phospholipase C, which catalyzes phosphoinositide hydrolysis. It results in the production of both inositol trisphosphate, which induces the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and diacylglycerol, which stimulates PKC. PKC is a serine/threonine kinase that is thought to play some role in diverse cellular processes. There are many serine and threonine residues at the COOH terminus of mGluR1 and mGluR5, which suggests that the residues could be targets of kinases that could thus regulate receptor activity. We herein demonstrated that the two CaM binding sites in mGluR5 are substrates for PKC. The changes in the cellular response by direct stimulation of PKC using phorbol esters have been previously investigated in many studies. The mGluR-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was inhibited by the PKC stimulation in cerebellar granule cells (28Canonico P.L. Favit A. Catania M.V. Nicoletti F. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and in rat hippocampal slices (29Schoepp D.D. Johnson B.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 4299-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The diacylglycerol production by the agonist stimulation of mGluRs was also inhibited by the direct stimulation of PKC in cerebrocortical nerve terminals (30Herrero I. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The receptor-mediated response was inhibited by the preactivation of PKC in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells transfected with mGluR1a (31Thomsen C. Mulvihill E.R. Haldeman B. Pickering D.S. Hampson D.R. Suzdak P.D. Brain Res. 1993; 619: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) whereas receptor phosphorylation was also observed in response to agonist activation of the receptor in the same BHK cells (32Alaluf S. Mulvihill E.R. McIlhinney R.A.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the suggestion that the PKC phosphorylation of Group I receptor may result in receptor desensitization. The phosphorylation site responsible for the desensitization has yet to be identified, and this study thus suggests some likely candidates. Preliminary results suggest that a higher rate of phosphate incorporation appears in the fusion protein derived from mGluR5b than in the fusion protein from mGluR5a under the same reaction conditions. 2R. Minakami, unpublished observations. Although the fusion protein which has only the mGluR5b-specific region is not phosphorylated, the region might be phosphorylated when linked to site I and/or site II. It is also conceivable that the mGluR5b-specific exon between site I and site II affects the accessibility of the PKC enzyme to the two sites. The alternative exon might serve as a modulatory domain which affects the phosphorylation state of the receptor.The CaM-dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation was demonstrated at both sites in mGluR5. The phosphorylation of the site II protein, which showed a higher affinity for CaM, was more sensitively suppressed by CaM. We observed similar results with peptides R1 and R2, where the latter was more sensitive in phosphorylation suppression by CaM. Thus the most likely reason for the reduced phosphorylation is that CaM blocks access of PKC to the phosphorylation site. We further showed that the phosphorylation of the two sites prevents their interaction with CaM. These results thus indicated that the CaM binding and the PKC phosphorylation are mutually antagonistic.Myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) is a major cellular substrate of PKC, and it binds to both CaM and actin. PKC phosphorylation inhibits CaM and actin binding, and CaM binding prevents PKC phosphorylation and actin binding (33Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 34Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The CaM binding domains of mGluR5 might thus be involved in cytoskeletal association in a manner analogous to the MARCKS protein. The relative timing of surges of internal Ca2+ transient (and the Ca2+-CaM complexes it produces) and PKC activity thus determines the extent of MARCKS protein phosphorylation (35Chakravarthy B.R. Isaacs R.J. Morley P. Whitfield J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24911-24916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that the different times of arrival of Ca2+ and PKC signal to the membrane-associated mGluR5 might thus affect the extent of the phosphorylation of mGluR5.Whereas the two mGluR5 variants and mGluR1a possess a long cytoplasmic domain, the splice variants of mGluR1 named mGluR1b and mGluR1c have a smaller COOH terminus than the three receptors because of an in-frame stop codon in the alternative exon (6Tanabe Y. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 7Pin J.-P. Waeber C. Prezeau L. Bockaert J. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10331-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The shorter proteins elicited a small and slowly generated oscillatory current inXenopus oocytes (7Pin J.-P. Waeber C. Prezeau L. Bockaert J. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10331-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) whereas the subcellular distribution of mGluR1b was different from mGluR1a and the two mGluR5 isoforms when expressed in cells (8Pickering D.S. Thomsen C. Suzdak P.D. Fletcher E.J. Robitaille R. Salter M.W. MacDonald J.F. Huang X.-P. Hampson D.R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain of mGluR1a contains regions homologous to site I and site II of mGluR5, whereas the smaller cytoplasmic regions in mGluR1b and mGluR1c also have a region corresponding to site I but do not have a region corresponding to site II because of the truncation by the in-frame stop codon. We could thus speculate that a loss of a target sequence of CaM or PKC or possibly a binding domain of actin in mGluR1b and mGluR1c might thus confer the characteristics shown in the shorter receptor. Our findings in this study may provide new leads for approaching the Ca2+-mediated modulation of the mGluRs as well as the biological function of the spliced cassette of the receptors.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13361-13368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three splice variants called mGluR1a to -1c have been described (6Tanabe Y. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 7Pin J.-P. Waeber C. Prezeau L. Bockaert J. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10331-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The mGluR1a possesses a long COOH-terminal intracellular domain which is homologous to mGluR5 in the amino acid sequence. The COOH-terminal domain of mGluR1b is much smaller than that of mGluR1a since an additional exon containing an in-frame stop codon is inserted into the domain. In mGluR1c, a distinct insertion results in a similar truncation of the COOH terminus. In contrast to the large fast transient responses induced by mGluR1a, the shorter proteins mGluR1b and mGluR1c elicited a small and more slowly generated oscillatory current in Xenopus oocytes (7Pin J.-P. Waeber C. Prezeau L. Bockaert J. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10331-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Moreover, the subcellular distribution of mGluR1b expressed in cells was different from that of mGluR1a (8Pickering D.S. Thomsen C. Suzdak P.D. Fletcher E.J. Robitaille R. Salter M.W. MacDonald J.F. Huang X.-P. Hampson D.R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We previously reported the presence of a variant of mGluR5 and named it mGluR5b (9Minakami R. Katsuki F. Sugiyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An extra 96-base pair exon was inserted into mGluR5a, which had originally been reported as mGluR5. Because of this insertion, the mGluR5b cDNA is able to encode a protein longer than mGluR5a by 32 amino acids. The mRNA levels of the two isoforms were regulated in a development-specific manner (10Minakami R. Iida K. Hirakawa N. Sugiyama H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). No difference of these two isoforms could be seen regarding their pharmacological properties (11Minakami R. Katsuki F. Yamamoto T. Nakamura K. Sugiyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Joly C. Gomeza J. Brabet I. Curry K. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3970-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two mGluR5 variants revealed common functional characteristics with mGluR1a: the generation of the rapid and transient responses when expressed into Xenopus oocytes and the transduction mechanism and subcellular localization in transfected cells (12Joly C. Gomeza J. Brabet I. Curry K. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3970-3981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it was suggested that the long COOH-terminal domain of these three receptors may play a similar role, their structural determinants for the properties still remain unknown. The identification of proteins which interact with the COOH-terminal domain of mGluR5 may give a clue for the role of the domain and may suggest the biological function of the spliced cassette of mGluR5. In the present study, we created several fusion proteins of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) which possess various portions of the COOH-terminal intracellular region of mGluR5 and used them to detect proteins which could interact with them. A 17-kDa protein associating with them was identified as calmodulin (CaM). To our knowledge, none of the G protein-coupled receptors have been reported to interact with CaM directly although several ion channels are regulated by direct CaM binding (13Saimi Y. Kung C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). We characterized the two distinct CaM binding sites which apparently have different affinities for CaM. The two binding sites are separated by the alternatively spliced exon cassette of mGluR5b. We further showed that protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates the fusion proteins and the peptides which have one of the two CaM binding regions. PKC phosphorylation is inhibited by CaM binding, and conversely the formation of the complex with CaM is blocked by this phosphorylation. These results suggest that the direct binding of CaM on the COOH-terminal region of the mGluR5 may thus affect the PKC-mediated modulation of the receptor while also indicating that the phosphorylation state may regulate the effect of CaM binding on the receptor. DISCUSSIONWe have shown in this study that CaM directly binds the COOH terminus of the mGluR5 in vitro. We identified the two binding sites which are separated by the mGluR5b-specific alternative exon. There is growing evidence that the ion channels can be regulated by CaM through direct binding. In some cases, the binding reduces the channel activities; in others, it activates the channels. The binding of CaM on the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel reduces the channel activity (25Chen T.-Y. Yau K.-W. Nature. 1994; 368: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and in contrast, the ParameciumNa+ channels are activated by CaM (26Saimi Y. Ling K.-Y. Science. 1990; 249: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Direct CaM binding might thus be a general mechanism for the Ca2+-dependent regulation of ion channel properties. There has however been no previous report of direct CaM binding on G protein-coupled receptors as far as we know. In a recent study, a subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, which belongs to the glutamate-gated ion channels, was also reported to be a target of CaM binding (14Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhardt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Two CaM binding sites of the subunit NR1 were found which have different affinities for CaM. It was demonstrated by patch-clamp recording techniques that the interaction of CaM with the NR1 subunit causes an inactivation of the channels. We showed in this paper that CaM also interacts with the subtype 5 of the metabotropic glutamate receptors at two distinct sites. It is interesting that direct CaM binding has been demonstrated in members of both categories of glutamate receptors: namely, ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors. The degree of cooperativity between the two CaM binding sites is unknown in both the case of NR1 and the case of mGluR5. Although both of the fusion proteins derived from mGluR5a and mGluR5b associated with CaM in vitro, the affinities for CaM might be different in the two splice variants of the native form. It is also conceivable that a conformational change of the receptor by agonist stimulation might also affect the accessibility of CaM to the receptor. The functional consequences of the direct binding of CaM on mGluR5 thus remain to be elucidated.The eight mGluR subtypes can be classified into three groups (27Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar). The Group I mGluRs, which comprise mGluR1 and mGluR5, are coupled to phospholipase C, which catalyzes phosphoinositide hydrolysis. It results in the production of both inositol trisphosphate, which induces the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and diacylglycerol, which stimulates PKC. PKC is a serine/threonine kinase that is thought to play some role in diverse cellular processes. There are many serine and threonine residues at the COOH terminus of mGluR1 and mGluR5, which suggests that the residues could be targets of kinases that could thus regulate receptor activity. We herein demonstrated that the two CaM binding sites in mGluR5 are substrates for PKC. The changes in the cellular response by direct stimulation of PKC using phorbol esters have been previously investigated in many studies. The mGluR-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was inhibited by the PKC stimulation in cerebellar granule cells (28Canonico P.L. Favit A. Catania M.V. Nicoletti F. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and in rat hippocampal slices (29Schoepp D.D. Johnson B.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 4299-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The diacylglycerol production by the agonist stimulation of mGluRs was also inhibited by the direct stimulation of PKC in cerebrocortical nerve terminals (30Herrero I. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The receptor-mediated response was inhibited by the preactivation of PKC in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells transfected with mGluR1a (31Thomsen C. Mulvihill E.R. Haldeman B. Pickering D.S. Hampson D.R. Suzdak P.D. Brain Res. 1993; 619: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) whereas receptor phosphorylation was also observed in response to agonist activation of the receptor in the same BHK cells (32Alaluf S. Mulvihill E.R. McIlhinney R.A.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the suggestion that the PKC phosphorylation of Group I receptor may result in receptor desensitization. The phosphorylation site responsible for the desensitization has yet to be identified, and this study thus suggests some likely candidates. Preliminary results suggest that a higher rate of phosphate incorporation appears in the fusion protein derived from mGluR5b than in the fusion protein from mGluR5a under the same reaction conditions. 2R. Minakami, unpublished observations. Although the fusion protein which has only the mGluR5b-specific region is not phosphorylated, the region might be phosphorylated when linked to site I and/or site II. It is also conceivable that the mGluR5b-specific exon between site I and site II affects the accessibility of the PKC enzyme to the two sites. The alternative exon might serve as a modulatory domain which affects the phosphorylation state of the receptor.The CaM-dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation was demonstrated at both sites in mGluR5. The phosphorylation of the site II protein, which showed a higher affinity for CaM, was more sensitively suppressed by CaM. We observed similar results with peptides R1 and R2, where the latter was more sensitive in phosphorylation suppression by CaM. Thus the most likely reason for the reduced phosphorylation is that CaM blocks access of PKC to the phosphorylation site. We further showed that the phosphorylation of the two sites prevents their interaction with CaM. These results thus indicated that the CaM binding and the PKC phosphorylation are mutually antagonistic.Myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) is a major cellular substrate of PKC, and it binds to both CaM and actin. PKC phosphorylation inhibits CaM and actin binding, and CaM binding prevents PKC phosphorylation and actin binding (33Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 34Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The CaM binding domains of mGluR5 might thus be involved in cytoskeletal association in a manner analogous to the MARCKS protein. The relative timing of surges of internal Ca2+ transient (and the Ca2+-CaM complexes it produces) and PKC activity thus determines the extent of MARCKS protein phosphorylation (35Chakravarthy B.R. Isaacs R.J. Morley P. Whitfield J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24911-24916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that the different times of arrival of Ca2+ and PKC signal to the membrane-associated mGluR5 might thus affect the extent of the phosphorylation of mGluR5.Whereas the two mGluR5 variants and mGluR1a possess a long cytoplasmic domain, the splice variants of mGluR1 named mGluR1b and mGluR1c have a smaller COOH terminus than the three receptors because of an in-frame stop codon in the alternative exon (6Tanabe Y. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 7Pin J.-P. Waeber C. Prezeau L. Bockaert J. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl.

A. 1992; 89: 10331-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) whereas the subcellular distribution of mGluR1b was different from mGluR1a and the two mGluR5 isoforms when expressed in cells (8Pickering D.S. Thomsen C. Suzdak P.D. Fletcher E.J. Robitaille R. Salter M.W. MacDonald J.F. Huang X.-P. Hampson D.R. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain of mGluR1a contains regions homologous to site I and site II of mGluR5, whereas the smaller cytoplasmic regions in mGluR1b and mGluR1c also have a region corresponding to site I but do not have a region corresponding to site II because of the truncation by the in-frame stop codon. We could thus speculate that a loss of a target sequence of CaM or PKC or possibly a binding domain of actin in mGluR1b and mGluR1c might thus confer the characteristics shown in the shorter receptor. Our findings in this study may provide new leads for approaching the Ca2+-mediated modulation of the mGluRs as well as the biological function of the spliced cassette of the receptors. We have shown in this study that CaM directly binds the COOH terminus of the mGluR5 in vitro. We identified the two binding sites which are separated by the mGluR5b-specific alternative exon.

Previously, we have shown that overexpression of a BRCA1 splice variant BRCA1a accelerates apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. In an attempt to determine whether the subcellular localization of BRCA1 is cell cycle regulated, we have studied the subcellular distribution of BRCA1 in asynchronous and growth arrested normal, breast and ovarian cancer cells using different BRCA1 antibodies by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining. Upon serum starvation of NIH3T3, some breast and ovarian cancer cells, most of the BRCA1 protein redistributed to the nucleus revealing a new type of regulation that may modulate the activity of BRCA1 gene. We have also characterized two new variant BRCA1 proteins (BRCA1a/p110 and BRCA1b/p100) which are phosphoproteins containing phosphotyrosine. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting analysis indicate cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins. To elucidate the biological function of BRCA1, we created a bacterial fusion protein of glutathione-transferase (GST) and BRCA1 zinc finger domain and detected two cellular proteins with molecular weights of approximately 32 and 65 kD, one of which contains phosphotyrosine designated p32 and p65 BRCA1 interacting proteins (BIP) that specifically interact with BRCA1. Western blot analysis of BIP with cyclins/CDKs and E2F antisera indicated association with cdc2, cdk2, cdk4, cyclin B, cyclin D, cyclin A and E2F-4 but not with cdk3, cdk5, cdk6, E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3, E2F-5 and cyclin E. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated a direct interaction of in vitro translated BRCA1a and BRCA1b proteins with recombinant cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, cdc2, cdk2 and E2F fusion proteins in vitro. Taken together these results seem to suggest that BRCA1 could be an important negative regulator of cell cycle that functions through interaction with E2F transcriptional factors and phosphorylation by cyclins/cdk complexes with the zinc ring finger functioning as a major protein-protein interaction domain. If the interactions we observe in vitro is also seen in vivo then it may be possible that lack or impaired binding of the disrupted BRCA1 proteins to E2F, cyclins/CDKs in patients with mutations in the zinc finger domain could deprive the cell of an important mechanism for braking cell proliferation leading to the development of breast and ovarian cancers."

Thus, activation of the Met RTK is also implicated in neoplasia. Consistent with this, the Met RTK was originally isolated as an oncogene, Tpr-Met (14Cooper C.S. Park M. Blair D.G. Tainsky M.A. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Vande Woude G. Nature. 1984; 311: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Oncogenic activation of the Met receptor occurred following translocation of sequences encoding the amino terminus of the Tpr gene located on chromosome one upstream of sequences encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the Met RTK located on chromosome seven (15Park M.

The product of the resulting chimeric gene, Tpr-Met, is a constitutively activated, transforming kinase (16Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Curr. Opin. Genet.

To define signal transduction pathways required for transformation of fibroblasts by Tpr-Met, we have shown that a single carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue, Tyr489, is phosphorylated (18Kamikura D.M. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1010-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and essential for the association of Tpr-Met with the Grb2 adaptor protein, phospholipase Cγ, and the tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2 (19Fixman E.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13116-13122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This tyrosine is also required for the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase and the tyrosine phosphorylation of and/or association with an unknown protein of 110 kDa (19Fixman E.D. Naujokas M.A. Rodrigues G.A. Moran M.F. Park M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 237-249PubMed Google Scholar). A Y489F Tpr-Met mutant transforms cells at 20% of the efficiency of the wild-type Tpr-Met oncoprotein; however, because the association of multiple signaling molecules with Tpr-Met is dependent upon Tyr489, it was unclear which of these were required for transformation. A mutant that selectively fails to associate with Grb2, yet retains the ability to associate with phospholipase Cγ, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, and SHP2, transforms cells with the same efficiency as the Y489F mutant (20Fixman E.D.

Thus, association of Tpr-Met with the Grb2 adaptor protein is essential for efficient transformation of fibroblasts by Tpr-Met. The identification of signaling pathways downstream of Grb2 will help define the mechanism by which Tpr-Met transforms Fr3T3 fibroblasts. In the present study we demonstrate that association of Grb2 with Tpr-Met is essential for the efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of the Cbl protooncogene product, and a previously characterized 110-kDa protein which we show corresponds to the Grb2-associated docking protein, Gab1. The generation of the various Tpr-Met mutant proteins has been described previously (18Kamikura D.M. Naujokas M.A. Park M.

All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics. Cell lines expressing either wild-type or mutant forms of Tpr-Met were generated by ecotropic retroviral infection of parental Fischer rat 3T3 (Fr3T3) fibroblasts as described previously (22Rodrigues G.A. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2962-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Antibodies which recognize Tpr-Met were generated against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of the Tpr-Met protein as described previously (22Rodrigues G.A. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell.

Antibodies which recognize Gab1 were generated against bacterially expressed GST-Gab1 as described previously (23Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Antibodies to Cbl were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to hemagglutinin were purchased from Berkeley Antibody Company. For anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, recombinant horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antiphosphotyrosine Fab fragment, RC20H, from Transduction Laboratories, was utilized. Generation of cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting have been described previously (19Fixman E.D. Naujokas M.A. Rodrigues G.A. Moran M.F. Park M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 237-249PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria expressing GST proteins fused to either full-length Grb2, SH2, SH3(N)-SH2, or SH2-SH3(C) domains of Grb2 were kindly provided by Drs. Mike Moran, Alain Charest, and Michel Tremblay. Fusion proteins were produced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction and purification on glutathione-agarose beads (24Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Approximately 0.5–1.0 μg of protein was used in the in vitro association experiments. 293 cells (8 × 105) were transfected with 5 μg of expression plasmid DNA encoding either wild-type or mutant forms of the Tpr-Met proteins utilizing calcium phosphate coprecipitation. In Fig.5 B, 2 μg of an expression plasmid encoding hemagglutinin-tagged Gab1 were included. The cells were maintained for 3 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, at which time they were harvested in 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. COS-1 cells (106) were transfected with 6 μg of expression plasmid DNA encoding either wild-type or mutant forms of the Tpr-Met proteins utilizing a modification of the DEAE-dextran protocol (19Fixman E.D. Naujokas M.A. Rodrigues G.A. Moran M.F. Park M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 237-249PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were maintained for 60 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, after which they were harvested in 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Tpr-Met proteins from approximately 20% of each lysate were immunoprecipitated with antibody 144, the immune complexes collected on protein A-Sepharose, and washed with 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. In vitroassociation/kinase assays were carried out as described (19Fixman E.D. Naujokas M.A. Rodrigues G.A. Moran M.F. Park M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 237-249PubMed Google Scholar, 25Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Escobedo J.A. Rapp U.R. Roberts T.M. Williams L.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). For denaturation and reimmunoprecipitation following the in vitro association/kinase assay, the immune complexes were boiled for 5 min in 900 μl of buffer composed of 0.4% SDS, 50 mm triethanolamine, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Following addition of 125 μl of Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) and 250 μl of 10% Triton X-100, the lysates were incubated with GST-Grb2 fusion proteins or anti-Tpr-Met antibody 144 for 3 h at 4 °C and washed with 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Samples were then suspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and subjected to 9% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The carboxyl terminus of the Tpr-Met oncoprotein contains three tyrosine residues, Tyr482, Tyr489, and Tyr498, two of which are followed by consensus binding sites for several SH2 binding proteins (Fig.1) (26Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell.

Consistent with Tyr489 being the only detectably phosphorylated residue in the carboxyl terminus (18Kamikura D.M. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1010-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), mutation of this residue to a conserved Phe residue results in a dramatic decrease in transforming activity of the Y489F mutant protein (19Fixman E.D. Naujokas M.A. Rodrigues G.A. Moran M.F. Park M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 237-249PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. dalla Zonca P. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Utilizing carboxyl-terminal tyrosine mutant Tpr-Met proteins, Y482F, Y489F, and Y482F/Y489F, as well as a mutant that has selectively lost the ability to associate with Grb2, N491H, we have demonstrated that pathways downstream of Grb2 and Shc are required for transformation of Fr3T3 cells by Tpr-Met (20Fixman E.D. Fournier T.M. Kamikura D.M. Naujokas M.A. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13116-13122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, characterization of the signaling pathways downstream of Grb2 and Shc will permit further definition of the mechanism by which Tpr-Met transforms Fr3T3 fibroblasts. Using a sensitive in vitro association/kinase assay to detect proteins which associate with Tpr-Met, we have previously identified a highly phosphorylated protein of 110 kDa whose association with and/or phosphorylation by Tpr-Met was dependent upon the presence of Tyr489 (19Fixman E.D. Naujokas M.A. Rodrigues G.A. Moran M.F. Park M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 237-249PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A, lane 5). When compared with wild-type Tpr-Met (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), a Y482F/Y489F Tpr-Met mutant failed to associate with and/or phosphorylate the 110-kDa protein (Fig. 2 A, lane 6), whereas the Y482F Tpr-Met mutant retained the ability to associate with and/or phosphorylate this protein (Fig. 2 A,lane 4). Interestingly, the N491H Tpr-Met mutant, which no longer binds to Grb2, was also severely impaired in its ability to associate with and/or phosphorylate the 110-kDa protein (Fig.2 A, lane 7). This suggested that the association of the 110-kDa protein with Tpr-Met was indirect, mediated by the Grb2 adaptor protein, or direct and, like Grb2, dependent upon the Asn residue two amino acids downstream of tyrosine 489. To investigate whether the 110-kDa protein could associate directly with Grb2, the phosphorylated proteins from an in vitroassociation/kinase assay were denatured by boiling in buffer containing 0.4% SDS and 2 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Following addition of Tris-Cl and Triton X-100, the dissociated and denatured proteins were incubated with anti-Tpr-Met antibody 144 (22Rodrigues G.A. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2962-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or GST proteins encoding either full-length Grb2 or various domains of Grb2. No detectable 110-kDa protein was coimmunoprecipitated with Tpr-Met, demonstrating that the protein complexes had been efficiently dissociated (Fig. 2 B, lane 6). However, following incubation of the dissociated, denatured proteins with a nondenatured GST-Grb2 fusion protein, association of the 110-kDa protein with full-length Grb2 was detected (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) demonstrating the the 110-kDa protein could associate directly with Grb2. The 110-kDa protein also associated to the same extent with the SH2-SH3(C) Grb2 fusion protein (Fig. 2 B, lane 3) and to a lesser extent with the SH3(N)-SH2, and SH3(N)-SH3(C) Grb2 fusion proteins (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and4). It did not associate with a fusion protein encoding only the SH2 domain of Grb2 (Fig. 2 B, lane 5). Tpr-Met, on the other hand, associated with full-length Grb2 (Fig.2 B, lane 1) as well as the SH3(N)-SH2, SH2-SH3(C), and SH2 fusion proteins (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2, 3, and 5) but not with the SH3(N)-SH3(C) Grb2 fusion protein. Neither Tpr-Met nor the 110-kDa protein associated with GST (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the 110-kDa protein associated primarily with the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 and suggest that the Grb2 adaptor protein acts to couple the 110-kDa protein with Tpr-Met. The Cbl protooncogene product, which is similar in size to the 110-kDa protein, is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following stimulation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (29Tanaka S. Neff L. Baron R. Levy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14347-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 30Galisteo M.L. Dikic I. Batzer A.G. Langdon W.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20242-20245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and in v-Src and v-Abl transformed fibroblasts (29Tanaka S. Neff L. Baron R. Levy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14347-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 31Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As demonstrated by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, Cbl was highly phosphorylated in the stable cell lines expressing wild-type or the highly transforming Y482F Tpr-Met mutants (Fig. 3 A,lanes 2–5). However, Cbl was poorly phosphorylated in stable cell lines expressing the weakly transforming N491H, Y489F or the nontransforming Y482F/Y489F Tpr-Met mutants (Fig. 3 A,lanes 6–11), although similar amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 3 B). Thus, in a manner similar to the 110-kDa protein, the increased level of Cbl phosphorylation in stable cell lines expressing Tpr-Met was dependent upon Tyr489 and more specifically, the Asn residue two amino acids downstream of Tyr489. These data suggested that Cbl was binding Tpr-Met either directly, recognizing the consensus binding site, YVNV, present at position 489, or indirectly via another protein that required Tyr489 for association. Cbl contains several proline-rich repeats that mediate its association with SH3 domain-containing proteins, including Grb2 (32Meisner H. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25332-25335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10800-10805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Because Cbl was not highly phosphorylated in cell lines expressing Tpr-Met mutants unable to bind Grb2, the possibility that Grb2 was functioning as an adaptor coupling the Tpr-Met oncoprotein with Cbl was investigated. A GST-Grb2 fusion protein was able to bind to Cbl present in lysates prepared from both Fr3T3 fibroblasts and cell lines expressing wild-type or the mutant Tpr-Met proteins (Fig.3 C, lanes 3–10). Furthermore, while full-length Grb2 (Fig. 3 D, lane 1), as well as the SH3(N)-SH2, and SH3(N)-SH3(C) fusion proteins (Fig. 3 D,lanes 2 and 4) all retained the ability to associate with Cbl from wild-type Tpr-Met-transformed Fr3T3 cells, fusion proteins encoding the SH2-SH3(C) or the SH2 domain alone of Grb2 did not bind Cbl well (Fig. 3 D, lanes 3 and5). Each of the GST fusion proteins was present in approximately the same amount (Fig. 3 D, bottom). Thus, these data demonstrate that the association of Cbl with Grb2 was mediated by the amino-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2. This is consistent with the ability of GST-Grb2 to bind Cbl irrespective of the phosphorylation status of Cbl (Fig. 3 C). However, as shown in Fig. 2 B, the association between Grb2 and the 110-kDa protein was mediated primarily by the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2, suggesting that the 110-kDa protein was not Cbl. Furthermore, Cbl was not readily coimmunoprecipitated with Tpr-Met in Fr3T3 cells transformed by Tpr-Met (data not shown) or when Tpr-Met was overexpressed in 293 cells, which express high levels of endogenous Cbl (32Meisner H. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25332-25335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, consistent with previous reports (32Meisner H. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25332-25335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Bowtell D.D.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14554-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) the EGF receptor coimmunoprecipitated with Cbl following EGF stimulation of 293 cells (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4and 5, and data not shown). Thus, while Cbl coimmunoprecipitated with the EGF receptor it did not detectably coimmunoprecipitate with Tpr-Met, even though abundant Tpr-Met protein was present (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–3) and Cbl was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in 293 cells expressing wild-type Tpr-Met (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and 2). Moreover, when compared in the in vitro association/kinase assay, a lysate depleted of Cbl protein (Fig. 4 C) contained abundant levels of the phosphorylated 110-kDa protein compared with a nondepleted lysate (Fig. 4 D, lanes 2 and3). Thus, while Cbl is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in cells transformed by Tpr-Met, it does not correspond to the 110-kDa protein that associates stably with and is tyrosine phosphorylated by Tpr-Met. Gab1, a Grb2-binding protein of 115 kDa, was recently isolated and shown to be a multisubstrate docking protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation of cells with EGF and insulin (23Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Because both Gab1 and the 110-kDa protein associate with Grb2 and are similar in size, the ability of Gab1 to associate with Tpr-Met was determined. In the in vitro association assay Gab1 expressed in Fr3T3 fibroblasts associated with the wild-type Tpr-Met oncoprotein (Fig. 5 A,lane 1) and to a lesser extent with the highly transforming Y482F mutant Tpr-Met protein (Fig. 5 A, lane 3). However, it did not associate well with the poorly transforming Y489F, N491H, or the nontransforming Y482F/Y489F mutant Tpr-Met proteins, none of which bind Grb2 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–6). Similarly, in 293 cells overexpressing Tpr-Met and Gab1, both the wild-type and the highly transforming Y482F mutant Tpr-Met proteins coimmunoprecipitated with Gab1 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1and 3), whereas the nontransforming Y482F/Y489F Tpr-Met mutant associated poorly with Gab1 (Fig. 5 B, lane 5), to the same extent as the nontransforming K241A Tpr-Met mutant (Fig. 5 B, lane 2). Interestingly, compared with wild-type Tpr-Met, when overexpressed, the poorly transforming Y489F and N491H mutants showed weak association with Gab1 (Fig.5 B, lanes 4 and 6). Each of the Tpr-Met proteins was expressed at approximately equal levels (Fig.5 C, lanes 1–6). In a manner similar to the 110-kDa protein (Fig. 2 B), Gab1 from serum-starved Fr3T3 cells (Fig. 5 D) or Tpr-Met transformed Fr3T3 cells (Fig. 5 E) associated predominantly with GST-Grb2 fusion proteins containing the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (Fig. 5, D and E, lanes 1, 3, and 4) and not detectably with a fusion protein encoding only the SH2 domain of Grb2 (Fig. 5,D and E, lanes 5). Thus, because both Gab1 and the 110-kDa protein bound preferentially to the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2, were impaired in their ability to interact with Tpr-Met mutants that did not bind Grb2 (Y489F and N491H, Figs. 2 A and 5, A and B) and were similar in size, we examined whether the 110-kDa protein was Gab1. In the in vitro association/kinase assay, using a lysate immunodepleted with anti-Gab1 antiserum, the 110-kDa Tpr-Met substrate was no longer detected (Fig. 5 F, lane 4). However, a lysate treated similarly, but without addition of anti-Gab1 antiserum, retained the 110-kDa protein (Fig. 5 F, lane 3). Thus, the 110-kDa Tpr-Met substrate corresponds to the Grb2-associated docking protein, Gab1. Using a series of mutant Tpr-Met oncoproteins, we have previously demonstrated that, in the absence of direct Grb2 association and Shc phosphorylation, Tpr-Met fails to transform Fr3T3 fibroblasts (20Fixman E.D. Fournier T.M. Kamikura D.M. Naujokas M.A. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13116-13122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of pathways downstream of these two adaptor molecules is crucial in defining the mechanism by which Tpr-Met transforms fibroblasts. We have shown here that tyrosine phosphorylation of the Cbl protooncogene product and the multisubstrate docking protein, Gab1, correlates with the ability of the Tpr-Met oncoprotein to associate with the Grb2 adaptor protein and to transform cells. The c-Cbl protooncogene product is a 120-kDa phosphoprotein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells transformed by v-Src, v-Abl, or Bcr-Abl and following activation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (29Tanaka S.

Consistent with tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl playing a role in cellular transformation, Cbl was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in cells expressing only the highly transforming wild-type or Y482F mutant Tpr-Met oncoproteins (Figs. 3 A and 4 A). The level of Cbl phosphorylation was reduced in cells expressing the weakly transforming Tpr-Met mutants, Y489F and N491H, which do not bind to Grb2 (Fig. 3 A) (19Fixman E.D. Naujokas M.A. Rodrigues G.A. Moran M.F. Park M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 237-249PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fixman E.D. Fournier T.M. Kamikura D.M. Naujokas M.A. Park M. J. Biol.

Thus, the dramatic decrease in Cbl phosphorylation in cells expressing the N491H or Y489F Tpr-Met mutants suggests that either Grb2 or the Asn residue two amino acids downstream of Tyr489 is required for subsequent phosphorylation of Cbl. Consistent with the former, Cbl contains proline-rich sequences that interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins (33Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol.

Moreover, an interaction between wild-type Tpr-Met and Cbl was not readily detected in Tpr-Met-transformed fibroblasts (data not shown) or in cotransfection assays where an association between Cbl and the EGF receptor was observed (Fig. 4 A). Thus, while the exact mechanism by which Cbl is phosphorylated in Tpr-Met-transformed fibroblasts is unclear, the level of Cbl phosphorylation correlated with the ability of the mutant Tpr-Met proteins to transform cells. In addition to Cbl, the highly transforming wild-type Tpr-Met oncoprotein induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a 110-kDa protein both in vivo (19Fixman E.D. Naujokas M.A. Rodrigues G.A. Moran M.F. Park M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 237-249PubMed Google Scholar) andin vitro (Fig. 2 A). Like Cbl, phosphorylation of this protein was dependent upon the ability of Tpr-Met to associate with Grb2. However, unlike Cbl, which bound primarily to GST-Grb2 fusion proteins containing the amino-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (Fig.3 D), the 110-kDa protein bound primarily to GST-Grb2 fusion proteins containing the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (Fig.2 B). Moreover, unlike Cbl, a stable association between the 110-kDa protein and Tpr-Met was detected (Fig. 2 A) and a lysate prepared from Fr3T3 fibroblasts immunodepleted of Cbl, still contained abundant levels of the 110-kDa phosphoprotein (Fig.4 D), providing further evidence that the 110-kDa protein did not correspond to Cbl. Recently a 115-kDa, Grb2 associated protein, Gab1, was identified and shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation of cells with EGF and insulin (23Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that the highly phosphorylated 110-kDa Tpr-Met substrate in Fr3T3 fibroblasts is Gab1. Like the 110-kDa Tpr-Met substrate, Gab1 associated primarily with the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (Figs. 2 B and 5,D, and E) and neither Gab1 nor the 110-kDa Tpr-Met substrate associated efficiently with Tpr-Met mutant proteins that failed to bind Grb2 directly (Figs. 2 A and 5,A and B). Furthermore, a lysate prepared from Fr3T3 fibroblasts and immunodepleted of Gab1 contained no 110-kDa protein (Fig. 5 F), consistent with the 110-kDa protein being Gab1. While the majority of Gab1 association with Tpr-Met was dependent upon an intact Grb2 binding site at Tyr489, we also consistently observed low, but detectable binding of Gab1 to the Y489F and N491H Tpr-Met mutants that fail to bind Grb2 (Fig. 5, Aand B). This may represent direct binding of Gab1 to Y482 of Tpr-Met. Interestingly, a direct interaction between Gab1 and Y1349 in the Met receptor (which corresponds to Y482 in Tpr-Met) was identified using the yeast two hybrid system (41Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our data; however, we demonstrate here that the majority of Gab1 association with Tpr-Met is mediated by Tyr489 and Grb2 and not by direct association with Tyr482. Importantly, the near loss of Gab1 phosphorylation and reduced association of Gab1 with the Y489F and N491H Tpr-Met mutants correlated with the poor transforming activity of these mutant proteins. From genetic and biochemical data, Grb2 couples receptor tyrosine kinases to the Ras pathway via an interaction with SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras (42Egan S.E. Giddings B.W.

Activation of Ras occurs following association of Grb2 with either the activated RTK or another adaptor protein, Shc (42Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A.

In cell lines expressing the poorly transforming Tpr-Met mutants that fail to bind Grb2, Shc is still phosphorylated and coupled to Grb2, yet these mutant oncoproteins activate Ras-dependent pathways at 50–60% the efficiency of the wild-type Tpr-Met oncoprotein (20Fixman E.D.

The poor transforming activity of these Tpr-Met mutants (20% of wild-type) was inconsistent with the observed decrease in Ras dependent signaling suggesting that other Grb2 dependent pathways, in addition to Ras, were required for efficient cell transformation by Tpr-Met. In support of this, our data demonstrate that phosphorylation of Cbl and Gab1 was dependent upon Grb2 association with Tyr489 of Tpr-Met. From sequence analysis, both Cbl and Gab1 contain proline rich sequences that interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins such as Grb2 and several tyrosine residues which, when phosphorylated, associate with multiple signaling molecules (23Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 38Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Functionally, tyrosine phosphorylation of both Gab1 and Cbl is associated with an altered growth response. Constitutively phosphorylated variants of Cbl transform fibroblasts (31Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and NIH3T3 cells overexpressing Gab1 have an increased growth rate in 1% serum and grow in soft agar in the presence of EGF or insulin whereas control cells do not (23Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Although the function of Cbl and/or Gab1 is as yet unknown, Tpr-Met mutants impaired in their ability to couple with Grb2 and to transform fibroblasts fail to induce high levels of phosphorylation of Cbl or Gab1 consistent with one or both of these proteins functioning as important signal transducers for transformation by Tpr-Met.

Genetic and biochemical data have established Raf-1 as a Ras effector, but in contrast to the simple activation mechanisms of MEK and mitogen-activated protein kinase, the mechanism of activation of Raf-1 is complex, involving more than the simple binding of Ras. The minimal Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1 spans residues 51–131, which are located predominantly in conserved region 1. In vitro, the interaction of Ras with this isolated RBD is of high affinity, is GTP-dependent, and is blocked by mutations in the Ras switch I effector loop that abrogate biological activityin vivo (2Vojtek A.B.

A mutation, R89L, in the minimal RBD is sufficient to abrogate binding to Ras in vitro and blocks activation of Raf-1 by Ras in vivo (6Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl.

However, coexpression with oncogenic mutant Ras in vivo results in recruitment of Raf-1 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and activation (15Traverse S. Cohen P. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Rapp U. Grand R.J.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3175-3181PubMed Google Scholar). Localization of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane is critical because targeting Raf-1 to the plasma membrane independent of Ras is sufficient for activation (16Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar,17Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas Raf-1 cannot be activated in vitro by purified Ras and Src, partial activation can be achieved using membranes from Ras- and Src-transformed cells (18Dent P. Reardon D.B. Morrison D.K. Sturgill T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4125-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9544-9548Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The nature of the membrane events that actually activate Raf-1 remain unclear, although phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 340 and 341 in conserved region 3 is a critical event (20Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 21Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In vivo, all activated tyrosine-phosphorylated Raf-1 is found sequestered at the plasma membrane (22Jelinek T. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), probably in caveolae, since sucrose gradient fractionation of plasma membranes shows that Ras and Raf-1 cofractionate with caveolin (23Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our previous observation that membrane-recruited Raf-1 is found almost exclusively in a detergent-insoluble membrane fraction that is enriched for caveolin (17Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Given the critical role of the plasma membrane in activating Raf, we have developed assays to measure Raf activity in intact plasma membranes. Using these and other assays, we examined the role of the Raf zinc finger in membrane recruitment and activation. A recent study has shown that the activation of Raf by the epidermal growth factor receptor is critically dependent on an intact zinc finger but did not determine whether this was a result of failure of membrane recruitment or failure of a plasma membrane activation mechanism (12Luo Z. Diaz B. Marshall M. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our study directly addresses this issue and shows that the RBD, not the zinc finger, is required for plasma membrane recruitment, but that the zinc finger is critical for the activation of plasma membrane-recruited Raf. In addition, we present evidence that full activation of membrane-recruited Raf requires a negative charge on residues 340 or 341, an intact zinc finger, and activated Ras. Thus this study for the first time demonstrates that Ras has an additional role in the activation of Raf other than the recruitment of Raf to the plasma membrane. The Myc/Glu-Glu N-terminal epitope tags on the RafCAAX cDNA described previously (17Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) was replaced with a FLAG epitope tag using PCR primers that simultaneously introduced a new, translationally silent PstI site by mutating codon 92 and either mutated codon 89 to leucine or left as wild type arginine. The Y340D,Y341D (DD) and Y340F,Y341F (FF) double mutations were introduced using a PCR mutagenesis strategy that simultaneously introduced a new, translationally silent NheI site by mutating codons 346 and 347. The mutated sequences were subcloned as AccB7/NheI fragments into wild type FLAG RafCAAX and FLAG RafCAAXR89L. The C165S,C168S double mutant (CCSS) was generated using PCR mutagenesis, and the mutant sequence was subcloned as aPstI/BspHI fragment into FLAG RafCAAX. FLAG RafCAAXCCSSDD was generated by recombination. All PCR products were completely sequenced before subcloning. The FLAG RafCAAX mutant cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector EXV-3. To generate nonmembrane targeted versions of each mutant, a stop codon was introduced by a Klenow fill-in of theEcoRI site at the 5′ end of the cDNA cassette encoding the K-ras polybasic domain and CAAX motif. COS cells were electroporated as described previously (24Huang D.C.S. Marshall C.J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2420-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).

After 10 min on ice, cells were homogenized with 50 strokes in a tight-fitting dounce homogenizer, and the nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation. The post-nuclear supernatants were spun at 100,000 × g. The supernatant (S100) was removed, and the sedimented fraction (P100) was rinsed and then sonicated for 5 min in 100 μl of ice-cold Buffer A. The S100 fraction and resuspended P100 fractions were snap-frozen and stored at −70 °C in aliquots after measuring protein content by the Bradford reaction. P100 fractions were normalized by protein content and adjusted to 15 μl in Buffer A. An equal volume of Buffer A containing 2% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the sample was sonicated at 4 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the Nonidet P-40-soluble supernatant was removed and added to 6 μl of 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction was taken up in 36 μl of 1 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Equal volumes of each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted with anti-FLAG monoclonal antiserum. Expression and subcellular localization of Raf-1 and Ras proteins were determined using immunoblotting. Sample loading was normalized on S100 protein content, and equal proportions of the S100 and P100 fractions of each lysate were then used for blotting. Samples were resolved on 10% (Raf) or 15% (Ras) SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using semidry transfer. Western blots were probed with M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal (Eastman Kodak Co.) or Y13-259 and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence or quantitated by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad) after development with rabbit anti-mouse or rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulin (as appropriate) and 125I-protein A. The linearity of this quantitative 125I Western assay is demonstrated in Fig.1.Figure 1Demonstration of the linearity of the coupled Raf activity assay and the FLAG Western blotting assay. Membrane fractions (P100) from COS cells expressing FLAG Raf + RasG12V were assayed for Raf activity. Aliquots of 5, 10, 15, and 20 μg of P100 fraction were incubated with MEK, ERK, and cold ATP for 10, 20, and 30 min. The reactions were then diluted, and an aliquot of the diluted reactions was incubated for 10 min with MBP and [γ32P]ATP. The radioactivity incorporated into MBP was determined by scintillation counting of gel slices after the reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. MBP phosphorylation due to MEK and ERK co-purifying with Raf was measured simultaneously in parallel reactions without MEK and without MEK and ERK. These counts (each <5% of the total) were subtracted from the total counts. The results are plotted against P100 input in panel A and against time inpanel B. These data are from a representative single experiment and show that the activity assay is linear with respect to the time of the first incubation over 10–30 min and with respect to COS cell P100 input over 5–20 μg. Aliquots of 5, 10, 15, and 20 μg of the same P100 fraction were immunoblotted with M2 (anti-FLAG) monoclonal antibody and developed using rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin and 125I-protein A. The immunoblot was autoradiographed (panel C) and then quantitated by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad). The radioactivity bound to FLAG-Raf (expressed in arbitrary phosphorimaging units) is graphed inpanel D. These data are from a representative single experiment and show that the Western blotting assay is linear with respect to Raf input.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We reported previously that Raf activity can be measured in intact plasma membranes using a coupled MEK/ERK activation assay (17Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). For this report we modified membrane preparation protocols to minimize copurification of MEK and ERK and introduced sonication steps to improve membrane suspension. P100 samples were normalized for Raf-1 content using quantitative125I Western blotting. P100 aliquots (typically 10–30 μg of total protein) were adjusted to 100 μl in Buffer A, and the membranes were pelleted at 100,000 × g and resuspended in 36 μl of Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 100 μmNaVO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in a sonicating water bath for 2 min at 4 °C. Sonication does not remove any membrane-associated Raf-1. 2S. Roy and J. F. Hancock, unpublished data. To 10 μl of sonicated P100 fraction, 6 μl of Buffer A containing 0.25 μg MEK, 1 μg of ERK, and 4 μl of 0.5 mm ATP in 40 mmMgCl2 was added, and the mix was vortexed at 30 °C. After 20 min, the sample was placed on ice, and 10 μl was diluted into 40 μl of ice-cold Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 100 μmNaVO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol). 10 μl of this diluted sample was taken into a second incubation with 5 μl of MBP (16 μg) and 10 μl of an ATP mix containing 0.5 mm ATP, 50 mm MgCl2, [γ32P]ATP (2,400 cpm/pmol). After 10 min the reaction was stopped by adding 6 μl of 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the reaction products were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE. The radioactivity incorporated into MBP was measured by scintillation counting of gel slices of stained, fixed gels. MBP phosphorylation in the second 10-min incubation is linear with respect to P100 input and incubation time of the first incubation over ranges of 5–30 μg and 5–30 min, respectively (Fig. 1). To determine background counts due to any remaining P100-associated MEK or ERK, control tubes were set up for each P100 assay without MEK or without MEK and ERK, respectively (each was <5% of the total activity). To determine background counts due to untransfected cells, P100 fractions prepared from COS cells transfected with empty vector (EXV-3) were analyzed. To verify Raf-1 normalization, 10 μl of the initial reaction incubation with MEK and ERK was analyzed by quantitative 125I Western blotting. This assay measures P100-associated Raf activity, but membranes prepared from COS cells transfected with empty vector have minimal activity (≤2pmol of phosphate transfer to MBP/10 μg of P100/10 min). Therefore the measured Raf activity in P100 fractions containing transfected RafCAAX is an accurate measure of RafCAAX activity. Raf activity in P100 fractions containing transfected Raf and RasG12V represents the activity of membrane-recruited transfected Raf, plus membrane-recruited endogenous Raf. The activity of endogenous Raf recruited and activated by RasG12V was determined by assaying P100 fractions of COS cells transfected with RasG12V and no Raf, which contained an equal amount of Ras (determined by quantitative 125I Western blotting). This endogenous Raf activity was subtracted from the total measured Raf activity to derive the activity of transfected Raf. The mean correction made to the raw values for transfected Raf proteins to account for activation of endogenous Raf was 7 ± 2 pmol of phosphate transferred to MBP/10 min/10 μg of membrane (mean ± S.E., n = 20). To measure the activity of cytosolic Raf, S100 fractions were normalized for Raf content by quantitative 125I Western blotting and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the immunoprecipitates three times in Buffer B, the immunoprecipitates were split into three aliquots and incubated with MEK and ERK and without MEK and without MEK and ERK, exactly as described above. The beads were then collected, washed, and immunoblotted to verify the amount of Raf present in the assay. We first determined whether the Raf zinc finger is required for plasma membrane recruitment. The mutations C165S,C168S, and R89L were introduced into FLAG-Raf (Raf with an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag), and the constructs were coexpressed with oncogenic mutant RasG12V in COS cells. The cells were fractionated into cytosolic and membrane fractions, and the transfected Raf was detected by immunoblotting for the FLAG tag. The immunoblot in Fig.2 A shows that RafCCSS is recruited to the plasma membrane (P100 fraction) by RasG12V to the same extent as wild type Raf. In contrast, RafR89L remains localized to the cytosolic S100 fraction when coexpressed with RasG12V. Wild type Raf and RafCCSS recruited to the plasma membrane by Ras are both insoluble in 1%Nonidet P-40 (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that the Raf zinc finger is not required for plasma membrane recruitment of Raf. Membrane fractions from COS cells coexpressing RasG12V and either wild type Raf or RafCCSS were then prepared and normalized for Raf content, and Raf activity was measured in a coupled MEK/ERK assay. Fig.2 D shows that the activity of plasma membrane-recruited RafCCSS is approximately 25% that of plasma membrane-recruited wild type Raf. Thus, although the zinc finger mutation does not compromise membrane recruitment, it does significantly abrogate Raf activation. If, as these experiments suggest, the role of the zinc finger is restricted to mediating Raf activation, then constitutive plasma membrane targeting of RafCCSS would not be expected to rescue activity. To test this prediction, we introduced the C165S,C168S mutations into RafCAAX. Figs. 2, B and C, shows that when expressed in COS cells, RafCAAX, RafCAAXR89L, and RafCAAXCCSS all localize to the Nonidet P-40-insoluble P100 fraction. Membrane fractions normalized for Raf content were then assayed for activity. Fig. 2 D shows that the activity of RafCAAXR89L is equivalent to that of RafCAAX, whereas that of RafCAAXCCSS is approximately 45% that of RafCAAX. Thus membrane targeting silences the R89L mutation but not the activation defect of the zinc finger mutation. We conclude that the role of the RBD may be restricted to membrane recruitment, whereas Ras-zinc finger interactions or membrane-zinc finger interactions must function in some other aspect of the Raf activation process. To address this hypothesis, we investigated to what extent mutations in the zinc finger compromised the activity of constitutively activated Raf. Replacement of tyrosines 340 and 341 with aspartic acid activates Raf kinase activity by mimicking the negative charge normally imparted by phosphorylation (20Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We therefore introduced the Y340D,Y341D mutations into wild type Raf (RafDD) and RafCCSS (RafCCSSDD) and coexpressed these Raf mutants with RasG12V in COS cells. Subcellular fractionation and Western blotting showed that RafDD and RafCCSSDD were recruited to the P100 fraction by RasG12V to the same extent as wild type Raf (Figs.2 A and 3 A). The specific activities of Raf recruited to the P100 fraction and Raf remaining in the cytosol (S100 fraction) were then measured in coupled MEK/ERK assays. Fig. 3 B shows that the RafDD immunoprecipitated from the cytosol was activated 10-fold over wild type Raf immunoprecipitated from the cytosol. Thus the DD mutations alone increase Raf activity to 80% that achieved by plasma membrane localization (compare RafDD + Ras (S100) with RafCAAX in Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, the CCSS mutation has no effect on the activity of cytosolic RafDD (Fig. 3 B). This contrasts with the effect of the CCSS mutation on cytosolic Raf where it reduces the already low activity by 50% (Fig. 2 D). The activity of RafDD is increased a further 7-fold when recruited to the plasma membrane by RasG12V (compare RafDD + Ras (S100) with RafDD + Ras (P100) in Fig. 3 B). The activity of RafCCSSDD is also increased on recruitment to the plasma membrane by RasG12V but to less than 50% that of RafDD (Fig. 3 B). We conclude that constitutive negative charge on tyrosines 340 and 341 suppresses the inhibitory effect of the zinc finger mutation on cytosolic Raf activity but does not fully suppress a defect in a plasma membrane-catalyzed activation process. To investigate the nature of the membrane activation of Raf DD in more detail, we introduced the Y340D,Y341D mutations into RafCAAX and expressed the mutant protein in COS cells. Subcellular fractionation and Western blotting showed that RafCAAXDD localized to the P100 fraction to the same extent as RafCAAX (Fig.4 A). Membrane fractions from COS cells were then prepared and normalized for Raf content, and Raf activity was measured in a coupled MEK/ERK assay. We and others have shown previously that Raf recruited to the plasma membrane by RasG12V is activated to the same extent as membrane-targeted RafCAAXand that the activity of RafCAAX is not further increased by coexpression of RasG12V ( Refs. 16Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar and 17Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar; Fig. 4 B). In marked contrast, the activity of membrane-targeted RafCAAXDD was found to be significantly lower than the activity of RafDD recruited to the plasma membrane by RasG12V (Fig. 4 B), and coexpression of RasG12V with RafCAAXDD was required to increase the activity of RafCAAXDD to that of RafDD recruited to the plasma membrane by RasG12V (Fig. 4 B). It should be emphasized that this enhancement of RafCAAXDD activity is not due to any further recruitment of RafCAAXDD to the plasma membrane because RafCAAXDD is already P100-localized and the Raf assays are normalized for Raf content. This result suggested that, in addition to recruiting Raf to the plasma membrane for tyrosine phosphorylation, Ras has a subsequent role in effecting full activation of membrane-localized, tyrosine-phosphorylated Raf or membrane-localized RafDD. If so, Raf mutations that interfere with Ras binding would be expected to adversely affect the activation of RafCAAXDD by RasG12V. To test this hypothesis, R89L and C165S,C168S mutations were introduced into RafCAAXDD, and the mutant proteins were expressed in COS cells with and without RasG12V. Membrane fractions were prepared, normalized for Raf content, and assayed for Raf activity. Fig.4 B shows that the specific activities of RafCAAXR89LDD and RafCAAXCCSSDD are both reduced to approximately 70% that of RafCAAXDD. However, the response of these mutants to RasG12V is strikingly different. Coexpression with RasG12V increases the activity of RafCAAXR89LDD some 3-fold, close to the activities of RafCAAXDD coexpressed with RasG12V and RafDD recruited to the membrane by RasG12V. In contrast, coexpression with RasG12V has no effect on the activity of RafCAAXCCSSDD. We conclude that Ras plays a critical role in the activation of membrane-localized RafDD (and by analogy tyrosine-phosphorylated membrane-localized Raf) and that this Ras- mediated activation mechanism requires an intact Raf zinc finger. Finally we examined whether Raf that cannot be phosphorylated on tyrosines 340 or 341 could still be activated by membrane recruitment. The mutations Y340F,Y341F were introduced into Raf, RafCAAX, RafCAAXCCSS, and RafCAAXR89L, and the constructs were expressed in COS cells with or without RasG12V. RafFF was recruited to the plasma membrane by RasG12V to the same extent as wild type Raf and all of the RafCAAXFF proteins localized to the P100 fraction. Fig. 5 shows that recruitment of RafFF to the P100 fraction by RasG12V resulted in minimal activation; similarly RafCAAXFF, RafCAAXR89LFF, and RafCAAXCCSSFF all had very low activities. Coexpression of RasG12V with RafCAAXFF had no effect on RafCAAXFF activity (data not shown). We conclude that tyrosine residues 340 or 341 may be critical for all plasma membrane-mediated Raf activation mechanisms. The interaction of Ras with the N terminus of Raf can be disturbed by a mutation in the minimal Ras binding domain or by mutations of the zinc finger in the adjacent CRD. Crystallography and NMR analysis suggest that the RBD (Raf residues 51–131) and the CRD (Raf residues 139–184) represent discrete Raf protein domains (5Nassar N. Horn G. Hermann A. Sherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 7Mott H.R. Carpenter J.W. Zhong S. Ghosh S. Bell R.M. Campbell S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7745-7752Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). There is general agreement that the effector loop of Ras binds the RBD in a GTP-dependent, prenyl-independent manner (2Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A.

Drugan et al. (11Drugan J.K. Khosravi Far R. White M.A. Der C.J. Sung Y.J. Hwang Y.W. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 233-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) show that Ras switch 2 also interacts with the isolated Raf zinc finger (residues 139–186) and does not require Ras to be prenylated. Hu et al. (10Hu C.D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) show GTP-independent binding of prenylated Ras to the isolated zinc finger (residues 132–206) and show that switch 1 mutations had no effect on this interaction. Most recently, Luo et al. (12Luo Z. Diaz B. Marshall M. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) also show that high affinity interaction of full-length Raf with Ras required an intact zinc finger and Ras prenylation. Taken together, these data argue for two sites of interaction between Ras and Raf, the RBD binding to Ras switch 1 in a GTP conformation, and a more complex binding site for the zinc finger that may comprise switch 2 sequences flanking switch 1 and the C terminus of Ras. The current model for the activation of Raf-1 by Ras envisages the recruitment of Raf from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where Raf is activated by a combination of tyrosine phosphorylation on Tyr-340 and Tyr-341 and other mechanisms (21Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) that may include dimerization (26Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M.

There are two separate aspects of Raf activation that can therefore be measured: the recruitment of Raf from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and the subsequent activation of plasma membrane-localized Raf. In this study we addressed the relative contribution of the two sites of Ras/Raf interaction to membrane recruitment and Raf activation in vivo. The role of the RBD is limited to that of recruiting Raf to the plasma membrane. The mutation R89L completely abrogates the ability of the RBD to bind RasGTP and has been shown previously to block activation of Raf by oncogenic mutant Ras (6Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the R89L mutation also blocks activation of Raf by activated Src (21Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). However, RafR89L targeted to the plasma membrane using Ras C-terminal localization signals is activated to the same extent as wild type Raf recruited by Ras or plasma membrane-targeted wild type Raf (this study and Ref. 21Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Thus, once Raf is recruited to the plasma membrane, the RBD is dispensable for subsequent activation. The R89L mutation itself has no detrimental effect on the kinase domain because RafR89L is activated by membrane targeting to the same extent as wild type Raf. In contrast, the Raf zinc finger is completely dispensable for plasma membrane recruitment by oncogenic mutant Ras. These results exclude any significant role for the zinc finger in mediating membrane interactionsin vivo. Although the zinc finger is not required for plasma membrane recruitment, it serves at least two functions in Raf activation. We found that the basal kinase activity of cytosolic RafCCSS is 50% that of wild type Raf and that membrane localization of RafCCSS, either by RasG12V or by membrane targeting, increases kinase activity significantly less than wild type Raf. The basal activity of Raf in the cytosol is governed by the level of background phosphorylation of Tyr-340 and Tyr-341; phosphorylation of Tyr-340 and Tyr-341 is moderately increased when Raf is recruited to the plasma membrane and colocalized with relatively quiescent tyrosine kinases and further increased if specific tyrosine kinases, e.g. Src are activated (21Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The reduction in the basal activity of cytosolic RafCCSS and the suboptimal activation on membrane recruitment could therefore reflect a reduction in the basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation and a reduced increase in tyrosine phosphorylation on membrane localization. This interpretation is supported by our observation that the elevated basal activity of Raf with aspartic acid substitutions at tyrosines 340 and 341 is unaffected by mutations of the zinc finger. This result also shows that the Raf kinase domain is not distorted by aberrant folding resulting from the C165S,C168S mutations. The same conclusion was reached by Luo et al.(12Luo Z. Diaz B. Marshall M. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), who show that the whole Raf zinc finger can be replaced with the zinc finger of protein kinase Cγ without any compromise of the Raf kinase domain. Taken together, these data indicate that the Raf zinc finger may be required either for optimal interaction with tyrosine kinases or for inhibiting interaction with phosphatases. In this context, it is interesting to note that the CRD may provide a binding site for 14–3-3 proteins (32Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), which, when complexed with activated Raf, can prevent dephosphorylation and deactivation by tyrosine and serine phosphatases (33Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Maximum activation of Raf kinase is achieved by a combination of Y340D,Y341D mutations to simulate tyrosine phosphorylation plus recruitment to the plasma membrane by RasG12V. The different activities of the RafDD mutants described here can be accounted for if there are two separate plasma membrane activation mechanisms. One mechanism accounts for the greater activity of RafDD recruited to the membrane by RasG12V over membrane-targeted RafCAAXDD. This mechanism may reflect a direct interaction between Ras and the Raf zinc finger because coexpression of RasG12V fully activates RafCAAXDD but only if the zinc finger is intact. A striking control is provided by RafCAAXR89LDD, which is competent for Ras interaction with the zinc finger but not with the RBD. RafCAAXR89LDD is activated by RasG12V to approximately the same extent that RafCAAXDD is activated by RasG12V. RafCCSSDD recruited to the membrane by Ras has the same activity as RafCAAXDD because, although Ras is present, the zinc finger is not, and the necessary interaction between Ras and RafCCSSDD cannot occur. The second mechanism accounts for the increment in activity between cytosolic RafDD and RafCAAXDD and results directly from membrane recruitment. The recruitment is Ras- and RBD-dependent, but the actual activation at the membrane is Ras- and zinc finger-independent since the activities of RafCAAXCCSSDD and RafCAAXR89LDD and RafCAAXDD are similar. Dent et al. (18Dent P. Reardon D.B. Morrison D.K. Sturgill T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4125-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) demonstrate a similar Raf activation mechanism in vitro. We contend that these activation mechanisms reflect the membrane regulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated Raf-1. However, B-Raf has aspartic acid in place of tyrosine at residues 447 and 448 (homologous to 340 and 341 in Raf-1) and in consequence has an elevated basal kinase activity. The same activation mechanisms may therefore operate when B-Raf is recruited to the plasma membrane by RasG12V as operate for RafDD. Consistent with previous reports (20Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 21Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), we show here that replacement of tyrosines 340 and 341 with phenylalanine to prevent their phosphorylation almost completely abolishes the basal activity of RafFF. Moreover, minimal activation occurs when RafFF is targeted to the plasma membrane or recruited by RasG12V. These data indicate that 340 and 341 must be available for phosphorylation for any significant activation to occur at the plasma membrane. Whereas other interpretations cannot be excluded, it seems most likely that the first event that occurs on recruitment of Raf to the plasma membrane by Ras or by membrane targeting is tyrosine phosphorylation. If, as discussed above, zinc finger mutations compromise both initial tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation by RasGTP of membrane-localized tyrosine-phosphorylated Raf, then the activation of Raf-1 by the epidermal growth factor receptor would be severely compromised by a zinc finger mutation even though plasma membrane recruitment is unaffected. The recent study by Luo et al.(12Luo Z. Diaz B. Marshall M. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) confirms this prediction.

However, Gp31 shows a series of structural adaptations which will increase the size and the hydrophilicity of the “Anfinsen cage,” the enclosed cavity within the GroEL/GroES complex that is the location of the chaperonin-assisted protein folding reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2006682691,"The Escherichia coli protein DnaA and the plasmid RK2-encoded TrfA protein are required for initiation of replication of the broad host range plasmid RK2. The TrfA protein has been shown to bind to five 17-base pair repeat sequences, referred to as iterons, at the minimal replication origin (oriV). Using DNase I footprinting and a gel mobility shift assay, purified DnaA protein was found to bind to four DnaA consensus binding sequences immediately upstream of the five iterons at the RK2 origin of replication. Binding of the TrfA protein to the iterons results in localized strand opening within the A+T-rich region of the replication origin as determined by reactivity of the top and bottom strands to potassium permanganate (KMnO4). The presence of either theE. coli DnaA or HU protein is required for the TrfA-mediated strand opening. Although the DnaA protein itself did not produce an RK2 open complex, it did enhance and/or stabilize the TrfA-induced strand opening.

Many plasmids found in Gram-negative bacteria contain one or more clusters of direct repeats (iterons) within the replication origin (ori), one or more essential binding sites for the DnaA protein (DnaA box), and an A+T-rich region (1Helinski D.R.

For these plasmids, replication initiation involves binding of a plasmid-encoded replication initiation protein to the iterons which, in the presence of bound DnaA protein, results in the formation of a specific nucleoprotein structure and structural changes within the origin sequence (1Helinski D.R.

In the presence of HU protein and ATP, a compact, ellipsoid structure is formed which is partially unwound (open complex) at theE. coli origin (10Bramhill D. Kornberg A.

The role of the DnaA protein in plasmid P1 replication has also been investigated (15Mukhopadhyay G. Chattoraj D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Mukhopadhyay G. Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Chattoraj D.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4547-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this system, the DnaA protein alone induces open complex formation. The P1-encoded replication initiation protein, RepA, cannot form an open complex by itself, but it enhances DnaA protein-induced reactivity of the P1 origin to KMnO4(16Mukhopadhyay G. Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Chattoraj D.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4547-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the case of the initiation of bacteriophage λ DNA replication, the initiation protein (λO) induces helix destabilization at the λ origin (17Schnos M. Zahn K. Inman R.B. Blattner F.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 385-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). More recently it has been shown that the F plasmid-encoded RepE protein, in the presence of the HU protein, produces localized melting within an F replication origin, and this open complex is extended by DnaA (18Kawasaki Y. Matsunaga F. Kano Y. Yura T. Wada C. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mechanism of DNA replication initiation of the broad host range plasmid RK2 is largely unknown. RK2 is 60 kilobases and replicates at a copy number of 5–8/chromosome in E. coli (19Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Thomas C.M. Promiscuous Plasmids of Gram-negative Bacteria. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 1-26Google Scholar). This antibiotic resistance plasmid is of particular interest because of its ability to replicate and to be stably maintained in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria (19Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Thomas C.M. Promiscuous Plasmids of Gram-negative Bacteria. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 1-26Google Scholar). DNA replication of RK2 requires a single plasmid origin (oriV) and a plasmid-encoded initiation protein (TrfA) (20Figurski D.H. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it has been shown that the DnaA protein binds to DnaA consensus sequences within the RK2 origin (30Gaylo P. Turjman N. Bastia D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4703-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,31Shah D.S. Cross M.A. Porter D. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 608-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present work, we examined in vitro binding of theE. coli DnaA protein to the RK2 origin of replication and the role of the TrfA and DnaA proteins in forming an open complex. Four DnaA binding sites, arranged in two pairs in an inverted orientation with respect to each other, were found within the RK2 minimal origin. DNase I protection assays showed that the binding pattern of the DnaA and TrfA proteins to the origin region is essentially the summation of binding by either protein alone. Using an in vitroKMnO4 reactivity assay, we have found that the RK2 initiation protein, TrfA, in the presence of HU can produce localized opening at the A+T-rich region of oriV. The DnaA protein stimulates and/or stabilizes this RK2 open complex formation, but cannot, on its own, form an open complex. Highly purified proteins were used for the various assays. The mutant His6 TrfA254D/267L protein was purified as described previously (32Blasina A. Kittell B.L. Toukdarian A.E. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3559-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This protein, containing two plasmid copy up mutations, initiates replication with kinetics similar to those of the wild-type protein but is present largely in the form of active monomers. 2A. Toukdarian, unpublished observations. The E. coli DnaA protein used was either a generous gift from Dr. D. Bramhill or was purified following published procedures (33Diederich L. Roth A. Messer W. BioTechniques. 1994; 16 (2nd Ed.): 916-923PubMed Google Scholar) using the overproducer strain WM1202 pdnaA107A, kindly provided by Dr. W. Messer. Basic cloning methods were performed according to Sambrook et al. (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). pTJS42 and pSP6 are mini-replicons of plasmid RK2 and contain the five-iteron minimal oriV (25Perri S. Helinski D.R.

Plasmid. 1983; 9: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Commercially available proteins and chemicals were used. HU and SSB were purchased from Enzyco, Inc. Bovine serum albumin (fraction V), creatine phosphate, creatine kinase, rNTPs, and KMnO4 were from Sigma. Restriction endonucleases, T4 polynucleotide kinase, the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase, and DNase I were from New England Biolabs, Life Technologies, Inc., Boehringer Mannheim, Stratagene, or Promega and were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The Ultra Clean DNA purification kit was from MolBio Laboratories. AmpliTaq polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer. 30-mer pBR322 primer was from New England Biolabs. A 25-mer oriV1 primer (5′-GAATTCATCCAGCATTTGCAAGGGT-3′) was from OPERON. Plasmid DNA, pSP6, used as a source of DNA probes, was purified by two rounds of ethidium bromide-CsCl gradient centrifugation. The procedure for labeling the 400-bp probe containing the linear RK2 origin of replication has been described previously (25Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers used for primer extension were end labeled (30 pmol of DNA) with [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in the presence of seven units of T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligonucleotide primers were separated from unincorporated ATP using the Nuctrap push column (Stratagene) or by gel filtration through a 1-ml Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) in the presence of 50 mm NaCl. These experiments were performed as described previously (25Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lin J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24926-24932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that all of the binding reactions were carried out in the presence of 5 mm ATP. The reaction volume for the gel mobility shift experiments was 20 μl. Poly[d(I·C)] was present at 25 μg/ml for both the gel mobility shift and DNase I protection experiments. In all cases, His6 TrfA254D/267L and DnaA proteins were incubated together or separately with DNA at 27 °C for 20 min. The amount of DNase I used was 12.5 ng/reaction. The position of the protected area was determined by comparison with a sequencing ladder run in parallel on the same gel. Permanganate footprinting was carried out as described (13Hsu J. Bramhill D. Thompson C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with modifications. The standard reaction mixture (25 μl), based on the RK2 in vitro replication system reconstituted with purified components, 3I. Konieczny and D. R. Helinski, manuscript in preparation. contained 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 8.0; 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4; 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin; 4% sucrose; 4 mmdithiothreitol; 11 mm magnesium acetate; 2 mmATP; 500 μm (each) CTP, GTP, and UTP; 8 mmcreatine phosphate; 20 μg/ml creatine kinase; 8 ng of HU; 100 ng of DnaA; 300 ng of oriV DNA (pTJS42); and 400 ng of His6 TrfA254D/267L. After preincubation for 15 min at 37 °C, KMnO4 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. After a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 μl of 14.3 mβ-mercaptoethanol and EDTA to a final concentration of 15 mm. Each sample was purified further by using the Ultra Clean DNA purification kit. Primer extension reactions were carried out using a polymerase chain reaction with radiolabeled primer and AmpliTaq polymerase. Two synthetic 32P-labeled primers were used. For top strand analysis, the 30-mer pBR322 1238 primer (New England Biolabs) was used. For the bottom strand the 25-mer synthesized by OPERON was used. Polymerase chain reactions (25 μl) were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of formamide buffer (90% deionized formamide, 54 mmTris/HCl, pH 8, 1.8 mm EDTA, 0.18% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol FF) followed by electrophoresis on an 8 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiography. The position of the area modified by KMnO4was determined by comparison with a sequencing ladder run in parallel on the same gel. Replication of the broad host range plasmid RK2 inE. coli is dependent on the plasmid origin of replication, the plasmid-encoded initiation protein TrfA, and host replication factors. E. coli DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, DnaG primase, DNA gyrase, polymerase III holoenzyme, and SSB proteins are required for RK2 replication in crude extracts (38Pinkney M. Diaz R. Lanka E. Thomas C.M. J. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7072-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); however, little is known about the nature of binding of the DnaA protein to oriV. We examined this binding using both the gel mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting. The probe used in the gel mobility experiments is a DNA restriction fragment containing the minimal RK2 origin required for replication in E. coli and for replication in vitro using either an E. colicrude extract (39Kittell B.L. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or a system reconstituted with purified components.3 Gel retardation analysis demonstrated the ability of the DnaA protein to bind specifically to oriV. At a low concentration of DnaA protein only two retarded bands were observed; however, four distinct DNA-protein complexes were resolved by gel electrophoresis at higher DnaA concentrations (Fig.1). The omission of ATP had no effect on the formation of the four retarded bands (data not shown). The presence of two DnaA protein binding sites upstream of the iterons within the RK2 minimal origin has been reported previously based on RK2 DNA sequence analysis (22Stalker D.M. Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 41Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Barth P.T. Figurski D.H. Guiney D.G. Haas D. Helinski D.R. Schwab H. Stanisich V.A. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 623-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), replication activity in E. coliof RK2 mini-replicon deletion mutants (31Shah D.S. Cross M.A. Porter D. Thomas C.M. J. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4703-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding of four retarded bands in our gel mobility shift experiments led us to examine in greater detail the location and number of DnaA protein binding sites inoriV. DNase I footprinting was carried out to localize the DnaA binding sites within the RK2 origin. Using a 32P-labeledEcoRI-XbaI oriV restriction fragment, we analyzed the extent of DnaA protection upstream from the A+T-rich site. Fig. 2 shows the protection obtained with either the DnaA and the TrfA protein alone or in combination. In this and subsequent experiments, we used a mutant protein, His6 TrfA254D/267L, which has been shown to be largely in the active monomer form (32Blasina A. Kittell B.L. Toukdarian A.E. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3559-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).2 In all of the experiments that follow, the mutant protein is referred to as TrfA. As shown before with the wild-type TrfA protein (25Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Perri S. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3662-3669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the His6 TrfA254D/267L mutant protein completely protects the cluster of five iterons against DNase I digestion as well as producing DNase I-hypersensitive sites (Fig. 2,A and B). The DnaA protein alone, or in the presence of TrfA, protected four distinct regions localized upstream of the iterons (Fig. 2, A and B). A part of the protected area corresponds to previously reported DnaA binding sites (box 2 and box 3) (30Gaylo P. Turjman N. Bastia D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4703-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Shah D.S. Cross M.A. Porter D. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 608-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 41Pansegrau W.

Biol. 1994; 239: 623-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar); however, protection also was observed at two previously unreported DnaA binding sites (box 1 and box 4), both of which correspond to the DnaA binding consensus sequence (9Schaefer C. Messer W. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A; see also Fig. 6 A). The same protection pattern was observed when a supercoiled DNA template containingoriV was used instead of the linear oriV fragment (data not shown). The DNase I protection pattern obtained in the presence of both proteins was essentially the summation of that obtained for either protein alone.Figure 6A map depicting sequences of DnaA binding sites and the open region. Panel A, the RK2 HpaII fragment containing the functional five iterons origin (indicated withblack arrows) and four DnaA binding sites (gray arrows). The sequences of the KMnO4-sensitive region on the top and bottom strands of oriV and the DnaA binding sites determined by DNase I footprinting are shown. L,M1, M2, and R correspond to 13-mer sequences localized within the A+T-rich sequence of oriV(panel B). Internal stability of the nucleotide sequences within the RK2 minimal origin was determined using OLIGO software. Nucleotide coordinates are as described (22Stalker D.M. Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The presence of a DnaA box has also been reported downstream of the iterons in the A+T-rich region (30Gaylo P. Turjman N. Bastia D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4703-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Barth P.T. Figurski D.H. Guiney D.G. Haas D. Helinski D.R. Schwab H. Stanisich V.A. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 623-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). To test binding of the DnaA protein within the A+T-rich region, a 32P-labeledKpnI-BamHI restriction fragment containingoriV was used. A clearly defined region of DNase I protection with the DnaA protein alone or in the presence of TrfA was not observed within the A+T-rich region under the same conditions that showed protection of the DnaA boxes localized upstream from the iterons (Fig. 2 B). However, we did observe that increasing amounts of the DnaA protein gave a slightly different DNase I pattern downstream from the iterons in the region containing the previously reported DnaA box. As shown above, both the host-encoded DnaA protein and the plasmid-encoded TrfA protein bind to the RK2 origin. To determine the role of these two proteins in the formation of an open complex, KMnO4 was used as a reagent to probe any structural changes at the RK2 origin as a result of binding by one or both proteins. KMnO4 reacts preferentially with pyrimidines in single-stranded DNA, modifying primarily T and to a less extent C residues. Specific modification of plasmid supercoiled DNA can be detected by termination of the primer extension reaction from a radiolabeled primer at modified residues. In our experiments, supercoiled DNA containing the RK2 minimaloriV region (plasmid pTJS42) and two specific primers, one for each of the two strands, was used. Fig.3 shows the pattern of KMnO4modifications of the top and bottom strands of the RK2 origin. Some of the bands visible on the autoradiogram correspond to terminations that occur during primer extension even in the absence of KMnO4treatment. Also, certain base positions were found to be hypersensitive to oxidation even in the absence of the TrfA or DnaA protein (Fig. 3). The addition of TrfA alone or both TrfA and DnaA proteins, however, clearly induced a modification of a 46-bp region with coordinates of 500–545 in the top strand (Fig. 3). Similarly, a 13-bp region of the bottom strand with coordinates 519–531 was found to be sensitive to oxidation by KMnO4 in the presence of TrfA or both TrfA and DnaA (Fig. 3). The modified regions on the top and bottom strands contain a total of four 13-mers that correspond in sequence to the 13-mer consensus sequence within E. coli oriC (10Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). DnaA itself did not induce KMnO4 reactivity; however, the observed pattern of modified residues after the addition of both TrfA and DnaA proteins is different with respect to the intensity of the bands compared with incubation with TrfA alone. When both proteins are present, the position and number of bands are the same as with TrfA alone; however, the intensity of certain individual bands is greater (Fig. 3). The HU and IHF proteins have been shown to stimulateoriC replication in vivo and in vitro(43Bonnefoy E. Rouviere-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 44Skarstad K. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2341-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Using sensitivity to P1 nuclease activity as a probe, it has been shown that HU or IHF is required for oriC opening mediated by the DnaA protein (12Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the experiments described above, HU was present in the standard reaction mix. To test if RK2oriV open complex formation actually requires the presence of HU protein, we examined TrfA oriV opening activity in the presence and absence of HU protein. The results showed that TrfA mediated oriV opening is strictly dependent on HU in the absence of the DnaA protein. In contrast, HU is dispensable when both TrfA and DnaA proteins are present. Also, at any HU concentration tested, the DnaA protein alone could not open the RK2 origin (Fig.4). Interestingly, even at high concentrations of HU the TrfA-induced KMnO4 modification pattern was not as intense in the downstream portion of the open region compared with the presence of both the TrfA and DnaA proteins in the reaction mixture (Fig. 4). This observation indicates that although both the DnaA and the HU proteins can stimulate and/or stabilize TrfA-mediated origin melting, the two proteins show differences in their ability to enhance the formation of the open complex. Duplex opening by DnaA protein at oriC is ATP-dependent (10Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar,12Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, during the initiation of bacteriophage λ DNA replication, the λO initiation protein can generate a local helix destabilization in the absence of nucleotides (17Schnos M. Zahn K. Inman R.B. Blattner F.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 385-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We tested the nucleotide requirement for the opening of the RK2 origin. Reactions were performed in the presence of TrfA and HU or TrfA, DnaA, and HU. A strict ATP dependence was not observed for KMnO4reactivity. However, the extent of the open region was greater in the presence of ATP. This effect is not the result of ATP hydrolysis because the addition of ATPγS gave a pattern similar to that observed for ATP. Unlike the duplex opening experiments described above (Figs. 3and 4) where GTP, CTP, and UTP are present in these reactions, these results obtained in the absence of these ribonucleotides (Fig.5) also indicate that ribonucleotides other than ATP are not required for the opening at the RK2 origin. RK2 is a broad host range plasmid that requires host initiation factors for DNA replication including the DnaA protein which is indispensable,in vivo and in vitro (30Gaylo P. Turjman N. Bastia D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4703-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Pinkney M. Diaz R. Lanka E. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39Kittell B.L. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our results show the specific binding of E. coli DnaA protein to four DnaA boxes localized upstream of the TrfA binding sites (Fig.6 A). The sequences of the two newly identified, as well as the two previously described, DnaA binding sites match well (a single mismatch in each case) to the DnaA binding relaxed consensus sequence proposed by Schaefer and Messer (9Schaefer C. Messer W. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig.6 A). Binding of the DnaA protein to oriV at the A+T-rich region has been reported previously (30Gaylo P. Turjman N. Bastia D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4703-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, in the present study we could not detect a clearly defined segment of DNase I protection in this region. This discrepancy may be because of the use of different methods for the determination of DnaA protein binding. For the four upstream boxes, DNase I footprinting (Fig. 2 A) showed similar binding of the DnaA protein in the absence and presence of TrfA. Although the pattern of DNase I footprinting in the presence of both proteins was the sum of each protein alone, we cannot exclude that under a different set of conditions there is some cooperativity in binding by these two initiation proteins. It has been shown that the DnaA protein binds to five DnaA boxes atoriC, and this binding results in bending of the DNA. It was also observed that nucleotide sequences flanking the DnaA boxes influenced DnaA binding affinity (8Schaper S. Messer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17622-17626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that the complex of DnaA proteins and its binding site consists of one DnaA monomer/DnaA box, but multimeric higher order complexes are formed on larger DNA fragments (8Schaper S. Messer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17622-17626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In our gel mobility shift experiments we observed four retardation bands that presumably correspond to the four DNase I protection sites at the RK2 minimal origin. It is of interest that the requirement for DnaA protein for in vitroreplication of oriV using a reconstituted system with purified components is substantially lower than the DnaA concentration required for oriC replication.3 This observation may indicate different structural features of the DnaA-DNA nucleoprotein complex for the two replication origins. The formation of a cruciform-like structure at the minimal RK2 origin is worth considering since the internal DnaA boxes (box 2 and box 3) can form a hairpin structure (duplex length of 5 bp with a 5-nucleotide loop; ΔG of −3.8 kcal). The proposal that binding of the DnaA protein to a DNA hairpin structure in the pBR322 origin is essential for helicase loading has been investigated (45Seufert W. Messer W. Cell. 1987; 48: 73-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 46Parada C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18895-18906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of one of the DnaA boxes substantially reduced DnaA-dependent replication of pBR322, and deletion of both DnaA binding sites abolished template activity (45Seufert W. Messer W. Cell. 1987; 48: 73-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 46Parada C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18895-18906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A hairpin structure is required for DnaA binding and helicase loading during the ABC priming reaction on the M13 single-stranded DNA template (47Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that for the initiation of RK2 replication binding of the DnaA protein to a hairpin structure is important for helicase delivery to the plasmid origin. Additional work is required to determine the specific DNA structural requirements for helicase delivery, loading, and activity at the RK2 oriV. The results of the KMnO4 modification footprinting experiments clearly show that the TrfA protein opens the RK2 origin. KMnO4sensitivity was observed along a 46-bp sequence in the top strand and a 13-bp sequence in the bottom strand. Differences in susceptibility to single strand-specific reagents between the top and bottom strands have also been observed in the case of opening in the oriC and P1 origins (15Mukhopadhyay G. Chattoraj D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 48Ogawa T. Baker T.A. van der Ende A. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3562-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The top strand of RK2 with respect to the direction of replication likely serves as the template for lagging strand polymerization. In the case of plasmid P1, the major KMnO4reactivity also occurs within the lagging strand (16Mukhopadhyay G. Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Chattoraj D.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4547-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Open complex formation at the RK2 oriV is localized within the A+T-rich region and corresponds to the region of lowest internal stability within the minimal origin, which includes four 13-mer repeat sequences (Fig. 6). These four 13-mers (L, M1, M2, R) exhibit a DNA consensus sequence (TAAACnTTnTTTT) that is similar to the 13-mer consensus sequence determined for oriC(GATCTnTTnTTTT) (10Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The location of the four 13-mers coincides precisely with the site for oriV duplex opening (Fig. 6). Since a specific sequence and spacing within the 13-mer region oforiC are required for replication activity (10Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 12Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hsu J. Bramhill D. Thompson C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Gille H. Messer W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it is of interest to determine if all four oriV 13-mers are required for RK2 replication. The TrfA-induced opening does not absolutely require the presence of nucleotides; however, the formation of the open complex was somewhat enhanced by ATP or ATPγS. Similar observations have been reported for strand destabilization at the origin of bacteriophage λ (17Schnos M. Zahn K. Inman R.B. Blattner F.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 385-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, ATP is required forE. coli oriC open complex formation mediated by the DnaA protein (10Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 12Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DnaA or HU protein is required for full opening of oriV by TrfA (Figs. 3 and 4). Similarly, the formation of an open complex at the replication origin of the F plasmid by the RepE protein requires the HU protein and is enhanced by DnaA (18Kawasaki Y. Matsunaga F. Kano Y. Yura T. Wada C. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HU protein also has been shown to enhance DnaA-mediated opening of the origin of E. coli (12Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the HU or the DnaA protein enhances open complex formation is not known. Recently it has been shown that binding of DnaA protein induces a bend in oriCDNA (8Schaper S. Messer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17622-17626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Similarly, HU protein binds nonspecifically to double- or single-stranded DNA, and this binding either induces bending and folding or alters the superhelicity of supercoiled DNA (42Drlica K. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 301-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that DnaA or HU-dependent DNA bending is responsible for the observed increase and/or stabilization of TrfA-mediated oriV opening. Interestingly, although DnaA can perform a role similar to that of HU in the formation of the open complex at the RK2 origin, it is unable to open oriV by itself or in the presence of HU. This is in contrast to the origin regions of oriC and plasmid P1. The addition of the RepA protein increases the DnaA-induced strand opening at the P1 origin region, but RepA alone does not form an open complex (16Mukhopadhyay G. Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. Chattoraj D.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4547-4554Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The ability of the plasmid-specified initiation protein, in the case of RK2, to bring about the formation of an open complex in the absence of a specific host protein may be a contributing factor accounting for the different replication activities observed for plasmids RK2 and P1. RK2 is a broad host range replicon, whereas the P1 replicon appears to have a more limited host range. Although the DnaA protein by itself does not induce open complex formation, it is required for RK2 replication in vivo andin vitro (1Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A.E. Novick R.P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 2295-2324Google Scholar), and it does enhance or stabilize the TrfA-induced open complex formation. Recently, it has been shown that the DnaA protein plays a critical role in the delivery of the E. coli DnaB (helicase) to the RK2 origin. In the absence of TrfA protein, an oriV·DnaA·DnaB·DnaC complex can be isolated using a gel filtration method.3 These observations, along with results presented in this paper, indicate at least two roles for the DnaA protein during RK2 replication initiation: (i) enhancement of the formation of an open complex; and (ii) helicase delivery to the origin region. We propose that the TrfA protein in turn forms an open complex at the 13-mer region and in concert with the DnaA protein induces specific nucleoprotein structural changes at the origin, which allows proper positioning of the DnaB helicase within the open complex. The helicase is activated by these events, and replication is allowed to proceed. Finally, the formation of a specific nucleoprotein structure containing four DnaA boxes (which potentially can form a cruciform structure) that bind DnaA protein and 17-bp iterons that bind the TrfA protein appears to be a critical factor in the initiation of RK2 replication and may also contribute to the unique broad host replication properties of this plasmid.

Toukdarian for helpful discussions and for critically reading the manuscript. We also thank R. Neves for help during the preparation of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1983737411,"The membrane proteins synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 form the core of a ubiquitous fusion machine that interacts with the soluble proteins NSF and α-SNAP. During regulated exocytosis, membrane fusion is usually strictly controlled by Ca2+ ions. However, the mechanism by which Ca2+ regulates exocytosis is still unclear. Here we show that the membranes of exocrine secretory granules contain an 18-kDa protein, syncollin, that binds to syntaxin at low Ca2+ concentrations and dissociates at concentrations known to stimulate exocytosis. Syncollin has a single hydrophobic domain at its N-terminus and shows no significant homology with any known protein. Recombinant syncollin inhibits fusion in vitro between zymogen granules and pancreatic plasma membranes, and its potency falls as Ca2+ concentration rises. We suggest that syncollin acts as a Ca2+-sensitive regulator of exocytosis in exocrine tissues."

Perhaps the most phylogenetically specific nucleoside in tRNA is archaeosine, which occurs only in archaeal tRNA at position 15, a site that is not modified in tRNAs from the other two primary domains (7Sprinzl M. Steegborn C. Hübel F. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Archaeosine was first discovered by Kilpatrick and Walker (8Kilpatrick M.W. Walker R.T. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Mikrobiol. Hyg. 1 Abt. Orig. 1982; C3: 79-89Google Scholar) during sequencing of tRNA fromThermoplasma acidophilum, and it was subsequently shown to be present in many archaeal species (9Edmonds C.G. Crain P.F. Gupta R.

Subsequently, the structure of archaeosine was determined to be the non-purine, non-pyrimidine nucleoside 7-formamidino-7-deazaguanosine (Fig.1 A) (11Gregson J.M. Crain P.F. Edmonds C.G. Gupta R.

In contrast to archaeosine, members of the Q nucleoside family are located at the first position of the anticodon (position 34) in bacterial and eukaryotic tRNAs that are specific for only four amino acids (Tyr, His, Asp, and Asn) (19Harada F. Nishimura S. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the Q nucleoside in tRNA is tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT; EC2.4.2.29), which catalyzes a base-exchange reaction by cleavage of the N–C glycosidic bond at position 34 (20Okada N. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3061-3066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

After incorporation of preQ1 into tRNA, it is further modified to oQ by transfer of the ribosyl moiety from S-adenosylmethionine (22Slany R.K. Bösl M. Crain P.F. Kersten H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7811-7817Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), then finally to yield Q in the polynucleotide chain (23Frey B. McCloskey J.A. Kersten W. Kersten H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2078-2082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in eukarya, TGT can incorporate fully modified Q base into the first position of the anticodon by a base-replacement reaction (24Shindo-Okada N. Okada N. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura S.

Here we report the isolation of a new type of TGT from H. volcanii; it catalyzes the incorporation of preQ0 base into position 15 of tRNA, replacing guanine originally located at that site. Further, we have demonstrated that free preQ0 base is present in H. volcanii cells, implying that TGT utilizes preQ0 as a substrate leading to the biosynthesis of archaeosine in archaeal tRNAs. H. volcanii (ATCC 29605) was grown aerobically at 37 °C on a 500-liter scale in Gupta's medium (10Gupta R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9461-9471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.8–1.0. About 1.0 kg of cells was collected. Exchange between guanine and various 7-deazaguanine analogues, catalyzed by TGT, was assayed as described previously (20Okada N. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3061-3066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the final ionic condition of the reaction mixture was 1.5 m KCl and 1.5 m NaCl. The 7-deazaguanines were synthesized as described previously: preQ0 (28Kondo, T., Nakatsuka, S., and Goto, T. (1980) Chemistry Lett.559–562.Google Scholar), preQ1 (29Ohgi, T., Kondo, T., and Goto, T. (1979) Chemistry Lett.1283–1286.Google Scholar), and archaeosine base (30Hashizume T. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. Symp. Ser. 1994; 31: 137-138Google Scholar). Frozen H. volcanii cells (100 g) were suspended in 200 ml of buffer A (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus DNase I (2.5 μg/ml), and were broken by sonication. The S-100 fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h, dialyzed against buffer A, and then adsorbed onto a DEAE-Sepharose FF column (2.5 × 20 cm) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.02 to 0.5 m in buffer A. The eluate containing the active fraction was brought to 40% ammonium sulfate and then applied to a Butyl-Sepharose FF column (2.5 × 20 cm) (Pharmacia), which was eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate from 40 to 0% in buffer A. The active fraction was next applied to a Butyl-Sepharose 4B column (1.5 × 15 cm) (Pharmacia) and eluted as described above for the Butyl-Sepharose FF column. The active fraction was then applied to a Superdex 200 column (1.6 cm × 60 cm) (Pharmacia), and then eluted with buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl. Finally, the TGT fraction was applied to a Mono Q column (0.50 × 5 cm) (Pharmacia) and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 300 mm to 1 m. This TGT fraction was stable for at least 1 month when stored at 4 °C. The activity of the enzyme was monitored by incorporation of [8-14C]guanine into unfractionated E. colitRNA (20Okada N. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3061-3066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of peptide fragments generated by digestion with lysylpeptidase were determined as described previously (31Tsunasawa S. Masaki T. Hirose M. Soejima M. Sakiyama F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3832-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two synthetic DNA oligomers, namely Lys-FOR (5′- TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCGGTAGCTCAGTTAGGCAGAGCGTCTGACTCTT-3′) and Lys-REV (5′-TGGTGGGCCGGACGCGATTTGAACACGCGACCGTCTGATTAAGAGTCAGACGCTCTGCCTA-3′) were annealed via the complementary region, and both of the 3′ ends were extended by Tth DNA polymerase (Toyobo). After extension, two synthetic DNA primers, namely T7 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATA-3′) and Halo-Lys3′ (5′-CCTGGTGGGCCGGACGCGATTT-3′) were added, and a polymerase chain reaction was performed to yield the gene for H. volcanii tRNALys(CUU) containing the promoter sequence for T7 RNA polymerase (Takara). We cloned the product of a polymerase chain reaction in pUC19; digestion of plasmid DNA with MvaI generated a CCA end for the tRNA gene, which was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (32Himeno H. Hasegawa T. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Miura K. Shimizu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7855-7863Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For preparation of the T7 transcript into which preQ0 base was incorporated, 200 μl of a reaction mixture containing 300 pmol of T7 transcript, 20 μl of TGT (15 units) (20Okada N. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3061-3066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 5 nmol of preQ0 base (under ionic conditions of the guanine exchange reaction; see above) were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. The sequence of the RNA was determined as described elsewhere (33Stanley J. Vassilenko S. Nature. 1978; 274: 87-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 34Kuchino Y. Hanyu N. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A reaction mixture containing T7 transcript and TGT in the presence of preQ0 base or an aliquot of acid-soluble extract ofH. volcanii was incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. After digestion of the T7 transcript by RNase T2, the preQ0nucleotide was analyzed by post-labeling using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (21Okada N. Noguchi S. Kasai H. Shindo-Okada N. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3067-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Silberklang M. Prochiantz A. Haenni A.-L. RajBhandary U.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 72: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The enzymes used (RNase T2, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and yeast hexokinase) were inactivated by phenol extraction instead of boiling. After incubation with nuclease P1, the digestion product was applied to a cellulose thin layer plate (20 × 20 cm) and was subjected to two-dimensional chromatography (15Okada N. Noguchi S. Nishimura S. Ohgi T. Goto T. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). H. volcanii cells were suspended in a solution of 0.2 m formic acid and shaken for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered through a Millipore filter. After neutralization with NaOH, soluble substances were extracted with tetrahydrofuran. The organic phase was evaporated, and the material was used for the identification of preQ0base. E. coli TGT can be assayed by its ability to incorporate [8-14C]guanine into Q-unmodified tRNAs (typically unfractionated yeast tRNA, which constitutively lacks Q, is used) by replacing the guanine base located at the first position of the anticodon (20Okada N. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3061-3066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy with E. coli TGT, we searched for such an enzymatic activity in a crude extract of H. volcaniiusing E. coli tRNA as a substrate (see below). H. volcanii TGT was purified to near homogeneity following successive column chromatographies. Table I shows the recovery and the purification factor at each step, and Fig.2 shows the pattern of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at each step. The molecular mass of the enzyme was deduced to be 78 kDa from a profile of the gel (Fig. 2, lane 6). Like E. coli and eukaryotic TGT, H. volcanii TGT does not require ATP for the base replacement reaction. High salt concentration (approximately 2.4 m) is necessary for maximum activity. Magnesium ion is required for activity with the T7 transcript as a substrate, but activity with unfractionatedE. coli tRNA does not require magnesium ion. These results suggest that magnesium ion may be responsible for conformational rigidity of the tRNA, but not for the enzymatic activity itself. Optimum activity occurs near pH 7.5. Purified TGT was digested with lysylpeptidase, and the sequences of several resultant peptide fragments were determined (see below).Table IPurification of tRNA-guanine transglycosylase from H. volcaniiFractionProteinSpecific activity1-a1 unit = 20 pmol/h.Purification factorRecoverymg×10 2 units/mg%S-10055002.41100DEAE-Sepharose FF110013.86118Butyl-Sepharose FF35036.916102Butyl-Sepharose 4B5034.81514Superdex 2007321.313918Mono Q0.4975.042231-a 1 unit = 20 pmol/h. Open table in a new tab To examine the specificity for tRNA substrate, we constructed a plasmid clone containing the sequence of H. volcanii tRNALys(CUU) and that of T7 promoter upstream of the gene. Its T7 transcript (Fig.3 A) was found to be a good substrate for the enzyme (Fig. 3 B). The labeled T7 transcript was isolated, and the site at which [8-14C]guanine had been incorporated was determined by RNA sequencing to be position 15, 2M. Watanabe, M. Matsuo, S. Tanaka, and N. Okada, unpublished observations. the exclusive location of archaeosine nucleotide in archaeal tRNA. This result suggested that the enzymatic activity is involved in the biosynthesis of archaeosine nucleotide in tRNA. Unfractionated tRNA from E. coli was also found to be a good TGT substrate, whereas unfractionated H. volcanii, yeast, and bovine tRNAs were not (Fig. 3 B), although we did not quantitatively measure the efficiency of unfractionated E. coli tRNA and of the T7Lystranscript as substrates. These results further suggest that position 15 of H. volcanii tRNAs is fully modified to archaeosine nucleotide. The ability of various bases to serve as substrates for incorporation into tRNA by H. volcanii TGT was examined using the procedure of Okada et al. (21Okada N. Noguchi S. Kasai H. Shindo-Okada N. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3067-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, the T7 transcript was labeled with [8-14C]guanine by incubation with TGT. To a reaction mixture that contained this 8-14C-labeled tRNA and the TGT enzyme, we added various 7-deazaguanine bases and monitored the decrease in acid-insoluble radioactivity of the tRNA due to release of [8-14C]guanine by replacement with the added base (Fig.4). Unexpectedly, neither archaeosine base itself (Fig. 1 B), nor preQ1 base (Fig.1 C), which is the physiological substrate for E. coli TGT (21Okada N. Noguchi S. Kasai H. Shindo-Okada N. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3067-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were incorporated into the tRNA transcript. Among 7-deazaguanine derivatives, only preQ0 base (Fig.1 D) was efficiently incorporated. We attribute the small amount of apparent archaeosine base incorporation into tRNA to be due to preQ0 base, and not archaeosine base, since approximately 20% of archaeosine base is chemically converted to preQ0 base after incubation of the reaction mixture under the conditions used. Furthermore, the nucleotide at position 15 of the tRNA product after incubation with archaeosine base was found to be preQ0 nucleotide by RNA sequencing2 (see “Discussion”). To investigate whether preQ0 base is directly incorporated into tRNA, as well as whether incorporation occurs at position 15 in the D-loop, the sequence of the D-loop region in the T7 transcript after incubation with preQ0 base was determined by the post-labeling method (33Stanley J. Vassilenko S. Nature. 1978; 274: 87-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 34Kuchino Y. Hanyu N. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The RNA was subjected to partial digestion with alkali and the 5′ ends of resultant RNA fragments were labeled by using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, followed by separation by electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel (Fig.5 A). RNA was extracted from each band in the gel and digested with nuclease P1. The resultant32P-labeled nucleotide 5′-monophosphate was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. Fig. 5 B shows clearly that preQ0 base was incorporated at position 15 of the tRNA, and also shows that more than 90% of the nucleotide at position 15 is a preQ0 nucleotide, indicating that the base-replacement reaction by H. volcanii TGT was efficient under the present conditions. If preQ0 base is the physiological substrate for H. volcanii TGT, free preQ0 base could be present in H. volcanii cells. To test this hypothesis, we prepared an acid-soluble extract of H. volcanii and incubated an aliquot of the extract with the T7 transcript of H. volcanii tRNALys(CUU) andH. volcanii TGT under the same conditions described in Fig.4. After the reaction, we analyzed modified nucleotides in the treated tRNA using the post-labeling method (21Okada N. Noguchi S. Kasai H. Shindo-Okada N. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3067-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Silberklang M. Prochiantz A. Haenni A.-L. RajBhandary U.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 72: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, preQ0 5′-monophosphate was detected in the tRNA transcript following incubation in the presence of the acid-soluble extract (Fig. 6 B), but it was not detected following incubation with the enzyme alone (Fig. 6 C). Further, similar acid treatment of isolated H. volcanii tRNA did not release preQ0 by the criterion of failure of the T7 transcript to incorporate preQ0 when incubated with the extract and TGT.2 Although archaeosine base is unstable under conditions of high temperature and high salt (see above), archaeosine appears stable when present as a nucleotide in intact tRNA (10Gupta R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9461-9471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that free preQ0 base is present in H. volcanii cells and that it may serve as the physiological substrate for H. volcanii TGT (see “Discussion” Fig.7 A).Figure 7Two biosynthetic pathways involving tRNA-guanine transglycosylases.

J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9461-9471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains Tryptone, which, as a whole meat extract, is a source of Q nucleoside and, therefore, a potential source of preQ0. To rule out the possibility that H. volcanii may not synthesize archaeosine de novo, tRNA was isolated from cells grown in a chemically defined (Q-free) medium (36Kauri T. Wallace R. Kushner D.J. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1990; 13: 14-18Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and analyzed for archaeosine; archaeosine content in tRNA from cells grown in the normal growth medium and in chemically defined growth medium was identical.2 Recently, the complete genome sequence of the methanogenic archaeon, Methanococcus jannaschii, has been reported (37Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomd J.-F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F.

Hurst M.A. Kaine B.P. Borodovsky M. Klenk H.-P. Fraser C.M. Smith H.O. Woese C.R. Ventner J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). Among 1738 protein-coding genes predicted is a putative M. jannaschii TGT gene (MJ#0436) that exhibits 30% identity to E. coli TGT (38Reuter K. Slany R. Ullrich F. Kersten H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2256-2264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We determined the amino acid sequences of three peptide fragments, generated from purified H. volcanii TGT by digestion with lysylpeptidase, and compared them with the sequence of the putative M. jannaschii TGT. As shown in Fig. 8, fragments 1and 2 from H. volcanii TGT appear to be closely related to the M. jannaschii sequence, with identities of 53.5 and 38.5%, respectively, although the C-terminal portion offragment 3 diverges from that in M. jannaschii. These results suggest that the H. volcanii tRNA-guanine transglycosylase characterized here is the counterpart of the putative TGT whose sequence is present in M. jannaschii (37Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomd J.-F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F.

Hurst M.A. Kaine B.P. Borodovsky M. Klenk H.-P. Fraser C.M. Smith H.O. Woese C.R. Ventner J.C. Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). It is well established that TGT is involved in biosynthesis of Q nucleotide inE. coli (Fig. 1 E) by exchange of guanine at position 34 by preQ1 base in tRNAs specific for Tyr, Asp, Asn, and His ((20, 21); see Introduction). The resultant preQ1 nucleotide in tRNA is then modified to the epoxide oQ by the S-adenosylmethionine-requiring enzyme QueA (22Slany R.K. Bösl M. Crain P.F. Kersten H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7811-7817Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and finally, oQ is converted to Q by an unknown vitamin B12-dependent enzyme (23Frey B. McCloskey J.A. Kersten W. Kersten H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2078-2082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These processes are schematically represented in Fig. 7 B. In the present study, we provide evidence that, in contrast with the primary substrate of bacterial TGT (preQ1), preQ0 base is the normal substrate for H. volcanii TGT. Presumably, the incorporated preQ0 base then is further converted to archaeosine by (net) addition of ammonia, at the polynucleotide level (Fig.7 A). Therefore, both E. coli and H. volcanii TGTs catalyze a very similar reaction, namely, the exchange of guanine base in a polynucleotide chain with a free 7-deazaguanine derivative; however, their actual substrates (in terms of base, tRNAs, and the site of replacement in tRNA) are different. Archaeosine is present at position 15 (D-loop) in most archaeal tRNAs (7Sprinzl M. Steegborn C. Hübel F. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), whereas Q and its derivatives are present at position 34 (first position of the anticodon) of four specific tRNAs in bacteria and eukarya (19Harada F. Nishimura S. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) (see Introduction). Accordingly, these conserved differences in structure and sequence location suggest differences in function. Q has been proposed to be involved in codon recognition (39Bienz M. Kubli E. Nature. 1981; 294: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and has been shown to prevent stop codon readthrough in tobacco mosaic virus RNA in a codon context-dependent manner (40Beier H. Barciszewska M. Krupp G. Mitnacht R. Gross H.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 351-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A correlation between the presence of Q-undermodified tRNAs and frameshifts of some retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus was proposed (41Hatfield D. Feng Y.-X. Lee B.J. Rein A. Levin J.G. Oroszlan S. Virology. 1989; 173: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Other functional implications of Q, such as in virulence of Shigella (42Durand J.M. Okada N. Tobe T. Watarai M. Fukuda I. Suzuki T. Nakata N. Komatsu K. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4627-4634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), signal transduction (43Morris R.C. Brooks B.J.

Seubert P.H. Tillman D.M. Farkas W.R. Katze J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and tumor differentiation (45Okada N. Shindo-Okada N. Sato S.

Katze J.R. Trewyn R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3613-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), have also been suggested. The functional role of archaeosine has not been established, but has been proposed to involve enhanced stabilization of tRNA tertiary structure as a consequence of the unique charged imidino side chain (11Gregson J.M. Crain P.F. Edmonds C.G. Gupta R. Hashizume T. Phillipson D.W. McCloskey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10076-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier work has demonstrated that hydrogen bonding interactions between G-15 in the D-loop and C-48 in the T-loop, stabilized by stacking with purine-59, constitute a generally conserved mechanism for stabilization of the universal folded L-shape of tRNA (49Rich A. RajBhandary U.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 805-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 50Dock-Bregeon A.C. Westhof E. Giegé R. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 707-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These structural features (G-15, C-48, purine-59) are basically met by nearly all reported archaeosine-containing tRNA sequences (7Sprinzl M. Steegborn C. Hübel F. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), to which would be added the strong potential for electrostatic interactions between phosphate and the “arginine fork” imidino side chain of archaeosine. Interestingly, precursor bases used as substrates for both bacterial and archaeal TGTs participate in analogous biosynthetic pathways. Free preQ1 base has been isolated from E. coli (21Okada N. Noguchi S. Kasai H. Shindo-Okada N. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3067-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and here we provide evidence for the presence of free preQ0base in H. volcanii. We believe that this free preQ0 base is likely to be the precursor exchanged into tRNA in the normal biosynthetic pathway leading to archaeosine, although, at present, we cannot strictly exclude the possibility that free preQ0 base detected is instead derived from archaeosine in tRNA. In E. coli, preQ1 base is synthesized from GTP (13Nishimura S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 49-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), possibly via preQ0 (51Björk G.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 263-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), although there is presently no direct evidence for any precursor-product relationship between these two 7-deazaguanine bases. Presumably a similar pathway is present in H. volcanii for biosynthesis of preQ0 base from GTP. The key substrates following base replacement at the tRNA level, then, are preQ1 nucleotide (leading to queuosine in E. coli) and preQ0 nucleotide (leading to archaeosine inH. volcanii). It is noted that preQ0 nucleoside is present in tRNA of certain mutants of E. coli (51Björk G.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 263-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the meaning of which has not yet been rationalized (14Noguchi S. Yamaizumi Z. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura Y. Hirota Y. Nishimura S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4215-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Okada N. Noguchi S. Kasai H. Shindo-Okada N. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3067-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The occurrence of these 7-deazaguanine precursor bases in both primary phylogenetic domains, archaea and bacteria, prompts us to speculate a more general role for them in cellular functions. In this respect, more detailed characterization of free preQ0 base (and possibly free preQ1 base) in H. volcanii cells is required. tRNA structural requirements for enzyme recognition remain to be identified. Preliminary experiments2 showed that an 18 nucleotide minihelix containing the D-loop and D-stem of H. volcaniitRNALys(CUU) does not serve as a substrate for H. volcanii TGT, implying the existence of higher order recognition elements for the archaeal TGT. By contrast, bacterial TGT recognizes the anticodon loop sequence U33-G34-U35, which is the minimum requirement for recognition by the enzyme, and minihelices containing this triplet sequence are good substrates for the enzyme (52Curnow A.W. Kung F.-L. Koch K.A. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5239-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 53Nakanishi S. Ueda T. Hori H. Yamazaki N. Okada N. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32221-32225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By x-ray crystallography, the tRNA-guanine transglycosylase fromZymomonas mobilis has been determined to be an irregular (α/β)8 barrel with a tightly attached C-terminal zinc-containing subdomain (54Romier C. Reuter K. Suck D. Ficner R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2850-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Further, the structure of Z. mobilis TGT in complex with preQ1 suggests a binding mode for tRNA where the phosphate backbone interacts with the zinc subdomain and the U33-G34-U35sequence is recognized by the barrel. The zinc binding motif (CXCX 2CX 25H) is highly conserved in prokaryotic TGTs known so far (52Curnow A.W. Kung F.-L. Koch K.A. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5239-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the homologous region in M. jannaschii is (CXCX 2CX 22H). These results demonstrate a structural and functional conservation of the archaeal and bacterial/eukaryotic TGT binding mode with tRNA, despite archaeal modification of the D-loop and bacterial/eukaryotic modification of the anticodon loop. The utilization of 7-deazaguanine derivatives for tRNA processing by interrelated TGT enzymes suggests an evolutionarily fundamental role for 7-deazaguanine. In contrast to bacterial TGT (52Curnow A.W. Kung F.-L. Koch K.A. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5239-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 55Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. J. Biol.

In addition, eukaryotic TGT is believed to be a heterodimer, although this is not conclusive at present (44Deshpande K.L. Seubert P.H. Tillman D.M. Farkas W.R. Katze J. Arch. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2044056402,"Bryostatin 1 and phorbol esters are both potent activators of protein kinase C (PKC), although their specific biological effects can differ in many systems. Here, we report that bryostatin 1 activates protein kinase D (PKD), a novel serine/threonine protein kinase, in intact Swiss 3T3 cells and secondary mouse embryo fibroblasts and in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with a PKD expression construct. The dose response of PKD activation induced by bryostatin 1 follows a striking biphasic pattern with maximal activation achieved at a concentration of 10 nm. Higher concentrations of bryostatin 1 (100 nm) reduced PKD activation induced by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to levels stimulated by bryostatin 1 alone. Bryostatin 1-induced PKD activation was markedly attenuated by treatment of cells with the PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I and Ro 31-8220. However, these agents did not inhibit PKD activity when added directly to in vitro kinase assays, suggesting that bryostatin 1 stimulates PKD activation through a PKC-dependent pathway in intact cells. Our results raise the possibility that activated PKD in intact cells could mediate some of the multiple biphasic biological responses induced by bryostatin 1.

Despite appearing to bind to the same cellular targets, the biological responses induced by bryostatin 1 frequently differ from those induced by phorbol esters. For example, many bryostatin 1-mediated effects have unusual characteristics such as biphasic dose-response relationships, delayed kinetics, and the ability to inhibit phorbol ester-induced responses (7Kraft A.S.

Cancer Lett. 1992; 66: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism(s) by which bryostatin 1 induces these biological effects remain poorly understood. The newly identified protein kinase D (PKD) is a mouse serine/threonine protein kinase with distinct structural features and enzymological properties (17Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Valverde A.M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In particular, the catalytic domain of PKD, which is distantly related to Ca2+-regulated kinases, shows little homology to the highly conserved regions of the kinase domain of the PKC family. As a consequence of this, PKD does not phosphorylate a variety of known PKC substrates, indicating that PKD has a distinct substrate specificity (18Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 19Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of PKD contains a putative transmembrane domain, two cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motifs, and a pleckstrin homology domain. Unlike all known PKC isoforms, PKD does not contain a pseudosubstrate motif upstream of the cysteine-rich region, and the sequence separating the cysteine-rich repeats of PKD (95 amino acids) is substantially longer than that of classical and novel PKCs (28 and 35 amino acids, respectively). Additionally, residues Ala-146, Ala-154, and Tyr-182 in the consensus cysteine-rich motif of PKD differ from those found in PKCs. However, both immunopurified PKD and a fusion protein containing the cysteine-rich region of PKD bind phorbol esters with high affinity, and PKD is directly stimulated in vitroby these agents, or by diacylglycerol, in the presence of phospholipids (18Valverde A.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A human protein kinase called atypical PKCμ (20Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 92% homology to PKD is also stimulated in vitro by phorbol esters and phospholipids (21Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Bottinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PKD/PKCμ are phorbol ester/diacylglycerol-stimulated protein kinases. Recent studies have demonstrated a novel mechanism of activation of PKD. Specifically, treatment of intact cells with biologically active phorbol esters induces phosphorylation-dependent activation of PKD through a PKC-dependent pathway (22Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). PKD activity recovered from phorbol ester-stimulated cells can be measured by kinase assays in the absence of lipid activators. These results revealed an unsuspected connection between PKCs and PKD and suggested that PKD can function parallel to and/or downstream of PKC in signal transduction pathways. The differences between the biological effects elicited by phorbol esters and bryostatin 1 in certain systems prompted us to examine whether bryostatin 1 regulates PKD activity in intact cells. Here we report that treatment with bryostatin 1 induces PKD activation in intact Swiss 3T3 cells and MEF and in COS-7 cells transfected with a PKD expression vector. A salient feature of our results is that bryostatin 1-mediated activation of PKD follows a striking biphasic dose-response relationship. PKD activation induced by treatment with PDB was inhibited by high concentrations of bryostatin 1. These results raise the possibility that PKD could mediate some of the multiple biological responses induced by bryostatin 1. Cell Culture—Stock cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 at 37 °C. For experimental purposes, cells were plated in 90-mm dishes at 6 × 105 cells/dish in DMEM containing 10% FBS and used after 6–8 days, when the cells were confluent and quiescent. COS-7 cells were plated in 90-mm dishes at 6 × 105 cells/dish in DMEM containing 10% FBS and used for transfection 1 day later. Secondary cultures of MEF were seeded in 90-mm dishes at 6 × 105 cells/dish in DMEM containing 10% FBS, switched down to 0.5% FBS after 3–4 days, and were used after 24 h when the cells were confluent and quiescent. The PKD cDNA fragment spanning bases −125 to 3179 was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3, as described (19Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A kinase-deficient mutant (PKDK618M) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis kit (Promega) and subcloned into pcDNA3 (pcDNA3-PKDK618M). Exponentially growing COS-7 cells, 40–60% confluent, were transfected with the various plasmids using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 μg of DNA was used for 90-mm dishes. The DNA was diluted to 1 ml with Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then mixed with Lipofectin (20 μl) diluted to 1 ml with Opti-MEM I. After 15 min, the DNA-Lipofectin complex was diluted to 5 ml with Opti-MEM I, mixed gently, and overlaid onto rinsed (once with Opti-MEM I) COS-7 cells. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, and the medium was then replaced with fresh Opti-MEM I containing 10% FBS. The cells were used for experimental purposes 72 h later. Cultured cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2′-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and 1% Triton X-100 (lysis buffer A). PKD was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 3 h with the PA-1 anti-peptide antiserum (1:100 dilution), raised against the synthetic peptide EEREMKALSERVSIL that corresponds to the COOH-terminal region of the predicted amino acid sequence of PKD, as described previously (18Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 19Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were recovered using protein A coupled to agarose. PKD immunocomplexes were washed once with lysis buffer A, twice with lysis buffer B (consisting of lysis buffer A minus Triton X-100), and once with kinase buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). In some experiments PKD was then eluted from immunocomplexes by incubation with 0.75 mg/ml of the immunizing peptide in kinase buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. PKD autophosphorylation was determined by in vitro kinase assays by mixing 30 μl of either immunocomplexes or eluted PKD with 5 μl of a phosphorylation mixture, consisting of kinase buffer (see above) containing 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP final concentration (specific activity, 400–600 cpm/pmol). In vitro stimulation of eluted PKD was performed using 100 μg/ml PS and either 50 nm bryostatin 1 or 200 nm PDB, as described previously (19Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the reactions were terminated by washing with 200 μl of cold kinase buffer and adding 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (1 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm Na3V04, 6% SDS, 0.5m EDTA, pH 8, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol), followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The gels were dried, and the 110-kDa radioactive band corresponding to phosphorylated PKD was visualized by autoradiography. Autoradiographs were scanned in a LKB Ultrascan XL densitometer, and the labeled band was quantified using Ultrascan XL internal integrator. Exogenous substrate phosphorylation by immunoprecipitated PKD was carried out by mixing 30 μl of the washed immunocomplexes with 5 μl of phosphorylation mixture (see above) containing 2.5 mg/ml syntide-2 (PLARTLSVAGLPGKK), a peptide based on phosphorylation site 2 of glycogen synthase (23Lorca T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9143-9147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the kinase reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 75 mmH3PO4 and then spotting 80 μl of supernatant onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Free [γ-32P]ATP was separated from the labeled substrate by washing the P-81 paper four times (5 min each) in 75 mm H3PO4. The papers were dried, and radioactivity incorporated into syntide-2 was determined by Cerenkov counting. PKD autophosphorylation and syntide-2 phosphorylation by PKD in the absence or presence of activators were linear up to 10 min of incubation. Purified PKC (5 ng) was assayed in the presence of 50 nm bryostatin 1, 100 μg/ml PS, and 1 mm CaCl2 in a phosphorylation mixture (see above) containing 2.5 mg/ml syntide-2. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the kinase reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 75 mm H3PO4 and then spotting 80 μl of supernatant onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper. Free [γ-32P]ATP was separated from the labeled substrate by washing the P-81 paper four times (5 min each) in 75 mmH3PO4. The papers were dried and radioactivity incorporated into syntide-2 determined by Cerenkov counting. Confluent and quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were washed twice in phosphate-free DMEM and incubated at 37 °C with this medium containing 200 μCi/ml carrier-free 32Pi for 18 h. Cells were then stimulated with either bryostatin 1 or PDB, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with PA-1 antiserum. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Confluent and quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated with 10 nm bryostatin 1 for 30 min and lysed. The lysates were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with either 1 μm microcystin or an equivalent volume of solvent. PKD was then immunoprecipitated and subjected toin vitro kinases assays, as described above. For Western blot analysis of PKD, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer A (see above), extracted for 10 min at 95 °C in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to Immobilon membranes. The transfer was carried out at 100 V, 0.4 A at 4 °C for 4 h using a Bio-Rad transfer apparatus in a buffer consisting of 200 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, 0.01% SDS, and 20% CH3OH. Membranes were blocked using 5% non-fat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and incubated with PA-1 antiserum (1:500) at room temperature for 3 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% non-fat dried milk. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and subsequent enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL) detection or protein A-I125 and autoradiography. In Fig. 1 A, lower panel, lysates of bryostatin 1-treated cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to PKD immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Bryostatin 1 was isolated from Bugula neritina as described previously (3Pettit G.R. Herald C.L. Doubek D.L. Arnold E. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6846-6848Crossref Scopus (711) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (370 MBq/ml), 32Pi (10 mCi/ml), protein A-I125 (100 μCi/ml), and ECL reagents were from Amersham International (U. K.). PDB was obtained from Sigma. The inhibitors GF I and Ro 31-8220 were from LC Laboratories. Protein A-agarose was from Boehringer Mannheim. The MEK-1 inhibitor PD 098059 was the generous gift of Alan R. Saltiel, Department of Signal Transduction, Parke Davis Research Division, Ann Arbor, MI. Microcystin was from Sigma. Purified PKC from rat brain (containing α, β, and γ isoforms) was from TCS Biologicals, U. K. Other items were from standard suppliers or as indicated in the text. To determine whether bryostatin 1 induces PKD activation in intact cells, quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with increasing concentrations (0.3–100 nm) of bryostatin 1 for 30 min, lysed, and the extracts immunoprecipitated with the PA-1 antiserum. The immunocomplexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and scanning densitometry to determine the level of PKD autophosphorylation. Stimulation of intact cells with bryostatin 1 induced a striking dose-dependent increase in PKD activity which was maintained during cell lysis and immunoprecipitation and which could be measured by autophosphorylation assays in the absence of further lipid activators (Fig.1 A, upper panel). Half-maximum and maximum stimulation were achieved at 1 nmand 5–10 nm, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Maximal PKD activation induced by bryostatin 1 was comparable to that induced by 200 nm PDB in parallel cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells (Fig.1 A, upper panel). However, at higher concentrations of bryostatin 1 (>10 nm) PKD was activated to a lesser extent. This biphasic pattern of PKD activation was not the result of PKD degradation induced by high concentrations of bryostatin 1, as can be seen by Western blot analysis of PKD expression levels (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). In contrast, neither PDB nor TPA induced biphasic activation of PKD. The maximum effects of PDB and TPA (achieved at 100 nm and 20 nm, respectively) were not decreased by increasing the concentration of these agents by 10- and 25-fold respectively (Fig. 1 C). Thus, bryostatin 1, unlike phorbol esters, induces a biphasic activation of PKD in intact Swiss 3T3 cells. A similar dose-dependent biphasic activation of PKD induced by bryostatin 1 (0.3–100 nm) was also seen in quiescent cultures of secondary MEF (Fig. 2) with a maximum response occurring at 10 nm. Thus, biphasic PKD activation in response to bryostatin 1 is not restricted to immortalized cell lines. The time course of PKD activation induced by 10 nmbryostatin 1 also contrasts with that stimulated by 200 nmPDB (Fig. 3 A). Although PKD activation was maximal after 10 min of PDB stimulation, bryostatin 1-mediated PKD activation was delayed, with the maximal response only occurring after treatment for 30 min. Subsequently, we determined whether bryostatin 1-mediated PKD activation could also be demonstrated using an exogenous substrate. The synthetic peptide syntide-2 (23Lorca T. Cruzalegui F.H. Fesquest D. Cavadore J.C. Mery J. Heans A. Doree M. Nature. 1993; 366: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 24Mochizuki H. Ito T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9143-9147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been identified as an efficient substrate for the catalytic domain of PKD (18Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and for the full-length PKD (19Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore syntide-2 was chosen as a model exogenous substrate to assay PKD activity immunoprecipitated from lysates of Swiss 3T3 cells treated with increasing concentrations of bryostatin 1 (as indicated) or 200 nm PDB. As shown in Fig.3 B, a biphasic pattern of syntide-2 phosphorylation was seen in PKD immunoprecipitates from cells stimulated with bryostatin 1, which was comparable to the biphasic pattern of PKD autophosphorylation seen previously. The biphasic bryostatin 1 dose-response curve of PKD activation in Swiss 3T3 cells prompted us to examine whether this agent, at high concentrations, could antagonize activation of PKD by PDB. To examine this possibility confluent and quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with either 200 nm PDB or with increasing concentrations of bryostatin 1 (1, 10, or 100 nm) in the absence or presence of 200 nm PDB for 30 min. The results presented in Fig.4 show that activation of PKD by bryostatin 1 alone follows the biphasic pattern seen previously and that PDB-induced activation of PKD was not affected by the simultaneous addition of either 1 nm or 10 nm bryostatin 1. However, PKD activation induced by PDB in the presence of 100 nm bryostatin 1 was reduced to levels seen with 100 nm bryostatin 1 alone (Fig. 4). A similar antagonism of PKD activation was seen when cells were treated with 100 nmbryostatin 1 for 30 min prior to treatment with 200 nm PDB for 10 min (data not shown). These results demonstrate that treatment with high concentrations of bryostatin 1 antagonizes PKD activation induced by PDB. To confirm that the bryostatin 1-induced kinase activity measured was the result of activation of PKD rather than the presence of a coprecipitating protein kinase, we examined PKD autophosphorylation in COS-7 cells transfected with either a wild type PKD expression vector (pcDNA3-PKD) or with a kinase-defective PKD mutant (pcDNA3-PKDK618M) in which lysine 618 in the ATP binding site is replaced by methionine. Cells were treated with bryostatin 1 or PDB, lysed, and the immunoprecipitates subjected to in vitro kinase assays and to immunoblotting with the PA-1 antiserum. Bryostatin 1 treatment of COS-7 cells, like PDB, resulted in activation of wild type PKD (Fig.5 A, upper panel,left). In contrast, no inducible kinase activity was seen in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3-PKDK618M (Fig. 5 A,upper panel, right) despite similar PKD and PKDK618M expression levels (Fig. 5 A, lower panels). Similarly, no kinase activity was detected in COS-7 cells transfected with the control vector pcDNA3 (data not shown). These results verified that the bryostatin 1-induced kinase activity measured in PKD immunoprecipitates was caused by the activation of PKD. The preceding experiments demonstrated that treatment with bryostatin 1 markedly increased the level of PKD autophosphorylation in “in vitro” kinase assays. We next examined whether bryostatin 1 induces PKD phosphorylation in intact cells. Confluent and quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells metabolically labeled with32Pi were stimulated with 10 nmbryostatin 1 for 30 min or 200 nm PDB for 10 min. Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with PA-1 antiserum, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 5 B,upper panel, 10 nm bryostatin 1 induced a 4.6-fold increase in the incorporation of 32Piinto PKD, which was comparable to that induced by 200 nmPDB. Interestingly, when cells were stimulated with 100 nmbryostatin 1, incorporation of 32Pi into PKD was 47% lower than after treatment of cells with 10 nmbryostatin 1 (Fig. 5 B, lower panel). Thus, bryostatin 1 induces biphasic phosphorylation of PKD in intact cells. To determine further the role of phosphorylation in maintaining the activated state of PKD, we examined whether endogenous protein phosphatases could reverse bryostatin 1-induced PKD activation. Lysates of Swiss 3T3 cells treated with bryostatin 1 were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the absence or presence of 1 μmmicrocystin, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, prior to PKD immunoprecipitation. As can be seen in Fig. 5 C, incubation of the lysate in the absence of microcystin resulted in a marked decrease of PKD activity. Addition of this protein phosphatase inhibitor preserved substantial PKD activity (Fig. 5 C). We next examined potential signaling pathways leading to bryostatin 1-induced PKD activation in Swiss 3T3 cells. Inhibition of a variety of kinases, including p70S6K with rapamycin (20 nm), PI 3-kinase with wortmannin (50 nm), PKA with H-89 (60 μm), and p42MAPK/p44MAPK with the selective MEK-1 inhibitor PD 098059 (10 μm) did not affect PKD activation in response to bryostatin 1 (Fig. 6). Similarly, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and inhibition of p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation using cytochalasin D had no effect on subsequent PKD activation induced by bryostatin 1 (Fig.6). However, treatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with GF I or Ro 31-8220, potent inhibitors of classic and novel isoforms of PKC (25Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3980-3988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), did attenuate PKD activation induced by bryostatin 1 (Fig. 6). We therefore investigated further the role of bryostatin 1-sensitive PKCs in the activation of PKD induced by treatment of intact cells with bryostatin 1. As shown in Fig.7 A, upper panels, pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with increasing concentrations of either GF I or Ro 31-8220 led to a marked dose-dependent reduction in the subsequent activation of PKD elicited by bryostatin 1. In addition, we verified that GF I and Ro 31-8220 could also prevent PKD activation induced by PDB, in agreement with previous results (22Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In striking contrast neither GF I nor Ro 31-8220 inhibited PKD activity, induced by treatment of intact cells with either bryostatin 1 or PDB, when added directly to in vitro kinase assays at concentrations identical to those used in intact cells (Fig.7 A, lower panels). To verify that GF I does not prevent PKD stimulation induced by bryostatin 1 in vitro, cultures of COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3-PKD were lysed, and PKD was immunoprecipitated with the PA-1 antiserum. The enzyme was eluted from the immunocomplexes with the immunizing peptide, incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of PS and bryostatin 1, as indicated, followed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and scanning densitometry. As shown in Fig.7 B, addition of 3.5 μm GF I to the incubation mixture did not prevent stimulation of PKD induced by bryostatin 1 and PS. In contrast, the activity of purified PKC, measured in parallel reactions, in the presence of bryostatin 1 and PS was strikingly inhibited by the inclusion of 3.5 μm GF I, as measured in a syntide-2 phosphorylation assay (Fig. 7 B,inset). Taken together these results indicate that bryostatin 1-mediated PKD activation occurs through a PKC-dependent pathway in intact cells. Bryostatin 1 binds to and activates PKC, but its biological effects differ greatly from other PKC activators such as the tumor-promoting phorbol esters (7Kraft A.S. Smith J.B. Berkow R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1334-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 11Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol.

Albeck M. Gross O. Aurbach D. Sharon P. Sehgal S.N. Gurwith M.J. Michlin Cair H. Immunology. 1990; 70: 473-477PubMed Google Scholar). These unexplained differences prompted us to examine the regulation of PKD activity by bryostatin 1 in intact cells. The results presented here demonstrate, for the first time, that bryostatin 1 induces a striking activation of PKD in intact cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells, MEF, and in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with a PKD expression construct. Stimulation of intact cells with bryostatin 1 leads to the persistent activation of PKD which can be detected byin vitro kinase assays (as seen by autophosphorylation and syntide-2 phosphorylation) in the absence of any further lipid activators. Since the activated state of PKD induced by bryostatin 1 in intact cells is maintained during cell lysis and immunoprecipitation, it is likely that the enzyme is activated by a covalent modification. Here we demonstrate that bryostatin 1 stimulation of intact Swiss 3T3 cells markedly enhanced the incorporation of32Pi into PKD in metabolically labeled cells. The role of phosphorylation in the regulation of PKD was also suggested by treatment of bryostatin 1-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cell lysates with the protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor microcystin, which partially prevented the inactivation of PKD by endogenous protein phosphatases. The active state induced by bryostatin 1 stimulation of intact cells could be produced by an activating autophosphorylation step or bytrans-phosphorylation mediated by an upstream protein kinase, for example, bryostatin 1-sensitive PKCs. Interestingly, bryostatin 1 has been shown to induce potent activation of PKCε, as judged by translocation assays (11Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PKCε has been implicated as one of the PKC isoforms that promote PKD activation (22Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To distinguish between PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways of PKD activation we utilized inhibitors that discriminated between PKCs and PKD. We found that pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with the PKC inhibitors GF I and Ro 31-8220 before stimulation with bryostatin 1 markedly attenuates PKD activation. Importantly, neither GF I nor Ro 31-8220 inhibits PKD activity when added directly in vitro. These results strongly suggest that persistent PKD activation induced by bryostatin 1 is mediated through a PKC-dependent pathway. Further experimental work will be required to elucidate whether PKCs directly phosphorylate and activate PKD or stimulate an intermediary kinase(s) that leads to activation of PKD. Many biological responses induced by bryostatin 1 are characterized by a biphasic dose-response relationship, with a typical maximum effect occurring at ∼10 nm, and suppression of phorbol ester-induced effects at higher concentrations. These include stimulation of growth of JB6 cells (13Kraft A.S. Reeves J.A. Ashendel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8437-8442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sensitization of human cervical carcinoma cells to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (14Basu A. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3119-3124PubMed Google Scholar), induction of cytokine secretion in mononuclear cells (15Sredni B. Kalechman Y. Albeck M. Gross O. Aurbach D. Sharon P. Sehgal S.N. Gurwith M.J. Michlin Cair H. Immunology. 1990; 70: 473-477PubMed Google Scholar), and induction of c-Jun protein in NIH 3T3 cells (11Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying these biphasic biological effects of bryostatin 1 remain poorly understood. A salient feature of the results presented here is that the dose-dependent activation of PKD induced by bryostatin 1 in Swiss 3T3 cells or MEF is clearly biphasic and reflects the biphasic pattern of PKD phosphorylation induced by bryostatin 1. Furthermore, bryostatin 1, at high concentrations (e.g.. 100 nm) reduced PKD activation in response to PDB to the same level achieved by treatment with bryostatin 1 alone. Interestingly, the biphasic activation of PKD in response to bryostatin 1 precedes most other biphasic biological responses induced by bryostatin 1. Our results, therefore, raise the intriguing possibility that at least some of the biphasic biological effects induced by bryostatin 1 in a variety of systems could be mediated via activated PKD, a proposition that warrants further experimental work."
https://openalex.org/W2065529156,"We have recently cloned from 3T3-L1 adipocytes a novel glycogen-targeting subunit of protein phosphatase-1, termed PTG (Printen, J. A., Brady, M. J., and Saltiel, A. R. (1997)Science 275, 1475–1478). Differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into highly insulin-responsive adipocytes resulted in a marked increase in PTG expression. Immobilized glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-PTG fusion protein specifically bound either PP1 or phosphorylase a. Addition of soluble GST-PTG to 3T3-L1 lysates increased PP1 activity against32P-labeled phosphorylase a by decreasing theK m of PP1 for phosphorylase 5-fold, while having no effect on the V max of the dephosphorylation reaction. Alternatively, PTG did not affect PP1 activity against hormone-sensitive lipase. PTG was not a direct target of intracellular signaling, as insulin or forskolin treatment of cells did not activate a kinase capable of phosphorylating PTG in vivo or in vitro. Finally, PTG decreased the ability of DARPP-32 to inhibit PP1 activity from 3T3-L1 adipocyte lysates. These data cumulatively suggest that PTG increases PP1 activity against specific proteins by several distinct mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2325481036,"We demonstrate in this paper that CDK4 which is a G1 phase specific cell cycle regulator and catalytic subunit of D-type cyclins has oncogenic activity similar to D-type cyclins themselves and is able to provoke focus formation when cotransfected with activated Ha-ras into primary rat embryo fibroblasts. Surprisingly, using two different mutants we show that CDK4's ability to bind to p16INK4a and not its kinase activity is important for its transforming potential. In addition, p16INK4a but not a mutant form that is found in human tumours can completely abrogate focus formation by CDK4 suggesting that CDK4 can malignantly transform cells by sequestering p16INK4a or other CKIs. We demonstrate that both cyclin D1 and CDK4 functionally depend on active Myc to exert their potential as oncogenes and vice versa that the transforming ability of Myc requires functional cyclin D/CDK complexes. Moreover, we find that p16INK4a and the Rb related protein p107 which releases Myc after phosphorylation by cyclin D1/CDK4 efficiently block Myc's activity as a transcriptional transactivator and as an oncogene. We conclude that both p16INK4a and cyclin D/CDK4 complexes are upstream regulators of Myc and directly govern Myc function in transcriptional transactivation and transformation via the pocket protein p107."

Freeze-fractured vesicles reconstituted with purified spinachb 6 f featured particles 83 Å in diameter and 110 Å in height, which Mörschel and Staehelin interpreted as dimers (8Mörschel E.

International Congress on Electron Microscopy, Electron Microscopy 1994, Les Editions de Physique. 1994; 3: 609-610Google Scholar) obtained tubular crystals and two types of thin three-dimensional crystals of spinachb 6 f. The projection map that was calculated did not give unambiguous limits of the molecule. Thus, these studies have not led so far to a clear description of the size and shape of the complex. Most interestingly, the structure of the cleaved extramembrane domain of turnip cytochrome f (10Martinez S.E. Huang D. Szczepaniak A. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and that of the catalytic domain of the mitochondrial Rieske protein (11Iwata S. Saynovits M. Link T.A. Michel H. Structure. 1996; 4: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) have both been solved to high resolution by x-ray crystallography. On the basis of these data, Link and Iwata have proposed a model for the association of cytochrome f with the photosynthetic Rieske protein (12Link T.A. Iwata S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography is expected to lead rapidly to a detailed structural model of the entire mitochondrial bc 1complex (13Yu C.-A. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Yu L. Xia D. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, due to the important differences between the two complexes (different subunit compositions, low sequence similarities of homologous subunits, presence of photosynthetic pigments inb 6 f, sensitivity to antimycin limited to bc 1, and possible functional differences), high resolution structural data on one complex might not be easily transposable to the other. Understanding the functional mechanism of cytochromeb 6 f hangs on the knowledge of its detailed structure. Growing well ordered two-dimensional crystals suitable for analysis by electron crystallography is one approach toward determining the structure of proteins at high resolution (14Unwin P.N.T.

The yield, purity, and stability of theb 6 f preparations from C. reinhardtii (2Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol.

(1997)J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar, 16Pierre, Y., Breyton, C., Lemoine, Y., Robert, B., Vernotte, C. & Popot, J.-L. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar). In the present article, we describe the crystallization of theb 6 f complex from C. reinhardtii in very thin three-dimensional crystals. For this purpose, we have adapted and improved a reconstitution strategy that uses Bio-Beads as a detergent-removing agent and has been demonstrated successful for two-dimensional crystallization of different membrane proteins (17Rigaud J.-L. Mosser G. Lacapère J.-J. Olofsson A. Lévy D. Ranck J.-L. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Optimizing the pre-reconstitution conditions and combining the use of Bio-Beads with freeze-thaw cycles led to the formation of large and highly ordered thin three-dimensional crystals that diffract to better than 10 Å resolution in negative stain. After correction of lattice distortions, crystallographic analysis has yielded a projection map of cytochromeb 6 f at 8 Å resolution. The map is discussed in the light of available evidence on the organization of the subunits in the complex. SM2 Bio-Beads were obtained from Bio-Rad and di-C18:1-phosphatidylglycerol from Avanti Polars Lipids Inc. Sources for the other chemicals have been described in Ref. 2Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D.

Cytochromeb 6 f complex was purified fromC. reinhardtii thylakoid membranes in the presence of 6-O-(N-heptylcarbamoyl)-methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (Hecameg) 1The abbreviations used are: Hecameg, (6-O-(N-heptylcarbamoyl)-methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside; Tricine,N-(2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl)glycine (N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine). as described previously (2Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purification protocol comprises three steps: selective solubilization from thylakoid membranes, sucrose gradient sedimentation, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. Following solubilization, all media are supplemented with egg phosphatidylcholine to prevent the loss of the Rieske protein from the complex that follows delipidation (2Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 6Breyton, C., Tribet, C., Olive, J., Dubacq, J.-P. & Popot, J.-L. (1997)J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar). Purified cytochromeb 6 f complex was resuspended in 20 mm Hecameg, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.3% glycerol, 0.3 mm NaN3, 5.6 mmε-aminocaproic acid, 1.1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 245 mmammonium phosphate, 6.8 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, and supplemented with a mixture of egg phosphatidylcholine and di-C18:1-phosphatidylglycerol (1:1 to 1.4:1, w/w). The protein concentration in the final reconstitution mixture was adjusted to 0.5 g/liter and that of the lipid to a lipid/protein ratio of 0.2 w/w. The samples were preincubated overnight in the cold room under gentle stirring and subsequently treated with 200 g/liter SM2 Bio-Beads according to the batch procedure previously described (17Rigaud J.-L. Mosser G. Lacapère J.-J. Olofsson A. Lévy D. Ranck J.-L. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). After 6–12 h of incubation with beads, the reconstituted material was pipetted off and kept for 24 h at 4 °C before three cycles of freezing (−190 °C) and thawing (37 °C). Aliquots were taken daily and examined by electron microscopy. Samples, negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate, were observed on a Philips CM120 transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV. Low dose electron micrographs were recorded at magnifications of 45,000× and 60,000×. The best images were selected by optical diffraction, and areas exhibiting strong coherent diffraction spots were digitized on a Leafscan 45 CCD-array microdensitometer with a 5 μm scan spot size. Areas ranging up to 3200 × 3200 pixels in size, corresponding to 0.34 × 0.34 μm at the specimen level, were subjected to analysis using the Spectra program package (18Schmid M.F. Dargahi R. Tam M.W. Ultramicroscopy. 1993; 48: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the MRC image processing system (19Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). A total of 14 crystalline areas from nine images were analyzed with unbending methods. The underfocus level was determined by multiple measurements on the Thon-rings from the Fourier transform of the raw image, and the reflections corrected for the overall transfer function. The reflections from the processed images were centered and averaged, utilizing spots up to IQ 7. An image scale factor and the reflection peak height were used as a weighing factor during averaging. A refinement step on the positions of the zeroes in the contrast transfer function was performed, using the preliminary average as a reference. An optimal position of the lattice extraction, centered around the best crystalline area of each image, was achieved by extracting a few sets of reflections and testing for phase quality. The data set was phase-minimized with a small step size and merged, in several rounds, to yield a new average. A cut-off selection of maximally 45 ° phase deviation from the real values, in addition to IQ 7 for the amplitudes, was applied for acceptance of a reflection prior to calculation of the map. An error weighing factor was included by multiplying the amplitudes by the cosine of the phase deviation. The symmetry was imposed, and the projection map was displayed using histogram equalization and the plot program Pluto. Equidistant line levels were generally employed to the maximum positive density (i.e. stain-excluding region) in the map. Thin three-dimensional crystallization of cytochrome b 6 f was achieved by reconstituting the solubilized complex into phospholipid bilayers containing egg phosphatidylcholine and an anionic unsaturated phospholipid, dioleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol, in the presence of calcium ions and protease inhibitors. Reconstitution was performed by removing detergent from the lipid-Hecameg-protein micellar solution by adsorption onto Bio-Beads SM2. Previous systematic studies have determined precisely the amount of beads to be added to remove the detergent initially present in about 6 h at 4 °C while avoiding protein adsorption and limiting lipid adsorption (17Rigaud J.-L. Mosser G. Lacapère J.-J. Olofsson A. Lévy D. Ranck J.-L. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Provided the amount of beads was carefully controlled, as well as the lipid to protein ratio, crystallization of cytochromeb 6 f was reproducible. Another important parameter was the duration of the preincubation period before detergent removal, which had to be sufficiently long. Although the reason for this requirement is not definitely identified, it may be related to the time needed for full equilibration of the initial populations of detergent-lipid and detergent-lipid-protein micelles. Finally, the presence of calcium was found to be essential for crystal formation. Following detergent removal, proteoliposomes with densely packed proteins were observed by electron microscopy. They tended to aggregate upon further incubation at 4 °C with concomittant formation of crystalline areas. Growth of large crystals from these aggregates was improved by treating the samples through freeze-thaw cycles. Possible explanations would be that such a treatment not only induces fusion of proteoliposomes but also creates some defects in the bilayer or some protein aggregation, which would favor crystal growth (20Young H.S. Rigaud J.-L. Lacapère J.-L. Stokes D.L. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2545-2558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Samples were periodically checked by electron microscopy to monitor the growth of the crystals. The crystals presented a smooth homogeneous and continuous gray appearance (Fig.1 A) and were always composed of a stack of lamellae. The best time to collect them was generally between the third and the seventh day after three freeze-thaw cycles. After that, the crystals increased inhomogeneously in thickness and sometimes started to deteriorate. Our belief that the crystals observed in the reconstituted preparations are formed by the b 6 f in its native state is based on several lines of evidence. Neither visible absorption spectra nor SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns changed during the 3-day to 1-week period required for crystallization. Two good indices of the native state of the complex are its dimeric nature and the stability of the spectrum of theb 6 f-associated chlorophylla; indeed, loss of the Rieske protein, which is the first step in the degradation of the complex (6Breyton, C., Tribet, C., Olive, J., Dubacq, J.-P. & Popot, J.-L. (1997)J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar), is always accompanied by a red shift of the visible absorption peak of the chlorophyll (16Pierre, Y., Breyton, C., Lemoine, Y., Robert, B., Vernotte, C. & Popot, J.-L. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar) and almost invariably followed by monomerization (6Breyton, C., Tribet, C., Olive, J., Dubacq, J.-P. & Popot, J.-L. (1997)J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar). The crystals (Fig.1 A) generally grew up to 5 μm in one direction (along theb direction) and up to 1.5 μm in the other (along thea direction). In some cases, they reached up to 10 μm ′ 3 μm. At high magnification, the array appeared clearly and spread over the whole crystal (Fig. 1 B). Although the crystals presented in this study are actually stacks of lamellae, they were selected such that they presented a small number of layers and were of extremely good crystallinity. The coherence of the lattice was confirmed by optical diffraction analysis of low dose negatives, which revealed sharp, coherent peaks out to 10 Å over the whole electron micrographs. This also strongly suggests that the different layers are in perfect register, making the stacks equivalent to very thin three-dimensional crystals. The diffraction pattern corresponded to a rectangular lattice with parameters a = 175 Å, b = 68 Å, and γ = 90 °. Systematic extinctions were observed for [h(odd),0] and [0,k(odd)]. Fourteen areas were selected by optical diffraction from nine of the best images and digitized, and the lattice distortions were corrected. Calculated phases indicated that the crystals belonged to plane groupp22 1 2 1. In this space group, rows of molecules alternatively face up and down with respect to the membrane plane. The results of the R value test for this symmetry are shown in Table I for four resolution ranges, indicating the high quality of the phases to 8 Å resolution.Table ICrystallographic dataPlane group symmetryp22121No. crystals9No. images14Unit cell parametersa = 175 Å, b = 68 Å, γ = 90 °Underfocus level1800–5500 ÅNo. unit cells averaged104No. reflections used in the map223Resolution rangeTwo-fold residual IQ 5 (45 degrees random)CompletnessUnweightedAmplitude-weightedIQ 5IQ 6Å % 175–209.64.2100.0100.0 20–1514.711.994.194.1 15–1118.315.477.8100.1 11–817.915.839.184.1Total range 175–815.47.865.191.8 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 A shows the Fourier transform of the best distortion-corrected images.

Because plane groupp22 1 2 1 gave the best phase residual, it was used to calculate projection maps to 20 and 8 Å resolution (Fig. 3, A andB).Figure 3Projection maps after symmetry averaging (p22 1 2 1) of negatively stained cytochrome b 6 f.

The dimer features an elongated S shape, ∼88 Å long and ∼53 Å wide. The monomer has a C-like shape with two major domains denoted X and Y. The 8 Å resolution map reveals within the extramembrane part of each monomer a ring of densities surrounding a deep groove (G). The external diameter of the monomer is ∼53 Å, whereas the internal groove is ∼14 Å long and ∼9 Å wide. The main goal of this study was to generate a projection map of cytochrome b 6 f to provide information about the localization of its different subunits. The purity and reproducibility of theb 6 f preparations from C. reinhardtii facilitated the identification of conditions favoring the growth of large and coherent thin three-dimensional crystals suitable for structural analysis by electron microscopy. In addition to the usual parameters that affect the formation and quality of crystals, we believe that two key factors in the success of our procedure are the rapid and total removal of detergent by Bio-Beads (see also Ref. 17Rigaud J.-L. Mosser G. Lacapère J.-J. Olofsson A. Lévy D. Ranck J.-L. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and the use of freeze-thaw cycles to increase the size and ordering of the crystals (see also Ref. 20Young H.S. Rigaud J.-L. Lacapère J.-L. Stokes D.L. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2545-2558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The excellent quality of the crystals allowed us to record low dose images of negatively stained specimens that diffracted out to 10 Å resolution prior to the correction of lattice distortions and to better than 8 Å following it. The IQ plot of reflection intensities (Fig.2 A) and the crowding of calculated phases around the values of 0 ° and 180 ° expected from thep22 1 2 1 lattice symmetry (Fig. 2 B) are indicative of the quality of the data. Such a high resolution has never been reported before for negatively stained crystals of any membrane protein. The multi-layered nature of the crystals cannot by itself account for this result, because similar resolutions have already been observed with negatively stained single-layered crystals such as those of annexin V (21Olofsson A. Mallouh V. Brisson A. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 113: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and of subunit B of cholera toxin. 2G. Mosser, unpublished observations. Thus, our observations suggest that the resolution attainable following negative staining may be higher than usually accepted (∼15 Å). The projection maps show a dimeric organization of cytochromeb 6 f, in keeping with biochemical determinations on the solubilized complex (6Breyton, C., Tribet, C., Olive, J., Dubacq, J.-P. & Popot, J.-L. (1997)J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar). Each monomer presents a C-like shape, ∼53 Å in diameter, covering a total area of about 2,000 Å2. By comparison with the dimensions of the transmembrane regions in bacteriorhodopsin (14Unwin P.N.T. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) or cytochromec oxidase (22Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar), this area significantly exceeds that needed to accommodate 11 transmembrane α-helices per monomer. In the 20 Å projection map, each monomer features two main domains (labeledX and Y in Fig. 3), surrounding a deep central groove (G in Fig. 3). Domain X, which is near the 2-fold axis of symmetry, is less bulky than domain Y, suggesting that much of the extramembrane mass of the complex lies away from this axis. The dimensions and overall appearance of cytochromeb 6 f at 20 Å resolution are not dissimilar to those of the subcomplex of Neurospora crassacytochromes b and c 1 (lacking the Rieske and core proteins), except that in the latter case domain X appeared stronger than domain Y (23Hovmöller S. Leonard K. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), at variance with theb 6 f map. A three-dimensional reconstruction of bovine heart mitochondrial bc 1at 16 Å resolution has recently been calculated from electron micrographs of frozen tubes (24Akiba T. Toyoshima C. Matsunaga T. Kawamoto M. Kubota T. Fukuyama K. Namba K. Matsuhara H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It shows, protruding into the intermembrane space, four proteic masses per dimer, reaching into the solvent and delineating a relatively empty space around the 2-fold axis of symmetry. A depression about the C2 axis is also apparent in the preliminary x-ray map of beef heart bc 1(13Yu C.-A. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Yu L. Xia D. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The projection of the monomer obtained does not resemble any of the three possible projections (Y, Z, and L shapes) previously observed with spinach b 6 f (9Mosser G. Dorr C. Hauska G. Kühlbrandt W. International Congress on Electron Microscopy, Electron Microscopy 1994, Les Editions de Physique. 1994; 3: 609-610Google Scholar). Differences in the conditions of crystal formation may explain these dissimilarities. Whereas low calcium concentration (0.5 mm), Hecameg, and Bio-Beads were used to crystallize the complex from C. reinhardtii, comparatively high calcium concentration (10 mm), octylglucoside, and dialysis were employed for the crystallization of the spinach complex. These differences may have led to the monomerization of the complex from spinach, explaining why no tight dimers were observed. The location of the stain in the case of membrane proteins is not perfectly understood. It seems to vary from one protein to another, but it is usually accepted that the hydrophobic membrane core is largely stain-excluding. Therefore, we made the assumption that the structural information obtained, including the presence of the groove, primarily concerns the extramembrane parts of theb 6 f complex. Positive densities should be due mainly to the cytochrome f extramembrane domain (28 kDa; residues 1–250), the Rieske protein (19 kDa), the main loops of cytochrome b 6 (11 kDa; residues 1–33, 58–82, and 140–181) and subunit IV (8 kDa; residues 215–249 and 272–308), and the extramembrane extensions of the three 4-kDa subunits (∼1 kDa each). However, because of the smallness of 4-kDa subunits' extramembrane extensions, their contribution to the projection map will not be discussed in the following. The projection map at 8 Å resolution (Fig. 3 A) confirms the C shape of the monomer. Each monomer features four domains of variable importance (II > I ≫ III > IV), which can be tentatively allocated to some of theb 6 f subunits. The two major stain-excluding regions, I and II, are well individualized, indicating that they correspond to two independent proteic masses. Taking into account their respective importance (II > I) and the fact that the extramembrane part of cytochrome f and the Rieske protein fold into autonomous domains, one may tentatively assign density II to the largest of these subunits, the cytochromef, whereas domain I would correspond to the Rieske protein. The other densities (domains III and IV), which include that close to the 2-fold symmetry axis, would be due to the extramembrane loops of cytochrome b 6 and subunit IV. However, in this case, because the mass of the loops is small compared with the whole mass of these two subunits, it would be premature to assign individual subunits to specific features at this stage of the structural study. Domain IV appears to be separated from domain III by a gap and appears to connect more closely to domain I. This suggests that the extramembrane regions of the two monomers may partially engage into one another close to the symmetry axis, as proposed in Fig.4. Moreover, the continuity observed between the two densities IV of the dimer suggests that the subunits that contribute to it tightly interact through their extramembrane parts. It should also be stressed that domain IV appears small to fit either subunit IV or cytochrome b 6. However, this domain is rather flat, and it is reasonable to assume that the subunit that contributes to it may extend under the Rieske protein while contributing in a negligible way to domain I. This general arrangement would be consistent with biochemical data that have shown that cytochrome b 6 can be easily cross-linked to cytochrome b 6 and subunit IV to subunit IV within a dimer, indicating that regions of both subunits come close to the symmetry axis (25Chain R.K. Malkin R. Photosynth. Res. 1991; 28: 59-68PubMed Google Scholar, 26Vater J. Heinze K. Friedrich B. Kablitz B. Blokesch A. Irrgang K.-D. Thiede B. Salnikow J. Ber. Busenges. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 2107-2111Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). On the contrary, homologous cross-linking between the large extramembrane domains is almost never observed. The effects of mutations on the functionality and sensitivity to inhibitors of site Qo (reviewed in Ref. 27Brasseur G. Saribas G.S. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and on the strength of the Rieske protein's association with the complex (27Brasseur G. Saribas G.S. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28Finazzi G. Büschlen S. de Vitry C. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Wollman F.-A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2867-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) suggest that at least part of the second (c-d) extramembrane loop of cytochrome b 6 and of the first loop of subunit IV is located close to the Rieske protein. The allocation of the Rieske protein to density I and of parts of cytochrome b 6 and subunit IV to less intense features near the monomer-monomer interface would imply that site Qo, which is formed by these three subunits, might lie relatively close to the 2-fold axis of the dimer. Such a location would be consistent with the close apposition of the twob L hemes in the bc 1dimer, as revealed by x-ray diffraction (13Yu C.-A. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Yu L. Xia D. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The relative proximity of the two Qo sites and the two b Lhemes within the bc 1 andb 6 ƒ dimers opens up interesting vistas regarding the possibility of a functional cooperation between the two monomers (cf. Ref. 13Yu C.-A. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Yu L. Xia D. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is also worth noting that removal of the Rieske protein is generally, even though not always, accompanied by the monomerization of the complex and vice versa (6Breyton, C., Tribet, C., Olive, J., Dubacq, J.-P. & Popot, J.-L. (1997)J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar). The proposed positioning of the Rieske protein close to the monomer-monomer interface suggests a possible origin for the frequent correlation between these two events: destabilization could result from the loss of interactions between the Rieske protein of one monomer and neighboring subunit(s) of its partner. In conclusion, our results provide the first crystallographic information on the structure of the cytochromeb 6 f complex in its intact form. The 8 Å projection map of the enzyme has permitted proposals to be made regarding the location cytochrome f and the Rieske protein in the b 6 f dimer. In future work, subunit assignment will be further examined using the same approach to crystallization associated with labeling methods or with the removal of specific subunits (cf. Ref. 6Breyton, C., Tribet, C., Olive, J., Dubacq, J.-P. & Popot, J.-L. (1997)J. Biol. Chem., 272, in press.Google Scholar). Obtaining highly ordered crystals opens the way to the determination of a three-dimensional model of cytochrome b 6 f using cryo-electron microscopy. Establishing a three-dimensional model of the complex, although facing the problem of analyzing multilayered crystals, can be attempted by appropriate treatment of the crystallographic data and/or by modifications of the crystallization protocol favoring the growth of monolayered crystals. It should be stressed that even a moderate resolution three-dimensional map would be extremely useful in helping to delineate structural differences between the bc 1 andb 6 f complexes. We are extremely grateful to D. Picot (Institut de Biologie Physico Chimigue, Paris) for useful discussions."

A precise intracellular cation composition is of vital importance for cell homeostasis and function. The maintenance of high K+ and low Na+ concentrations, characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, is critically dependent on Na+,K+-ATPase (1Jörgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 36-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 2Skou J. Esmann M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 249-261PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular Na+ concentration is such that Na+,K+-ATPase is not saturated with regard to this substrate. Therefore, Na+,K+-ATPase activity is dependent on the activity of the Na+ influx (leak) pathway (3Turnheim K. Physiol. Res. 1994; 43: 211-218PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason the pump has often been considered to have a passive role in the regulation of cellular Na+and K+ homeostasis (4Jörgensen P.L. Kidney Int. 1986; 29: 10-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that Na+,K+-ATPase activity can be regulated by hormones, second messengers, protein kinase A (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; AM, acetoxymethyl; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SBFI, Na+-binding benzofuran isophthalate; Na+ i, intracellular Na+ concentration; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger. 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; AM, acetoxymethyl; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SBFI, Na+-binding benzofuran isophthalate; Na+ i, intracellular Na+ concentration; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger. and protein kinase C (PKC) (5Aperia A.

In this study Ser-23 was mutated to alanine and the functional consequences examined in intact cells.DISCUSSIONAll mammalian cells are characterized by low Na+ i and a high Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane that is generated by vectorial transport of Na+ mediated by Na+,K+-ATPase. Since the coupling ratio for outward Na+ transport and inward K+ transport is 3:2, Na+,K+-ATPase activity also generates a difference in membrane potential. The Na+,K+-ATPase-dependent electrochemical gradient is necessary for many vital cell functions, and total inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase results in cell death (2Skou J. Esmann M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 249-261PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Na+ i is generally too low to saturate Na+,K+-ATPase (Refs. 21Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 22Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and this study), and the activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase is dependent on Na+ i . Since the affinity for Na+ of the various subunits appears to vary, Na+ i concentration is also expected to be dependent on which isoform(s) a given cell type expresses (21Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Munzer J.S. Daly S.E. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the present study indicate that other mechanisms are also involved in the regulation of Na+ i . Thus we have shown using a variety of methods that cells transfected with S23A Na+,K+-ATPase α1 subunit were no longer able to respond to PKC activation with the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis, decrease in Rb+ uptake, and increase in Na+ i exhibited by cells expressing wild type rat Na+,K+-ATPase. These results highlight the significance of phosphorylation of Ser-23 of rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1 subunit in response to activation of PKC in intact cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that this regulatory phosphorylation site may play a direct role in modulating basal Na+ i, as well as an indirect role in modulating intracellular pH and other cellular phenotypes.Many pumps and other ion transporters are involved in the regulation of Na+ i and pH. The results of the present study illustrate that it is important not only to consider the regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase, but also its impact on other Na+-coupled transporters such as the NHE (Fig. 5). Activation of PKC stimulates NHE, resulting in an increase of intracellular pH (24Dhanasekaran N. Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Wadsworth S.J. Dermott J.M. van Rossum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11802-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and presumably an increase of Na+ influx (Fig. 5, A–D). Our results suggest that in cells expressing wild type rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1, activation of PKC also inhibits the activity of Na+,K+-ATPase (Fig. 5,A and B). At early time points (<5 min, Fig.5 A), it appears that any increase in Na+ influx mediated by stimulation of NHE is compensated for by increased Na+ i -dependent Na+,K+-ATPase activity. However, at later time points (>5 min, Fig. 5 B) the combined effects of PKC on stimulation of Na+ entry and inhibition of Na+exit pathways results in a measurable increase in Na+ i (Fig. 5 B). This increase in Na+ i appears ultimately to create such an unfavorable Na+ gradient that down-regulates NHE activity, resulting in the transient nature of the pH increase observed. In cells expressing S23A Na+,K+-ATPase, PKC activation will lead only to activation of NHE (Fig. 5, C andD). In these cells, as observed at early time points in cells expressing wild type Na+,K+-ATPase, any increase in Na+ i mediated by stimulation of NHE is compensated for by increased Na+,K+-ATPase activity (Fig. 5 C). The observation that PDBu stimulated86Rb+ uptake in cells expressing S23A Na+,K+-ATPase, which was measured in intact cells with low, nonsaturating Na+ concentration, is consistent with this conclusion. Moreover, in cells expressing S23A Na+,K+-ATPase, the increased pH induced by PDBu does not return to the basal level, because Na+ i does not increase to a level sufficient to inhibit NHE (Fig.5 D). The regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity by phosphorylation of Ser-23 also appears to influence the basal ionic status of cells. Presumably because of a basal PKC activity, basal Na+ i is higher in cells expressing wild type rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1. Furthermore, most likely because of the relationship between the NHE leak and the Na+,K+-ATPase pump activity, the basal intracellular pH is lower in cells expressing wild type enzyme.Since mutation of S23A of rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1 altered such important parameters as the concentration of Na+ i and pH, it might also influence the phenotype of the cell in other ways. Such an effect was indeed observed, in that the shape of the cells expressing S23A Na+,K+-ATPase indicated that the attachment to substrate was perturbed. Furthermore, the ability of these cells to attach and spread on fibronectin was impaired. As cell attachment to this protein is mediated by integrins (27Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar, 28Giancotti F.G Maniero F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 47-64PubMed Google Scholar), this raises the possibility of a change in the expression and/or function of integrins. The relationship between this phenomenon and the resetting of Na+ i and pH will be a topic for future studies. Notably, an increase in intracellular pH following overexpression of a H+-ATPase has previously been shown to lead to a change in cell shape (29Perona R. Serrano R.

In the rat renal tubule, Na+,K+-ATPase is inhibited by several natriuretic hormones, the effect of which may be mediated via PKC (31Kansra V. Chen C. Lokhandwala M.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By inhibiting the activity of Na+,K+-ATPase they should increase Na+ i and thereby decrease the transcellular driving force for Na+. This may explain why these hormones inhibit Na+ reabsorption in the renal tubules. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate the importance of PKC in the regulation of rat α1 Na+,K+-ATPase and suggest that regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation plays an important role in cell and body Na+ homeostasis. A precise intracellular cation composition is of vital importance for cell homeostasis and function. The maintenance of high K+ and low Na+ concentrations, characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, is critically dependent on Na+,K+-ATPase (1Jörgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 36-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 2Skou J. Esmann M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 249-261PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular Na+ concentration is such that Na+,K+-ATPase is not saturated with regard to this substrate. Therefore, Na+,K+-ATPase activity is dependent on the activity of the Na+ influx (leak) pathway (3Turnheim K. Physiol. Res. 1994; 43: 211-218PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason the pump has often been considered to have a passive role in the regulation of cellular Na+and K+ homeostasis (4Jörgensen P.L. Kidney Int. 1986; 29: 10-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that Na+,K+-ATPase activity can be regulated by hormones, second messengers, protein kinase A (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; AM, acetoxymethyl; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SBFI, Na+-binding benzofuran isophthalate; Na+ i, intracellular Na+ concentration; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger. 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; AM, acetoxymethyl; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SBFI, Na+-binding benzofuran isophthalate; Na+ i, intracellular Na+ concentration; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger. and protein kinase C (PKC) (5Aperia A.

Together, these various results suggest that the response of Na+,K+-ATPase to altered ion levels is hormonally modulated allowing for greater versatility in the regulation of cellular homeostasis. Serine 23 has recently been identified as the major PKC phosphorylation site in rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1 (9Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14072-14077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Logvinenko N.S. Dulubova I. Fedosova N. Larsson S.H. Nairn A.C. Esmann M. Greengard P. Aperia A.

DISCUSSIONAll mammalian cells are characterized by low Na+ i and a high Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane that is generated by vectorial transport of Na+ mediated by Na+,K+-ATPase. Since the coupling ratio for outward Na+ transport and inward K+ transport is 3:2, Na+,K+-ATPase activity also generates a difference in membrane potential. The Na+,K+-ATPase-dependent electrochemical gradient is necessary for many vital cell functions, and total inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase results in cell death (2Skou J. Esmann M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 249-261PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Na+ i is generally too low to saturate Na+,K+-ATPase (Refs. 21Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 22Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and this study), and the activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase is dependent on Na+ i . Since the affinity for Na+ of the various subunits appears to vary, Na+ i concentration is also expected to be dependent on which isoform(s) a given cell type expresses (21Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the present study indicate that other mechanisms are also involved in the regulation of Na+ i . Thus we have shown using a variety of methods that cells transfected with S23A Na+,K+-ATPase α1 subunit were no longer able to respond to PKC activation with the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis, decrease in Rb+ uptake, and increase in Na+ i exhibited by cells expressing wild type rat Na+,K+-ATPase. These results highlight the significance of phosphorylation of Ser-23 of rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1 subunit in response to activation of PKC in intact cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that this regulatory phosphorylation site may play a direct role in modulating basal Na+ i, as well as an indirect role in modulating intracellular pH and other cellular phenotypes.Many pumps and other ion transporters are involved in the regulation of Na+ i and pH. The results of the present study illustrate that it is important not only to consider the regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase, but also its impact on other Na+-coupled transporters such as the NHE (Fig. 5). Activation of PKC stimulates NHE, resulting in an increase of intracellular pH (24Dhanasekaran N. Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Wadsworth S.J. Dermott J.M. van Rossum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11802-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and presumably an increase of Na+ influx (Fig. 5, A–D). Our results suggest that in cells expressing wild type rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1, activation of PKC also inhibits the activity of Na+,K+-ATPase (Fig. 5,A and B). At early time points (<5 min, Fig.5 A), it appears that any increase in Na+ influx mediated by stimulation of NHE is compensated for by increased Na+ i -dependent Na+,K+-ATPase activity. However, at later time points (>5 min, Fig. 5 B) the combined effects of PKC on stimulation of Na+ entry and inhibition of Na+exit pathways results in a measurable increase in Na+ i (Fig. 5 B). This increase in Na+ i appears ultimately to create such an unfavorable Na+ gradient that down-regulates NHE activity, resulting in the transient nature of the pH increase observed. In cells expressing S23A Na+,K+-ATPase, PKC activation will lead only to activation of NHE (Fig. 5, C andD). In these cells, as observed at early time points in cells expressing wild type Na+,K+-ATPase, any increase in Na+ i mediated by stimulation of NHE is compensated for by increased Na+,K+-ATPase activity (Fig. 5 C). The observation that PDBu stimulated86Rb+ uptake in cells expressing S23A Na+,K+-ATPase, which was measured in intact cells with low, nonsaturating Na+ concentration, is consistent with this conclusion. Moreover, in cells expressing S23A Na+,K+-ATPase, the increased pH induced by PDBu does not return to the basal level, because Na+ i does not increase to a level sufficient to inhibit NHE (Fig.5 D). The regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity by phosphorylation of Ser-23 also appears to influence the basal ionic status of cells. Presumably because of a basal PKC activity, basal Na+ i is higher in cells expressing wild type rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1. Furthermore, most likely because of the relationship between the NHE leak and the Na+,K+-ATPase pump activity, the basal intracellular pH is lower in cells expressing wild type enzyme.Since mutation of S23A of rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1 altered such important parameters as the concentration of Na+ i and pH, it might also influence the phenotype of the cell in other ways. Such an effect was indeed observed, in that the shape of the cells expressing S23A Na+,K+-ATPase indicated that the attachment to substrate was perturbed. Furthermore, the ability of these cells to attach and spread on fibronectin was impaired. As cell attachment to this protein is mediated by integrins (27Ruoslahti E. J. Clin.

Granzyme A-deficient CTL have a small but reproducible defect in their ability to induce 51Cr and125I-UdR release from susceptible allogeneic target cells. Since other granzyme A-like tryptases could potentially account for the residual cytotoxicity in granzyme A-deficient CTL, we cloned the murine granzyme K gene, which is linked to granzyme A in humans, and proved that it is also tightly linked with murine granzyme A. The murine granzyme K gene (which encodes a tryptase similar to granzyme A) is expressed at much lower levels than granzyme A in CTL and LAK cells, but its expression is unaltered in granzyme A−/− mice.

Perforin is thought to produce channels in the target cell membrane through which the granzymes pass; in the target cell, granzymes are thought to cleave and activate critical substrates, thereby initiating the apoptotic program of the cell.

Except for granzyme B, which is required for the rapid induction of target cell apoptosis during CTL attack (30Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 31Shresta S. MacIvor D.M. Heusel J.W. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 1996; 87: 1232-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the precise functions of the other granzymes are not yet known. Granzymes A and B are the most abundantly expressed granzymes found in CTL stimulated with a wide variety of activation protocols. Granzyme A is a tryptase (which cleaves after lysine or arginine at the P1 position) and granzyme B is an Asp'ase (which cleaves after aspartic acid at the P1 position). The genes encoding these proteases have been mapped to two different chromosomal loci: 1) murine and human granzyme A are found on chromosome 13 and a syntenic region of human chromosome 5, respectively (23Gershenfeld H.K.

Genomics. 1993; 18: 401-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and 2) both murine and human granzyme B are found on syntenic regions of chromosome 14 (35Harper K. Mattei M.-G. Simon D. Suzan M. Guenet J.-L. Haddad P. Sasportes M. Golstein P. Immunogenetics. 1988; 28: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Hanson R.D. Hohn P.A. Popescu N.C. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1991; 266: 6152-6158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The granzyme B gene is part of a cluster of tightly linked granzymes and other serine protease genes that are specifically regulated and expressed in distinct hematopoietic cell types. The murine granzyme B locus contains granzymes B-G, cathepsin G, and MMCP-2 (and probably other mast cell chymases); the human granzyme B locus is known to contain granzymes B and H, cathepsin G, and mast cell chymase. Our laboratory has demonstrated that the insertion of PGK-Neo cassette in the murine granzyme B gene disrupts the expression of granzymes C, D, F, and G in LAK/NK cells, potentially confounding interpretations of some of the results obtained from these mice (38Pham C.T.N. MacIvor D.M. Hug B.A. Heusel J.W. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13090-13095Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Specifically, the defect observed in the ability of granzyme B−/− LAK cells to induce apoptosis of susceptible targets could be due in part to the loss of granzyme C, D, F, or G. However, CTL derived from MLR predominantly express granzymes A and B. Thus, in our studies of granzyme B−/− CTL, the defect in the rapid induction of apoptosis is most likely due to the loss of granzyme B itself. Studies of granzyme B−/− mice have revealed that CTL are equipped with a late, granzyme B-independent mechanism(s) of cytotoxicity (30Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar,31Shresta S. MacIvor D.M. Heusel J.W. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5679-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence implicate granzyme A as a potential candidate for this pathway. Specifically, 1) purified granzyme A from mouse CTL or rat NK granules induces apoptosis of detergent-permeabilized or perforin-permeabilized target cells (16Shi L. Kam C.-M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar,39Hayes M.P. Berrebi G.A. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 933-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); 2) noncytotoxic rat basophilic leukemia cells transfected with perforin and granzyme vectors induce DNA fragmentation in target cells only when they express both perforin and granzyme A or B (40Shiver J.W. Su L. Henkart P.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 315-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 41Nakajima H. Park H.H. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1037-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); and 3) granzyme A is a “late” acting protease, since NK granule-purified granzyme A induces apoptosis only after 14 h of incubation time, compared with 2 h of incubation time needed for the production of granzyme B-induced apoptosis (16Shi L. Kam C.-M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Another tryptase called granzyme K is also a candidate for granzyme B-independent cytotoxicity. The murine orthologue of human granzyme K (28Przetak M. Yoast S. Schmidt B.F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Sayers T.J. Lloyd A.R. McVicar D.W. O'Connor M.D. Kelly J.M. Carter C.R.D. Wiltrout T.A. Wiltrout R.H. Smyth M.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 763-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) has not yet been identified, but rat granzyme K has been purified and its cDNA has been cloned (16Shi L. Kam C.-M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 18Sayers T.J. Wiltrout T. Smyth M.J. Ottaway K.S. Pilaro A.M. Sowder R. Henderson L.E. Sprenger H. Lloyd A.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2289-2297PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to granzyme A, granzyme K purified from a rat large granular lymphoma cell line (RNK-16) induces apoptosis of target cells in a late 14-h cytotoxicity assay (16Shi L. Kam C.-M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Moreover, human granzymes A and K map to the same location on chromosome 5q11-q12 (42Baker E. Sayers T.J. Sutherland G.R. Smyth M.J. Immunogenetics. 1994; 40: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These data suggested that murine granzyme K is likely to exist, and that it may be located near the granzyme A gene on mouse chromosome 13. In this paper, we report the cloning of murine granzyme K and establish the tight linkage between murine granzymes A and K. We have created a null mutation of granzyme A by replacing exon 2 and a significant portion of intron 2 with a standard PGK-Hygro cassette. We have found that our granzyme A−/− mice are viable and have normal development, fertility, and hematopoiesis, similar to the mice reported by Ebnetet al. (43Ebnet K. Hausmann M. Lehmann-Grube F. Mullbacher A. Kopf M. Lamers M. Simon M.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4230-4239Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which bear a different mutation in the granzyme A gene. Expression of the granzyme K gene is not altered by the insertion of the PGK-Hygro cassette in the granzyme A locus. Granzyme A−/− CTL have only a slightly reduced ability to attack and kill allogeneic target cells, perhaps because they have an intact granzyme B cluster, and/or perhaps because they exhibit persistent expression of granzyme K (and/or D), which is also a potent tryptase. Total RNAs derived from mouse splenocytes activated with concanavalin A/IL-2 for 2 days, or from an NK-like cell line (a CD3−, NK1.1+ splenic tumor line harvested from transgenic mice expressing simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen driven by the human granzyme H promoter) 2D. MacIvor and T. J. Ley, unpublished results. were isolated using a previously described method (44Chomszynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). The first strand of cDNA was synthesized with reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random hexamer primers. Using KlenTaqLA (Wayne Barnes, Washington University, St. Louis), double-stranded cDNA templates were then PCR amplified with the following pair of primers that were derived from rat sequences and corresponded to the most conserved regions between the human and rat granzyme K cDNAs: 5′-CATTCCAGGCCTTTTATGGC-3′ and 5′-GGATCAAAAGCAAGCTTGCC-3′. A 650-bp PCR product was subcloned into the pCR 2.0 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego). The inserts were sequenced with an ABI373 automated sequencer. A 500-bp murine granzyme A probe spanning the two alternatively spliced leader exons of granzyme A was generated using PCR amplification of mouse genomic DNA. The PCR amplified probe was sequenced and tested in Southern analysis to confirm its ability to detect unique mouse granzyme A bands. This probe was then used to screen a murine BAC library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO). Four BAC clones (BAC 1254–1257) that hybridized strongly with the granzyme A fragment were obtained and subsequently tested for the presence of granzyme K gene in Southern analysis using the 650-bp murine granzyme K cDNA as the probe. One BAC clone, BAC 1255, hybridized with the granzyme K cDNA probe. DNA obtained from BAC 1255 was then digested withHindIII or PstI, and two HindIII and one PstI fragments were subcloned into pUC19 based vectors and sequenced. DNA isolated from BAC 1255 was digested with rare cutting restriction endonucleases, electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels using a CHEF DRII apparatus (Bio-Rad), transferred onto Hybond (Amersham) membranes, and probed with either the 500-bp 5′ murine granzyme A probe or a 2.0-kb murine granzyme K HindIII genomic fragment containing exons 1 and 2. The hybridizing and washing conditions of these Southern blots were performed as described previously (37Heusel J.W. Hanson R.D. Silverman G.A. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6152-6158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Murine splenocytes were activated either with concanavalin A/IL-2, or with one-way mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) as described previously (30Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Mouse spleen cells were also cultured with high dose (1000 units/ml) recombinant human IL-2 for 10 days to generate LAK cells, as described previously (31Shresta S. MacIvor D.M. Heusel J.W. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5679-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from activated lymphocytes and analyzed using an S1 nuclease protection assay, as described (45Ley T.J. Maloney K.A. Gordon J.I. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Probes specific for murine granzyme A, murine granzyme B, and murine β2-microglobulin genes were previously reported (30Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). A probe that specifically detected correctly spliced exon 4 of murine granzyme K was created using a 1.8-kbBglII genomic fragment isolated from the plasmid containing the 4.7-kb HindIII genomic fragment of granzyme K. Correctly spliced granzyme K mRNA protects a probe fragment of 119 nucleotides from S1 digestion. All probes were labeled to approximately the same specific activity. The 500-bp murine granzyme A DNA probe that spans the alternatively spliced leader exons was used to screen a 129/Sv mouse genomic library (Stratagene). A λ clone containing an 8-kb BamHI fragment containing most of the murine granzyme A gene was obtained. The 8-kb genomic fragment was subcloned into pUC9, and Southern blot and partial sequencing analyses confirmed that this DNA contained the 5′-flanking region and exons 1 through 4 of mouse granzyme A. This 8-kbBamHI fragment was used to generate the granzyme A gene targeting vector. A 2.7-kb EcoRI-HindIII region containing exon 2 of the granzyme A gene was replaced with a 1.6-kb fragment containing the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase I gene promoter (PGK-hygro (46Mortensen R.M. Zubiaur M. Neer E.J. Seidman J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7036-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)), resulting in an exon 2 deletion mutation in the granzyme A gene. The PGK-hygro cassette was inserted in the opposite transcriptional orientation from granzyme A. The completed targeting vector consisted of a 3.5-kbBamHI-EcoRI genomic fragment containing 5′-flanking sequence and leader exons upstream from PGK-hygro, and a 1.9-kb HindIII-BamHI genomic fragment including exons 3 and 4 downstream from PGK-Hygro. RW4 ES cells (derived from 129/SvJ mice) were transfected with the granzyme A targeting vector, and hygromycin-resistant clones were isolated essentially as described (30Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The resistant ES clones were screened by Southern blotting using a 327-bp 3′ external probe that was PCR amplified with primers based on published mouse granzyme A genomic sequences (47Hershberger R.J. Gershenfeld H.K. Weissman I.L. Su L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25488-25493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Ebnet K. Kramer M.D. Simon M.M. Genomics. 1992; 13: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The external probe detected a 9-kb wild-type and a 5-kb mutant allele of PstI-digested mouse genomic DNA. Two out of 110 ES clones (ES 64 and ES 144) were correctly targeted, and these two clones were further confirmed in a Southern analysis with a hygromycin phosphotransferase specific probe. C57BL/6 blastocysts were then microinjected with ES cells from each of the two targeted clones and implanted into pseudopregnant Swiss Webster foster females, as described previously (30Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Chimeric males with a high percentage of agouti color were mated with C57BL/6 females, and their offspring were examined for germline transmission of the disrupted granzyme A allele by Southern analysis using the 3′ external probe described above. ES 64 derived heterozygotes were intercrossed to produce homozygous mutant mice. Thymocytes, splenocytes, and activated splenocytes from day 5 MLRs were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against various mouse cell surface markers and analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer and CellQuest version 1.2.2 software (Becton-Dickinson), as described previously (30Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). 1 × 107 CTL were resuspended in 100 μl of 1 × Hebs buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm KCl, 0.7 mmNa2HPO4, 6.0 mm dextrose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.05) and 100 μl of 2 × lysis buffer (2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.2% Triton X-100), sonicated for 2–3 s, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 10,000 rpm to clear the supernatant from cellular debris. 20 μl of this supernatant was tested for tryptase activity using the BLT (N α-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine thiobenzyl ester) esterase (Calbiochem) activity assay as described previously (49Green G.D.J. Shaw E. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, the test sample was mixed with 200 μl of BLT substrate solution (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2 mm BLT, 0.22 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Pierce), and 0.01% Triton X-100). After the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) was added to stop the reaction. The OD410 was then measured using a Beckman DU-20 spectrophotometer. Controls included the test sample and substrate solution without BLT (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.22 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and 0.01% Triton X-100) or the BLT substrate solution alone. Standard 51Cr or125I-UdR release assays were performed exactly as described (50Russell J.H. Masakowski V. Rucinsky T. Phillips G. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 2087-2094PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the mouse homologue of human and rat granzyme K, we performed reverse transcriptase-PCR using primers based on rat cDNA sequences that corresponded to the most conserved regions between the human and rat (77% identity between human and rat granzyme K cDNAs). We amplified a 650-bp product from Con/IL-2 activated mouse splenocytes and a mouse NK-like cell line. Sequence analysis confirmed that the 650-bp fragment from each cDNA source contained a highly homologous cDNA encompassing exons 2, 3, 4, and most of 5. Fig.1 shows the deduced amino acid sequence of this cDNA. The 650-bp cDNA sequence isolated was not full-length, but the 5′ region, all of exons 1 through 5, and a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) were identified in the genomic sequence (Fig. 2).Figure 2The murine granzyme K gene.

Based on previous work, the NH2terminus of the mature, active protease is designated +1 at the isoleucine position shown in Fig. 1. The deduced amino acid sequence of murine granzyme K shares 86.0 versus 70.9% identity with the rat and human homologues, respectively. In the aligned amino acid sequences of the mouse, rat, and human granzyme K, the catalytic triad residues (His41, Asp90, and Ser188) and six of eight cysteine residues that are expected to form three internal disulfide bonds (26–42, 123–155, and 173–194) are conserved among all three species (Fig. 1). The two remaining cysteine residues (184 and 208) may form a fourth disulfide bond. The granzyme K sequence does not contain any consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation. Among the murine granzymes, granzyme K cDNA is most similar to granzyme A (53.5% identity). Granzymes A, K, and other tryptases have an aspartic acid residue at position 182 (six residues amino-terminal to the active site serine) that is thought to determine specificity for lysine or arginine in the P1 position. However, in contrast to granzyme A (which forms a 60-kDa homodimer due to an interchain bond made by the ninth cysteine) granzyme K probably acts as a monomer because it does not contain the additional cysteine residue. Therefore, the active, mature murine granzyme K protein is predicted to be a 26-kDa monomer, in keeping with the size of purified rat (16Shi L. Kam C.-M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J.

We screened a mouse BAC library derived from 129/SvJ mice using a 500-bp genomic fragment containing the alternatively spliced leader exons of mouse granzyme A, and obtained four clones (BAC 1254–1257) that hybridized with this probe. Southern analysis of DNA from the BAC clones (using probes encompassing various regions of murine granzyme A locus) confirmed the presence of the entire granzyme A genomic sequence in all four BAC clones. These clones were further examined by Southern blotting using a 650-bp murine granzyme K cDNA probe spanning exons 2 through 5; one clone, BAC 1255, hybridized strongly with this probe. A HindIII or PstI digest of BAC 1255 DNA probed with the 650-bp granzyme K cDNA probe revealed two HindIII (2.0 and 4.7 kb) and onePstI (2.2 kb) fragment that were subcloned into pUC 19 vectors. All three plasmids were completely sequenced using oligonucleotides based on the cDNA and the newly derived genomic sequences. The 2.0-kb HindIII fragment contained the 5′ region and exons 1 and 2; the 4.7-kb HindIII piece contained exons 3, 4, and most of 5; and the 2.2-kb PstI fragment included exons 4 and 5 an"
https://openalex.org/W2314037851,"H19 is a paternally imprinted gene with unknown function. It is located in close proximity to the maternally imprinted IGF-2 gene on chromosome 11p15.5. In this study no consistent relationship between the expression of these two genes in clones derived from JEG-3 and JAr cell lines could be detected. Nor could a consistent relationship be detected between the expression levels of these two genes and between certain characteristic tumorigenic properties of these clones. We included in this study clones, expressing low H19 levels, which after transfection with an H19 expression construct highly expressed the H19 gene. In tumors, formed by the injection of cells of JAr or JEG-3 clones into nude mice, the H19 expression was high and irrelevant to the expression level in the cells before the injection. The same phenomenon was found for IGF-2 expression during tumorigenesis caused by cells of different JEG-3 clones and in some but not all JAr derived clones. Both H19 and IGF-2 are biallelicly expressed in all the JAr and JEG-3 clones. In summary, our observations point to the conclusion that H19 is not a tumor suppressor gene. However, its high expression in all the tumors formed after injection of cells of the JAr and JEG-3 clones, leaves its role, if any, in choriocarcinogenesis an open question."
https://openalex.org/W2076190154,"Interleukin (IL)-13 and IL-4 are cytokine products of TH2 cells which exert similar effects in a variety of cell types. We recently described IL-13R expression on human renal cell and colon carcinoma cells and demonstrated that γc is not a component of IL-13R or IL-4R systems in these cells. In lymphoid cells such as B cells and monocytes, which respond to IL-13, γc is a component of IL-4R but does not appear to be a component of IL-13R. Furthermore, while significant IL-13 binding is observed on carcinoma cells, IL-13 barely binds these lymphoid cells and the binding characteristics are different. To better understand the role of γc in IL-13 binding and signaling, we have transfected a renal cell carcinoma cell line with γc and examined IL-13 and IL-4 binding and signaling. IL-13 binding as well as IL-13 and IL-4 signaling through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway were severely inhibited. This inhibition was paralleled by a loss of expression of one of the IL-13R chains and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1. Thus, although γchas been shown to enhance IL-4 binding and function in some cell types, its influence on IL-13R function in tumor cells appear to be largely negative.

Both cytokines mediate similar effects on B cells and monocytes; however, IL-13 has not been shown to have direct effects on T cells (1Minty A. Chalon P. Derocq J.-M. Dumont X. Guillemot J.-C.

Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The effects of both cytokines are mediated by cell surface receptors (R) that are specific for each of these ligands (4Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol.

The receptor for IL-4 has been extensively investigated and its structure appears to vary with cell types. We have proposed three models for the structure of the IL-4R complex (6Murata T. Noguchi P.D. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30829-30836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, despite their structural differences, all of the identified forms of the IL-4R complex are quite effective in transducing signals in response to IL-4 binding. Unlike the IL-4 receptor system, the receptor for IL-13 has not been well characterized. We have demonstrated that RCC cells express a large number of IL-13 binding sites and that these cells respond to IL-13 (4Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,7Obiri N. Husain S.R. Debinski W. Puri R.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1743-1749PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies indicate that the IL-13R is predominantly composed of a ∼65–70-kDa protein (4Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). RCC cells also express IL-4R, and 125I-IL-4 cross-links to IL-4Rβ (the p140 chain of IL-4R) and a 65–70-kDa IL-4-binding protein. The inhibition of IL-4 binding to both proteins by IL-13 supports the notion that IL-4 and IL-13 receptors are structurally and functionally interrelated (4Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J.

We recently proposed several models to account for the complex interactions among IL-13, IL-4, and the receptors for these ligands as they are expressed in different cell types. We proposed that IL-13R shares IL-4Rβ (p140) and IL-4Rα (p70) with the IL-13R system in certain cell types (11Obiri N.I. Dover P. Murata T. Debinski W. Puri R.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 756-764PubMed Google Scholar). We had also predicted that IL-13 binds to a heterodimer consisting of two ∼70-kDa proteins, one of which binds IL-13 alone (we termed this IL-13Rα) while the other binds IL-13 as well as IL-4 (we termed this IL-13Rα′) (7Obiri N. Husain S.R. Debinski W. Puri R.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1743-1749PubMed Google Scholar, 11Obiri N.I. Dover P. Murata T. Debinski W. Puri R.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 756-764PubMed Google Scholar). The genes for a murine IL-13-binding protein, its human homologue, and a second human IL-13-binding protein were subsequently identified and characterized (12Hilton D.J. Zhang J. Metcalf D.

One of these (corresponding to our IL-13Rα′) requires IL-4Rβ to bind and transduce IL-13 signal (14Aman M.J. Tayebi N. Obiri N.I. Puri R.K. Modi W.S. Leonard W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29265-29270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), while the other (corresponding to our IL-13Rα) can bind IL-13 in the absence of IL-4Rβ, but its role in IL-13 signaling remains unclear (13Caput D.

Whether other as yet unidentified proteins are required to constitute a functional high affinity IL-13R remains to be resolved. The IL-2Rγ chain termed γc is shared by receptors for IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 on immune cells (15Russell S.M. Keegan A.D. Harada N. Nakamura Y. Noguchi M. Leland P. Freedman M.C. Miyajima A.

However, we have reported that an anti-γc antibody did not immunoprecipitate any125I-IL-13-bound protein from RCC (4Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) or colon carcinoma (6Murata T. Noguchi P.D. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30829-30836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) cell lysates, indicating that the γc protein may not be directly involved in IL-13 binding. The γc protein was not expressed in these cells. However, whether γcaffects IL-13 binding in cells that normally express it is not known. It is also not known whether γc affects IL-13R structure and signal transduction. In this study, we have examined the effect of the γcchain on IL-13 and IL-4 binding and signaling. We have transfected ML-RCC cells with the γc cDNA and examined its influence on certain biological responses of these cells to IL-13 and IL-4. We present evidence that γc severely decreased the IL-13 binding capacity of these cells and prevented the expression of the α chain of the IL-13 receptor as well as ICAM-1. Furthermore, although γc had no significant effect on the binding of IL-4 to its receptors, its presence altered IL-13 and IL-4 signaling pathways in these cells in several ways, including the inhibition of IL-13- and IL-4-induced STAT-6 activation. Recombinant human IL-13 (rhIL-13) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (4Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Recombinant human IL-4 was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Widmer of Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA. Antibodies to JAKs 1 and 2 and biotin-anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies to γc, JAK3, Tyk2, and STATs 3, 4, and 6 were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to STAT1 and STAT5 were provided by Dr. David Finbloom (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration (CBER, FDA), Bethesda, MD). The ML-RCC (synonym: MA-RCC) renal cell carcinoma cell line was established in our laboratory as described previously (19Obiri N.I. Hillman G. Haas G.P. Sudha S. Puri R.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) from primary surgical tissues and was maintained in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose supplemented with glutamine plus 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). ML-RCC cells (3 × 105) were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates and cultured overnight. They were then transfected with a mixture of cDNAs encoding the genes for the γc subunit of the IL-2 receptor or neomycin transferase or both. Transfection was effected by the calcium phosphate method using the PROFECTANT kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Neomycin-resistant transfectants were selected by incubating the transfected cells in 0.8 mg/ml active G418 for 10 days. Selected cells were examined by Northern blot analysis to identify clones containing the γc gene in addition to the neomycin resistance gene. Two such clones isolated from the ML-RCC cell line were identified as MLγc. Clones transfected with the neomycin resistance but not the γc gene (MLneo) were used as negative controls for the double transfectants. Additional negative control transfectants (i.e. neomycin-resistant, γc(−)) were generated by using a recombination deficient retroviral vector to introduce the neomycin resistance gene into the target ML-RCC cells. This was achieved by infecting target cells with supernatant generated by the amphotropic retroviral vector-producing PA317 cell line (20Miller D. Buttimore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Carolyn Wilson (CBER, FDA). Identical results were observed when all negative control and parental cell lines were used in all tests. Similarly the two γc-positive clones (MLγc) were identical in their responses to all tests performed. Cells were harvested from culture with Versene (Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, MD), washed, and total RNA isolated in a one-step procedure using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of total RNA were electrophoresed through agarose (0.8%)/formaldehyde denaturing gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (S & S Nytran; Schleicher & Schuell) by capillary action and immobilized by ultraviolet cross-linking (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA). The membrane was then prehybridized overnight at 42 °C and hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe for γc at 42 °C for 18 h. The membrane was subsequently exposed to an X-AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) to obtain an autoradiograph. To evaluate the amount of RNA loaded per lane, the blots were stripped and reprobed with 32P-labeled GAPDH cDNA. rhIL-13 and rhIL-4 were labeled with 125I (Amersham Research Products) by using IODO-GEN reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific activity of the radiolabeled cytokines was estimated to range from 20 to 80 μCi/μg of protein for 125I-IL-4 and 40–120 μCi/μg for 125I-IL-13. Binding experiments were performed as described previously (4Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Typically, 1 × 106 cells were incubated at 4 °C for 3–5 h with125I-IL-13 (100–500 pm) or125I-IL-4 (100–500 pm) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations (up to 1000 nm) of unlabeled IL-13 or IL-4. The data were analyzed with the LIGAND (21Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar) program to determine the number of binding sites/cell as well as binding affinity. MLγc RCC cells as well as MLneo control cells were cultured at 1 × 105 cells/ml in medium containing IL-4 or IL-13 (0–10 ng/ml) over a 48-h period. Cells were washed and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human ICAM-1 antibody (Immunotech/Coulter) at a concentration of 40 μg/ml in FACS staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% sodium azide) at 4 °C for 60 min. Control cells were incubated in FACS staining buffer alone or FITC-conjugated IgG1 (isotype control antibody). The cells were subsequently washed and fluorescence data collected on a FACScan/C32 equipment (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The data were analyzed with a LYSIS II software program, and fluorescence intensity was expressed as mean channel number on a 256-channel/104log scale. Cells (5–10 × 106) were incubated with 125I-IL-13 in the presence or absence of excess IL-13 or IL-4 for 2 h at 4 °C. The bound ligand was cross-linked to its receptor with disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) at a final concentration of 2 mm for 30 min. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer consisting of 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 mmleupeptin, 5.0 μm trypsin inhibitor, 10 mmbenzamidine HCl, 1 mm phenanthroline, iodoacetamide, 50 mm aminocaproic acid, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell lysates were precleared and cleared by boiling in sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by electrophoresis through an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was subsequently dried and autoradiographed. In some instances, the receptor-ligand complex was captured from the precleared total cell lysate on protein A-Sepharose beads previously incubated with specific antibodies. The complex was washed in lysis buffer, boiled in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. ML-RCC cells (2 × 107) were incubated with 250 ng/ml IL-13 or 50 ng/ml IL-4 or left untreated as control for 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by addition of 10 ml of PBS containing 1 mmsodium vanadate, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm EDTA. The cells were lysed at 4 °C with 1% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), leupeptin (10 mg/ml), aprotinin (10 mg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), 1 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm EDTA. The cell lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). They were then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads that had been preincubated with primary antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The resulting complex was washed five times in lysis buffer, resuspended in loading buffer (NOVEX), and separated through 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (NOVEX) for 1 h. The blots were washed three times in TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), followed by 1 h of incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or strepto-avidin (Amersham), depending on the nature of the primary antibody, followed by three washes. The blots were incubated with RENAISSANCE™ chemiluminescence substrate mixture according to the manufacturer's instructions (NEN Life Science Products) for 1 min and exposed to x-ray film for 1–30 min. After treatment with/without IL-13 (250 ng/ml) or IL-4 (50 ng/ml), cells were washed in cold PBS and solubilized with cold whole cell extraction buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 20% glycerol). DNA-binding proteins were identified by EMSA by using bandshift kit from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Briefly, 30 μg of protein samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 1 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe consisting of double-stranded GRR (5′-AGCATGTTTCAAGGATTTGAGATGTATTTCCCAGAAAAG-3′) of the promoter of the FcRγ1 gene in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC)). A 200-fold excess of cold GRR probe was added as a competitor. Before loading, 10 × loading dye was added to each sample and separated in a 5% non-reducing polyacrylamide gel at 150 V for 2.5 h. Gels were dried for 2 h and autoradiographed overnight at room temperature. For the supershift assay, cell lysates were preincubated with preimmune rabbit serum as a control or STAT1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 antibodies on ice for 30 min, standard EMSA was then performed as described above. Two γc mRNA-positive (+) clones of ML-RCC (MLγc) were selected from five neomycin-resistant (MLneo) clones. As shown in Fig.1 A, alternatively spliced γc mRNA (16Takeshita T. Asao H. Ohtani K. Ishii N. Kumaki S. Tanaka N. Munakata H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Science. 1992; 257: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) was detected in MLγc but not in MLneo cells. Both of the MLγc clones were tested in all experiments shown, and both yielded identical results. Similarly, all the negative control clones (MLneo) yielded identical results in tests performed. To confirm that the γc mRNA being transcribed was also being properly translated into its protein in MLγc cell lines, we examined total cell lysates from these γcmRNA+ cell lines for the presence of γcprotein by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. The results indicate that MLγc cells expressed the γcprotein as detected by anti-γc antibody, whereas the control and untransfected parental cell lines were negative (Fig.1 B). We have also demonstrated γc protein expression on the surface of these γcmRNA+ cells by flow cytometry (22Puri R.K. Leland P. Obiri N.I. Husain S.R. Mulé J. Pastan I. Kreitman R.J. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 171: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Following γc transfection, the MLγc clones took on a different morphology, appearing smaller and more elongated than the neomycin-resistant control cell lines (data not shown). Since γc modulated the binding of IL-13 to its plasma membrane receptors, it was important to determine whether the γc protein expressed in ML-RCC cells transfected with the γc cDNA is associated with IL-13 receptor proteins. We cross-linked 125I-IL-13 to its receptors on γc-transfected and control cells. The cell lysate from each group was subsequently incubated with anti-γc antibody, and the resulting antigen-antibody complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was overexposed (5 days) to ensure visualization of the IL-13/γc band. The results (Fig. 1 C) indicate the formation of an125I-IL-13·IL-13R complex of 58–65 kDa in MLγc cells. Furthermore, the γc protein could be immunoprecipitated from this band in MLγc as a faint ∼60-kDa band (Fig. 1 C) but not from the control MLneo cell line (data not shown). Since γc has previously been shown to increase the binding affinity of certain cytokine ligands to their receptor (15Russell S.M. Keegan A.D. Harada N. Nakamura Y. Noguchi M. Leland P. Freedman M.C.

The results (TableI, Fig. 2,A and B) show that theneoR + control RCC cells (MLneo) significantly bound 125I-IL-13, and this binding was specific as it was displaced by increasing concentrations of the unlabeled ligand (Fig. 2). However, introduction of the γc chain into these cells resulted in a drastic reduction of 125I-IL-13 binding. For example, assuming a 1:1 ratio of radiolabeled ligand to cell surface receptor, an analysis of the125I-IL-13 binding data with the LIGAND program (21Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar) indicates that neoR + control MLneocell lines express 480 ± 86 × 103 (mean ± S.D.) IL-13 binding sites/cell, and the number of binding sites/cell on the parental cell line, ML-RCC was determined to be 351 ± 90 × 103. However, in the γc-transfected MLγc, 125I-IL-13 binding was dramatically reduced (by up to 2 log orders) to 4080 ± 1890 binding sites/cell. It is interesting that, in addition to reducing the level of ligand binding, γc induced high affinity125I-IL-13 binding to RCC cells (Fig. 2 B). For example, ML and MLneo cells bound 125I-IL-13 with a dissociation constant (K d ) ranging from 7.5 to 20.5 nm (mean ± S.D. = 13.4 ± 4.6 nm), but in MLγc, the K d value (mean ± S.D.) was 0.23 nm ± 0.14 (n = 4) (Table I). In some experiments, analysis of the binding data with the LIGAND program (21Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar) indicated a concurrent expression of a lower affinity IL-13R (K d = 7.5 nm) (Fig. 2 B).Table IEffect of γ c on IL-13 receptor expression in ML-RCC cellsCell lineTreatmentBinding sites/cell1-aDetermined from 125I-IL-13 displacement studies in which 100 pm125I-IL-13 was incubated with cells at 4 °C for 4–5 h in the presence of 0–500 nm IL-13.

Our results (Fig. 2 C) show that in comparison to the profound decrease in IL-13R expression induced by γc, IL-4R expression is not significantly affected. Since γc inhibited IL-13 binding and IL-13Rα and IL-13Rα′ chains were recently cloned, we were interested to examine whether one or both chains were modulated by the presence of γc in ML-RCC. By Northern analysis, we found that IL-13Rα mRNA is expressed in MLneo but not in MLγc cells (Fig. 3,upper panel). The expression of IL-13Rα′ mRNA was reduced in MLγc in comparison to MLneo (Fig.3, middle panel). When we normalized IL-13Rα′ mRNA band to the GAPDH mRNA band in each cell type for comparison, we observed that IL-13Rα′ expression is about 3 times higher in MLneo than in MLγc. Since γc modulated IL-13 binding and appeared to alter the morphology of γc-transfected cells, we further investigated its role in ML-RCC cells by examining the effect of IL-13 and IL-4 on the surface expression of ICAM-1 molecules. Consistent with our previous findings (4Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 23Obiri N.I. Tandon N. Puri R.K. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the control MLneo cell line had considerable baseline expression of ICAM-1 (Fig.4 A, left panel), which was significantly enhanced by IL-13 or IL-4 treatment. However, transfection of γc inhibited the basal level of ICAM-1 expression in MLγc and neither IL-13 nor IL-4 could reverse this inhibition (Fig. 4 A, right panel). Additionally, we examined the effect of γc on ICAM-1 mRNA expression by Northern analysis. Our results show that in the γc-positive MLγc cells (Fig. 4 B,right lane) ICAM-1 mRNA is not expressed, but it is expressed in the γc-negative MLneo and the parental ML-RCC cells (two left lanes). It has been shown that a number of cytokines including IL-13 and IL-4 can induce phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family of kinase (24Murata T. Noguchi P. Puri R.K. J.

In the present study, we examined the impact of the presence of γc chain on the IL-13- and IL-4-induced phosphorylation of JAK tyrosine kinase in ML-RCC cell lines. As shown in Fig.5 A, IL-4 induced the phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 tyrosine kinase in ML cells. JAK1 kinase was weakly phosphorylated in response to IL-13, but in contrast to o"

To account for the specificity of vesicle transport, the SNARE hypothesis proposes that the docking and fusion of vesicles with the cognate compartment is mediated by specific pairing between vesicle-associated SNAREs (v-SNAREs) with those (t-SNAREs) associated with the target membrane (6Ferro-Novick S.

Vesicle-associated membrane proteins or synaptobrevins are v-SNAREs associated with the synaptic vesicles, while syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa) are t-SNAREs associated with the presynaptic membrane. The specific pairing of vesicle-associated membrane proteins with the syntaxin 1-SNAP-25 complex plays a key role in the docking/fusion of synaptic vesicle with the presynaptic membrane (6Ferro-Novick S.

Antibodies against GS15 revealed that GS15 is an integral membrane protein of the Golgi apparatus that behaves like a novel SNARE. MDCK II (Madin-Darby canine kidney strain II) was a generous gift from Dr. Kai Simons (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany), and all other cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). The rat brain λ-ZAP cDNA library and Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase were obtained from Stratagene. The rat mRNA Multiple Tissues Northern filter was obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The oligolabeling kit and glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were purchased from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Brefeldin A (BFA) was from Epicentre Technologies. A mouse EST clone (accession number W83047) encoding an open reading frame that is homologous to the rbet1 protein was revealed using the BLAST program. The cDNA insert of this EST clone was used to screen a rat brain λ-ZAP cDNA library as described (16Lowe S.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 209-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among 10 positive clones, one (clone 5) with an insert size of 1.2 kbp was sequenced completely. A rat multiple tissues blot of poly(A)+ mRNA (CLONTECH) was probed with the rat cDNA using the procedure as described (16Lowe S.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 209-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were produced using the pGEX-KG vector (17Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal.

Booster injections containing a similar amount of antigen emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant were administered every 2 weeks. Rabbits were bled 10 days after the second and subsequent booster injections. Serum was diluted twice with PBS and incubated sequentially with cyanogen bromide activated-Sepharose beads coupled with GST protein and GST fusion protein for 2 h at room temperature. The beads containing the GST fusion protein were washed extensively, and specific antibodies were eluted (16Lowe S.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 209-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (16Lowe S.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 209-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Subramaniam V.N. Krijnse-Locker J.

For the treatment of cells with BFA or nocodazole, cells grown on coverslips were incubated with BFA (10 μg/ml) or nocodazole (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed twice with PBSCM (PBS with 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2), and then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were then permeabilized and incubated with antibodies against GS15 (polyclonal) and mannosidase II (monoclonal) for double labeling. Pelleted Golgi membranes (500 μg) were extracted on ice for 1 h in 100 μl of 2 m KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate (pH 12.0), 2.5m urea or PBS and then centrifugated at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to another tube, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 1 × SDS sample buffer. Aliquots (20 μl) from both the supernatants as well as the pellets were analyzed by immunoblot analysis (19Subramaniam V.N. Krijnse-Locker J. Tang B.L. Ericsson M. Yusoff A.R.B.M. Griffiths G.

For immunoprecipitation of the 20 S complex, 20 S fractions were incubated with antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose (in the presence of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C for 2 h with agitation. Sepharose beads were washed five times with gradient buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP)) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and divided into two equal aliquots. One of the aliquots was eluted with 30 μl of gradient buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (assembly condition) and the other one with 30 μl of gradient buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 8 mm MgCl2 (disassembly condition). Both the eluants as well as the beads were processed for immunoblot analysis using antibodies against NSF and α-SNAP. Golgi enriched membranes (1 mg) were extracted in 500 μl of incubation buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP) containing 1% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with agitation. The extracted Golgi membranes were diluted with 500 μl of incubation buffer without Triton X-100 and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads containing 2 μg of GST-α-SNAP were washed twice with incubation buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (1 ml each) before incubating with different amounts of extracted Golgi proteins in a total volume of 200 μl at 4 °C for 3 h with agitation. Beads were then washed twice with incubation buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, once with incubation buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, twice with incubation buffer without Triton X-100, and then processed for immunoblot analysis. Searching the EST data bases using rbet1 amino acid sequence led to the identification of a mouse EST clone (accession number W83047) that encodes a protein related to rbet1 (11Hay J.C. Hirling H. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5671-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The PCR product of the EST clone was used to screen a rat brain λ-ZAP cDNA library, leading to the isolation of full-length rat cDNA clones. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequence of rat GS15 are shown in Fig.1 A. GS15 is a protein of 111 residues with a 21-residue carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic region that may function as a membrane anchor. Preceding the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic tail are several regions that have the potential to form coiled-coil structures. The alignment of rat and mouse GS15 sequences with that of rbet1 is shown in Fig. 1 B. The rat and mouse GS15 are highly homologous with 96% amino acid identity, and both are related to rbet1 with amino acid identity of 28%. Northern blot analysis was performed to examine the levels of GS15 mRNA in various rat tissues (Fig. 2). A major mRNA species of about 1.8 kb was detected in all the tissues examined, suggesting that GS15 may be involved in a general cellular process. Recombinant GST-GS15 fusion protein was produced in bacteria, purified, and used to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GS15. Affinity-purified antibodies against GS15 recognized a 15-kDa protein enriched in Golgi membranes (Fig. 3 A,lanes 4–6), and its enrichment was comparable to that of Golgi α2,6-sialyltransferase (lanes 1–3). When Golgi-enriched membranes were subjected to different extraction conditions, GS15 was effectively extracted by detergents but not by 2m KCl, 2.5 m urea, or 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate (pH 12), establishing that GS15 is an integral membrane protein enriched in the Golgi fractions (Fig. 3 B). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy provided further independent evidence of the cellular localization of GS15 (Fig.4). Affinity-purified antibodies against GS15 specifically labeled perinuclear structures (Fig. 4 A,a) characteristic of the Golgi apparatus (22Louvard D. Reggio H. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 92-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and this labeling was blocked by GST-GS15 fusion protein (c) but not by GST (b). The Golgi nature of this perinuclear structure was confirmed by the colocalization of GS15 with Golgi mannosidase II (23Moremen K.W. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) under control condition (Fig. 4 B, a andb) or when the Golgi apparatus was fragmented by nocodazole treatment (c and d). Like mannosidase II and other Golgi proteins (24Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar), GS15 is redistributed to the ER when cells are treated with BFA (e and f). These results firmly establish that GS15 is an integral membrane protein associated with the Golgi apparatus.Figure 4GS15 is associated with the Golgi apparatus. A, perinuclear Golgi labeling by anti-GS15 antibodies are specific. Permeabilized NRK cells were incubated with antibodies against GS15, supplemented with nothing (a), recombinant GST (b), or recombinant GST-GS15 and then processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy.

Control (a and b), nocodazole-treated (c and d), and BFA-treated (e and f) NRK cells were double-labeled with antibodies against GS15 (a, c, and e) and Golgi mannosidase II (b, d, andf). Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ubiquitous expression of GS15 mRNA suggests that GS15 is widely expressed. To examine whether GS15 is also widely expressed in the Golgi apparatus of different cell lines, we examined nine additional cell types (NRL, CHO, MDCK, Vero, LLC-PK1, CV1, A431, NIH3T3, and C6) and observed similar Golgi labeling of GS15 (data not shown). Such ubiquity of expression and localization further indicates that GS15 may participate an essential process of the Golgi apparatus. Although the functional aspect of rbet1 remains to be established, recent studies have shown that it is in a protein complex that could be immunoprecipitated by antibodies against cis-Golgi syntaxin 5 (25Hay J.C. Chao D.S. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The fact that GS15 is structurally related to rbet1, in conjunction with the observation that GS15 has a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic tail that is preceded by potential coiled-coil regions, prompted us to investigate whether GS15 is a new SNARE of the Golgi apparatus. When Golgi extract was sedimented on a glycerol gradient, GS15 was found to have a sedimentation coefficiency of about 6 S (Fig. 5 A,upper panel). Incubation in the presence of recombinant α-SNAP and NSF in a buffer that promotes formation of the 20 S SNARE complex caused GS15 to be shifted into the 20 S fractions (middle panel). This shift was not observed when Golgi extract was incubated with equal amounts of α-SNAP and NSF in a buffer that promotes disassembly of the Golgi SNARE complex. Under the disassembly conditions, GS15 has a sedimentation coefficiency of 3 S (lower panel), indicating that GS15 may be associated with other proteins in the Golgi extract and that this association is disrupted by the disassembly conditions. When the 20 S fractions were immunoprecipitated with GS15 antibodies, both α-SNAP and NSF were released from the immunoprecipitate under the disassembly conditions (Fig. 5 B,lane 4) but not in the assembly conditions (lane 3). Under the assembly conditions, immunoprecipitated NSF and α-SNAP remained associated with the beads (lane 1). Control antibodies (lanes 5–8) did not immunoprecipitate significant amounts of either NSF or α-SNAP. When a fixed amount of recombinant GST-α-SNAP immobilized on beads was incubated with increasing amounts of Golgi extracts, it was revealed that increasing amounts of GS15 were retained by the beads (Fig.6). Under identical conditions, GS15 was not retained by GST or several other GST fusion proteins (data not shown). Furthermore, other Golgi proteins, including α2,6-sialyltransferase, were not retained by immobilized GST-α-SNAP. These results further support the idea that GS15 is a Golgi SNARE. Since SNAREs are key molecules mediating docking and fusion of vesicular transport and are present either in the vesicles and/or the target membrane, identification of new SNAREs will not only provide novel markers for a given transport step but also provide a novel approach for the molecular dissection of the respective transport events. Despite the fact that many SNAREs are known, few SNAREs have been identified in mammalian cells that are specifically associated with the Golgi apparatus (6Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R.

Landes Co., Austin, TX1996Google Scholar), the major organelle of the secretory pathway. In this report, we have molecularly identified a novel COOH-terminal tail-anchored integral membrane protein (GS15) that is significantly related to rbet1 exhibiting 28% amino acid identity. The mRNA is widely expressed in all the rat tissues examined. The subcellular localization of GS15 was clearly established in many cell types and it is ubiquitously associated with the Golgi apparatus. Biochemically, we have established that it behaves like a SNARE. Although the exact cellular function of GS15 remains to be investigated, the establishment of its being a novel SNARE associated with the Golgi apparatus suggests that it may participate in a transport event associated with the Golgi apparatus. What is the functional relationship between GS15 and rbet1? GS15 and rbet1 may either participate in a common transport event at either a similar stage or at different stages. Alternatively, they may participate in separate transport events. Although the functional aspects for rbet1 have not been revealed (11Hay J.C. Hirling H. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5671-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), recent studies suggest that it exists in a protein complex that could be immunoprecipitated by antibodies against syntaxin 5 (25Hay J.C. Chao D.S. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Since syntaxin 5 is involved in transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (27Dascher C. Matteson J. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29363-29366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in conjunction with the fact that yeast Bet1p is essential for ER-Golgi transport (12Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D.

Since the amino acid similarity between GS15 and rbet1 is around 28%, GS15 and rbet1 may have related but distinct properties. In this respect, we favor the possibilities that GS15 and rbet1 are involved in different transport events or distinct stages of a similar transport event. Further studies along this line will provide additional insight not only into the functional aspects of GS15 but also into the molecular and mechanistic aspects of the Golgi apparatus."

They were tested for their ability to reactivate inactive P1-P2-deficient core particles derived from 60 S ribosomal subunits treated with dimethylmaleic anhydride, in poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis. The recombinant P1-P2 were unable to reactivate these core particles although they could bind to them. When recombinant P1-P2 had been phosphorylated first with casein kinase II, they were as efficient in the reactivation process as P1-P2 extracted with ethanol/KCl from the 60 S subunits. Reconstitution experiments were carried out using all possible combinations of the two recombinant proteins phosphorylated or not. Reactivation of the core particles required the presence of both P1 and P2 with the latter in its phosphorylated form. These experiments reveal a distinct role for P1 and P2 in protein synthesis. Phosphorylated P2 produced a partial quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of eukaryotic elongation factor 2, which was not observed with the unphosphorylated protein. This result demonstrates the existence of an interaction between phosphorylated P2 and eukaryotic elongation factor 2.

The large subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes contains 12-kDa acidic P proteins, which seem more numerous in lower eukaryotes than in higher organisms (1Liljas A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 124: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In these, two types of P proteins are found, designated as P1 and P2 (2Tsurugi K. Collatz E. Todokoro K. Ulbrich N. Lightfoot H.N. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 946-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wool I.G. Chan Y.L. Glück A. Suzuki K. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). They share similar properties with prokaryotic proteins L7–L12, which form a pentamer with protein L10, (L7/L12)4-L10, constituting the lateral stalk of the 50 S ribosomal subunits (4Strycharz W.A. Nomura M. Lake J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 126: 123-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic P proteins, as their prokaryotic counterparts, seem to play an essential role in the interaction with elongation factors and in factor-dependent GTPase activity (5MacConnell W.P. Kaplan N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5359-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, some specific properties are observed with eukaryotic P proteins. First, these proteins exist on the ribosome as phosphorylated derivatives. They can be phosphorylated in vitro by either casein kinase II or by an endogenous ribosome-bound enzyme (6Hasler P. Brot N. Weissbach H. Parnassa A.P. Elkon K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13815-13820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, proteins P1-P2 present on the ribosome can exchange with a cytoplasmic pool of these unphosphorylated proteins (7Elkon K. Skelly S. Parnassa A. Moller W. Danho W. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7419-7423Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of P1-P2, which appears to be necessary for ribosome activity, was originally suggested to be a requirement for the binding of these proteins to ribosomes (5MacConnell W.P. Kaplan N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5359-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but recently this hypothesis has been challenged by new results obtained in yeast (8Ballesta J.P.G. Remacha M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 6477-6480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactivation of the rat liver core particles was obtained not only with DMMA-split proteins containing several proteins including P1-P2 but also with a 50% ethanol, 0.08 m KCl extract containing P1-P2 exclusively. Dephosphorylation of P1-P2 with alkaline phosphatase completely inhibited the reactivation process (11Lavergne J.P. Conquet F. Reboud J.P. Reboud A.M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The poor ability of the ethanol/KCl core particles to be reactivated with this extract was shown to be related to a conformational alteration which destabilizes the 5 S RNA·protein complex (12Lavergne J.P. Marzouki A. Reboud J.P. Reboud A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).Using this relatively simple in vitro reconstitution system, we here report results obtained by studying separately the role of P1 and P2 overproduced by cloning their cDNA in Escherichia coli. We have focused our work on the effects of phosphorylation of each of the two proteins, their mutual interaction, and the interaction of P2 with elongation factor eEF-2.DISCUSSIONBy expressing the cDNA of mammalian acidic ribosomal proteins P1 and P2 in an E. coli system, it was possible to obtain these proteins pure in large amounts and therefore to study the function and the role of the phosphorylation of each protein. Active 60 S subunits could be reconstituted by incubation of inactive DMMA core particles with the recombinant proteins previously phosphorylated. The requirement for phosphorylation to obtain active material was not surprising, since this result has also been obtained in reconstitution experiments using P1 and P2 extracted from the ribosomes (5MacConnell W.P. Kaplan N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5359-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the 60 S subunits (11Lavergne J.P. Conquet F. Reboud J.P. Reboud A.M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More unexpected was the finding of a dissymmetry between the effects of phosphorylated P1 and P2: phosphorylated P2 with unphosphorylated P1 could reactivate the core particles, whereas phosphorylated P1 with unphosphorylated P2 were almost ineffective. The phosphorylation reaction was carried out with casein kinase II. It has been shown that the two residues, which are phosphorylated by this enzyme as well as by an endogenous ribosome-bound kinase, are the two serine located in the common C-terminal peptide near the C terminus (6Hasler P. Brot N. Weissbach H. Parnassa A.P. Elkon K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13815-13820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the results of our experiments, it is clear that the phosphorylation of P1-P2 is not required for their binding to the core particles, since the unphosphorylated proteins can be incorporated and then phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP. The presence in the core particles of P0, which is assumed to be required for the binding of P1-P2 (18Santos C. Ballesta J.P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15689-15696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could be demonstrated by using a monoclonal antibody. This antibody had been obtained using recombinant P1 as antigen, and since it recognized the three proteins P0-P1-P2, it was directed most likely against an epitope located in the C-terminal peptide common to the three proteins. The major part of P0 was probably phosphorylated, since this protein was not visible in the autoradiogram of the core particles incubated with the kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 4). In fact, it appeared weakly labeled when the exposure time was increased (not shown). If the role of P1-P2 phosphorylation is not to allow the binding of these proteins to the core particles, the questions of why it is required for the reactivation process and why P2 phosphorylation appears to have a specific role remain. The experiment illustrated by Fig. 5 could give at least part of the answer. It had been shown previously that elongation factor eEF-2 could be cross-linked with protein P2, among other ribosomal proteins (19Uchiumi T. Kikuchi M. Terao K. Iwasaki K. Ogata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our results obtained from intrinsic fluorescence measurements demonstrate the existence of an interaction of eEF-2 with phosphorylated P2. On the other hand, no interaction between eEF-2 and unphosphorylated P2 was observed using this technique. It will be interesting now to identify the amino acid residues of P2, which are involved in this interaction by site-directed mutagenesis and to precise the exact role of P2 phosphorylation in the eEF-2-dependent step of elongation. Interaction of P2 with P1 was also detected using the same technique, and the amino acid residues involved should also be identified.

The major part of P0 was probably phosphorylated, since this protein was not visible in the autoradiogram of the core particles incubated with the kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 4). In fact, it appeared weakly labeled when the exposure time was increased (not shown). If the role of P1-P2 phosphorylation is not to allow the binding of these proteins to the core particles, the questions of why it is required for the reactivation process and why P2 phosphorylation appears to have a specific role remain. The experiment illustrated by Fig. 5 could give at least part of the answer. It had been shown previously that elongation factor eEF-2 could be cross-linked with protein P2, among other ribosomal proteins (19Uchiumi T. Kikuchi M. Terao K. Iwasaki K. Ogata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our results obtained from intrinsic fluorescence measurements demonstrate the existence of an interaction of eEF-2 with phosphorylated P2. On the other hand, no interaction between eEF-2 and unphosphorylated P2 was observed using this technique. It will be interesting now to identify the amino acid residues of P2, which are involved in this interaction by site-directed mutagenesis and to precise the exact role of P2 phosphorylation in the eEF-2-dependent step of elongation. Interaction of P2 with P1 was also detected using the same technique, and the amino acid residues involved should also be identified. We are grateful to Dr. I. G.

https://openalex.org/W2082522421,"Abstract Propanodeoxyguanosine (PdG) is a model for several unstable exocyclic adducts formed by reaction of DNA with bifunctional carbonyl compounds generated by lipid peroxidation. The effect of PdG on DNA synthesis by human DNA polymerase β was evaluated using template-primers containing PdG at defined sites. DNA synthesis was conducted in vitro and the products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. The extent of PdG bypass was low and the products comprised a mixture of base pair substitutions and deletions. Sequence analysis of all of the products indicated that the deoxynucleoside monophosphate incorporated “opposite” PdG was complementary to the base 5′ to PdG in the template strand. These findings are very similar to recent results of Efrati et al. (Efrati, E., Tocco, G., Eritja, R., Wilson, S. H., and Goodman, M. F. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 2559–2569) obtained in DNA replication of template-primers containing abasic sites and suggest that PdG is a non-informational lesion when acted upon by polymerase (pol) β. In addition to base pair substitutions and one- or two-base deletions, a four-base deletion was observed and the mechanism of its formation was probed by site-specific mutagenesis. The results indicated that this deletion occurred by one-base insertion followed by slippage to form a four-base loop followed by extension. All of the observations on pol β replication of PdG-containing template-primers are consistent with a mechanism of lesion bypass that involves template slippage and dNTP stabilization followed by deoxynucleoside monophosphate incorporation and extension. This mechanism of PdG bypass is completely different than that previously determined for the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and is consistent with recent structural models for DNA synthesis by pol β."
https://openalex.org/W2019143753,"This paper describes the first report of the production and use of an artificial recombinant protein substrate to study “aggrecanase” activity. The substrate (rAgg1) is composed of the complete interglobular domain (IGD) of human aggrecan flanked by the “marker” sequences FLAGTM at the amino terminus and the human immunoglobulin G1 constant region at the carboxyl terminus. The expressed protein occurs as large multimolecular aggregates (>120 kDa) that, upon reduction, consist of a major isoform of 72 kDa (containing the IGD) and a minor 39-kDa species that through alternative splicing has had the IGD deleted. Using this recombinant substrate we developed a novel agarose cell culture system containing either rat chondrosarcoma or bovine chondrocytes that could be used in studies of the biochemical characterization of aggrecanase activities. These studies showed the following. (i) rAgg1 is a suitable substrate for aggrecanase proteolysis. (ii) Aggrecanase activity was specifically induced by exposing chondrocytes to retinoic acid. (iii) A considerable time period was required to synthesize and/or activate aggrecanase, with considerable differences in that found in rat chondrosarcomaversus bovine chondrocyte culture systems. (iv) Aggrecanase cleavage of the aggrecan IGD does not require the presence of the G1 or G2 globular domains or keratan sulfate post-translational modification in the IGD.

Mechanisms of proteoglycan breakdown in connective tissue are complex and involve multiple agents and pathways. In studies investigating the catabolism of aggrecan, the experimental systems used have included monolayer cultures of primary chondrocytes (1Aydelotte M.B. Raiss R.X. Caterson B. Kuettner K.E.

Cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor have been extensively used as agents that promote the degradation of the extracellular matrix (2Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Fosang A.J.

In particular, these two cytokines have been shown to target the catabolism of aggrecan, the major proteoglycan present in hyaline articular cartilages. Several studies have now led to a number of important discoveries, which have defined at least seven specific cleavage sites along the protein core of aggrecan (9Maniglia C.A. Loulakis P.P.

Amino acid sequence analysis of cartilage proteoglycan breakdown products has defined the two major sites of proteolytic cleavage in aggrecan, both found within the interglobular domain (IGD) 1The abbreviations used are: IGD, interglobular domain; rAgg1, a recombinant substrate containing the IGD polypeptide sequence of human aggrecan; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1The abbreviations used are: IGD, interglobular domain; rAgg1, a recombinant substrate containing the IGD polypeptide sequence of human aggrecan; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. of the aggrecan core protein. These occur between amino acid residues Asn341–Phe342 and Glu373–Ala374 (human sequence enumeration (13Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMP1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, and -13) have now been shown to cleave aggrecan at the former cleavage site. The second cleavage site was first described in the early 1990s (10Ilic M.Z. Handley C.J. Robinson H.C. Mok M.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 11Loulakis P. Shrikhande A. Davis G. Maniglia C.A. Biochem.

Now, however, almost 6 years later, the agent(s) responsible for cleavage at the Glu373–Ala374 peptide bond still remain to be identified. This uncharacterized activity, termed “aggrecanase” (12Sandy J.D. Neame P.J. Boynton R.E. Flannery C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8683-8685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fosang A.J.

The majority of aggrecan catabolites found in the synovial fluids of patients with arthritis appear to be generated by aggrecanase activity (15Sandy J.D. Flannery C.R. Neame P.J. Lohmander L.S. J.

In a recent study, Fosang et al. (17Fosang A.J. Last K. Maciewicz R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2292-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) reported the presence of aggrecan catabolites in synovial fluid that contained the amino-terminal sequence FFG …, which indicates that matrix metalloproteinases are also involved in aggrecan catabolism. Culture systems have been manipulated with a variety of agents that enhance proteoglycan catabolism in efforts to discover the agent(s) responsible for aggrecan breakdown. However, these studies have been unsuccessful in defining any specific agent responsible for the degradation of aggrecan (18Flannery C.R. Sandy J.D. Trans. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1993; 17: 677Google Scholar). Nonetheless, experimental data using purified aggrecan and modified aggrecan as a substrate for testing purified enzyme preparations in vitro have yielded some information on the specific cleavage sites of the enzymes themselves, but this work has not directly helped in determining the identity or biochemical properties of aggrecanase (14Fosang A.J.

J. 1995; 305: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 21Hughes C.E. Caterson B. White R.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16011-16014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we have developed a number of monoclonal antibodies (neoepitope antibodies) that recognize unique proteoglycan degradation products that have been generated by specific proteinases including aggrecanase. These antibodies have proved useful as tools in studying the mechanisms of the breakdown of proteoglycan in cartilage explant culture systems. The purpose of this current work was to further refine culture systems that would facilitate the identification of the agents responsible for the cleavage of aggrecan at the374ARGSVI … site in the IGD of aggrecan. In this study, we describe the development of an in vitro culture system that has enabled us to study the activity of aggrecanase against an artificial recombinant substrate in a cell culture system that is free of inherent endogenous proteoglycans and other extracellular components. The use of previously characterized neoepitope antibodies to key cleavage sites in the IGD of aggrecan facilitated the monitoring of products generated by the proteolytic action of aggrecanase in this system. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody and substrate used in Western blot analysis were obtained from Promega as the Protoblot Western blot AP system (catalog no. W3920). Nitrocellulose (0.2-μm pore size) was obtained from Schleicher and Schuell. Monoclonal antibody M1, which recognizes the FLAGTM epitope, and anti-FLAG M1 affinity gel were both obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. Anti-human IgG monoclonal antibody was obtained from Cappel (Durham, NC). Monoclonal antibody BC-3 was prepared as ascitic fluid (2Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Fosang A.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The Rx cell line was kindly provided by Dr. James Kimura, Bone Research Center, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI. The genetic construct for rAgg1 codes for the signal sequence of the lymphocyte glycoprotein T1/Leu-1 (CD5), the 8-amino acid-long FLAG epitope (22Prickett K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopp T.P. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 580-589PubMed Google Scholar), the 127-amino acid-long interglobular domain of the human cartilage large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan (Thr331–Gly457, assuming Val20 is the native amino terminus (13Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), a 4-amino acid-long spacer (GDPE), and a 232-amino acid polypeptide sequence from the human IgG1 hinge, CH2 and CH3 constant regions (see Fig. 1), thus giving rise to a secreted fusion protein with an expected molecular mass of 41,059. Aggrecan cDNA sequences encoding the interglobular domain were amplified by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (23Saiki R.K. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stockton Press, New York1989: 7-16Crossref Google Scholar) with synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to sequences flanking this region. Total RNA was extracted from human cartilage tissue obtained from joint replacement surgery according to Adams et al. (24Adams M.E. Huang D.Q. Yao L.Y. Sandell L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were designed to contain additional sequence information regarding the 8-amino acid FLAG epitope and the GDPE to allow the creation of restriction enzyme cleavage sites at the 5′ and 3′ extremities of the amplified cDNA segments to facilitate subsequent insertion into the CD5-IgG1 expression vector, modified to contain a 3′ NheI site (25Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). The primer encoding the FLAG epitope, the amino-terminal start of the interglobular domain, and including an NheI site was synthesized with the following sequence: 5′-CGC GGG GCT AGC CGA CTA CAA GGA CGA CGA TGA CAA GAC AGG TGA AGA CTT TGT GGA C. A reverse primer encoding the carboxyl-terminal end of the interglobular domain, the GDPE spacer, and a splice donor site containing aBamHI site had the sequence: 5′-CGC GGG GGA TCC CCT CCC CCT GGC AAA TGC GGC TGC CC. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NheI and BamHI and ligated to aNheI and BamHI cut vector CD5-IgG (25Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). The genetic construct was transfected into COS cells via DEAE-dextran (26Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Cells grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS were trypsinized, seeded onto fresh dishes 12 h after transfection, and allowed to grow for 5 days. On the 3rd day, fresh medium containing 10% FBS was added. Supernatants were harvested, centrifuged to remove nonadherent cells and debris, pooled, and stored at 4 °C. Fusion proteins were affinity-purified via anti-FLAG M1 affinity gel (Kodak) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The yield was 1–3 μg of fusion protein/ml of culture supernatant. Rat chondrosarcoma cells were plated in 75-cm2flasks and maintained in DMEM medium containing 5% FBS and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Confluent monolayers in 75-cm2 flasks were harvested by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin (w/v) in DMEM containing 0.44 mm EDTA) for 15–20 min at 37 °C with agitation followed by digestion in 0.05% collagenase (w/v) in DMEM for 1–2 h. The cells were then resuspended in DMEM at 4 × 106cells/ml. 24-well culture plates were coated (200 μl/well) with a 1% (w/v) solution of FMC Seaplaque-agarose in DMEM. The agarose was solidified by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min (27Aydelotte M.B. Kuettner K.E. Connect. Tissue Res. 1988; 18: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and then re-equilibrated to 37 °C. The chondrocyte cell suspension (described above) was diluted with a 2% (w/v) solution of Seaplaque-agarose in DMEM such that the final cell concentration was 2 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots (200 μl) of the agarose cell suspension containing 0.4 × 106 cells were layered over the previously prepared agarose plugs. Immediately following this, 50 μg of rAgg1 was added to the appropriate wells and mixed by agitation. The plates were then incubated at 4 °C for 15 min to solidify the agarose and re-equilibrated at 37 °C. Experimental medium (with or without retinoic acid) was then added to triplicate wells containing the recombinant IGD construct, as follows: control cultures, DMEM plus gentamicin (50 μg/ml) and treated cultures, DMEM plus gentamicin (50 μg/ml) plus 10−6mretinoic acid (2Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Fosang A.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Agarose cell cultures were then maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 96 h after which media and agarose cell matrix extracts were further analyzed. Agarose cultures containing only the rat chondrosarcoma cells (i.e. no rAgg1) were set up as described above. Experimental medium (with or without retinoic acid) containing 20 μg of rAgg1 was added to duplicate cultures. Thus, in this experiment the chondrocytes (in agarose) were partitioned from the multimolecular aggregate rAgg1 substrate in the medium. Agarose cultures were maintained as described above, and media were harvested at 16, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h for further analysis as described below. Bovine articular chondrocytes were isolated from the metacarpophangeal joints of 2–3-year-old cows using established procedures (28Handley C. Brooks P. Lowther D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 544: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 29Handley C. Lowther D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 500: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly cartilage was removed from the joint surfaces under sterile conditions. The tissue was digested in 0.1% Pronase in DMEM containing 5% FBS for 1 h at 37 °C with agitation, washed, and further digested with 0.04% collagenase in DMEM containing 5% FBS overnight at 37 °C with agitation. Cells were then filtered through a 0.2-μm Nitex filter and washed before cell numbers were established. Cells were then plated in agarose (without substrate) as described above for the rat chondrosarcoma cells. Experimental medium (with or without retinoic acid) containing 20 μg of rAgg1 was added to duplicate cultures. Agarose cultures were maintained as described above and media were harvested at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h for further analysis as described below. In a specific experiment conditioned media samples were obtained from control and retinoic acid-treated cultures at 120 h; these were used to demonstrate the soluble nature of aggrecanase activity in retinoic acid-treated cultures. Media (96 h) from cultures where both the cells and the rAgg1 were embedded in agarose were dialyzed exhaustively against distilled H2O, lyophilized, and reconstituted in an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 10% (v/v) mercaptoethanol. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunolocated with either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies using procedures described below. Media from cultures containing only rAgg1 (with or without retinoic acid) from the cells embedded in agarose were dialyzed exhaustively against distilled H2O, lyophilized, and reconstituted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (at a concentration of 1 μg/μl rAgg1) containing 10% (v/v) mercaptoethanol. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunolocation as described below. Samples containing native recombinant IGD substrate and its catabolites were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide slab gels in SDS using procedures described by Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the fractionated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose and immunolocated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M1 or monoclonal antibody BC-3 (anti-ARG … ) and a subsequent alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody using procedures previously described (2Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Fosang A.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In general, the immunoblots were incubated with substrate for 5–15 min at room temperature to achieve optimum color development. For experiments establishing antibody BC-3 specificity duplicate lanes containing 1 μg of rAgg1 substrate and product generated from cultures exposed to retinoic acid for 96 h were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The lanes were separated and one replicate was immunolocated with antibody BC-3 (1:10,000) alone, and the second replicate was immunolocated with BC-3 antibody (1:10,000) that had been preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 2.8 mg/ml synthetic peptide containing the amino-terminal sequence ARGSVI … that was prepared with free amino and carboxyl termini on an Applied Biosystems 431A automated synthesizer using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry with the peptide purified on a C8 reverse-phase column, and the structure was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis (Advanced Biotechnology Center, Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School). Second antibody and substrate development were as described above. Transfection of the recombinant IGD construct into COS-7 cells resulted in the cellular expression and subsequent secretion of the recombinant IGD product into the medium. The use of an anti-FLAG M1 affinity gel facilitated its purification from the transfected cell medium. One liter of transfected COS cell medium yielded 1–3 mg of rAgg1. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2) indicated that under non-reducing conditions (lane 1), rAgg1 formed large molecular mass aggregates (124 and >200 kDa) due to the presence of an uneven number of cysteine residues in the human immunoglobulin domain of the molecule. This aggregate formation facilitated immobilization of the recombinant IGD substrate in the agarose cultures (see below). Under reducing conditions the recombinant IGD construct occurred as two molecular weight components having estimated molecular masses of 72 and 39 kDa (see Fig. 2, lane 2). Densitometric analysis of a Coomassie Blue-stained gel of the separated recombinant IGD construct showed that the ratio of the 72- to 39-kDa band was approximately 10:1 (results not shown). Amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the 72-kDa form consisted of the correct FLAG and IGD peptide sequence. However, amino acid sequence analysis of the 39-kDa form gave the sequence DYKDDDDKTEPKSXD …, indicating that the IGD sequence had been deleted (see Fig. 1). This deletion most likely occurs through the use of a previously reported alternate splice donor site contained in the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the amino terminus of the IGD (31Valhmu W.B. Palmer G.D. Rivers P.A. Ebara S. Cheng J.-F. Fischer S. Ratcliffe A. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the splice acceptor site of the hinge region of the genomic DNA segment encoding the human IgG1 gene (see Fig. 1). A disparity occurs in the calculated molecular mass and the observed SDS-PAGE migration of the 72-kDa isoform of reduced rAgg1 that contains the IGD. We have performed enzymatic deglycosylation analyses that indicate the presence of both O- andN-glycosylation amounting to approximately 10 kDa (data not shown). In addition, we have also used MALDI (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization) spectroscopy to obtain a more accurate molecular weight of the reduced 72-kDa rAgg1 substrate. These results indicate a molecular mass of approximately 55 kDa (data not shown). Collectively, these data more closely reflect the calculated molecular weight and indicate that the 72-kDa isoform has an anomalous migration in SDS-PAGE analyses. rAgg1 was immobilized in agarose cell cultures containing rat chondrosarcoma chondrocytes and maintained in medium with or without retinoic acid for 96 h. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of rAgg1 and its metabolites released into the culture media are shown in Fig. 3. Immunolocation with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M1 (recognizing an epitope in the FLAG domain at the amino terminus of the recombinant substrate) showed no differences in the pattern of rAgg1 metabolites present in medium from either control cultures or retinoic acid-treated cultures (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). However, immunolocation with monoclonal antibody BC-3 (anti-ARG … ) showed positive reactivity only in the retinoic acid-treated culture medium where it reacted with a band migrating at approximately 66 kDa that was not recognized by the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M1 (Fig. 3, lane 4,lower arrow). Immunolocation with BC-3 showed no reactivity in control cultures without retinoic acid treatment (Fig. 3, lane 3). This result indicates that aggrecanase catabolism of the 72-kDa form of rAgg1 has occurred through the removal of a small peptide (∼6 kDa), containing the FLAG epitope from the amino terminus of the rAgg1 construct. As expected, there was no evidence that the 39-kDa isoform had been catabolized since it did not contain the IGD sequence. Immunoblot analyses with antibody BC-3 were also performed on media obtained from cultures with and without retinoic acid exposure where no rAgg1 was added. No glycosaminoglycan was detected in the medium from these cultures. In addition, Western blot analysis of the medium showed no immunostaining with antibody BC-3. This indicates that insufficient amounts of endogenous rat aggrecan were synthesized by the cells maintained in serum-free culture for 4 days for it to act as an endogenous substrate for aggrecanase activity (results not shown). This conclusion is also supported by the observation that retinoic acid essentially completely inhibits aggrecan synthesis in monolayer cultures (3Lark M.W. Gordy J.T. Weidner J.R. Ayala J. Kimura J.H. Williams H.R. Mumford R.A. Flannery C. Carlson S.S. Iwata M. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2550-2556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In a subsequent experiment we used this culture system to investigate whether retinoic acid-induced aggrecanase activity could diffuse from the agarose containing the cells and catabolize rAgg1 sequestered in the medium (probably because of its large aggregate properties). For these experiments, the chondrocytes were suspended in agarose alone. The rAgg1 substrate was added to control or retinoic acid-containing medium, and culture media were harvested at 16, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Thus, to catabolize the rAgg1 aggregates the aggrecanase activity would have to diffuse through the agarose and into the medium. The results of immunolocation analyses of the rAgg1 medium metabolites with antibody BC-3 are shown in Fig.4 A. These results indicate that aggrecanase-generated products occur after 48 h of retinoic acid exposure (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4–6). At 72 and 96 h a BC-3 positive slower migrating band of approximately 121 kDa was evident. This band probably represents a minor aggrecanase product of aggregated rAgg1 that results from incomplete reduction. Data supporting this conclusion are indicated in Fig. 4 Cwhere only 1 μg of rAgg1 (96 h) was loaded, and this minor component was not detected. No evidence of aggrecanase activity was evident in control cultures after 96 h (Fig. 4, A andC, lane 1). These results suggest that aggrecanase can occur as a non-cell-associated proteolytic activity that is present in the conditioned medium. Additional experiments were also performed to discriminate better the undigested substrate from the 66-kDa aggrecanase-generated product. Fig. 4 B shows immunolocation analysis of rAgg1 medium metabolites (1 μg) from cultures exposed to retinoic acid for 96 h (Fig. 4 B, lane 1) that was subsequently reprobed with anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4 B,lane 2) to identify undigested substrate containing the FLAG sequence at the amino terminus. These results clearly show the molecular mass shift from the 72-kDa undigested rAgg1 isoform to the 66-kDa aggrecanase-generated BC-3 positive product. In addition, we also performed experiments to verify the specificity of the BC-3 antibody (Fig. 4 C). Lane 1 of Fig.4 C shows BC-3 positive immunoreactivity on rAgg1 metabolites (1 μg) present in medium from cultures treated with retinoic acid for 96 h. However, this BC-3 reactivity is completely removed by preincubation of the antibody with 2.8 mg/ml synthetic peptide containing the amino-terminal sequence ARGSVI … . This result confirms the specificity of monoclonal antibody BC-3 as previously reported (2Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Fosang A.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Similar experiments with freshly isolated bovine articular chondrocytes substituting for Rx cells in agarose culture with and without retinoic acid exposure were also performed. The results of immunolocation analyses of media with antibody BC-3 at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h of culture are shown in Fig. 5. The results indicate that for bovine chondrocytes rAgg1 catabolites produced by aggrecanase are evident between 96 and 120 h of culture in the presence of retinoic acid. The result also suggests that aggrecanase activity is diffusible and takes approximately 48–72 h longer to be expressed in bovine chondrocytes compared with the Rx rat chondrosarcoma cell cultures (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and6). An experiment was performed to demonstrate the diffusible properties of aggrecanase. Conditioned medium (120 h) from both control and retinoic acid-treated bovine cultures were collected and centrifuged to remove any insoluble components, and 1 ml of the supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of rAgg1 for 16 h at 37 °C. Replicate samples without rAgg1 substrate were treated similarly (as controls). After incubation, the samples were processed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the Western blots were immunolocated with antibody BC-3 (Fig. 6). No immunopositive BC-3 reactivity was seen in the control medium (Fig. 6,lane 1) or in media that were incubated without rAgg1 (results not shown). However, medium from retinoic acid-treated cultures showed strong BC-3 reactivity (Fig. 6, lane 2) indicating that aggrecanase was a soluble proteolytic activity present in the conditioned medium. These results are the first report of the production and use of a recombinant protein substrate for the study of aggrecanase activity. In addition, we have developed a novel cell culture system to monitor aggrecanase activity without the complication of endogenous aggrecan acting as a substrate. The unique aggregating properties of this artificial substrate (rAgg1) facilitated its immobilization in the agarose cell culture system and also its sequestration in the medium compartment for other studies demonstrating the diffusible properties of this activity. Furthermore, we were able to use freshly isolated chondrocytes without the need to establish an endogenous extracellular matrix to act as a substrate for monitoring aggrecanase activity. The results obtained with the recombinant IGD construct demonstrate that there is not a need for a G1 and/or a G2 domain on the IGD of aggrecan for cleavage at the aggrecanase site. The rAgg1 construct showed no positive staining on Western blot analysis with an anti-keratan sulfate antibody 5-D-4 (results not shown). Therefore, there appears to be no requirement for keratan sulfate chains within the IGD that may give rigidity to this region in the native aggrecan molecule. The induction of aggrecanase activity in rat chondrosarcoma cells (2Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Fosang A.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem.

Our studies demonstrate that aggrecanase activity is only expressed several hours after the chondrocytes are exposed to retinoic acid. Interestingly, the same time period (48 h) is required for aggrecanase induction from both rat chondrosarcoma monolayer cell cultures (3Lark M.W. Gordy J.T. Weidner J.R. Ayala J. Kimura J.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2550-2556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and the same cells maintained in agarose cultures (this study). This finding indicates that the presence of the agarose matrix is not impeding the diffusion of aggrecanase into the conditioned media. This suggests that time may be required for synthesis and processing of the proteolytic activity. Alternatively, expression of aggrecanase activity may require time for the involvement of additional enzyme cascades to produce the active form(s) of the enzyme. This time-dependent expression of aggrecanase was demonstrated using two different animal sources of chondrocytes exposed to retinoic acid. In addition, there were different times required for the appearance of aggrecanase activity (synthesis and/or activation) using chondrocytes from the two different animal species. Finally, our studies provide evidence that aggrecanase activity can occur in the medium free from association with the cell surface of the chondrocyte. Additional evidence supporting this conclusion came from the specific experiment where we isolated the medium prior to the addition of the rAgg1 substrate and then incubated the retinoic acid-treated conditioned media with rAgg1 in the absence of cells. After 16 h of cell-free incubation with rAgg1 BC-3, positive products were observed (Fig. 6, lane 2) that were identical to those in Fig. 5, lane 6 (120 h). Thus, the aggrecanase activity produced by the cells in culture can be manifested in the complete absence of cells. The identity of aggrecanase is still not known. Our findings of the diffusible properties of this enzyme still leave open the possibility that it could belong to several families of proteases, including matrix metalloproteinases that express their activity at physiological pH. This newly developed culture system will prove useful for further studies of the molecular mechanisms involved in aggrecan degradation by aggrecanase. It is also a novel experimental approach that could be considered for studies of the catabolism of other matrix macromolecules given the availability of recombinant substrates and neoepitope antibodies."

Here, we investigated the consequence of IκBR overexpression on the expression of NF-κB-regulated chemokine genes in lung alveolar epithelial cells. Chemokines play an important role in many inflammatory diseases such as asthma and AIDS. Overexpression of IκBR in the lung cells resulted in a rapid 50–100-fold greater production of the RANTES (regulated upon activation, normalTexpressed and presumablysecreted) protein upon cytokine-induction compared with control cells. IκBR overexpression, however, did not enhance interleukin-8 or MIP-1α gene expression, despite the fact that the expression of all three chemokine genes are regulated by NF-κB. The up-regulation of RANTES gene expression resulting from overexpression of IκBR correlated with increased amounts of a unique RANTES-κB binding activity and decreased binding of p50 homodimers. Previous studies have shown that p50 homodimers function as repressors of certain κB sites.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10680-10685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). IκBR belongs to the IκB family of proteins that function as cytoplasmic retention proteins for the Rel-NF-κB transcription factors and serve to regulate their functions (2Verma I.S. Stevenson J.K.

Several members of the IκB family have now been identified that, in vertebrates, include IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, IκBR, Bcl-3, p105, and p100 (reviewed in Refs. 2Verma I.S. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M.

So far, five members of the NF-κB family have been described that are c-Rel, NF-κB1 (p50), NF-κB2 (p52), RelA (p65), and RelB (reviewed in Refs. 4Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev.

Most members of the NF-κB family can form homo- or heterodimers (except for RelB, which only forms heterodimers with p50 or p52) that bind slightly different κB motifs (2Verma I.S. Stevenson J.K.

The existence of multiple homo- and heterodimeric forms of NF-κB-Rel proteins in a given cell type requires tight regulation of their activity that appears to be achieved via differential interactions with different IκB proteins. For example, both IκBα and IκBβ inhibit the DNA binding activity of p50-p65 heterodimers but not that of the p50 homodimer (2Verma I.S. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S.

Bcl-3, on the other hand, interacts with (p50)2 or (p52)2 and has been reported to behave as a transactivator (2Verma I.S. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S.

Because gene knockout studies indicate that the different NF-κB-Rel proteins are not functionally redundant (2Verma I.S. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S.

Noso N. Carroll M. Davies D.E. Holgate S. Schroder J.-M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1806-1812PubMed Google Scholar). In a murine model of endotoxemia, significant levels of RANTES mRNA and protein were detected in lung homogenates of mice following intraperitoneal administration of endotoxin and RANTES mRNA was detected as early as 1–2 h post endotoxin stimulation in the lung (24VanOtteren G.M. Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Paine R.r. Greenberger M.J. Danforth J.M. Burdick M.D. Standiford T.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1900-1908PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the RANTES protein was immunolocalized to the alveolar epithelium in this setting and was implicated in macrophage recruitment in the lungs (24VanOtteren G.M. Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Paine R.r. Greenberger M.J. Danforth J.M. Burdick M.D. Standiford T.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1900-1908PubMed Google Scholar). In other studies, the cytokine TNFα was shown to induce RANTES mRNA at 16 h post-stimulation in lung epithelial cells (25Stellato C. Beck L.A. Gorgone G.A. Proud D. Schall T.J. Ono S.J. Lichtenstein L.M. Schleimer R.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar). Although lung-derived RANTES has been implicated in the recruitment of eosinophils in the lungs of asthmatics, little is known at the molecular level about mechanisms that control RANTES gene expression in lung cells. Clearly, an understanding of such mechanisms could be useful in the design of drugs to combat asthma on the one hand and for developing strategies for suppressing HIV-1 infection via overproduction of RANTES on the other.Here we show that overexpression of IκBR can selectively up-regulate cytokine-induced expression of the RANTES gene in lung epithelial cells. Furthermore, this up-regulation of RANTES gene expression is associated with increased binding of a unique NF-κB complex to the RANTES κB region and decreased binding of p50 homodimers.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo address the effect of IκBR on NF-κB-mediated chemokine gene regulation in lung epithelial cells, we established A549 clones stably expressing epitope-tagged IκBR, named A549/IκBR. IκBR was epitope-tagged to distinguish the protein expressed from the expression vector from other endogenous IκB proteins. A pool of stable transfectants were incubated with IL-1α or TNFα for various lengths of time and analyzed for expression of different chemokine mRNAs by Northern blotting techniques. In control A549/vector cells, TNFα induced a very low level of RANTES mRNA expression at 24 h post-stimulation, and the level of induction with IL-1α was barely detectable even after 24 h (Fig. 1). In contrast, in A549/IκBR cells, both TNFα and IL-1α caused an up-regulation of RANTES gene expression as early as 2 h post-stimulation, which continued to increase even at 24 h after stimulation. We then tested whether IκBR overexpression specifically up-regulated RANTES gene expression or the expression of other NF-κB-regulated genes such as IL-8 (31Kunsch C. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell.

As illustrated in Fig.1 A, IL-8 gene expression induced by either IL-1α or TNFα was partly inhibited in A549/IκBR cells. We also studied the effect of IκBR overexpression on the expression of MIP1α, whose induced expression is barely detectable in A549 cells. Overexpression of IκBR failed to up-regulate IL-1α- or TNFα-induced MIP1α expression in these cells (data not shown). We tested the culture supernatants for the presence of RANTES and IL-8 proteins. As shown in Fig.1 B, the protein data were in good agreement with the Northern analyses. At 6 h post-stimulation with IL-1α or TNFα, A549/IκBR cells produced 50- and 100-fold more RANTES than the control cells. The results of these experiments showed that IκBR preferentially up-regulated RANTES gene expression in A549 cells.To determine whether the IκBR-mediated up-regulation of cytokine-induced RANTES mRNA expression was associated with activation of the RANTES promoter, A549/vector and A549/IκBR cells were transiently transfected with a reporter gene (luciferase) construct containing ∼900 nucleotides from the 5′-flanking region immediately upstream of the transcription start site of the RANTES gene (27Nelson P.J. Kim H.T. Manning W.C. Goralski T.J. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2601-2612PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nelson P.J. Ortiz B.D. Pattison J.M. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1139-1148PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region of the RANTES gene contains two NF-κB-binding sites in tandem, termed A and B (see Fig. 3 and Refs.27Nelson P.J. Kim H.T. Manning W.C. Goralski T.J. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2601-2612PubMed Google Scholar and 28Nelson P.J. Ortiz B.D. Pattison J.M. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1139-1148PubMed Google Scholar). In A549/vector cells, the RANTES promoter was activated by IL-1α or TNFα between 1.5–2-fold (Fig.2). In contrast, in A549/IκBR cells, IL-1α and TNFα activated the RANTES promoter between 7–8- and 8–10-fold, respectively (Fig. 2). Mutations in the A and B sites in the context of the 900-base pair promoter abolished reporter gene activity in both cell types. The difference between the level of RANTES mRNA expression and the fold induction of the RANTES promoter in cytokine-induced A549/IκBR cells can be attributed to the stability of RANTES mRNA. RANTES mRNA lacks the destabilizing AUUUA sequence in its 3′-untranslated region (14Schall T.J. Jongstra J. Dyer B.J. Jorgensen J. Clayberger C. Davis M.M. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1018-1025PubMed Google Scholar). This probably explains why RANTES mRNA induced by TNFα or IFN-γ was reduced by only 30% after incubation for 4 h in the presence of actinomycin D (25Stellato C. Beck L.A. Gorgone G.A. Proud D. Schall T.J. Ono S.J. Lichtenstein L.M. Schleimer R.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar). IL-8, on the other hand has a half-life of less than 1 h in epithelial cells (38Kwon O.J. Au B.T. Collins P.D. Baraniuk J.N. Adcock I.M. Chung K.F. Barnes P.J. Immunology. 1994; 81: 389-394PubMed Google Scholar). Because mRNA destabilization appears to play an insignificant role in the regulation of RANTES production, it stands to reason that an up-regulation of RANTES promoter activity by IL-1 or TNF in A549/IκBR cells would cause a significant difference in steady-state levels of RANTES mRNA and protein levels between the IκBR-overexpressing cells and the control cells.Figure 3Augmented binding of an NF-κB-Rel complex to the RANTES NF-κB region with nuclear extracts from A549/IκBR cells. A549/vector or A549/IκBR cells were either left untreated or treated with hIL-1α or hTNFα and collected at the indicated times for the preparation of nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts (4 μg) were incubated with 20,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the RANTES κB region containing two κB-binding sequences A and B in tandem (28Nelson P.J. Ortiz B.D. Pattison J.M. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1139-1148PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts prepared from cells stimulated with hTNFα for 2 h were used to assess DNA binding activity by EMSAs in the presence or the absence of the indicated oligonucleotides (at 100-fold molar excess) or antibodies (1–2 μg/20-μl reaction volume). The anti-p50 Ab used in lane 8 was the anti-NLS Ab (114x; Santa Cruz Biotech.). All of these antibodies, including the anti-FLAG Ab M2 (47Zhang X.-K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), have been previously used by us and other investigators in EMSAs. The major DNA-protein complexes (I, II, and III) are indicated on the right. Theopen arrow indicates a nonspecific complex. The oligonucleotides containing the wt RANTES κB sites (underlined) or mutated A and B sites are shown. Different preparations of nuclear extracts yielded essentially identical data with some differences in the intensity of the nonspecific band. The binding reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% native polyacrylamide gels (1Ray P. Zhang D.-H. Elias J.A. Ray A. J. Biol.

Cells were transiently transfected with a RANTES promoter-reporter construct that included ∼900 nucleotides of the region immediately upstream of the transcription start site and the complete 5′-untranslated region excluding the translational start site (27Nelson P.J. Kim H.T. Manning W.C. Goralski T.J. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2601-2612PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nelson P.J. Ortiz B.D. Pattison J.M. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1139-1148PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in 60-mm Petri dishes were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method with 1.5 μg of the reporter plasmid together with 1 μg of RSVβgal (a vector for constitutive expression of β-galactosidase for monitoring transfection efficiency) and carrier plasmid adding up to a total of 10 μg of DNA. 16 h after transfection, cells were washed, treated with recombinant hIL-1α (5 ng/ml) or hTNFα (50 ng/ml), and harvested 6 h later for assaying β-galactosidase and luciferase activity. The data are representative of three independent experiments with deviations of not more than 10% between experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined the possibility that the IκBR-mediated up-regulation of RANTES promoter activity was associated with altered binding of protein(s) to the RANTES κB region. Toward this end, EMSAs were performed with nuclear fractions of cytokine-induced A549/IκBR cells and A549/vector cells and a radiolabeled 32-base pair double stranded oligonucleotide containing the two RANTES NF-κB sites as the probe. Although IL-1α and TNFα caused induction of NF-κB DNA binding activity in both cell types, the DNA-protein complexes formed with the activated proteins were not identical with nuclear extracts prepared from the two cell types (Fig. 3). As illustrated in Fig. 3, the binding intensity of complex I was equivalent in the two cell types. The intensity of complex II was 2–3-fold greater with nuclear extracts of A549/vector cells compared with that observed with A549/IκBR nuclear extracts. However, the intensity of complex III was at least 10–15-fold (as judged by densitometric scanning) greater with nuclear extracts of A549/IκBR cells compared with that observed with extracts of control cells (Fig.3, lower panel). Two additional minor complexes migrating more slowly than complex I were also obtained with extracts of both cell types. All of these complexes were specific because an excess of the same unlabeled oligonucleotide efficiently competed for formation of the complexes, whereas an oligonucleotide containing mutations in the κB sites failed to compete (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and7, respectively). Because different members of the NF-κB-Rel family could potentially interact with the κB motifs, we used specific antibodies to determine the composition of the different polypeptide complexes. Formation of complex I was affected with both anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies, suggesting that it contained the classic p50-p65 heterodimer (lanes 8 and 9). Complex II and complex III formation were both affected only by the anti-p50 antibody (lane 8). The complex migrating immediately after (slower than) complex I was affected only by the anti-p65 antibody (lane 9). This complex may contain a p65 homodimer. None of the complexes were inhibited/supershifted by the antibodies against c-Rel, p52, and RelB (lanes 10–12). Also, IκBR itself did not appear to be present in any of the complexes because a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Ab M2; IBI/Kodak) had no effect on the complexes (lane 13).The ability of the anti-p50 antibody to affect both complex II and complex III formation and the selective augmentation of complex III formation with the A549/IκBR nuclear extracts prompted us to further analyze the nature of both II and III. Toward this end, we first tested whether recombinant p50 (Promega) could bind to the RANTES κB region. The recombinant p50 was derived from a full-length cDNA encoding 453 amino acids (39Schmid R.M. Perkins N.D. Duckett C.S. Andrews P.C. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) that was identical to the human p50 cDNA described previously (40Kieran M. Blank V. Logeat F. Vandekerckhove J. Lottspelch F. Le Ball O. Urban M.B. Kourilsky P. Baeuerle P.A. Israel A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1007-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, p50 homodimers bound to the RANTES κB region. As expected, the (p50)2-DNA complex could be supershifted with the anti-p50 antibody but not with the anti-p65 (used as control) antibody (Fig. 4 A). Also, in accordance with previous findings (31Kunsch C. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6137-6146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kunsch C. Lang R.K. Rosen C.A. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 153-164PubMed Google Scholar), recombinant p50 did not interact with the IL-8 κB site (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, the (p50)2-RANTES κB complex comigrated with complex II (compare lanes 1, 4, and 5 in Fig.4 A).Figure 4The IκBR-augmented DNA binding activity is not (p50)2 but may be a heterodimer containing p50.EMSAs were carried out with either recombinant p50 (rp50; Promega) or nuclear extracts (n.e.) of A549/IκBR cells. A,32P-labeled RANTES oligonucleotide was incubated with rp50 in the presence (lanes 2 and 3) or the absence of the anti-NLS anti-p50 Ab or an anti-p65 Ab (372x; Santa Cruz Biotech., used as a control). The samples were analyzed in parallel with binding reactions carried out with nuclear extracts from control and A549/IκBR cells and the RANTES probe (lanes 4 and5, respectively). The binding of rp50 to the IL-8 κB site was also examined in the same experiment. B, the ability of the anti-NLS Ab and the anti-NH2-terminal anti-p50 Ab (1191x; Santa Cruz Biotech.) to supershift/inhibit binding of rp50 or A549/IκBR nuclear proteins to the RANTES probe was investigated.C, nuclear extracts of A549/IκBR cells were incubated with the wt RANTES probe with or without (lane 1) a 100-fold molar excess of oligonucleotides containing a wt (lane 2) or a mutated (lane 3) IL-8 κB site. D, binding reactions were performed with A549/IκBR nuclear extracts and the wt (lane 1) or mutant RANTES probes containing either a mutant A site and a wt B site (mAwtB; lane 2) or a wt A site and a mutant B site (wtAmB; lane 3). Binding reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% native polyacrylamide gels (1Ray P. Zhang D.-H. Elias J.A. Ray A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10680-10685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because both complexes II and III could not contain (p50)2and the data in Fig. 4 A suggested that complex II contained (p50)2, we further investigated the composition of the faster migrating complex III with two different anti-p50 antibodies. Although the first antibody (114x; Santa Cruz Biotech) recognizes sequences mapping within the nuclear localization signal (NLS) region of p50, the second antiserum (1191x; Santa Cruz Biotech) was raised against the NH2-terminal of p50. Both antibodies supershifted the RANTES DNA-(p50)2 complex (Fig.4 B). However, the anti-NLS antibody but not the anti-NH2-terminal antibody supershifted complex III (Fig.4 B). The latter antibody did not inhibit complex I (p50-p65) formation either (Fig. 4 B). This was consistent with previous reports showing weaker effects of some p50-specific antisera on p50 heterodimers than on p50 homodimers (32Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lernbecher T. Muller U. Wirth T. Nature. 1993; 365: 767-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that complex III did not consist of p50 homodimers.Because our Northern analyses and ELISAs showed that IκBR overexpression actually slightly inhibited IL-8 gene expression, we tested the ability of the IL-8 κB site to compete in the EMSA. At a 100-fold molar excess, the wt IL-8 κB sequence did compete for formation of complex III, albeit incompletely (Fig. 4 C,lane 4). The binding of the p50-p65 heterodimer (complex I) was only partially competed for by the wt IL-8 κB sequence (Fig. 4C,lane 4). This was in accordance with previous reports showing the preferential binding of p65-c-rel heterodimers rather than p50-p65 heterodimers to the IL-8 κB site (31Kunsch C. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6137-6146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kunsch C. Lang R.K. Rosen C.A. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 153-164PubMed Google Scholar, 35Parry G.C.N. Mackman N. J. Biol.

In published data, we demonstrated that interleukin-1, in contrast to endothelin, selectively generates ether-linked diglyceride species (alkyl, acyl- and alkenyl, acylglycerols) in rat mesangial cells, a smooth muscle-like pericyte in the glomerulus. We now demonstrate both in intact cell and in cell-free preparations that these interleukin-1 receptor-generated ether-linked diglycerides inhibit immunoprecipitated protein kinase C δ and ε but not ζ activity. Neither interleukin-1 nor endothelin affect de novo protein expression of these protein kinase C isotypes. As down-regulation of calcium-insensitive protein kinase C isotypes has been linked to antimitogenic activity, we investigated growth arrest as a functional correlate for IL-1-generated ether-linked diglycerides. Cell-permeable ether-linked diglycerides mimic the effects of interleukin-1 to induce a growth-arrested state in both G-protein-linked receptor- and tyrosine kinase receptor-stimulated mesangial cells.

Our laboratory has been investigating the early, lipid-mediated signal transduction pathways for inflammatory cytokines in MC with particular emphasis on the distinct molecular species of diglycerides (DG) generated and their regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity. We have demonstrated previously that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1α and the vasoconstrictor peptide, endothelin-1 (ET-1) generate distinct species of DG from different membrane-associated phospholipids in MC (1Musial A. Mandal A. Coroneos E. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21632-21638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Baldi E. Musial A. Kester M. Am. J.

IL-1 receptor activation selectively generates ether-linked species of DG, namely alkyl, acyl- and alkenyl, acylglycerols, whereas ET-1 receptor activation produces predominantly ester-linked diacylglycerols (1Musial A. Mandal A. Coroneos E. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21632-21638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has also demonstrated previously that these IL-1 generated ether-linked DG, in contrast to the PKC-activating diacylglycerols, inhibit total PKC activity as well as inhibit diacylglycerol-stimulated PKC α activation (1Musial A. Mandal A. Coroneos E. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21632-21638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In fact, ether-linked DG may competitively inhibit PKC activation induced by diacylglycerol species (4Daniel L.W. Small G.W. Schmidt J.D. Marasco C.J. Ishaq K. Piantadoss C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Additional studies support this signaling mechanism, as ether-linked DG fail to activate total PKC activity in vitro or only activate PKC in the presence of pharmacological concentrations of calcium (5Cabot M.C. Jaken S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Heymans F. DaSilva C. Marrec N. Godfroid J.J. Castagna M.

In light of these findings, our interest has now turned to regulation by ether-linked DG of specific PKC isotypes. The PKC family now includes 12 distinct isotypes subdivided into three categories (9Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The calcium-sensitive conventional PKCs consist of alpha (α), beta (β1 and β11), and gamma (γ) isotypes, while the calcium-insensitive novel isotypes include delta (δ), epsilon (ε), nu (η), mu (μ), and theta (θ). PKCs zeta (ζ), iota (ι), and lamda (λ) are known as atypical PKCs as they have only one cysteine-rich zinc finger domain and are not regulated by DG or phorbol esters. We have chosen to investigate the regulation of the calcium-insenstitive isotypes δ and ε by DG, as IL-1 receptor-mediated production of ether-linked DG is not accompanied by an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration (3Kester M. Mene P. Simonson M.S. Sedor J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Gallela G. Medini L. Stragliooto E. Stefanini P. Rise P. Jremoli E. Galli C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) It is not surprising that in addition to varying in primary structure, these PKC isotypes are differentially regulated in terms of expression, subcellular localization, cofactor, or substrate specificities and ligand activation (9Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 11Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which distinct receptors target specific PKC isotypes have not been elucidated. Mechanisms have focused on ligand-induced PKC translocation and/or down-regulation and catabolism as well as PKC accessory or binding proteins. We now hypothesize a novel acute mechanism by which inflammatory cytokine receptors form ether-linked DG species that competitively inhibit the bioactivity of calcium-insensitive PKC isotypes. Moreover, it is hypothesized that inhibition of calcium-insensitive PKC isotypes correlates with a growth-arrested, inflamed MC phenotype.

Cells were used in their 3rd to 15th passage. We have verified previously that the MC cultures are devoid of epithelial, endothelial, macrophage, and fibroblast contamination (12Kester M. J. Cell.

The cell lysate proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose blots were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with one of the polyclonal anti-PKC antibodies (1:1000 dilution) and then incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with the secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG, coupled to horseradish peroxidase at 1:5000 dilution. Enhanced chemiluminescence substrates were used to reveal positive bands according to the manufacturer's (Amersham Corp.) instructions. Confirming the results of another laboratory (14Huwiler A. Schulze-Luhoff E. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter S. Exp. Nephrol. 1993; 1: 19-25PubMed Google Scholar), we observed basal expression of PKC isotypes α, γ, δ, ε, and ζ, but not β in MC as well as in A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells (data not shown). To confirm the negative results with PKC β1 and β11 as well as the positive with PKC γ in MC, we utilized polyclonal antibodies from both Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) that were derived from different immunogens. Specificity of anti-PKC antibodies was determined on MC immunoprecipitates as described later. Human foreskin fibroblasts served as positive controls in all experiments. The immunoprecipitation of PKC isotypes and the subsequent reconstitution assay were adapted from previous methods (1Musial A. Mandal A. Coroneos E. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21632-21638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The bioactivity of the immunoprecipitate has been demonstrated with our polyclonal antibodies (15Pessino A. Passalacqua M. Sparatore B. Patrone M. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); and this immunoprecipitation strategy for PKC activity has been used successfully in MC (16Biswas P. Abboud H.E. Kiyomoto H.

Briefly, either PKC δ, ε, or ζ was immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates using 0.5 μg of polyclonal anti-PKC isotype (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The formed immunocomplexes were subsequently collected with goat anti-rabbit IgG agarose after a 2-h incubation at 4 °C. As described previously (1Musial A. Mandal A. Coroneos E. Kester M. J. Biol.

The phosphorylated proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified by laser densitometry. The concentration of our phospholipid-derived DG species was determined from the initial concentration of phospholipid precursor as described previously (1Musial A. Mandal A. Coroneos E. Kester M. J.

The phospholipase C reaction goes to completion and showed no preference for ester- or ether-linked phospholipids. We utilized either 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, 1-O-palmityl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, or phosphatidylcholine plasmalogen derived from bovine heart as phospholipid substrate. Thus, the prepared diacyl- and alkyl, acylglycerol species utilized in these PKC assays all consisted of 16:0 and 18:1 hydrocarbon substituents in the sn-1 andsn-2 position, respectively. The prepared alkenyl, acylglycerol species consisted predominantly of 16:0 and 18:1 substituents; 1-O-palmit-1′-ene-yl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol. 2Serdary Research (London, Ontario, Canada), personal communication. DG mass was confirmed by acetylation with 1 μCi of [14C]acetic anhydride and pyridine for 3 h at 37 °C. The DG acetates (diacyl-, R F = 0.465 ± 0.008; alkyl,acyl, R F = 0.585 ± 0.002; alkenyl,acyl, R F = 0.645 ± 0.005) are well resolved from underivatized DG (R F = 0.09 ± 0.01) using a hexane/diethyl/methanol/acetic acid, 90:20:3:2 (v/v/v/v) elution system followed by drying the TLC plates and then a toluene (100, v) TLC solvent system run in the identical direction. The DG acetate molecular species were also well resolved by C18 high performance liquid chromatography using an acetonitrile, 2-propranol, methyl-5-butyl ether, H20 elution system, 83:10:5:2 (v/v/v/v). Specificity of the immunoprecipitation procedure was determined by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitated PKC isotypes were resolubilized and run on 10% acrylamide gels. Blots which were probed for the immunoprecipitated isotype were subsequently stripped and reprobed with another anti-PKC antibody, upon which no positive bands were revealed. For example, Western blots of immunoprecipitated PKC δ revealed a 78-kDa band when anti-PKC δ, but not when anti-PKC ε, was used as a probe (data not shown). Also, the position of the band for each isotype corresponded to the correct molecular weight as determined by molecular weight markers. Furthermore, it has been shown that PKC isotype-specific peptide immunogens can abolish subsequent visualization of the PKC isotype by Western analysis. 3Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), personal communication. We determined that this procedure precipitated equal masses of each isotype by visualization of the protein bands on the membranes with Ponceau S (Sigma). Initial experiments investigated the DG cofactor requirement for the immunoprecipitated PKC isotypes. As a control, the kinase assay was performed in the absence of any immunoprecipitated PKC protein, which resulted in no observable histone phosphorylation. After immunoprecipitation of either PKC δ, ε, or ζ from treated MC,in vitro reconstitution assays were run with phosphatidylserine and either 100 nm (16:0, 18:1) diacylglycerol or vehicle control. Immunoprecipitated PKC δ and ε from ET (100 nm)-, but not IL-1 (10 ng/ml)-, stimulated MC could phosphorylate histone substrate in the absence of exogenous DAG (data not shown). In the presence of DAG, control-, and IL-1-induced histone phosphorylation was enhanced but was still significantly below the level observed from ET-stimulated cells. Supermaximal activation of immunoprecipitated PKC δ and ε from ET-treated MC was also observed when OAG or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate substituted for DAG in the kinase assay. Other laboratories have also noted a supermaximal stimulation of receptor-activated immunoprecipitated PKC isotypes in the presence of exogenous DAG or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (15Pessino A. Passalacqua M. Sparatore B. Patrone M. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,16Biswas P. Abboud H.E. Kiyomoto H. Wenzel U.O. Grandaliano G. Choudhury G.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast to PKC δ or ε, exogenous diacylglycerol had no effect upon either control or ET-stimulated PKC ζ bioactivity. This confirms numerous reports that activation of PKC ζ is DAG-independent. These data suggest, but do not prove, that ET, and not IL-1, treatment may induce a conformational or post-translational alteration of PKC δ, ε, and ζ, which can be maintained throughout the immunoprecipitation procedure. Proliferation of quiescent MC was evaluated by modification of our procedure to assess [3H]thymidine uptake into acid-insoluble DNA (17Coroneos E. Wang Y. Panuska J. Templeton D.J. Kester M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured into 12-well dishes and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 12% bovine serum albumin overnight. Twenty-four hours subsequent to the time of subculture, cells were down-regulated by incubation with serum-free medium for an additional 24 h. Cells were then stimulated with the appropriate agonist and further incubated for an additional 18 h, after which cells were pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine/ml of medium. Thymidine incorporation was stopped after 6 h by aspiration of medium and washing the cells twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were fixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 ml/well of fixing solution (40:50:10, v/v/v, water:methanol:acetic acid). A solution of 1% SDS (w/v) was applied to each well (0.5 ml/well) for 5 min at 4 °C. The SDS solution was then removed from each well and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Independent t tests were used to establish significant differences between groups. Thep value of the individual components was adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni method. All data points on the concentration-response curves are expressed as arithmetic means ± S.E. and analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting to logistical equations using the PRISM program (18Motulsky M. Intuitive Biostatistics. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1995Google Scholar). The goodness-of-fit for competitive and noncompetitive models were compared by an F test on the ratio of residual variance. To extend our previous studies, which demonstrate that IL-1-induced ether-linked DG inhibit total PKC activity (1Musial A. Mandal A. Coroneos E. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21632-21638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we now investigate if individual PKC isotypes are regulated via DG cofactor specificity. Utilizing intact cells, we asked if there were any effects of IL-1 pretreatment on either G-protein-coupled receptor (ET) or tyrosine kinase receptor-linked (PDGF) activation of novel and atypical calcium-insensitive immunoprecipitated PKC isotypes. IL-1- pretreatment diminished both ET- and PDGF-stimulated PKC δ and ε, but not ζ bioactivity (Fig. 1). In these experiments, IL-1 was added 5 min before a subsequent 5 min stimulation with either ET, PDGF, or vehicle. IL-1 had no significant effect, by itself, on any of these PKC isotypes. IL-1 pretreatment abrogated approximately 50% of either the ET- or PDGF-induced activation of PKC δ and ε. In additional data not shown, coincubation of IL-1 and ET for 10 min or IL-1 pretreatment for 5 min followed by a 30-min ET stimulation also significantly reduced PKC δ and ε activity. However, a 5- or 30-min incubation with IL-1 subsequent to a 5-min pretreatment with ET failed to significantly diminish PKC δ or ε activity (data not shown). At minimum, these studies suggest that a physiological function of IL-1 is, in part, to inhibit specific PKC isotypes and that IL-1, by itself, is incapable of stimulating MC PKC isotypes. At maximum, this inhibition may reflect the generation of second messengers that bind to, but do not activate, selected PKC isotypes. We next asked if an IL-1-induced second messenger, ether-linked DG, can mimic the effect of IL-1 to inhibit PKC isotypes in a cell-free system. Immunoprecipitated PKC isotypes from control MC were treated with exogenous alkenyl, acylglycerol (AAG, consisting primarily of 1-O-palmit-1′-ene-yl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol)) and/or DAG (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol) in the kinase assay buffer (Fig. 2). A dose-response relationship was determined with concentrations of AAG ranging from 10−6m to 10−10m, which were added to the kinase assay buffer already containing a fixed concentration of DAG (10−7m or 10−6m). Increasing concentrations of AAG dose-dependently inhibited PKC δ and ε activated with 0.1 μm DAG. Curve fitting analysis showed that inhibition of PKC δ by AAG was both highly potent (IC50 = 13 ± 2 nm) and effective (E max = 87 ± 3% reduction in activity). AAG was even more potent against PKC ε (IC50 = 1.9 ± 0.6 nm,E max = 55 ± 1%). Neither AAG nor DAG stimulated PKC ζ activity (data not shown). Also in data not shown, alkyl, acylglycerol (1-O-palmityl-2-oleoylglycerol) inhibited activated PKC δ and ε with a similar dose-response profile. This suggests that it is most likely the sn-1 ether or vinyl ether linkage and not the chain length or degree of saturation that leads to inhibition of PKC isotypes. To determine whether AAG inhibition was competitive with respect to DAG, we tested the effect of AAG on PKC activity stimulated with a 10-fold higher concentration of DAG (Fig. 2). The inhibitory effect of AAG was markedly blunted in the presence of 1.0 μm DAG. These data were analyzed according to either a competitive model (increase in IC50 with no concomitant change inE max) or a noncompetitive model (no change in IC50 with a decrease in E max). The competitive model gave the best fit for both PKC δ and ε (F(3,3) = 40 and 39, respectively; p < 0.01). Only the curves obtained in the competitive fit are shown in Fig. 2. These results show that DAG and AAG interact competitively and probably act at the same site on PKC. It may be inferred from these experiments that IL-1-induced ether-linked DG may function as second messengers to diminish the activity of calcium-insensitive PKC isotypes by binding to the DAG cofactor domain without leading to activation of PKC. We next investigated if the protein expression of PKC isotypes in MC can be differentially regulated by inflammatory cytokines or vasoactive peptides. Western blots depicting a time course of PKC δ, ε, and ζ expression after ET (10−7m) and IL-1 (10 ng/ml) treatment are shown in Fig. 3. There were no significant differences observed in the level of protein expression at any of the time points for either of the treatments. PDGF-ββ (10 ng/ml) treatment also did not significantly alter PKC δ, ε, or ζ expression over time (data not shown). In addition, IL-1 cotreatment with either ET or PDGF did not affect PKC isotype expression (data not shown). The constitutive expression of these PKC isotypes suggests that regulation of bioactivity by IL-1 is most likely a post-translational event and not a consequence of translational regulation or down-regulation by catabolism. We next investigated growth arrest as a physiological correlate for IL-1-induced ether-linked DG inhibition of selected PKC isotypes. Since physiological DG cannot penetrate the plasma membrane of intact cells, we utilized cell-permeable, sn-2 short chain, DG analogues. We initially asked if an ether-linked, cell-permeable, DG analogue could mimic the effect of AAG to reduce PKC activation. In cell-free systems, 1-palmityl-2-acetylglycerol (PAG) preincubation (5 min) reduced DAG (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylglycerol)-stimulated immunoprecipitated PKC δ and ε activity. Specifically, DAG (10−8m) activated PKC δ and ε 58 and 56%, respectively. PAG pretreatment reduced DAG stimulated activity to 6 and 4% of vehicle control for PKC δ and ε, respectively. Thus, we are confident in using PAG as an ether-linked DG analogue to potentially demonstrate inhibition of ET- or PDGF-induced proliferation. We next asked if either IL-1 or the cell-permeable, ether-linked, DG analogue can induce growth arrest. Quiescent MC, in the absence of serum, proliferated in response to both ET and PDGF, but not IL-1, stimulation (Fig. 4 A). However, IL-1 pretreatment reduced both ET (56%)- and PDGF (42%)-induced MC proliferation to a level consistent with the reduction of PKC δ and ε bioactivity by IL-1 pretreatment. We next asked if the ether-linked DG analogue, PAG, could mimic the effect of IL-1 to induce growth-arrest. PAG reduced ET-induced proliferation to basal levels (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the ester-linked DG analogue, OAG, elevated ET-induced proliferation. Both PAG and OAG did not by themselves significantly demonstrate any proliferative effect. As PAG can be metabolized into platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), we utilized a platelet-activating factor receptor blocker (BN52021) to show that this autacoid does not mediate the inhibitory actions of PAG upon proliferation (data not shown). These data suggest that IL-1-generated ether-linked DG can induce a growth-arrested state in both G-protein-linked receptor and tyrosine kinase receptor-stimulated MC. We conclude that the cell-permeable ether-linked DG analogue, PAG, not only mimics the actions of physiological (IL-1 receptor-generated) ether-linked DG to inhibit the activation of PKC isotypes, but also reduces ET- or PDGF-induced proliferation. We have demonstrated a signaling mechanism by which receptor generation of unique molecular species of diglycerides differentially regulate the bioactivity of individual PKC isotypes. Recent reports have also begun to establish a role for DG cofactor specificity for individual PKC isotypes. Supplementation of 1-O-hexadecylglycerol into fibroblasts of Zellweger patients leads to accumulation of ether-linked DG and a concomitant inhibition of bradykinin-induced translocation of PKC α, but not ε or ζ (19Clark K.J. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7097-7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol-derived DG preferentially containing arachidonate at the sn-2 position are a better cofactor for PKC α compared with PKC β or γ, in contrast to, phosphatidylcholine-derived DG species, which are equipotent in stimulating PKC isoenzymes (20Mahoney C.W. Huang K.P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: A1118Google Scholar). Interferon, which like IL-1, does not elevate [Ca2+] i and forms phosphatidylcholine-derived DG, translocates PKC ε but not α in Daudi cells (21Pfeffer L.M. Eisenkraft B.L. Reich N.C. Improta T. Baxter G. Daniel-Issakani S. Strulovici B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7988-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our studies may begin to clarify apparent paradoxes by demonstrating an acute receptor-mediated mechanism to diminish activation of selected PKC isotypes. Even though physiological ether-linked DG species have not been studied as growth-arresting lipids, ether-linked phospholipids and alkyl phosphocholine have recently been identified as antineoplastic, antiproliferative, and apoptosis-inducing agents (22Wieder T. Hasse A. Geilen C.C. Orfanos C.E. Lipids. 1995; 30: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Araki S. Tsuna I. Kaji K. Hayashi H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 1-O-Octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerophosphocholine, an alkyllysophospholipid analogue, reduced cell proliferation by decreasing serum- or PDGF-activated MAP kinases (24Zhou X. Lu X. Richard C. Xiong W. Litchfield D.W. Bittman R. Arthur G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Both alkyllysophospholipid and hexadecylphosphocholine reduced membrane-associated and cytosolic total PKC activity (25Berkovic D. Berkovic K. Fleer E.A. Eibl H. Unger C. Eur. J. Cancer. 1994; 30A: 509-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 1-O-Dodecyl-sn-glycerol, a monoalkylglycerol, reduced membrane-associated total PKC activity, which correlated with cell culture contact inhibition and resulting growth arrest (26Warne T.R. Buchanan F.G. Robinson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11147-11154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Also, in agreement with our studies, a cell-permeable ether-linked DG analogue (1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetylglycerol), but not an ester-linked DG analogue (1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-rac-glycerol), inhibited cell growth and induced the differentiation of HL60 human promyelocytic leukemic cells to mononuclear phagocytes (27McNamara M.J.C. Schmitt J.D. Wykle R. Daniel L.W. Bichem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, ether-linked DG inhibition of selected PKC isotypes may, in part, be the signaling mechanism by which inflammatory cytokine receptor-generated ether-linked DG induce a growth-arrested cellular phenotype. Our studies suggest that one of the major physiological outcomes of IL-1-mediated inhibition of calcium-insensitive PKC activity may be the induction of a growth-arrested phenotype. Previous studies have also suggested that inhibition and/or down-regulation of calcium-insensitive isotypes lead to changes in the cellular phenotype and/or growth arrest. Down-regulation of PKC ε or α inhibits G1/S transition (growth arrest) in vascular smooth muscle cells, an event consistent with cytokine-induced inflammation (28Mangoura D. Dawson G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2915-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Sassaguri T. Kosaka C. Hirata M. Masuda J. Shimokodo K. Fugishima M. Ogata Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of PKC ε induces tumorgenicity in fibroblasts (30Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G.

Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2095-2104PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that one component of IL-1 signaling is ether-linked DG inhibition of PKC δ and ε activity. However, other signaling pathways have been suggested, including the nuclear targeting of a 16-kDa N-terminal IL-1 cleavage product that may function as a trans-activating factor (32Stevenson F.T. Turck J. Locksley R.M. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1993; 4: 636AGoogle Scholar). Alternatively, the carboxyl end of IL-1 bound to the IL-1 receptor also localizes to the nucleus (33Weitzman M.N. Savage N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). IL-1 has also been shown to activate upstream kinases for heat shock proteins, β-casein, NF-κB, and cap-binding protein (34Guesdon F. Freshney N. Waller R.J. Rawlinson L. Saklatvala K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4236-4243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Cao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 36Guy G.R. Chua S.P. Wong N.S. Ng S.B. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14343-14352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory has demonstrated recently that IL-1 activates the stress-activated protein kinase cascade (also known as jun kinase) via ceramide formation (17Coroneos E. Wang Y. Panuska J. Templeton D.J. Kester M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As IL-1 does not activate ceramidase to form the putative PKC inhibitor sphingosine (37Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), we can rule out a role for IL-1-induced sphingosine to augment ether-linked DG-induced inhibition of PKC. On the other hand, ceramide inhibits PKC α translocation (38Jones M.J. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5007-5013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and autophosphorylation (39Lee J.Y. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13169-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) while inducing PKC ζ autophosphorylation (40Muller G. Ayoub M. Storz P. Rennecke J. Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In contrast to PKC δ and ε, PKC ζ was unaffected by DG, perhaps, reflecting the lack of a integral cysteine-rich zinc finger domain (9Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Regardless of mechanism, our data suggest that inhibition of activated PKC ζ is probably not essential for growth arrest. Even though IL-1 may not affect PKC ζ bioactivity directly, this inflammatory cytokine has been shown to induce translocation of PKC ζ from cytosol to a presumed membrane compartment in MC in the presence of serum (41Rzymkiewicz D.M. Tetsuka T. Daphna-Iken D. Srivastava S. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17241-17246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or after long term pretreatment (42Ganz M.B. Saska B. Saxena R. Hawkins K. Sedor J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F108-F113PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we have demonstrated that IL-1-induced ether-linked DG competitively inhibit activated calcium-insensitive PKC isotypes, an event consistent with a proinflammatory, growth-arrested phenotype. DG cofactor specificity for individual PKC isotypes may offer a more sensitive and specific mechanism for overall PKC regulation. Down-regulation of PKC δ and ε by IL-1-generated ether-linked DG may illustrate one mechanism by which a growth-arrested phenotype in MC can be induced and/or maintained in models of nonproliferative immunological renal disease (43Sedor J.R. Nakazato Y. Konieczkowski M. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 595-599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We thank Michael Simonson for critically reviewing this manuscript."

A. 1992; 89: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but the loss of methylation of DNA may be associated with transcriptional activation of this gene in mice and human lymphoma cells (10Tulchinsky E.

Tkatch T. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the natural mouse gene revealed two elements within the first intron that may be involved in regulating the expression of the S100A4 (mts1) gene in this species (12Tulchinsky E. Kramerov D. Ford H.L. Reshetnyak E. Lukanidin E. Zain S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar).

Savin J. Dube S. Rudland P. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Tulchinsky E. Kramerov D. Ford H.L. Reshetnyak E. Lukanidin E. Zain S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar). However, the expression of the rat S100A4 (p9Ka) transgene under the control of its own promoter in transgenic mice suggests a different pattern of expression between these two species (5Davies M. Harris S. Rudland P. Barraclough R. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, additional regulatory elements in the rat S100A4 (p9Ka) gene have been sought which might affect rat S100A4 (p9Ka) levels in rat mammary epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONA 14-nucleotide pair cis-acting negative control element has been located approximately 1,300 bp upstream of the start site of transcription of the rat S100A4 (p9Ka) gene. Deletion of this region results in a 6-fold increase in the level of activity of a SPAP reporter gene when transiently transfected into a benign epithelial rat mammary cell line, Rama 37, which naturally displays only low levels of p9Ka mRNA and protein (17Barraclough R. Dawson K.J. Rudland P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). No such increase is observed when constructs bearing the same deletion are transfected into cell lines, Rama 37-E8 and Rama 800, which naturally express high levels of S100A4 (p9Ka). Gel mobility shift assays, DNase 1 footprinting in vitro, and footprinting experiments in vivo strongly suggest that there is a factor present in nuclear extracts of the Rama 37, Rama 37-E8, and Rama 800 cells that binds to thiscis-acting element. The degree of protection of nuclear extracts of the various cell lines corresponds inversely with the level of S100A4 (p9Ka) in the cell lines, suggesting a quantitative variation of a factor binding to the inhibitory region.The nucleotide sequence of the protected inhibitory region suggests that it contains a sequence which closely resembles the consensus binding sequence of GC factor (36Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This factor was originally identified by its binding to a regulatory region in the promoters of the genes for the human epidermal growth factor receptor, β actin, and the calcium-dependent protease, calpain (36Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The present paper is the first report of a GC factor binding site in a rat gene, and the first report of such a functional site in the gene for a S100 protein. It is not known whether the variation of the recognition sequence from the human consensus sequence reflects a species difference. However, the fact that an oligonucleotide corresponding to the consensus human GC-factor binding region effectively competes with the rat S100A4 (p9Ka) inhibitory sequence for binding of a factor in the rat cell nuclei suggests that the binding specificity of the rat factor is similar to that of the human GC-factor.Several lines of evidence point to the factor that resembles GC-factor being a regulator of the transcription of the S100A4 (p9Ka) gene in the rat mammary cells in vivo. The degree of protection of DNA in footprinting experiments in vivo and in vitrois in inverse relationship to the levels of S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA in the corresponding cells, raising the possibility that the GC-factor-like activity might regulate S100A4 expression in vivo. This interpretation is confirmed by the observation that a GC-factor-specific probe hybridizes to an mRNA from the rat cells that is the same size (3 kb) as that already described previously in human cells (36Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The level of this mRNA, as measured by a quantitative Northern blotting procedure using a GC-factor-specific probe, exhibits an inverse relationship with the level of S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA in nine out of ten rat mammary cell lines that exhibit differing levels of S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA. The one exception is a cell line made metastatic by the transfection of additional copies of the S100A4 (p9Ka) gene (3Davies B. Davies M. Gibbs F. Barraclough R. Rudland P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 999-1008PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line expresses S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA at a high level but shows the same level of GC-factor mRNA as the low expressing Rama 37 cells. The explanation of this observation is likely to be that the additional 10–20 transfected copies of the S100A4 (p9Ka) gene lead to elevated levels of S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA and protein by titrating out molecules of the GC-factor in the recipient Rama 37 cells. However, the alternative explanation that levels of GC-factor protein but not mRNA levels are reduced by some other mechanism by the transfection procedure cannot be entirely ruled out at this stage. The observation that a cell line, KP1-LNT1, from a lymph node metastasis arising from the KP1-R37 cells exhibits an S100A4 (p9Ka) level consistent with its level of GC factor mRNA suggests that other mechanisms in the development of a metastasizing tumor might regulate S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA levels in these cells. Such a mechanism, in this case, might be methylation of the S100A4 (p9Ka) gene, as reported previously for the mouse S100A4 (mts1) gene (11Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Tkatch T. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The results of the present experiments contrast with those previously obtained using metastatic and non-metastatic murine mammary cells in which no evidence of important cis-acting regulatory sequences were found in the 5′ region of the mouse S100A4 (mts1) gene in the region −41 to −1,897 upstream of the transcriptional start site (10Tulchinsky E. Ford H. Kramerov D. Reshetnyak E. Grigorian M. Zain S. Lukanidin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the difference between the results with the rat and mouse S100A4 genes is that in the mouse S100A4 (mts1) gene, any GC-factor-binding sequence might lie further upstream than the 0 to −1,897 region examined (10Tulchinsky E. Ford H. Kramerov D. Reshetnyak E. Grigorian M. Zain S. Lukanidin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This explanation is unlikely since an exactly conserved GC-factor binding site is located at −1,472 bp upstream of the start site of transcription of the S100A4 gene in the human genome (37Engelkamp D. Schäfer B.W. Mattei M.G. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6547-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Fig.9 A). An alternative explanation is that in the murine cells, the predominant mechanism regulating the S100A4 (mts1) gene is the 16-base pair protein binding region, 290 bp downstream of an enhancer element, in the first intron of the S100A4 (mts) gene, which resembles the CD3δ enhancer of T lymphocytes (12Tulchinsky E. Kramerov D. Ford H.L. Reshetnyak E. Lukanidin E. Zain S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar). Differential patterns ofin vivo footprinting between metastatic and non-metastatic variants of mouse mammary epithelial cells arise from differential methylation of this region of the genome in the murine cell lines studied (12Tulchinsky E. Kramerov D. Ford H.L. Reshetnyak E. Lukanidin E. Zain S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar), and possibly from the resultant creation by methylation of a novel inhibitory AP-1 site, 40 bp downstream of the 16-bp binding region (38Tulchinsky E. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1737-1745PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence that constitutes this potential AP-1 site specifically appears to be absent by deletion in the first intron of the rat S100A4 (p9Ka) gene, despite generally good conservation of the sequence of the flanking regions (Fig. 9 B) and the first intron generally between rat and mouse. This observation suggests a possible difference between inhibitory mechanisms in mouse and rat S100A4 genes. The findings might serve to explain differences between the distribution of S100A4 in the tissues of rats and mice reported previously (5Davies M. Harris S. Rudland P. Barraclough R. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) from an examination of the tissue distribution of the endogenous S100A4 gene in rats (39Gibbs F. Barraclough R. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P. Wilkinson M. Parry E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and mice (40Jackson-Grusby L.L. Swiergiel J. Linzer D.I.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6677-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and by the pattern of expression of rat S100A4 transgenes under the control of their own rat promoter in the tissues of transgenic mice (5Davies M. Harris S. Rudland P. Barraclough R. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In these mice, the tissue distribution of the rat S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA in the mouse cells was identical to that found in the rat and did not correspond to the distribution of the endogenous mouse S100A4 (mts1) mRNA when the respective mRNAs were analyzed by Northern blotting procedures on the same tissue specimens (5Davies M. Harris S. Rudland P. Barraclough R. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).These results suggest that there is a different emphasis in the regulation of the S100A4 gene between rats and mice. However, the consequence of overexpression of the S100A4 gene and its protein products in rat and mouse epithelial cells is the same, i.e.the induction of the metastatic phenotype in non-metastatic benign rodent mammary epithelial cells.As noted above, the sequence that is recognized by GC-factor in the rat epithelial cells is conserved exactly between rat and human DNA although its position relative to the start site of transcription is slightly different in the two species, −1,300 in the rat and −1,427 in the human (Fig. 9 A). In the human, the location is only 91 base pairs downstream of the poly(A)-addition site of the S100A3 gene (37Engelkamp D. Schäfer B.W. Mattei M.G. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6547-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Since in the rat cells, the level of GC-factor mRNA is inversely related to the level of S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA, suggesting a correlation between GC-factor mRNA and S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA levels, it is possible that changes in GC-factor levels might also be associated with the acquisition of metastatic capability in human breast cancer cells. S100A4 (p9Ka) is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins first identified in a cultured myoepithelial-like cell line, Rama 29 (1Barraclough R. Dawson K.J. Rudland P.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The S100A4 (p9Ka) gene has been isolated and its nucleotide sequence determined (2Barraclough R. Savin J. Dube S. Rudland P. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Elevation of the level of S100A4 (p9Ka) in benign, non-metastatic rat (3Davies B. Davies M. Gibbs F. Barraclough R. Rudland P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 999-1008PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse (4Grigorian M. Tulchinsky E. Zain S. Ebralidze A. Kramerov D. Kriajevska M. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Gene ( Amst .). 1993; 135: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) cells induces metastatic capability in some of the cells. Although mice containing multiple copies of a rat (5Davies M. Harris S. Rudland P. Barraclough R. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or mouse (6Ambartsumian N. Grigorian M. Larsen F. Karlstrom O. Sidenius N. Rygaard J. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1620-1621Google Scholar) S100A4 transgene show no observable phenotype, mice which contain cells that express both the rat S100A4 transgenes and the activated neu oncogene, or mouse S100A4 transgenes in a genetic background that yields primary mammary tumors, succumb to metastatic mammary tumors (6Ambartsumian N. Grigorian M. Larsen F. Karlstrom O. Sidenius N. Rygaard J. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1620-1621Google Scholar, 7Davies M. Rudland P. Robertson L. Parry E. Jolicoeur P. Barraclough R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1631-1637PubMed Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that overexpression of S100A4 in mammary tumors can yield the metastatic phenotype. Some rat and mouse cultured mammary epithelial cell lines of high metastatic potential contain elevated levels of S100A4, when compared with their non-metastatic counterparts (8Dunnington, D. J.

Mechanisms for the regulation of transcription of the murine S100A4 (mts1) gene have been investigated. It has been reported that cis-acting elements 5′ of the region immediately upstream of the TATA box play little or no part in transcription of the mouse S100A4 (mts1) gene (10Tulchinsky E. Ford H.

Thus, additional regulatory elements in the rat S100A4 (p9Ka) gene have been sought which might affect rat S100A4 (p9Ka) levels in rat mammary epithelial cells. DISCUSSIONA 14-nucleotide pair cis-acting negative control element has been located approximately 1,300 bp upstream of the start site of transcription of the rat S100A4 (p9Ka) gene. Deletion of this region results in a 6-fold increase in the level of activity of a SPAP reporter gene when transiently transfected into a benign epithelial rat mammary cell line, Rama 37, which naturally displays only low levels of p9Ka mRNA and protein (17Barraclough R. Dawson K.J. Rudland P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). No such increase is observed when constructs bearing the same deletion are transfected into cell lines, Rama 37-E8 and Rama 800, which naturally express high levels of S100A4 (p9Ka). Gel mobility shift assays, DNase 1 footprinting in vitro, and footprinting experiments in vivo strongly suggest that there is a factor present in nuclear extracts of the Rama 37, Rama 37-E8, and Rama 800 cells that binds to thiscis-acting element. The degree of protection of nuclear extracts of the various cell lines corresponds inversely with the level of S100A4 (p9Ka) in the cell lines, suggesting a quantitative variation of a factor binding to the inhibitory region.The nucleotide sequence of the protected inhibitory region suggests that it contains a sequence which closely resembles the consensus binding sequence of GC factor (36Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This factor was originally identified by its binding to a regulatory region in the promoters of the genes for the human epidermal growth factor receptor, β actin, and the calcium-dependent protease, calpain (36Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The present paper is the first report of a GC factor binding site in a rat gene, and the first report of such a functional site in the gene for a S100 protein. It is not known whether the variation of the recognition sequence from the human consensus sequence reflects a species difference. However, the fact that an oligonucleotide corresponding to the consensus human GC-factor binding region effectively competes with the rat S100A4 (p9Ka) inhibitory sequence for binding of a factor in the rat cell nuclei suggests that the binding specificity of the rat factor is similar to that of the human GC-factor.Several lines of evidence point to the factor that resembles GC-factor being a regulator of the transcription of the S100A4 (p9Ka) gene in the rat mammary cells in vivo.

The level of this mRNA, as measured by a quantitative Northern blotting procedure using a GC-factor-specific probe, exhibits an inverse relationship with the level of S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA in nine out of ten rat mammary cell lines that exhibit differing levels of S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA. The one exception is a cell line made metastatic by the transfection of additional copies of the S100A4 (p9Ka) gene (3Davies B. Davies M. Gibbs F. Barraclough R. Rudland P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 999-1008PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line expresses S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA at a high level but shows the same level of GC-factor mRNA as the low expressing Rama 37 cells. The explanation of this observation is likely to be that the additional 10–20 transfected copies of the S100A4 (p9Ka) gene lead to elevated levels of S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA and protein by titrating out molecules of the GC-factor in the recipient Rama 37 cells. However, the alternative explanation that levels of GC-factor protein but not mRNA levels are reduced by some other mechanism by the transfection procedure cannot be entirely ruled out at this stage. The observation that a cell line, KP1-LNT1, from a lymph node metastasis arising from the KP1-R37 cells exhibits an S100A4 (p9Ka) level consistent with its level of GC factor mRNA suggests that other mechanisms in the development of a metastasizing tumor might regulate S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA levels in these cells. Such a mechanism, in this case, might be methylation of the S100A4 (p9Ka) gene, as reported previously for the mouse S100A4 (mts1) gene (11Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Tkatch T. Georgiev G.

Differential patterns ofin vivo footprinting between metastatic and non-metastatic variants of mouse mammary epithelial cells arise from differential methylation of this region of the genome in the murine cell lines studied (12Tulchinsky E. Kramerov D. Ford H.L. Reshetnyak E. Lukanidin E. Zain S.

This observation suggests a possible difference between inhibitory mechanisms in mouse and rat S100A4 genes. The findings might serve to explain differences between the distribution of S100A4 in the tissues of rats and mice reported previously (5Davies M. Harris S. Rudland P. Barraclough R.

In the human, the location is only 91 base pairs downstream of the poly(A)-addition site of the S100A3 gene (37Engelkamp D. Schäfer B.W. Mattei M.G. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6547-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Since in the rat cells, the level of GC-factor mRNA is inversely related to the level of S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA, suggesting a correlation between GC-factor mRNA and S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA levels, it is possible that changes in GC-factor levels might also be associated with the acquisition of metastatic capability in human breast cancer cells. A 14-nucleotide pair cis-acting negative control element has been located approximately 1,300 bp upstream of the start site of transcription of the rat S100A4 (p9Ka) gene. Deletion of this region results in a 6-fold increase in the level of activity of a SPAP reporter gene when transiently transfected into a benign epithelial rat mammary cell line, Rama 37, which naturally displays only low levels of p9Ka mRNA and protein (17Barraclough R. Dawson K.J. Rudland P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). No such increase is observed when constructs bearing the same deletion are transfected into cell lines, Rama 37-E8 and Rama 800, which naturally express high levels of S100A4 (p9Ka). Gel mobility shift assays, DNase 1 footprinting in vitro, and footprinting experiments in vivo strongly suggest that there is a factor present in nuclear extracts of the Rama 37, Rama 37-E8, and Rama 800 cells that binds to thiscis-acting element. The degree of protection of nuclear extracts of the various cell lines corresponds inversely with the level of S100A4 (p9Ka) in the cell lines, suggesting a quantitative variation of a factor binding to the inhibitory region. The nucleotide sequence of the protected inhibitory region suggests that it contains a sequence which closely resembles the consensus binding sequence of GC factor (36Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This factor was originally identified by its binding to a regulatory region in the promoters of the genes for the human epidermal growth factor receptor, β actin, and the calcium-dependent protease, calpain (36Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The present paper is the first report of a GC factor binding site in a rat gene, and the first report of such a functional site in the gene for a S100 protein. It is not known whether the variation of the recognition sequence from the human consensus sequence reflects a species difference. However, the fact that an oligonucleotide corresponding to the consensus human GC-factor binding region effectively competes with the rat S100A4 (p9Ka) inhibitory sequence for binding of a factor in the rat cell nuclei suggests that the binding specificity of the rat factor is similar to that of the human GC-factor. Several lines of evidence point to the factor that resembles GC-factor being a regulator of the transcription of the S100A4 (p9Ka) gene in the rat mammary cells in vivo. The degree of protection of DNA in footprinting experiments in vivo and in vitrois in inverse relationship to the levels of S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA in the corresponding cells, raising the possibility that the GC-factor-like activity might regulate S100A4 expression in vivo. This interpretation is confirmed by the observation that a GC-factor-specific probe hybridizes to an mRNA from the rat cells that is the same size (3 kb) as that already described previously in human cells (36Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The level of this mRNA, as measured by a quantitative Northern blotting procedure using a GC-factor-specific probe, exhibits an inverse relationship with the level of S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA in nine out of ten rat mammary cell lines that exhibit differing levels of S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA. The one exception is a cell line made metastatic by the transfection of additional copies of the S100A4 (p9Ka) gene (3Davies B. Davies M. Gibbs F. Barraclough R. Rudland P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 999-1008PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line expresses S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA at a high level but shows the same level of GC-factor mRNA as the low expressing Rama 37 cells. The explanation of this observation is likely to be that the additional 10–20 transfected copies of the S100A4 (p9Ka) gene lead to elevated levels of S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA and protein by titrating out molecules of the GC-factor in the recipient Rama 37 cells. However, the alternative explanation that levels of GC-factor protein but not mRNA levels are reduced by some other mechanism by the transfection procedure cannot be entirely ruled out at this stage. The observation that a cell line, KP1-LNT1, from a lymph node metastasis arising from the KP1-R37 cells exhibits an S100A4 (p9Ka) level consistent with its level of GC factor mRNA suggests that other mechanisms in the development of a metastasizing tumor might regulate S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA levels in these cells. Such a mechanism, in this case, might be methylation of the S100A4 (p9Ka) gene, as reported previously for the mouse S100A4 (mts1) gene (11Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Tkatch T. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The results of the present experiments contrast with those previously obtained using metastatic and non-metastatic murine mammary cells in which no evidence of important cis-acting regulatory sequences were found in the 5′ region of the mouse S100A4 (mts1) gene in the region −41 to −1,897 upstream of the transcriptional start site (10Tulchinsky E. Ford H. Kramerov D. Reshetnyak E. Grigorian M. Zain S. Lukanidin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the difference between the results with the rat and mouse S100A4 genes is that in the mouse S100A4 (mts1) gene, any GC-factor-binding sequence might lie further upstream than the 0 to −1,897 region examined (10Tulchinsky E. Ford H. Kramerov D. Reshetnyak E. Grigorian M. Zain S. Lukanidin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This explanation is unlikely since an exactly conserved GC-factor binding site is located at −1,472 bp upstream of the start site of transcription of the S100A4 gene in the human genome (37Engelkamp D. Schäfer B.W. Mattei M.G. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6547-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Fig.9 A). An alternative explanation is that in the murine cells, the predominant mechanism regulating the S100A4 (mts1) gene is the 16-base pair protein binding region, 290 bp downstream of an enhancer element, in the first intron of the S100A4 (mts) gene, which resembles the CD3δ enhancer of T lymphocytes (12Tulchinsky E. Kramerov D. Ford H.L. Reshetnyak E. Lukanidin E. Zain S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar). Differential patterns ofin vivo footprinting between metastatic and non-metastatic variants of mouse mammary epithelial cells arise from differential methylation of this region of the genome in the murine cell lines studied (12Tulchinsky E. Kramerov D. Ford H.L. Reshetnyak E. Lukanidin E. Zain S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 79-86PubMed Google Scholar), and possibly from the resultant creation by methylation of a novel inhibitory AP-1 site, 40 bp downstream of the 16-bp binding region (38Tulchinsky E. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1737-1745PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence that constitutes this potential AP-1 site specifically appears to be absent by deletion in the first intron of the rat S100A4 (p9Ka) gene, despite generally good conservation of the sequence of the flanking regions (Fig. 9 B) and the first intron generally between rat and mouse. This observation suggests a possible difference between inhibitory mechanisms in mouse and rat S100A4 genes. The findings might serve to explain differences between the distribution of S100A4 in the tissues of rats and mice reported previously (5Davies M. Harris S. Rudland P. Barraclough R. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) from an examination of the tissue distribution of the endogenous S100A4 gene in rats (39Gibbs F. Barraclough R. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P. Wilkinson M. Parry E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and mice (40Jackson-Grusby L.L. Swiergiel J. Linzer D.I.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6677-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and by the pattern of expression of rat S100A4 transgenes under the control of their own rat promoter in the tissues of transgenic mice (5Davies M. Harris S. Rudland P. Barraclough R. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In these mice, the tissue distribution of the rat S100A4 (p9Ka) mRNA in the mouse cells was identical to that found in the rat and did not correspond to the distribution of the endogenous mouse S100A4 (mts1) mRNA when the respective mRNAs were analyzed by Northern blotting procedures on the same tissue specimens (5Davies M. Harris S. Rudland P. Barraclough R. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results suggest that there is a different emphasis in the regulation of the S100A4 gene between rats and mice.

https://openalex.org/W1986376992,"Xenopus transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) binds to over 50 base pairs in the internal control region of the 5 S rRNA gene, yet the binding energy for this interaction (ΔG 0 = −12.8 kcal/mol) is no greater than that exhibited by many proteins that occupy much smaller DNA targets. Despite considerable study, the distribution of the DNA binding energy among the various zinc fingers of TFIIIA remains poorly understood. By analyzing TFIIIA mutants with disruptions of individual zinc fingers, we have previously shown that each finger contributes favorably to binding (Del Rio, S., Menezes, S. R., and Setzer, D. R. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 233, 567–579). Those results also suggested, however, that simultaneous binding by all nine zinc fingers of TFIIIA may involve a substantial energetic cost. Using complementary N- and C-terminal fragments and full-length proteins containing pairs of disrupted fingers, we now show that energetic interference indeed occurs between zinc fingers when TFIIIA binds to the 5 S rRNA gene and that the greatest interference occurs between fingers at opposite ends of the protein in the TFIIIA·5 S rRNA gene complex. Some, but not all, of the thermodynamically unfavorable strain in the TFIIIA·5 S rRNA gene complex may be derived from bending of the DNA that is necessary to accommodate simultaneous binding by all nine zinc fingers of TFIIIA. The energetics of DNA binding by TFIIIA thus emerges as a compromise between individual favorable contacts of importance along the length of the internal control region and long range strain or distortion in the protein, the 5 S rRNA gene, or both that is necessary to accommodate the various local interactions.

It also binds to 5 S rRNA itself to form a ribonucleoprotein storage particle that accumulates inXenopus oocytes (4Picard B. Wegnez M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Roeder R.G. Cell. 1980; 19: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and the archetypal zinc finger protein (7Miller J. McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar), TFIIIA has been an influential model protein for understanding the mechanisms of sequence-specific DNA and RNA recognition. The nine zinc fingers of TFIIIA define the sequence features that can be used to recognize zinc finger motifs in other proteins (7Miller J. McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). These include two cysteine and two histidine residues with conserved spacing; these four amino acids coordinate a Zn2+ ion (8Diakun G.P. Fairall L. Klug A. Nature. 1986; 324: 698-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) that contributes substantially to the stability of the folded domain (9Del Rio S. Menezes S.R. Setzer D.R. J. Mol.

Three conserved hydrophobic residues are also likely to stabilize TFIIIA-like zinc finger domains through interactions in a hydrophobic pocket. The large number of zinc fingers in TFIIIA has made its structural analysis difficult, and structural studies of zinc finger proteins have therefore focused on peptide fragments containing 1–3 zinc fingers from TFIIIA or other proteins (10Frankel A.D.

Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These studies have confirmed an earlier model of zinc finger structure (22Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) in which the N terminus of the domain folds into a pair of antiparallel β strands containing the Zn2+-coordinating cysteines and the C terminus into a helix containing the conserved histidines. Crystallographic analyses of complexes between the zinc finger proteins zif268 (19Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O.

Nature. 1993; 366: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and the specific DNA sequences recognized by each protein have revealed that specific DNA binding is mediated largely through major groove and phosphate contacts with the helical region of the zinc finger. The initial solution of the zif268-DNA structure raised hopes that a simple code for zinc finger recognition of DNA might be possible, but later structures have suggested that a multiplicity of recognition modes are used by different zinc finger proteins, even when the overall structures of the zinc finger domains exhibit considerable similarity. This observation, coupled with much biochemical data as well as theoretical considerations, suggests that extrapolating from the properties of known zinc fingers to the structure of TFIIIA in a complex with the 5 S rRNA gene may be misleading. TFIIIA binds to the 5 S rRNA gene with an equilibrium binding affinity (K d ) of about 0.4 nm (23Del Rio S. Setzer D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Romaniuk P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17593-17600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is comparable to the affinity exhibited by many other sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that occupy much smaller recognition surfaces than that represented by the 52 base pairs bound by TFIIIA (positions 45–96 of the Xenopus borealis somatic-type 5 S rRNA gene). A variety of analyses has demonstrated that the zinc fingers of TFIIIA are aligned more or less in order along the length of the internal control region of the 5 S rRNA gene, with the N-terminal fingers near the 3′ end of the control region and the C-terminal fingers near the 5′ end (9Del Rio S. Menezes S.R. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Smith D.R. Jackson I.J. Brown D.D.

Results obtained with truncation mutants have been interpreted to mean that almost all the free energy of DNA binding can be attributed to interactions between the first three zinc fingers of TFIIIA and the C box of the internal control region, whereas fingers 4–6 or 4–7 perform an analogous function in providing most of the specificity and free energy for 5 S rRNA recognition (29Clemens K.R.

In fact, numerous studies have confirmed that a fragment containing only zinc fingers 1–3 binds with high affinity and specificity to the 3′ end of the 5 S rRNA gene's ICR (26Vrana K.E.

Thus, the surprising dual specificity of TFIIIA, which permits recognition of both 5 S rRNA and the 5 S rRNA gene, has been explained by proposing that zinc fingers are specialized either for DNA binding (fingers 1–3) or RNA binding (4Picard B.

The results of various footprinting studies with intact TFIIIA and a nested set of TFIIIA truncation mutants have also been used to support models for the alignment of the zinc fingers of TFIIIA relative to the underlying sequence of the 5 S rRNA gene (27Hayes J.J. Clemens K.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11600-11605Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Clemens K.R. Liao X. Wolf V. Wright P.E. Gottesfeld J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In these models, zinc fingers 1–3 and 7–9 assume zif268-like conformations at the 3′ and 5′ ends of the ICR, respectively, whereas finger 5 interacts in the major groove of the so-called intermediate element. Fingers 4 and 6 are proposed to bind on a single face and cross the minor groove on either side of the intermediate element. Although studies of truncation mutants of TFIIIA have been most informative, it is important to realize that the interpretation of such analyses is strongly dependent on the assumption that functional interactions between zinc fingers are absent or unimportant and that the structure and function of a protein fragment reflect those of the same moiety in the context of the full-length protein. As a complement to the study of TFIIIA fragments, we have therefore taken an alternative approach in which individual zinc fingers have been structurally disrupted in the context of an otherwise normal, full-length protein. These “broken finger” mutants have been generated by the mutation of one of the Zn2+-coordinating residues of a single zinc finger, and their structural and functional analysis has also been described previously (9Del Rio S. Menezes S.R. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Two points are worthy of comment in the context of the current study. First, footprinting analyses of the broken finger mutants on the 5 S rRNA gene suggested that existing models for alignment of the various zinc fingers of TFIIIA with respect to the underlying DNA sequence are unlikely to be correct in detail, particularly for the C-terminal fingers, since footprint alterations observed with the relevant broken finger mutants occurred up to 10 base pairs away from their putative sites of interaction in models based on the study of truncation mutants. Second, quantitative analysis of the DNA binding affinity of broken finger mutants suggested that all the zinc fingers of TFIIIA contribute favorably to the free energy of binding of the intact protein to the 5 S rRNA gene, with little indication of thermodynamic dominance by the first three zinc fingers. Furthermore, the data suggested that thermodynamically unfavorable interactions between zinc fingers occurred during the DNA binding reaction, resulting in a “compensatory” mode of binding. This mode of binding would result in a kind of “thermodynamic buffering” in which loss of binding by a single zinc finger would be partially compensated by relief of thermodynamically unfavorable strain in the complex. This interpretation, however, was dependent on the assumption that the mutations used to disrupt zinc finger structure resulted in complete loss of DNA binding activity by the relevant finger. Based on the binding properties of two complementary N- and C-terminal fragments of TFIIIA, and of a set of full-length proteins that contain pairs of disrupted zinc fingers, we now document that thermodynamic interference indeed occurs in the TFIIIA·ICR complex and that the degree of interference is greatest between zinc fingers at opposite ends of the protein. The fact that energetic strain is built into the TFIIIA·5 S rRNA gene complex has interesting implications for the assembly and function of the 5 S rRNA transcription complex, for the evolutionary divergence of TFIIIAs from different species, and for the interpretation of data derived from the analysis of TFIIIA fragments. E. coli expression plasmids pTA1–100 and pTA100–344 were designed to produce complementary N- and C-terminal fragments of TFIIIA. pTA1–100 encodes the polypeptide A1–100, which contains amino acids 1–100 of TFIIIA, whereas pTA100–344 encodes the polypeptide A100–344, containing amino acids 100–344, preceded by a methionine residue. The boundaries of these fragments lie in the linker between histidine 98, the most C-terminal Zn2+-binding residue of zinc finger 3, and cysteine 105, the first Zn2+-binding residue of finger 4. pTA1–100 was constructed by inserting a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-generated fragment containing the first 100 codons of TFIIIA between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET11b (38Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). Specifically, the relevant DNA fragment was synthesized from the plasmid pTA102 using the 5′ primer CTTTAAGAAGGAGATA and the 3′ primer 5′ TAGACGGGATCCTAGATGTTATGGAATC. The PCR product was doubly cut withNdeI and BamHI, and the cut product was gel-purified, concentrated by precipitation in ethanol, and ligated into the large NdeI/BamHI vector fragment of pET11b. Plasmids from resulting colonies were screened by digestion with PstI, and a positive clone sequenced throughout the A1–100-coding region to ensure that no unanticipated mutations were introduced by the PCR process. To construct pTA100–344, an NdeI site was introduced into the plasmid pGA13 (see below) in place of TFIIIA codons 98 and 99 by site-directed mutagenesis (39Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar), using the anticodon strand primer TCTTGATGTTCATATGTCTGTTAAAG. Potential positives were screened for introduction of the new NdeI site, and a single clone was chosen and sequenced throughout the TFIIIA-coding region to verify the expected alteration. An NdeI-BamHI fragment from this plasmid was ligated into NdeI/BamHI-cut pET11b to generate pTA100–344. Plasmids encoding mutant TFIIIAs with two-finger disruptions were generated in the plasmid pTA105. pTA105 was constructed by insertion of the NdeI-BamHI fragment of pGA13–894 between theNdeI and BamHI sites of pET11b-150. pGA13–894 was derived by directed mutagenesis of pGA13 and contains a substitution of the codons GAG AAG AAC for codons 309–311 of TFIIIA, which are GAA AAA AAT in the wild type. These alterations do not affect the sequence of TFIIIA encoded and were made for reasons that are irrelevant in the context of this paper. pGA13 was derived from pGA11-NdeI (23Del Rio S. Setzer D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and contains the EP-(300–304) sequence changes that have been described previously in the construction of pTA102 (23Del Rio S. Setzer D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) but is otherwise identical to pGA11-NdeI. pET11b-150 was prepared by excising theAlwNI-PstI fragment of pZ150 (40Brown M.L. Schroth G.P. Gottesfeld J.M. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that contains the M13 replication origin and using it to replace the correspondingAlwNI-PstI fragment of pET11b. pTA105 therefore can be used to express wild-type TFIIIA protein from the T7 promoter in pET11b and also can be used to obtain single-stranded DNA for purposes of directed mutagenesis or sequencing. In pTA105, the single strand packaged in phage particles corresponds to the anticodon-sense strand of TFIIIA. Five codon-sense primers were used for introduction of the histidine to asparagine substitutions in the mutant sequences; the H33N mutation and a HindIII site were introduced using TGGAAGCTTCAGGCGAATCTG; the H63N mutation and an EcoRI site were introduced using TTAACCCGGAATTCACTCACT; the H183N mutation and aDraI site were introduced using GACATTATATTTAAAAAACGTGGCAG; the H241N mutation and a HindIII site were introduced using AGAAGCAATATACAAAGCTTTCAT; the H272N mutation and an EcoRI site were introduced using CTAGAAAGGAATTCAGTT. In the construction of the double mutants, two mutagenic primers were used simultaneously in a standard oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis experiment (39Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Resulting clones were screened for the introduction of both mutations using the restriction site tags associated with the desired changes. The presence of the desired mutations was then verified by sequencing the entire TFIIIA coding sequence from a single positive clone. Plasmids encoding each construct were transformed intoE. coli strain BL21(DE3), and mutant TFIIIA proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (23Del Rio S. Setzer D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. We found A1–100 to be considerably more soluble than wild-type TFIIIA in E. coli, so recombinant A1–100 was recovered in the initial supernatant after cell lysis by sonication. Further extraction of the insoluble pellet with urea was unnecessary. In contrast, A100–344 is substantially more difficult to solubilize than is wild-type TFIIIA, so initial cell lysis by sonication was performed in the presence of 5 m urea, and the resulting pellet after centrifugation was extracted in 5 murea-containing buffer for several days to recover reasonable yields of solubilized protein. Full-length mutants with two disrupted zinc fingers behaved similarly to wild-type TFIIIA and the single-finger mutants (9Del Rio S. Menezes S.R. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After ammonium sulfate fractionation and binding to Bio-Rex 70 in 5 m urea as described previously (23Del Rio S. Setzer D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the column was washed with the binding buffer lacking urea and then eluted in a single step with binding buffer containing 1 m NaCl and no urea. This modification aided in keeping the proteins soluble without adversely affecting purity of the final product. In most cases, mutant proteins were further purified on phenyl-Superose or phenyl-Sepharose as described previously (23Del Rio S. Setzer D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6197-6203Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In some cases, additional purification was achieved instead by chromatography of the Bio-Rex 70-eluted material on Superose 12 in buffer identical to that used to elute TFIIIA from the Bio-Rex 70 column. While overall recoveries were sometimes lower using the Superose 12 column, we often found that a higher percentage of the purified protein was active when assayed for DNA binding. In some cases, further purification beyond the Bio-Rex 70 stage proved technically infeasible, and Bio-Rex 70-eluted material was used directly in the analysis. To ensure that the double broken finger mutants contained structural disruptions in the proteins only within the mutated fingers and that no unanticipated longer range structural “cooperativity” resulted in more global or extended unfolding of the mutant proteins, we analyzed H33N/H63N, H241N/H272N, H33N/H272N, H33N/H241N, H63N/H241N, and H63N/H272N by partial proteolysis with thermolysin in a manner similar to that described previously for analysis of the single broken finger mutants (9Del Rio S. Menezes S.R. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In each case, the proteolytic digestion pattern was compared with that of wild-type TFIIIA and the corresponding single finger mutants. In every case, we observed proteolytic products of sizes equal to those predicted from the sites of proteolytic sensitivity observed in the corresponding single finger mutants (data not shown). Thus, even in the double finger mutants, there is no reason to believe the histidine to asparagine substitutions we have engineered to result in structural disruption of specific zinc fingers have longer range structural effects in the mutant proteins. K d values were measured and the data from multiple independent determinations used in analysis of covariance to arrive at a single best estimate of the K d with associated statistical measures of precision as described previously (9Del Rio S. Menezes S.R. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting studies were conducted as described previously, with selection of bound complexes after DNase I treatment but before analysis of cleavage events on a denaturing gel (9Del Rio S. Menezes S.R. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have noted the sporadic appearance of an electrophoretic artifact resulting in a prominent band and smear in some footprinting results when using gels containing 8.33 murea but no formamide (see Fig. 1 B). The inclusion of 40% formamide in the gel eliminates this artifact, suggesting it is the result of some structural feature in the end-labeled DNA fragment used that persists in the presence of urea. The results of Fig.1 B were obtained using a gel containing 8.33 murea but lacking formamide.Table IIEquilibrium binding constants of double broken finger mutantsMutantFingers mutatedNnK dRelativeK dΔG 0nmkcal/molWild type6480.416 ± 0.031.0−12.79(−12.75 to −12.83)H33N-H63N1 + 25329.30 ± 0.5222.4−10.95(−10.92 to −10.99)H33N-H241N1 + 842920.21 ± 1.548.6−10.49(−10.45 to −10.54)H33N-H272N1 + 943414.55 ± 1.435.0−10.69(−10.63 to −10.74)H63N-H241N2 + 863735.19 ± 2.484.6−10.16(−10.12 to −10.21)H63N-H272N2 + 942325.70 ± 2.561.8−10.35(−10.29 to −10.41)H183N-H241N6 + 85367.44 ± 0.5717.9−11.08(−11.04 to −11.13)H241N-H272N8 + 96568.78 ± 0.6121.1−10.98(−10.95 to −11.03)The notation is as described for Table I.

https://openalex.org/W2335209528,"In vitro and in vivo methods were combined to determine the function of the three Myb binding sites (NrasI, NrasII and NrasIII) within the promoter region of the mouse N-ras gene. We found that the c-Myb DNA-binding domain can bind with high affinity to NrasI and NrasII, but with a reduced affinity to NrasIII. In contrast, the full length v-Myb protein from BM2 cells only bound to the middle one of the three sites, NrasII. Both c-Myb and v-Myb functioned as repressors and reduce the basal activity of the N-ras promoter by 60%, as determined by transient transfection experiments using different regions of the N-ras promoter. This repression required a functional Myb DNA-binding domain and could not be overcome by fusion to the potent VP16 activation domain. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the v-Myb protein is shown to be present in different conformations depending on its binding to the NrasII or the mim-1A site. The v-Myb conformation is thus suggested to play a critical role in the regulation of v-Myb activity."

In cultured rat hepatocytes insulin and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 accelerated the degradation of glucagon-induced PCK mRNA (13Christ B. Nath A. Jungermann K. Biol. Chem.

The acceleration of PCK mRNA degradation was probably due at least in part to the insulin-enhanced expression of a ribonuclease. 2T. Heise, A. Krones, A. Nath, K. Jungermann, and B.

The stability of PCK mRNA seems to be regulated by proteins binding to the 3′-untranslated region of the mRNA. In cultured rat hepatocytes binding of a protein was enhanced after glucagon treatment, which correlated with PCK mRNA accumulation. Insulin prevented the increase in protein binding, which correlated with the decrease in PCK mRNA levels (20Christ B. Heise T. Jungermann K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21Christ B. Nath A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).

It was the goal of this investigation to identify and characterize protein(s), which might contribute to the regulation of PCK mRNA degradation. By gel retardation assays a cytosolic protein binding to PCK mRNA was identified, which was purified and biochemically characterized. Peptide sequence analysis showed identity of the protein with rat ferritin light chain. The binding of ferritin to RNA was regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and by iron. Competition experiments showed that ferritin did not bind preferentially to PCK mRNA but to a variety of different RNAs. It is suggested that ferritin may play a regulatory role in PCK mRNA degradation as well as in the general cytosolic mRNA turnover. The identification of ferritin as RNA-binding protein is discussed in view of an old hypothesis and recent publications, which proposed ferritin to play a role in the general metabolism of cytosolic RNA (23Zähringer J.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 20 min, the resulting supernatant at 8,500 × g for 15 min, and the then resulting supernatant at 120,000 × g for 1 h to obtain a post-polysomal, cytosolic extract (S120 extract). After heating to 50 °C for 15 min the crude extract was centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 15 min (Fig. 3). The resulting supernatant was brought to 35% saturation with ammonium sulfate and stirred on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation of the slurry for 20 min at 14,000 ×g the supernatant was brought to 65% saturation with ammonium sulfate and stirred again on ice for 15 min. The slurry was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, the pellet was suspended in dialysis buffer, which contained 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm each of dithioerythreitol and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the extract was dialyzed (cut off M r 3,500, Spectrum Medical Industries) overnight at 4 °C (cytosolic extract CE) (Fig. 3). Protein concentration was determined by a commercial kit (Bio-Rad, München). The extract was stored at −70 °C. The same procedure was performed for the preparation of cytosolic extracts from whole rat liver or other organs as indicated. In this case tissue was homogenized in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer. 3.5 g of swollen DEAE Sephadex A-25 (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnologies Inc., Freiburg) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.5 mm EDTA) was incubated in a batch procedure for 30 min at 4 °C with 10 ml of cytosolic extract (CE) containing about 100 mg of total protein. Buffer A containing unbound proteins was collected and combined with buffer A resulting from two subsequent washes of the gel. Bound protein was eluted by washing with buffer B (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1m NaCl). Eluted protein and the unbound material were concentrated separately by ultrafiltration (Centriplus 100, Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). The unbound protein fraction called FT1 (for historical reasons because this procedure was processed in a column at the beginning of the study) was further processed with fast protein liquid chromatography on the anion exchange matrix Source 30 Q (Pharmacia, Freiburg) in an HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia, Freiburg) (Fig.3). The column was equilibrated with three successive washes with buffer A. The sample was loaded onto the column and the resin washed with buffer A until protein was no longer detectable in the flow-through (FT2). Bound protein was eluted in a linear gradient ranging from 0 to 1 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were assayed for RNA binding activity in the gel retardation assay as described below. RNA binding activity containing fractions were pooled (range of fractions 6–10) (Source extract SO), concentrated, and equilibrated with buffer A by ultrafiltration on Centricon 100 and loaded onto a Superdex 200-pg column (Column volume,V c = 135 ml) equilibrated with buffer A (Fig. 3). Elution was performed in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min and 0.5- or 0.6-ml fractions were collected and assayed for RNA binding activity (range of fractions 36–38) (Superdex extract). For molecular mass determination the Superdex column was calibrated with standard proteins in a gel filtration calibration kit (Sigma, Deisenhofen). SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis under reducing conditions revealed that the Superdex extract contained one prominent protein band and only minor contaminations. Therefore it was used to raise an antiserum against the purified RNA-binding protein in rabbits. 200–250 mg of protein in the S120 extracts was incubated in a final volume of 50 ml in focusing puffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 2 m urea, 2% Ampholyte pH 3–10) and filled into the precooled (4 °C) Rotofor® cell (Bio-Rad, München). Isoelectric focusing was performed at constant power of 12 watts for 5–6 h. During this time voltage increased from 290 to 900 V and the current decreased from 41 to 13 mA. At the end of the run samples were fractionated as described in the manufacturer's manual and pH was measured in each sample. To separate ampholytes from protein, the samples were incubated in 1 m NaCl for 30 min at 4 °C. Then they were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol overnight. Each fraction was assayed for RNA binding activity as described below. Five different focusing buffers were tested containing CHAPS, urea, glycerol, digitonin, and/or Tris/HCl at different concentrations and combinations to minimize denaturation of protein during the focusing procedure. The Tris/HCl buffer described here yielded the best results. Plasmid pBS-PCK722 containing a 722-base pairPstI-EcoRI PCK cDNA fragment, which represented 120 translated and 602 untranslated bases of the 3′-portion of PCK mRNA (bases 1890–2611, Ref. 14Beale E.G. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Scoble H.A. Metz R.J. Quick D.P. Noble R.L. Donelson J.E. Biemann K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10748-10760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as the template for the production of PCR products. To obtain various DNA templates for the generation of PCK transcripts of different lengths and regions from the PCK mRNA 3′-UTR the following primers were used for PCR: sense primer 1 and 2 contained at the 5′-end the T7-RNA polymerase promotor sequence (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′) followed by genuine PCK mRNA sequences from bases 2010 to 2030 and 2265 to 2291 (14Beale E.G. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Scoble H.A. Metz R.J. Quick D.P. Noble R.L. Donelson J.E. Biemann K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10748-10760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense primers 1 and 2 contained genuine PCK mRNA sequences from bases 2235 to 2259 and 2583 to 2603 (14Beale E.G. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Scoble H.A. Metz R.J. Quick D.P. Noble R.L. Donelson J.E. Biemann K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10748-10760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The combinatorial use of the primer pairs sense primer 1 and antisense primer 2, sense primer 1 and antisense primer 1, sense primer 2 and antisense primer 2 yielded PCR products PCK1, PCK2, and PCK3, which contained either the total 3′-UTR (bases 2010–2603), the 5′-portion (bases 2010–2259), or the 3′-portion (bases 2265–2603) of the PCK mRNA 3′-UTR (14Beale E.G. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Scoble H.A. Metz R.J. Quick D.P. Noble R.L. Donelson J.E. Biemann K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10748-10760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCR was performed with 1 ng of pBS-PCK722 and 80 pmol of each primer in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 50 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm of each dCTP, dTTP, dATP, and dGTP and finally 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed in 35 cycles (45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, 60 s at 72 °C). The resulting PCR products were taken as templates for a second round of PCR under the same conditions. These PCR products were purified by a commercial kit (Qiagen, Düsseldorf) and the DNA content was measured spectrophotometrically. The PCR products PCK1, PCK2, and PCK3 were used as templates to generate PCK1, PCK2, and PCK3 transcripts. Transcription reactions were carried out with 10 nm PCR products (see above) in a final volume of 40 μl in transcription buffer (Stratagene, Heidelberg), containing 0.5 mm adenosine-, cytidine-, and guanosine 5′-triphosphate each, 0.025 mm uridine 5′-triphosphate, 55 pmol of uridine 5′-[α-32P]triphosphate (600 Ci/mmol) (ICN, Meckenheim), 10 mm dithioerythreitol, and 25 units of human placental ribonuclease inhibitor (Amersham, Braunschweig). The reaction was started by addition of 25 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene, Heidelberg). After incubation for 45 min at 37 °C another 25 units of T7 RNA polymerase were added and the reaction was continued for 45 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μg of tRNA (Boehringer, Mannheim) and 25 units of human placental ribonuclease inhibitor. Subsequently template DNA (PCK1, 2, or 3) was digested with 1 unit of RNase-free DNase I (Boehringer) for 15 min at 37 °C. The mixture was brought to 300 mm sodium acetate and 8 mm dithioerythreitol; the volume was adjusted to 70 μl with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Transcripts were purified by extraction of proteins with 70 μl of buffered phenol (Amresco, Solon), pH 4.3. Phases were separated by centrifugation for 5 min in a microcentrifuge and the aqueous phase was applied to a Nick column (Pharmacia, Freiburg) to remove unincorporated nucleotides. Human histone H1° and mouse arylsulfatase A transcripts were generated by the same procedure using plasmid DNA kindly provided by Drs. D. Doenecke (Göttingen) and V. Gieselmann (Kiel). Standard binding reaction was carried out in a final volume of 40 μl with 40 μg or as indicated total protein and about 5 ng of 32P-radiolabeled RNA in binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EDTA, and 40 μg of RNase A (Boehringer, Mannheim). Samples were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. After addition of 5 μl of electrophoresis buffer containing 10% glycerol and 0.01% bromphenol blue, reaction mixtures were separated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel (34 × 16 cm) for 2–3 h at 20 mA (about 6 volt/cm) at room temperature. After electrophoresis gels were dried and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham, Braunschweig) in general overnight at −70 °C or analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Krefeld). Competition experiments were carried out by addition of unlabeled competitor RNAs to the binding reaction 3 min prior to the addition of the labeled transcript. In the phosphorylation reaction 40 μg of protein in the CE was treated with 80 units of the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C in 40 μl of phosphorylation buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 4.8 mm MgCl2, and 0.85 mm ATP. In the dephosphorylation reaction 40 μg of protein in the CE was treated with 7 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) for 30 min at 37 °C in 40 μl of dephosphorylation buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.01 mm ZnCl2. Controls were performed without addition of kinase or phosphatase. 1 μg of protein in the Superdex extract (Fig. 4) was incubated with 0.5 or 1 μg of anti-phosphoserine, anti-phosphothreonine (Biomol, Hamburg), or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Amersham, Braunschweig) or with an unrelated antibody in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.05% Triton X-100 in a final volume of 10 μl at 4 °C overnight. After the incubation the mixture was submitted to the standard RNA binding assay. 40 mg of protein A coupled to Sepharose CL-4B beads (Pharmacia, Freiburg) was swollen in 1.5 ml of TS buffer (15 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) for 4 h at room temperature. The swollen gel was collected by centrifugation and washed 3 times in TS. The final pellet (200 μl) was resuspended in 200 μl of TS and combined with 20 μl (90 μg) of anti-ferritin antiserum. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C and subsequently for 4 h at room temperature. 60 μl from this mixture were combined with 40 μg of protein in the CE and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Precipitates were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was taken off (supernatant 1) and the pellet was washed 2 times with 30 μl of TS. The resulting supernatants were combined with supernatant 1. 25 μg of protein in this ferritin-free CE was applied to the gel retardation assay. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar). Mass spectroscopy and sequencing of tryptic peptides of the purified protein were conducted by Drs. B. Schmidt and T. Selmer (Göttingen, Germany). Antiserum against the purified protein from the Superdex extract was generated in rabbits by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). To identify and characterize proteins, which might be involved in the regulation of PCK mRNA degradation, a gel retardation assay was established using cytosolic protein extracts from rat liver and a 32P-labeled transcript, which was produced by in vitro transcription from a PCR-generated DNA fragment containing the entire 3′-untranslated region of PCK mRNA (PCK1 transcript, 594 bases long; position 2010 to 2603 in PCK mRNA; Ref.14Beale E.G. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Scoble H.A. Metz R.J. Quick D.P. Noble R.L. Donelson J.E. Biemann K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10748-10760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the binding reaction was performed in the absence of RNase A two dominant RNA-protein complexes (complex 1 and 2) formed with PCK1 transcript and cytosolic protein(s) from rat liver. While formation of complex 2 did not require the presence of Mg2+ complex 1 formed only in the presence of both Mg2+ and EDTA (Fig.1 A, lanes 3–5 versus lanes 4–6). Addition of RNase A yielded the specific formation of only complex 1 alone, essentially only in the presence of equimolar concentrations of a divalent cation (Mg2+ or Mn2+ or Ca2+ or Zn2+) and EDTA as shown representatively for Mg2+/EDTA (Fig. 1 A, lane 10 versus lanes 7–9). This complex was only obtained with protein from rat liver cytosol and not with bovine serum albumin or with nuclear protein extracts (Fig. 1 A, lanes 11 and12). Complex formation required incubation at 37 °C for at least 15 min (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–6) and did not occur at 4 °C (Fig.1 B, lanes 1–3), indicating that a temperature-sensitive step was involved in RNA-protein complex formation. Heating the cytosolic extract to 70 °C abolished complex formation (not shown). Pretreatment of the extracts with proteinase K did not destroy the RNA binding activity of the protein (Fig. 1 B, lane 11). Pretreatment of the extracts with a protease mixture containing proteinase K, trypsin, and Pronase E prevented complex formation (not shown). These data show that complex 1 was due to an interaction of protein(s) with PCK1 transcript. RNA-protein interactions can be expected to be dependent on salt concentration and pH. Binding of the rat liver cytosolic protein to PCK1 transcript was still observed at 0.4 m KCl but was lower compared with 0.1 m KCl (Fig. 1 B, lane 6 versus 7). Protein binding to PCK1 transcript was stronger at pH 4.0 compared with pH 9.0 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 8–10). Preparative isoelectric focusing (IEF, “Experimental Procedures”) enriched the RNA binding activity in fractions between pH 4.0 and pH 5.2, which showed that the RNA-binding protein was acidic. The binding activity containing IEF fractions were used for an estimate of the binding affinity of the protein to RNA. Increasing the amount of protein from 10 to 100 μg at a constant amount of the PCK1 transcript (16 fmol) increased complex formation in a sigmoidal manner. Half-maximal protein binding was reached at 38 μg, maximal binding at 80 μg of protein (not shown). The binding protein from rat liver (which was identified as rat ferritin light chain, see below) was enriched by 15-fold by the IEF procedure (5-fold in the protein extract over the crude liver homogenate and 3-fold in the IEF fraction over the protein extract). Since 1 g of liver contains 180 mg of protein (18% of the wet weight) (26Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar) and 600 μg of ferritin = 1.5 nmol (molecular mass 400 kDa) (27Munro H.N. Linder M. Physiol. Rev. 1978; 58: 317-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), 1 mg of liver protein would provide 8.33 pmol of ferritin, and 1 mg of IEF fraction protein, being enriched in binding activity by 15-fold, would provide 125 pmol of ferritin. Thus, in 40 μl of buffer half-saturation of the PCK1 transcript (16 fmol/40 μl = 0.4 nm) was reached by ferritin at 120 nm (38 μg of IEF protein = 4.75 pmol of ferritin/40 μl). Binding of cytosolic protein to PCK1 transcript should be hindered in the gel retardation assay by RNA molecules, which share sequence and/or structure similarities with PCK1 transcript. To study the binding preference of the protein for different RNAs, the gel retardation assay with PCK1 transcript was performed in the presence of single-stranded RNA homopolyribonucleotides (poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), and poly(U)) (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). In the presence of poly(U) (500 and 1000-fold excess by weight) binding of protein to PCK1 transcript was abolished and with tRNA (2000 and 4000-fold molar excess) binding was effectively attenuated. Poly(A) competed for protein binding to a lesser extent than poly(U), whereas poly(C) exhibited weak and poly(G) no competition for binding. Binding to labeled PCK1 transcript was also investigated in the presence of unlabeled transcripts of PCK1, PCK2, and PCK3, which contained either the entire 3′-UTR of PCK mRNA (PCK1 bases 2010–2603) or the 5′ (PCK2 bases 2010–2259) or the 3′ (PCK3 bases 2265–2603) (14Beale E.G. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Scoble H.A. Metz R.J. Quick D.P. Noble R.L. Donelson J.E. Biemann K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10748-10760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) part of it in a 150–1200-fold molar excess (Fig. 2, bottom part). With all three unlabeled transcripts binding of cytosolic protein to PCK1 transcript was effectively attenuated. However, when the PCR DNA fragments, which were used as templates for the generation of the transcripts, were included in a 500-fold excess by weight in the binding reaction, no interference with protein binding was observed. Protein binding to PCK1 transcript was compared with binding to the 3′-UTR of the human histone 1° (HIS) mRNA, which encodes a nuclear protein, and a portion of the 3′-UTR of the mouse arylsulfatase A mRNA, which encodes a lysosomal protein. With cytosolic protein from rat liver HIS and arylsulfatase A transcripts formed a complex, which had the same electrophoretic mobility as the complex with PCK1 transcript (Fig. 2 B). The tissue distribution of the cytosolic RNA-binding protein was studied. Cytosolic protein extracts from rat liver (LI), kidney (KI), spleen (SP), and lung (LU) were applied to the gel retardation assay with the PCK1 transcript. Whereas rat liver extracts exhibited strong protein binding to the PCK1 transcript, extracts from kidney, spleen, and lung showed weak but significant binding forming a complex with slightly higher mobility in the case of spleen and lung (Fig.2 C). These data show that the cytosolic RNA-bind"
