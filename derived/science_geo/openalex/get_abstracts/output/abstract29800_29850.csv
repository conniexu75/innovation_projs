https://openalex.org/W1976179891,"Three known genes guide circumferential migrations of pioneer axons and mesodermal cells on the nematode body wall. unc-5 affects dorsal migrations, unc-40 primarily affects ventral migrations, and unc-6 affects migrations in both directions. Circumferential movements still occur, but are misdirected whereas longitudinal movements are normal in these mutants. Pioneer growth cones migrating directly on the epidermis are affected; growth cones migrating along established axon fascicles are normal. Thus these genes affect cell guidance and not cell motility per se. We propose that two opposite, adhesive gradients guide circumferential migrations on the epidermis. unc-5, unc-6, and unc-40 may encode these adhesion molecules or their cellular receptors. Neurons have access to the basal lamina and the basolateral surfaces of the epidermis, but mesodermal cells contact only the basal lamina. These genes probably identify molecular cues on the basal lamina that guide mesodermal migrations. The same basal lamina cues, or perhaps related molecules on the epidermal cell surfaces, guide pioneer neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1969540615,"Mammalian cell receptors that promote entry of intracellular bacteria into nonphagocytic cells have not been identified. We show here that multiple members of the integrin superfamily of cell adhesion receptors bind the Y. pseudotuberculosis invasin protein prior to bacterial penetration into mammalian cells. Affinity chromatography of crude detergent extracts demonstrated that integrins containing the subunit structures alpha 3 beta 1, alpha 5 beta 1, and alpha 6 beta 1 bound to immobilized invasin. Furthermore, phospholipid vesicles containing isolated integrin proteins were able to attach to invasin. Specificity for invasin binding to the identified integrin receptors was also demonstrated, as immunoprobing and phospholipid reconstitution studies showed that the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin, beta 2 chain integrins, and vitronectin receptor (alpha v beta 3) were not involved in cellular attachment to invasin."
https://openalex.org/W2015312698,"Ultrasound has become an important synthetic tool in liquid-solid chemical reactions, but the origins of the observed enhancements remained unknown. The effects of high-intensity ultrasound on solid-liquid slurries were examined. Turbulent flow and shock waves produced by acoustic cavitation were found to drive metal particles together at sufficiently high velocities to induce melting upon collision. A series of transition-metal powders were used to probe the maximum temperatures and speeds reached during such interparticle collisions. Metal particles that were irradiated in hydrocarbon liquids with ultrasound underwent collisions at roughly half the speed of sound and generated localized effective temperatures between 2600 degrees C and 3400 degrees C at the point of impact for particles with an average diameter of approximately 10 microns."
https://openalex.org/W1978609854,"Cadherins are a group of homophilic intercellular adhesion molecules; each member of this family exhibits binding specificity. Here, we attempted to map the sites for the specificities of these molecules by analyzing adhesives selectivities of the cells that express chimeric and point-mutated E- and P-cadherin. The results showed that the amino-terminal 113 amino acid region is essential to determine the specificities, and within this region we could identify especially important sites in which amino acid substitutions altered the binding specificity of cadherins. We also found that the epitopes for antibodies capable of blocking cadherin action are located in this amino-terminal region."
https://openalex.org/W2039313637,"Actively transcribed chromatin is structurally different from bulk inactive chromatin. It has been difficult to define the molecular basis of the difference, however, because purified fractions of active chromatin were not available. We have overcome this problem by releasing oligonucleosomes from the nonmethylated CpG-rich islands (CpG islands) of HeLa cell nuclei using restriction endonucleases. Since CpG islands very often include the promoters and 5' transcribed regions of genes, they represent a model for the ""active"" chromatin structure. CpG island chromatin differs in three respects from bulk chromatin prepared in the same way: histone H1 is present in very low amounts; histones H3 and H4 are highly acetylated; and nucleosome-free regions are present. Except for the latter regions, the average nucleosomal spacing is similar to that of bulk chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W2054391444,"Human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiological agent for adult T cell leukemia (ATL). The HTLV-I trans-activator protein Tax can activate the expression of its own long terminal repeat (LTR) and many cellular and viral genes. Tax down-regulated the expression of human beta-polymerase (hu beta-pol), a cellular enzyme involved in host cell DNA repair. This finding suggests a possible correlation between HTLV-I infection and host chromosomal damage, which is often seen in ATL cells."
https://openalex.org/W2106801710,"MTF, a murine minor histocompatibility antigen, is maternally inherited and thought to be encoded by a mitochondrial gene. We sequenced the entire mitochondrial genomes from three strains that differ in MTF Mtf beta, Mtf gamma, and Mtf delta) and compared the sequences with the known, Mtf alpha, mitochondrial DNA sequence. We found only one site where all four genomes differed, affecting amino acid residue 6 of ND1, a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase. Incubation of non-Mtf alpha target cells with synthetic peptide ND1 alpha 1-17 (the first 17 amino acid of the ND1 protein of Mtf alpha mice) rendered them susceptible to lysis by MTF alpha-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Similarly, non-Mtf beta target cells were lysed by MTF beta-specific CTLs after incubation with the allelic form ND1 beta 1-17. Thus, Mtf is attributable to allelic variation at a single residue of the ND1 protein. Cells can therefore display peptides derived from mitochondrially encoded proteins, and such peptides can be histocompatibility antigens."

https://openalex.org/W2001183029,"Many proteins are initially synthesized as part of a large precursor. The role of the pro-region in the biosynthesis of transforming growth factor--beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and activin A, two structurally related disulfide-linked homodimers synthesized as large precursors, was studied. Vectors that expressed either the pro-region or the mature regions of these molecules were used in complementation experiments, only when the pro-region was coexpressed with the mature region did intracellular dimerization and secretion of biologically active homodimers occur. The pro-regions of activin A and TGF-beta 1, therefore, aid the folding, disulfide bond formation, and export of their respective homodimers."
https://openalex.org/W2053967009,"Voltage-dependent potassium currents were measured in Xenopus oocytes previously injected with RNAs generated in vitro from each of three cloned cDNAs (RBK1, RBK2, and RGK5). The currents differed in their sensitivities to blockade by tetraethylammonium (TEA; respective KDs 0.3, greater than 100, and 10 mM) and in their inactivation during a depolarizing pulse. Injections of RNA combinations (RBK1/RBK2 and RBK1/RGK5) caused currents that had TEA sensitivities different from those expected from the sum, in any proportion, of the two native channels. It is concluded that novel potassium channels are formed by the oocytes injected with two RNAs, presumably by heteropolymerization of subunits; such heteropolymerization would contribute functional diversity to voltage-dependent potassium channels in addition to that provided by a large gene family."
https://openalex.org/W2086970687,"Prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), a brain secretory polypeptide of insects, stimulates the prothoracic glands to produce and release ecdysone, the steroid essential to insect development. The complementary DNAs encoding PTTH of the silkmoth Bombyx mori were cloned and characterized, and the complete amino acid sequence was deduced. The data indicated that PTTH is first synthesized as a 224-amino acid polypeptide precursor containing three proteolytic cleavage signals. The carboxyl-terminal component (109 amino acids) that follows the last cleavage signal represents one PTTH subunit. Two PTTH subunits are linked together by disulfide bonds, before or after cleavage from prepro-PTTH, to form a homodimeric PTTH. When introduced into Escherichia coli cells, the complementary DNA directed the expression of an active substance that was functionally indistinguishable from natural PTTH. In situ hybridization showed the localization of the prepro-PTTH mRNA to two dorsolateral neurosecretory cells of the Bombyx brain."
https://openalex.org/W1578828739,"The regulation of adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (LPL) was examined in rats fed or fasted overnight, and was found to be controlled posttranslationally. LPL catalytic activity decreased by 50% after fasting while LPL mRNA levels and rates of synthesis increased nearly 2-fold; enzyme mass remained unchanged. The distribution of LPL within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi/post-Golgi secretory pathway was assessed by differentiating between LPL high mannose and complex forms. After fasting, the majority of LPL is in the high mannose ER form (65%, 0.97 micrograms/g wet weight tissue), whereas the LPL complex form comprises only 35% (or 0.52 micrograms/g). After refeeding, however, the Golgi-derived LPL complex form predominates (65%, 1.03 micrograms/g) over the high mannose ER form (35%, 0.55 micrograms/g). Kinetic analysis suggests that high mannose LPL disappears with a half-life of t0.5 = 40 min in both fed and fasted rats, indicating that the redistribution of LPL mass during feeding/fasting does not arise by differential retention within ER. Instead, the fractional catabolic rate of complex LPL within the Golgi/post-Golgi secretory compartment can be calculated to be 3.5-fold greater in fasting. In heart, changes in LPL activity in response to feeding/fasting are also not due to differences in mRNA levels or rates of synthesis. Based on these findings, a model of LPL posttranslational regulation is proposed and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2073005211,"Repair mechanisms related to illegitimate recombination can join nonhomologous DNA ends that terminate as protruding single strands (PSS). Here we analyze in Xenopus egg extracts joining reactions between 3' PSS termini and various partner termini. In junctions, 3' PSS termini are preserved by fill-in DNA synthesis, although their 5' recessed ends cannot serve as a primer. Alternative priming from a partner terminus ligated to the 3' PSS end appears unlikely, because no single strand-specific DNA ligases are detectable. We show that fill-in of 3' PSS termini precedes ligation and can even be primed in the absence of any ligation. Therefore, priming requires precise alignment of terminus pairs by a novel mechanism. We postulate that this is achieved by unique DNA binding proteins that align ends in various types of joining reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2074724874,"Membranes from posterior and anterior thirds of the chick optic tectum were added to explants from nasal and temporal retina. Posterior membranes, and to a lesser extent anterior membranes, cause temporal growth cones to collapse and their axonal processes to retract. Neither tectal source has an effect on nasal growth cones. We interpret these results to mean that there is a tectal activity, stronger in the posterior than the anterior region of the tectum, which helps guide growth cones during the development of the retinotectal map. We believe that in vivo this activity helps to steer temporal growth cones away from the posterior tectum. Nasal growth cones, which must map to the posterior tectum, are resistant to it. In vitro, when posterior membranes contact temporal growth cones over their surface, filopodia and lamellipodia withdraw rapidly. This leads to loss of contact between the growth cone and the substrate, followed by collapse."
https://openalex.org/W2042300283,"Simulations were performed of layers I and II of olfactory paleocortex, as connected to its primary input structure, olfactory bulb. Induction of synaptic long-term potentiation by means of repetitive sampling of inputs caused the simulation to organize encodings of learned cues into a hierarchical memory that uncovered statistical relationships in the cue environment, corresponding to the performance of hierarchical clustering by the biological network. Simplification led to characterization of those parts of the network responsible for the mechanism, resulting in a novel, efficient algorithm for hierarchical clustering. The hypothesis is put forward that these corticobulbar networks and circuitry of similar design in other brain regions contain computational elements sufficient to construct perceptual hierarchies for use in recognizing environmental cues."
https://openalex.org/W2071788180,"Rabbits are unique in that their immunoglobulin VH regions bear allotypic markers encoded by allelic genes. The presence of these markers on most serum immunoglobulins is difficult to explain, as the germline contains several hundred VH genes. We cloned VH genes from normal rabbits of the VHa allotypes a1, a2, and a3 and from a mutant a2 rabbit, Alicia, which expresses almost no a2 allotype. The D-proximal VH gene VH1 of normal rabbits encoded prototype a1, a2, or a3 allotype VH regions in a1, a2, or a3 rabbits, respectively; VH1 was shown to be preferentially utilized in leukemic rabbit B cells. This VH1 gene was deleted from the germline of the Alicia rabbit. These data suggest that the allelic inheritance of a allotypes results from preferential utilization of VH1 in VDJ rearrangements. We suggest that antibody diversity in rabbit primarily results from somatic hypermutation and gene conversion."

Clones carrying a 5.5 kb fragment are able to rescue the progeny of a fem-1 mutant when injected into its oocytes. The major fem-1 transcript in both sexes is 2.4 kb and comprises 11 exons. It encodes a soluble, intracellular protein of 656 amino acids that includes near its N-terminus six contiguous copies of a motif found in the products of the cdc10 gene of S. pombe, the SWI6 gene of S. cerevisiae, the Notch gene of Drosophila, and the lin-12 and glp-1 genes of C. elegans."

https://openalex.org/W2036348209,"The fundamental mechanism underlying the differing rates of tension development in fast and slow mammalian skeletal muscle is still unknown. Now, in skinned (membrane-permeabilized) single fibers it has been shown that the rate of formation of the strongly bound, force-producing cross-bridge between actin and myosin is calcium-sensitive in both fast and slow fibers and that the rate is markedly greater in fast fibers. The transition rates obtained at high calcium concentrations correlated with myosin isoform content, whereas at low calcium concentrations the thin filament regulatory proteins appeared to modulate the rate of tension development, especially in fast fibers. Fiber type-dependent differences in rates of cross-bridge transitions may account for the characteristic rates of tension development in mammalian fast and slow skeletal muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1996089840,"The CD4 receptor on human T cells has been shown to play an integral part in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection process. Recombinant soluble human CD4 (rCD4) was tested for its ability to inhibit SIVagm, an HIV-like virus that naturally infects African green monkeys, in order to define T cell surface receptors critical for SIVagm infection. The rCD4 was found to enhance SIVagm infection of a human T cell line by as much as 18-fold, whereas HIV-1 infection was blocked by rCD4. Induction of syncytium formation and de novo protein synthesis were observed within the first 24 hours after SIVagm infection, whereas this process took 4 to 6 days in the absence of rCD4. This enhancing effect could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed to rCD4. The enhancing effect could be abrogated with antibodies from naturally infected African green monkeys with inhibitory titers of from 1:2,000 to 1:10,000; these antibodies did not neutralize SIVagm infection in the absence of rCD4. Viral enhancement of SIVagm infection by rCD4 may result from the modulation of the viral membrane through gp120-CD4 binding, thus facilitating secondary events involved in viral fusion and penetration."
https://openalex.org/W2117647220,"We have cloned a cDNA coding for a delayed rectifier K+ channel from rat brain (RCK1) and rat muscle (RMK1) and expressed it in Xenopus oocytes and in a myoblast cell line (Sol-8). Stably transfected Sol-8 cells exhibited large outward K+ currents, which were indistinguishable from the K+ currents induced in Xenopus oocytes by injection of mRNA transcribed in vitro. RCK1 encodes a K+ channel with a unitary conductance of ∼14 pS. The steep voltage dependence of channel opening resides in transitions between closed states, whereas the direct transitions into and out of the open state are very rapid and not markedly voltage-dependent. Channel inactivation is very slow, voltage-independent, and occurs from the open state only. We present a simple model that incorporates our findings and is consistent with the presumed structural symmetry of a functional K+ channel."
https://openalex.org/W2013236126,"In a T cell receptor transgenic mouse model of thymic selection, the efficiency of selection of the transgenic αβ heterodimer is significantly enhanced in animals that express higher densities of the relevant major histocompatibility complex molecule (). These results imply that there is a stochastic component to positive selection in the thymus. Allelic variants of the original selecting I-Ek molecule are either less efficient (Eαk:Eβb) or incapable (Eαk:Eβa and I-Ed) of mediating the selection of transgenic αβ+ T cells. Two of these three I-E variants appear to differ from I-Ek in amino acid residues of the peptide binding site and not in residues capable of contacting the T cell receptor, suggesting that specific peptides, or conformations of peptides, play a role in positive selection. In contrast, mice transgenic for only the β chain of this T cell receptor show selection for CD4+ T cells in the presence of all four I-E variants tested."

https://openalex.org/W2016271900,"The objective of this study was to determine the direction of membrane lipid flow in locomoting cells. The plasma membrane of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was stained with a fluorescent lipid analog dihexadecanoyl indocarbocyanine. A line was photobleached on the cell surface perpendicular to the direction of cell motion. Low-light-level fluorescence microscopy and digital image-processing techniques were used to analyze a series of images taken at short intervals after photobleaching. The bleached line remained visible for about 5 seconds before being erased by diffusional recovery. Examination of fluorescence intensity profiles allowed a comparison to be made between the velocities of line and cell movement. Results indicate that the bleached line moves forward with the same velocity as the cell during locomotion, refuting the retrograde lipid flow model of locomotion. Instead, the plasma membrane lipid appears to move forward according to either the unit movement of membrane or the tank track model of locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W1512465642,"Leiurotoxin I (scyllatoxin) is a 31-amino acid polypeptide from the venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus which has been previously isolated and sequenced by others. This paper reports (i) the total synthesis of this scorpion neurotoxin as well as some aspects of its structure-function relationships; (ii) the synthesis of the analog [Tyr2]leiurotoxin I (scyllatoxin) that has been monoiodinated at high specific radioactivity (2000 Ci/mmol) and has served for the characterization of the properties of 125I-[Tyr2]leiurotoxin I binding sites (Kd = 80 pM, molecular mass of 27 and 57 kDa for two polypeptides in the leiurotoxin I binding protein); (iii) the similarity of physiological actions between leiurotoxin I and apamin. Both toxins contract Taenia coli previously relaxed with epinephrine, both toxins block the after-hyperpolarization due to Ca2(+)-activated K+ channel activity in muscle cells in culture; (iv) the probable identity of binding sites for apamin and leiurotoxin I. In spite of a different chemical structure apamin competitively inhibits 125I-[Tyr2] leiurotoxin I binding and vice versa. Moreover, the peculiar effects of K+ on 125I-[Tyr2]leiurotoxin I binding are identical to those previously observed for 125I-apamin binding."
https://openalex.org/W1482030582,"The complete primary structure has been determined for an inhibitor protein of protein kinase C. The bovine brain-derived inhibitor has a pI of 6 and its N-terminal alanine residue is blocked by acetylation. Fragments obtained by chemical and enzymatic cleavage of the purified inhibitor were analyzed by Edman degradation, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and tandem mass spectrometry. The results establish that the protein has a calculated average molecular mass of 13,690 daltons and contains 125 amino acid residues with the following sequence: (sequence: see text) The inhibitor does not show significant homology with any other known protein. Circular dichroism of the freshly prepared apoprotein indicated a secondary structural content of 23% alpha-helix, 31% beta-sheet, and 11% beta-turn. Immobilization on nitrocellulose followed by exposure to a 65Zn2(+)-containing overlay solution showed that, like protein kinase C itself, the inhibitor is a zinc-binding protein, although the sequence does not reveal a zinc finger structure. Competition with 10-fold molar excess Ca2+ or Mg2+ did not reduce the zinc-binding specificity of this inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2050430863,"A transient K+ current coded by the Shaker gene was identified in muscle and expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injecting cRNA transcribed from a cloned cDNA. The Shaker current has not previously been identified in neurons. Mutational analysis now reveals that in neurons, Shaker is required for expression of a very rapidly inactivating K+ current with a depolarized steady-state inactivation curve. Together, these properties distinguish the Shaker-coded current from similar fast transient K+ currents coded by other genes. The Sh5 mutation further enhanced the depolarization of the Shaker current steady-state inactivation curve. Deletion of the Shaker gene completely removes the transient K+ current from a small percentage of neurons (15%) in a mixed population, and removes a portion of the whole-cell current in about 35% of neurons. The remaining 50% of neurons were apparently unaffected by deletion of the Shaker gene. The unique combination of rapid inactivation and depolarized steady-state inactivation of the Shaker current may reflect a unique functional role for this curent in the nervous system such as the rapid repolarization of action potentials."

https://openalex.org/W1963002584,"Probucol, 4,4'-(isopropylidenedithio)bis(2,6-di-tert-butylphenol), has been shown to inhibit atherogenesis in genetically hypercholesterolemic (Watanabe) rabbits. Since atherosclerotic lesions contain macrophages capable of screting interleukin 1 (IL 1) and other cytokines that could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease, we have investigated whether probucol affects IL 1 secretion. Resident peritoneal macrophages from mice dosed with probucol secreted 40-80% less IL 1 than macrophages from control animals when stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The inhibitory effect of probucol was observed when IL 1 was assayed by the standard bioassay, the thymocyte proliferation assay, or a competitive IL 1 receptor binding assay. Probucol treatment had no effect on LPS-induced membrane IL 1 expression; secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF); Con A-induced splenic interleukin 2 (IL 2) and interleukin 3 (IL 3) release; and prostaglandin- or zymosan-induced secretion of prostacyclin, leukotriene C4, acid phosphatase, or superoxide anion. In contrast to the effect of oral administration, direct addition of probucol to macrophage cultures did not inhibit IL 1 release. Probucol administration did, however, inhibit the fall in serum zinc level induced by intravenous injection of LPS in zymosan-primed mice but had no effect on the LPS-induced increase in serum triglyceride levels, which indirectly confirms that probucol administration inhibits IL 1 but not TNF secretion. Paw granuloma induced in mice by heat-killed mycobacteria was inhibited by oral administration of probucol, an effect that may be attributable to inhibition of IL 1 secretion. Probucol neither reduced zymosan-induced liver granulomata in mice nor inhibited adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. We suggest that inhibition of IL 1 secretion from macrophages by probucol contributes to its therapeutic effects in atherosclerosis and may also result in beneficial activity in some chronic inflammatory diseases.— Ku, G.; Doherty, N.

https://openalex.org/W1973670712,"Antibodies were raised to three portions of the predicted sequences of Shaker, a gene that encodes a family of K+ channel components that are produced by the alternative splicing of transcripts. On immunoblots, the protein products appear to be 65,000-85,000 daltons in size. No smaller products were detected. Immunocytochemistry has revealed a nonuniform distribution of Shaker products in the brain of the adult fly. By comparing antisera directed against regions shared by all the splicing variants to antisera that are directed against one particular group of splicing variants, we have determined that there is a differential distribution of that group of variants. Thus, the alternative splicing of Shaker transcripts appears to produce different subtypes of A-channels in different tissues."

Repeated cycles in the density of this chloride current could be recorded for up to 6 hours (four cycles) in cleavage-arrested embryos, whether they were activated by sperm or calcium ionophore. These data suggest that there is a direct link between the cell cycle clock and the properties of this channel, a link that results in pronounced cyclical changes in the electrical properties of early blastomeres."
https://openalex.org/W1603766972,"The staphylococcal enterotoxin B gene (seb) is positively regulated at the transcriptional level (Gaskill, M. E., and Khan, S. A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6276-6280). The sequences involved in the regulation of transcription of the seb gene have been studied by deletion analysis. A multicopy Staphylococcus aureus plasmid carrying the cloned seb gene was used to generate a series of mutants that are deleted in the upstream region of this gene. The levels of enterotoxin B protein and mRNA produced by the deletion mutants were analyzed. A region between 59 and 93 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site was found to be required for transcription and expression of the seb gene. Deletion of this sequence greatly reduced or eliminated transcription of the seb gene. DNA-protein binding experiments showed that cell-free extracts made from an staphylococcal enterotoxin B-producing strain contain protein(s) that specifically bind to the upstream region. This protein may be involved in the transcriptional activation of the seb gene."

https://openalex.org/W1546782115,"The fluorescent probe, fura 2, is widely used to measure agonist-induced changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cultured cells. However, in many instances, the results obtained in the same cell type have differed from one study to the next. The possibility that such differences might be due to experimental conditions was examined by using fura 2 in four different cell types responding to appropriate agonists when the cells were incubated in either CO2/HCO3-- or HEPES-buffered media. Examined were: 1) the response of rat glomerular mesangial cells to arginine vasopressin, 2) the response of vascular smooth muscle cells to angiotensin II, 3) the response of adrenal glomerulosa cells to angiotensin II, and 4) the response of hypothalamic cells to insulin-like growth factor-1. In each cell type there was a significant difference in the pattern of agonist-induced change in [Ca2+]i when HEPES vs. CO2/HCO3- was used as the buffer system: in HEPES buffer, agonist addition led to a transient rise in [Ca2+]i followed by a fall to a sustained plateau 27 to 34 nM higher than the original basal value, whereas in CO2/HCO3- buffer, agonist addition led to an identical transient increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a fall to a value within 10 nM or less of the preagonist level. The plateau value of [Ca2+]i in the different buffers was examined in relationship to known differences in intracellular pH (pHi). It was found that measurements of [Ca2+]i with fura 2 were influenced by shifts in pHi that occur when cells are incubated in either HEPES-buffered or CO2/HCO3- media of differing pHo values. However, at any given value of pHi, the apparent [Ca2+]i measured in cells incubated in HEPES-buffered media was slightly higher than in cells incubated in CO2/HCO3- buffered media."

https://openalex.org/W2040719023,"Toxin I (DTX-I), a 60-residue peptide belonging to the dendrotoxin family of Mamba snake neurotoxins, is a potent inhibitor of various types of voltage-gated K+ currents. To investigate the sensitivity of another major class of K+ channels to DTX-I, the effect of this toxin was studied on single Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels from rat skeletal muscle incorporated into planar bilayers. Internal (intracellular) DTX-I was found to induce reversibly a long-lived (tau = 40 s), inwardly rectifying subconductance state with 66% of the normal open-state current at +20 mV. Analysis of the kinetics of substate formation and the current-voltage behavior of the substate suggest that binding of DTX-I modifies conduction of K+ ions through the pore without affecting the Ca2+ dependence or voltage dependence of gating. These results identify a unique internal binding site for DTX-I (Kd = 90 nM in 50 mM KCl) on a ubiquitous class of high-conductance, Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels."
