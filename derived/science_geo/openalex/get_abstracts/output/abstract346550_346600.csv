https://openalex.org/W2121881475,"Recent evidence suggests that alterations in insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling (IIS) can increase mammalian life span. For example, in several mouse mutants, impairment of the growth hormone (GH)/IGF1 axis increases life span and also insulin sensitivity. However, the intracellular signaling route to altered mammalian aging remains unclear. We therefore measured the life span of mice lacking either insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 or 2, the major intracellular effectors of the IIS receptors. Our provisional results indicate that female Irs1-/- mice are long-lived. Furthermore, they displayed resistance to a range of age-sensitive markers of aging including skin, bone, immune, and motor dysfunction. These improvements in health were seen despite mild, lifelong insulin resistance. Thus, enhanced insulin sensitivity is not a prerequisite for IIS mutant longevity. Irs1-/- female mice also displayed normal anterior pituitary function, distinguishing them from long-lived somatotrophic axis mutants. In contrast, Irs2-/- mice were short-lived, whereas Irs1+/- and Irs2+/- mice of both sexes showed normal life spans. Our results therefore suggest that IRS1 signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway regulating mammalian life span and may be a point of intervention for therapies with the potential to delay age-related processes."

https://openalex.org/W2068064057,"As a language evolves, grammatical rules emerge and exceptions die out. Lieberman et al. have calculated the rate at which a language grows more regular, based on 1,200 years of English usage. Of 177 irregular verbs, 79 became regular in the last millennium. And the trend follows a simple rule: a verb's half-life scales as the square root of its frequency. Irregular verbs that are 100 times as rare regularize 10 times faster. The emergence of a rule (such as adding –ed for the past tense) spells death for exceptional forms. The cover graphic makes the point: verb size corresponds to usage frequency, so large verbs stay at the top, and small verbs fall to the bottom. 'Wed', the next irregular verb to go, is on the brink. In a separate study, Pagel et al. looked at changing word meanings. Across the Indo-European languages, words like 'tail' or 'bird' evolve rapidly and are expressed by many unrelated words. Others, like 'two', are expressed by closely related word forms across the whole language family. Data from over 80 modern languages show that the more a word is used, the less it changes. Statistical modelling techniques and concepts from biology are applied to linguistic data to show a general and law-like relationship between the frequency with which meanings are used in everyday language and their rate of evolution throughout Indo-European history: the more a word is used, the less likely it is to change over time. The findings demonstrate a fundamental aspect of language evolution that is predicted to apply to all languages. Greek speakers say “ουρ ”, Germans “schwanz” and the French “queue” to describe what English speakers call a ‘tail’, but all of these languages use a related form of ‘two’ to describe the number after one. Among more than 100 Indo-European languages and dialects, the words for some meanings (such as ‘tail’) evolve rapidly, being expressed across languages by dozens of unrelated words, while others evolve much more slowly—such as the number ‘two’, for which all Indo-European language speakers use the same related word-form1. No general linguistic mechanism has been advanced to explain this striking variation in rates of lexical replacement among meanings. Here we use four large and divergent language corpora (English2, Spanish3, Russian4 and Greek5) and a comparative database of 200 fundamental vocabulary meanings in 87 Indo-European languages6 to show that the frequency with which these words are used in modern language predicts their rate of replacement over thousands of years of Indo-European language evolution. Across all 200 meanings, frequently used words evolve at slower rates and infrequently used words evolve more rapidly. This relationship holds separately and identically across parts of speech for each of the four language corpora, and accounts for approximately 50% of the variation in historical rates of lexical replacement. We propose that the frequency with which specific words are used in everyday language exerts a general and law-like influence on their rates of evolution. Our findings are consistent with social models of word change that emphasize the role of selection, and suggest that owing to the ways that humans use language, some words will evolve slowly and others rapidly across all languages."

https://openalex.org/W2059775504,"Methylene blue (MB) has been used clinically for about a century to treat numerous ailments. We show that MB and other diaminophenothiazines extend the life span of human IMR90 fibroblasts in tissue culture by >20 population doubling (PDLs). MB delays senescence at nM levels in IMR90 by enhancing mitochondrial function. MB increases mitochondrial complex IV by 30%, enhances cellular oxygen consumption by 37-70%, increases heme synthesis, and reverses premature senescence caused by H2O2 or cadmium. MB also induces phase-2 antioxidant enzymes in hepG2 cells. Flavin-dependent enzymes are known to use NAD(P)H to reduce MB to leucomethylene blue (MBH2), whereas cytochrome c reoxidizes MBH2 to MB. Experiments on lysates from rat liver mitochondria suggest the ratio MB/cytochrome c is important for the protective actions of MB. We propose that the cellular senescence delay caused by MB is due to cycling between MB and MBH2 in mitochondria, which may partly explain the increase in specific mitochondrial activities. Cycling of MB between oxidized and reduced forms may block oxidant production by mitochondria. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are thought to be key aberrations that lead to cellular senescence and aging. MB may be useful to delay mitochondrial dysfunction with aging and the decrease in complex IV in Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2010400641,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central controller of cell growth, and it regulates translation, cell size, cell viability, and cell morphology. mTOR integrates a wide range of extracellular and intracellular signals, including growth factors, nutrients, energy levels, and stress conditions. Rheb, a Ras-related small GTPase, is a key upstream activator of mTOR. In this study, we found that Bnip3, a hypoxia-inducible Bcl-2 homology 3 domain-containing protein, directly binds Rheb and inhibits the mTOR pathway. Bnip3 decreases Rheb GTP levels in a manner depending on the binding to Rheb and the presence of the N-terminal domain. Both knockdown and overexpression experiments show that Bnip3 plays an important role in mTOR inactivation in response to hypoxia. Moreover, Bnip3 inhibits cell growth in vivo by suppressing the mTOR pathway. These observations demonstrate that Bnip3 mediates the inhibition of the mTOR pathway in response to hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2002134090,"The origin of metazoan development and differentiation was contingent upon the evolution of cell adhesion, communication and cooperation mechanisms. While components of many of the major cell signalling pathways have been identified in a range of sponges (phylum Porifera), their roles in development have not been investigated and remain largely unknown. Here, we take the first steps toward reconstructing the developmental signalling systems used in the last common ancestor to living sponges and eumetazoans by studying the expression of genes encoding Wnt and TGF-beta signalling ligands during the embryonic development of a sponge.Using resources generated in the recent sponge Amphimedon queenslandica (Demospongiae) genome project, we have recovered genes encoding Wnt and TGF-beta signalling ligands that are critical in patterning metazoan embryos. Both genes are expressed from the earliest stages of Amphimedon embryonic development in highly dynamic patterns. At the time when the Amphimedon embryos begin to display anterior-posterior polarity, Wnt expression becomes localised to the posterior pole and this expression continues until the swimming larva stage. In contrast, TGF-beta expression is highest at the anterior pole. As in complex animals, sponge Wnt and TGF-beta expression patterns intersect later in development during the patterning of a sub-community of cells that form a simple tissue-like structure, the pigment ring. Throughout development, Wnt and TGF-beta are expressed radially along the anterior-posterior axis.We infer from the expression of Wnt and TGF-beta in Amphimedon that the ancestor that gave rise to sponges, cnidarians and bilaterians had already evolved the capacity to direct the formation of relatively sophisticated body plans, with axes and tissues. The radially symmetrical expression patterns of Wnt and TGF-beta along the anterior-posterior axis of sponge embryos and larvae suggest that these signalling pathways contributed to establishing axial polarity in the very first metazoans."

https://openalex.org/W2090933843,"DyP, a unique dye-decolorizing enzyme from the fungus <i>Thanatephorus cucumeris</i> Dec 1, has been classified as a peroxidase but lacks homology to almost all other known plant peroxidases. The primary structure of DyP shows moderate sequence homology to only two known proteins: the peroxide-dependent phenol oxidase, TAP, and the hypothetical peroxidase, cpop21. Here, we show the first crystal structure of DyP and reveal that this protein has a unique tertiary structure with a distal heme region that differs from that of most other peroxidases. DyP lacks an important histidine residue known to assist in the formation of a Fe<sup>4+</sup> oxoferryl center and a porphyrin-based cation radical intermediate (compound I) during the action of ubiquitous peroxidases. Instead, our tertiary structural and spectrophotometric analyses of DyP suggest that an aspartic acid and an arginine are involved in the formation of compound I. Sequence analysis reveals that the important aspartic acid and arginine mentioned above and histidine of the heme ligand are conserved among DyP, TAP, and cpop21, and structural and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that these three enzymes do not belong to any other families of peroxidase. These findings, which strongly suggest that DyP is a representative heme peroxidase from a novel family, should facilitate the identification of additional new family members and accelerate the classification of this novel peroxidase family."
https://openalex.org/W1649296624,"Laser radiation is usually measured with detectors that determine frequency and intensity, but gather no information about the phase of the radiation. By measuring the phase it would become possible to gain insights in the dynamic processes of optical amplification and attenuation underlying laser operation. Kröll et al. have now developed a way of measuring amplitude as well as phase of laser radiation from so-called quantum cascade lasers, which operate in the terahertz regime. The technique, which could be extended to other types of lasers, can be used to study effects leading to optical losses — useful information to improve the laser performance. Laser radiation is usually measured with intensity detectors that determine frequency and intensity, but throw away information about the phase of the radiation. But a scheme has been developed to measure amplitude as well as phase of laser radiation from so-called quantum cascade lasers, which operate in the terahertz regime. Lasers are usually described by their output frequency and intensity. However, laser operation is an inherently nonlinear process. Knowledge about the dynamic behaviour of lasers is thus of great importance for detailed understanding of laser operation and for improvement in performance for applications. Of particular interest is the time domain within the coherence time of the optical transition. This time is determined by the oscillation period of the laser radiation and thus is very short. Rigorous quantum mechanical models1,2 predict interesting effects like quantum beats, lasing without inversion, and photon echo processes. As these models are based on quantum coherence and interference, knowledge of the phase within the optical cycle is of particular interest. Laser radiation has so far been measured using intensity detectors, which are sensitive to the square of the electric field. Therefore information about the sign and phase of the laser radiation is lost. Here we use an electro-optic detection scheme to measure the amplitude and phase of stimulated radiation, and correlate this radiation directly with an input probing pulse. We have applied this technique to semiconductor quantum cascade lasers, which are coherent sources operating at frequencies between the optical (>100 THz) and electronic (<0.5 THz) ranges3. In addition to the phase information, we can also determine the spectral gain, the bias dependence of this gain, and obtain an insight into the evolution of the laser field."
https://openalex.org/W1980246358,"The activity of human replication protein A (RPA) in DNA replication and repair is regulated by phosphorylation of the middle RPA2 subunit. It has previously been shown that up to nine different N-terminal residues are modified in vivo and in response to genotoxic stress. Using a novel antibody against phospho-Ser29, a moiety formed by cyclin-Cdk, we observed that RPA2 was phosphorylated during mitosis in nonstressed cells. Robust phosphorylation of Ser29 was also seen in interphase cells following treatment with the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin, a rare example of stress stimulating the modification of a repair factor by cyclin-Cdk. RPA2 phosphorylation is regulated both in cis and trans. Cis-phosphorylation follows a preferred pathway. (That is, the initial modification of Ser33 by ATR stimulates subsequent phosphorylation of Cdk sites Ser23 and Ser29). These events then facilitate modification of Thr21 and extreme N-terminal sites Ser4 and Ser8, probably by DNA-PK. Our data also indicate that the phosphorylation of one RPA molecule can influence the phosphorylation of other RPA molecules in trans. Cells in which endogenous RPA2 was “replaced” with a double S23A/S29A-RPA2 mutant were seen to have an abnormal cell cycle distribution both in normal and in stressed cells.

Nature. 2004; 430: 992-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Because of these many roles, it is of significant interest to understand the mechanisms that regulate RPA activity. Of the ∼70-kDa (RPA1), 30-kDa (RPA2), and 14-kDa (RPA3) subunits, human RPA is subject to extensive phosphorylation on RPA2 (2Binz S.K. Sheehan A.M. Wold M.S. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and at one RPA1 site (15Nuss J.E. Patrick S.M. Oakley G.G. Alter G.M. Robison J.G. Dixon K. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8428-8437Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 33 residues of RPA2 undergo both cell cycle- and stress-dependent phosphorylation on approximately nine sites (Fig. 1A), which are thought to exist in an unstructured conformation (16Bochkareva E.

Ser23 and Ser29 are constitutively modified during mitosis by cyclin B-Cdk1 (18Fang F. Newport J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 983-994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Oakley G.G. Patrick S.M. Yao J.

These two residues may also undergo heightened phosphorylation in response to UV irradiation (22Zernik-Kobak M. Vasunia K. Connelly M. Anderson C.W. Dixon K. J. Biol.

The Thr21 and Ser33 residues are consensus sites for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinase (PIKK) family members (ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK) that signal the presence of DNA damage and replication stress. Under DNA damage conditions, the phosphorylation of Thr21 is apparently catalyzed by ATM, DNA-PK, and probably ATR (22Zernik-Kobak M. Vasunia K. Connelly M. Anderson C.W. Dixon K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 39517-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have concluded that Ser33 is modified by ATR. The remaining sites (Ser4, Ser8, Ser11, Ser12, and Ser13) are phosphorylated in response to genotoxic stress, although the responsible kinase(s) in vivo has not yet been identified. However, all can be modified by DNA-PK in vitro (22Zernik-Kobak M. Vasunia K. Connelly M. Anderson C.W. Dixon K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23896-23904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Others have also shown the involvement of DNA-PK in supporting RPA2 hyperphosphorylation (25Shao R.G.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8554-8563PubMed Google Scholar). RPA activity in vivo is regulated by phosphorylation. RPA containing RPA2 mutations that mimic hyperphosphorylation selectively prevent the association of RPA with replication centers but not repair foci (24Olson E. Nievera C.J. Klimovich V. Fanning E. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39517-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27Vassin V.M. Wold M.S. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1930-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Similarly, others have found that ATR-dependent phosphorylation of RPA inhibits DNA synthesis following UV irradiation (24Olson E. Nievera C.J. Klimovich V. Fanning E. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39517-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These effects are probably mediated by RPA phosphorylation regulating its association with other factors. It has been found that treatment of cells with camptothecin (CPT) led to dissociation of RPA·DNA-PK complexes, an event presumably mediated by RPA phosphorylation (25Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Zhang H. Kohn K.W. Wold M.S. Pommier Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A test of the mitotic RPA species (mentioned above) found that it had reduced affinity for ATM and DNA polymerase α, as compared with nonphosphorylated RPA (19Oakley G.G. Patrick S.M. Yao J. Carty M.P. Turchi J.J. Dixon K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3255-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The Wold laboratory similarly observed that RPA phosphorylation reduced its interaction with DNA polymerase α and SV40 T antigen but increased association with p53 (2Binz S.K. Sheehan A.M. Wold M.S. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Along with being a substrate for ATR, RPA is also instrumental in signaling the presence of replication stress and is an essential component of a pathway that activates the kinase (28Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar, 29Namiki Y. Zou L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The primary activation pathway during DNA replication stress apparently involves binding of RPA to ssDNA formed after DNA polymerase stalling and continued movement of the replicative helicase. This persistent RPA·ssDNA intermediate supports binding of the ATR·ATRIP complex and, in combination with other factors, leads to activation of the ATR kinase (30McGowan C.H. Russell P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which then phosphorylates RPA2 at Ser33. ATR is also regulated across the cell cycle with the processing of double strand breaks (DSBs) to RPA·ssDNA intermediates (that allow kinase activation) occurring only in the S and G2 phases when Cdk kinase activity is significant (31Jazayeri A. Falck J. Lukas C. Bartek J. Smith G.C. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a test of human cell extracts indicated that RPA phosphorylated by Cdk stimulates modification by DNA-PK (32Pan Z.Q. Amin A.A. Gibbs E. Niu H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Such data indicate that RPA phosphorylation events catalyzed by Cdk, PIKK, and other kinases may be interdependent. Because of the importance of RPA phosphorylation, we employed phospho-specific antibodies, including a novel antibody recognizing the Ser29 cyclin-Cdk site, to examine the modification pattern of RPA2 at five of the N-terminal sites. We find that, under conditions of genotoxic stress, the actions of cyclin-Cdk and PIKK in causing RPA hyperphosphorylation are synergistic, and both are necessary to cause subsequent modification of extreme N-terminal RPA2 residues. Cells expressing RPA2 mutated at the two cyclin-Cdk sites had more intense RPA2 staining and increased persistence of γH2AX foci following genotoxic stress. These data indicate that RPA phosphorylation stimulates DNA repair. Cell Culture—U2-OS cells were cultured in McCoy's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lines positive (MO59K) or null (MO59J) for the DNA-PK catalytic subunit were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1, v/v) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. As required, cells were treated for 1 h with 2 μm CPT (Sigma) or 75 μg/ml bleomycin (Ble; Calbiochem). For synchronization experiments, cells were arrested in prometaphase by treatment with 100 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 14–16 h, and the mitotic cells were isolated by shake-off. To release cells from the mitotic block, nocodazole-arrested cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), released in medium devoid of nocodazole, and then collected at various times postrelease. CPT or Ble treatment occurred 1 h prior to harvest. When testing kinase activity against mitotic RPA, cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole and 200 μm roscovitine (cyclin-Cdk inhibitor; Calbiochem) for 16 h. To examine the role of cyclin-Cdk in phosphorylation of RPA during genotoxic stress, cells were first treated with 50 or 200 μm roscovitine for 45 min, followed by treatment with 2 μm CPT (in the continued presence of roscovitine) for 1 h. In order to inhibit ERK activation, cells were pretreated with U0126 (a kind gift from Dr. Paolo Mignotti) at 10 μm for 1 h. Genotoxic stress was induced by treatment with 2 μm CPT for 1 h in the continued presence of the inhibitor. Transient transfections were performed using Effectene (Qiagen). Kit reagents were used at one-third of the recommended quantity, and cells were incubated with these reagents for 12 h followed by a change of medium. Cells were collected for analysis 48 h post-transfection. λ-Phosphatase Treatment—For phosphatase treatment, cells were lysed in λ-protein phosphatase buffer (New England Biolabs) containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm MnCl2 and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates (20 μg of protein) were then incubated with 400 units of λ-protein phosphatase for 30 min at 30 °C or mock-treated in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors (0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 mm NaF). Lysates were examined by Western blotting. RPA2 Mutagenesis and Retrovirus Expression—The Myc-tagged RPA2 expression vector was previously described (27Vassin V.M. Wold M.S. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1930-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This vector was used to generate the Ser to Ala or Asp phosphorylation site mutations (Fig. 1B) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Top strand primers were as follows: S23A (5′-CTA CAC GCA GGC CCC GGG GGG CT-3′); S23D (5′-TAC ACG CAG GAC CCG GGG GGC T-3′); S29A (5′-GGG GGG CTT TGG AGC ACC CGC ACC TTC TC-3′); S29D (5′-GGG GGG CTT TGG AGA TCC CGC ACC TTC TC-3′); T21A (5′-CCG GCG GCT ACG CAC AGT CCC CGG G-3′). The S23A-RPA2 was used as a template to generate the S23A/S29A double mutant, whereas S23D-RPA2 was the template to prepare the S23D/S29D double mutant. Similarly, we used the S33A-RPA2 mutant 3V. Vassin, R. W. Anantha, and J. A. Borowiec, manuscript in preparation. as the template to prepare the T21A/S33A double mutant. To analyze the effect of Cdk site mutation on mitotic RPA2 phosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation during genotoxic stress, the Myc-tagged versions of the Cdk site mutants were transiently transfected into U2-OS cells (see Fig. 2C). For all other analyses, untagged versions of RPA2 were generated. In order to do so, the mutated version of RPA2 was amplified by PCR using primers (forward, 5′-TGC AGA TAT CCA GCA CAG TGG CGG CCG CTC GAG-3′; reverse, 5′-AAT GGA TCC TTA TTC TGC ATC TGT GGA TTT AAA ATG GTC ATC ATC C-3′) that contain NotI and BamHI sites in the forward and reverse primers, respectively. PCR products were then subcloned into the NotI and BamHI sites on the pRetro-Off retroviral vector (Clontech). The mutants tested are shown (Fig. 1B). Production of retroviruses containing the RPA2 expression cassette was performed in Phoenix cells (obtained from G. Nolan; Stanford University) using the Phoenix Retroviral Helper dependent protocol (available on the World Wide Web). U2-OS cells at 40% confluence were infected with the desired retrovirus for 48 h in the presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline (to inhibit ectopic untagged RPA2 expression). Clones resistant to puromycin (1 μg/ml) were isolated and assayed for expression of the ectopic RPA2. This was done by Western blot analysis, after silencing of endogenous RPA2 (see below), both in the presence and absence of doxycycline. Clones that showed strong doxycycline-regulated induction of RPA2 were selected and amplified for further analysis. RPA2 Replacement Strategy and Silencing—For replacement of endogenous RPA2, retrovirally infected U2-OS clones were first grown for 48 h in medium lacking doxycycline to allow ectopic RPA2 expression (Fig. 1C). The endogenous RPA2 was then down-modulated using an siRNA molecule (top strand sequence, 5′-AAC CUA GUU UCA CAA UCU GUU-3′) targeting the 3′-untranslated region of the RPA2 mRNA (27Vassin V.M. Wold M.S. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1930-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Silencing was achieved using Hiperfect (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions, with cells tested 72 h post-transfection. Representative levels of RPA2 following down-modulation and ectopic induction by Western blot are shown (Fig. 1D), demonstrating the efficiency of the silencing and replacement procedure. A parallel investigation using immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates that the “replaced” cells each have similar levels of ectopic RPA2 expression (supplemental Fig. 1). Immunoblotting and Antibodies—For Western analysis, cells were directly lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the lysate proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were immobilized onto Protran nitrocellulose membranes (0.2-μm pore size). The antibodies used in this study were against c-Myc (Bethyl Biolabs), general RPA2 (NeoMarkers), Thr(P)21 (Abcam), and Ser(P)4/Ser(P)8-, Ser(P)33-, and Ser(P)29-RPA2 antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories). The Ser(P)29-RPA2 antibody was custom-synthesized and affinity-purified by Bethyl using a “CSPGGFGpSPAPSQ” phosphopeptide (where pS represents phosphoserine). For developing Western blots, Western wash buffer (PBS containing Tween 20 (0.3%, v/v), 5 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) was used. All phospho-specific antibodies were incubated in Western wash buffer containing nonfat dry milk (0.5%, w/v) and bovine serum albumin (0.5%, w/v). The secondary antibodies and nonphospho-specific primary antibodies were incubated in the Western wash buffer containing 0.2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. Detection was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For visualization of RPA2 foci, cells were split onto coverslips 48 h postsilencing. Cells were then either mock- or CPT-treated 24 h later. For treatment, cells were incubated with 2 μm CPT for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS and extraction with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in CSK buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2) for 2 min on ice. Cells were then fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde either immediately (0 h) or 8 h post-CPT treatment. γH2AX foci were generated by treatment of replaced cells with either 5 μm CPT (70 h postsilencing) or 30 μg/ml Ble (56 h postsilencing), in both cases for 2.5 h. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and extracted and fixed either immediately (0 h) or at 8 h (CPT) or 15 h (Ble) postwash. Coverslips were then stained with primary and secondary antibodies. Quantitation of foci intensity was performed using IPLab software (RPA2; BD Biosciences) or ImageJ (γH2AX; National Institutes of Health). In order to observe RPA2 expression patterns in wt-RPA2 versus S23A/S29A-RPA2 clones, cells were directly fixed and stained with a monoclonal RPA2 antibody. Flow Cytometry—Trypsinized cells were washed with PBS and fixed by dropwise addition into a 10× volume of ice-cold 70% ethanol. Following an overnight incubation at 4 °C, cells were pelleted and stained with 0.5 ml of a solution containing PBS, 0.02% (w/v) propidium iodide (Sigma), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 200 μg/ml RNase A, for 15 min at 37 °C followed by cell sorting. FACS was performed on a BD Bioscience flow cytometer using Cell Quest software. Cell cycle analysis was performed using Mod-Fit software. Phosphorylation of the RPA2 Ser29 Cyclin-Cdk Site in Vivo—Characterization of the effect of genotoxic stress on the human RPA phosphorylation pattern has been aided by the recent development of phospho-specific antibodies directed against the various phosphorylation sites. At the time of this study, antibodies were commercially available against Thr(P)21, Ser(P)33, and doubly phosphorylated Ser(P)4/Ser(P)8 (Fig. 1A). To add to this collection, we developed an antibody recognizing Ser(P)29, a cyclin-Cdk site reported to be modified constitutively during mitosis. Like the anti-Ser(P)33 and -Thr(P)21 RPA2 antibodies, the Ser(P)29 antibody was observed to show little reactivity to lysates prepared from control U2-OS cells (Fig. 2A). To induce genotoxic stress, cells were treated with CPT, which indirectly causes damage (e.g. DSBs) through the collision of DNA replication forks with trapped topoisomerase I-DNA complexes (33Pommier Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with CPT caused the appearance of a hyperphosphorylated wt-RPA2 species (lane 11), which was also significantly reactive to each of the phospho-specific antibodies (lanes 2, 5, and 8; marked H). Pretreatment of the lysates with λ-phosphatase caused the disappearance of the hyperphosphorylated RPA2 species (using a general RPA2 antibody) and a loss of reactivity by each of the phospho-specific antibodies. For the Ser(P)33 and Thr(P)21 antibodies, these data confirm previous reports showing high specificity of these antibodies (e.g. see Ref. 24Olson E. Nievera C.J. Klimovich V. Fanning E. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39517-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The Ser(P)4/Ser(P)8 antibody was previously demonstrated by our laboratory to lose reactivity of hyperphosphorylated RPA2 following phosphatase treatment (27Vassin V.M. Wold M.S. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1930-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To further verify the specificity of the novel Ser(P)29 antibody, we employed stable cell lines that allow inducible expression of an untagged version of wild type or mutant RPA2. Expression of this ectopic RPA2 is coupled with RNA interference-mediated knockdown of endogenous RPA2 by targeting a 3′-untranslated region sequence contained only in the endogenous RPA2 message. In this manner, the endogenous RPA2 is replaced with an ectopic version. Note that previous studies have found that the ectopic RPA2 is incorporated into heterotrimeric RPA, with the level of RPA2 apparently regulating the total cellular level of RPA (27Vassin V.M. Wold M.S. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1930-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34Dodson G.E. Shi Y. Tibbetts R.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2005; 25: 2463-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Using clonal U2-OS cells, the expression of either wt-RPA2 or a double S23A/S29A-RPA2 mutant was induced, and the endogenous RPA2 protein levels were then down-modulated by treatment with a specific siRNA molecule. Lysates were prepared from cells experiencing genotoxic stress or mitotic cells. Incubation of cells with CPT again caused the appearance of a hyperphosphorylated wt-RPA2 species that was also recognized by the anti-Ser(P)29 antibody (Fig. 2B, lane 1). The S23A/S29A mutation reduced the amount of hyperphosphorylated RPA2 and reactivity to the Ser(P)29 probe (lane 2). Examining mitotic RPA2, although the wild-type subunit generated a strong Ser(P)29 signal, the S23A/S29A mutation nearly completely caused the loss of the mitotic RPA2 species and the Ser(P)29 signal (lanes 3 and 4). We tested Ser29 modification across the cell cycle. U2-OS cells were arrested in mitosis with nocodazole, and aliquots of the arrested cells were then released into the cell cycle for 4 and 8 h (early and late G1 phases), 16 h (S phase), or 20 h (a mixture of S and G2 cells) (Fig. 2C). Lysates from these and mitotic cells (0 h) were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies directed to Ser(P)29-RPA2 or total RPA2. In mitotic cells, the RPA2 pool was present in three bands, a basal (nonphosphorylated) form and two slower migrating species. Of the three mitotic RPA species, the Ser(P)29 antibody recognized the slower migrating forms. When cells were released into the cell cycle, we did not observe any significant reactivity of RPA2 to the Ser(P)29 antibody in G1, S, or G2 cells. Along with verifying the usefulness of these antibodies, these data indicate that Ser29 is phosphorylated both during mitosis and in interphase only in response to genotoxic stress. Effect of Cyclin-Cdk Site Mutation on Formation of Mitotic and Hyperphosphorylated RPA2—Expression of an S23A/S29A-RPA2 mutant in vivo was previously found to prevent RPA2 phosphorylation (20Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) but did not reveal the relative importance of each site. We therefore examined the relative importance of the Ser23 and Ser29 sites in supporting mitotic RPA phosphorylation in vivo. To address these questions, we first tested Myc-tagged RPA2 molecules with one or both sites mutated to alanine (to prevent phosphorylation). A previous test of Myc-tagged RPA2 indicated that the subunit is efficiently incorporated into heterotrimeric RPA (27Vassin V.M. Wold M.S. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1930-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). U2-OS cells were transiently transfected with S23A-RPA2, S29A-RPA2, doubly mutated S23A/S29A-RPA2, or the control wt-RPA2. Following transfection, lysates were prepared from nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells and probed by Western analysis for the Myc tag (Fig. 2D). Similar to the endogenous RPA2 in mitotic cells (see Fig. 2C), the Myc-tagged wt-RPA2 had three bands corresponding to the basal RPA2 (marked B), mitotic RPA2 (+2p), and a form that migrated between these two species (+1p) (lane 1). The S23A and S29A single mutants resulted in a loss of the slowest migrating species (lanes 2 and 3), and the double S23A/S29A mutant gave rise to only a single band that migrated identically to nonphosphorylated RPA2 (lane 4). It is important to note that the migration of RPA2 in SDS-PAGE is governed by the RPA phosphorylation state (22Zernik-Kobak M."

Pyruvate/citrate cycling across the mitochondrial membrane leads to the production of malonyl-CoA and NADPH, two candidate coupling factors. To examine the implication of pyruvate/citrate cycling in glucose-induced insulin secretion (GIIS), different steps of the cycle were inhibited in INS 832/13 cells by pharmacological inhibitors and/or RNA interference (RNAi) technology: mitochondrial citrate export, ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), and cytosolic malic enzyme (ME1). The inhibitors of the di- and tri-carboxylate carriers, n-butylmalonate and 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate, respectively, reduced GIIS, indicating the importance of transmitochondrial transport of tri- and dicarboxylates in the action of glucose. To directly test the role of ACL and ME1 in GIIS, small hairpin RNA (shRNA) were used to selectively decrease ACL or ME1 expression in transfected INS 832/13 cells. shRNA-ACL reduced ACL protein levels by 67%, and this was accompanied by a reduction in GIIS. The amplification/KATP-independent pathway of GIIS was affected by RNAi knockdown of ACL. The ACL inhibitor radicicol also curtailed GIIS. shRNA-ME1 reduced ME1 activity by 62% and decreased GIIS. RNAi suppression of either ACL or ME1 did not affect glucose oxidation. However, because ACL is required for malonyl-CoA formation, inhibition of ACL expression by shRNA-ACL decreased glucose incorporation into palmitate and increased fatty acid oxidation in INS 832/13 cells.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is associated with the reoxidation of cytosolic NAD, possibly favoring fast glycolytic flux (23MacDonald M.J. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1229-1231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As part of this cycling process, citrate derived from anaplerotic input into the tricarboxylic acid cycle is exported from mitochondria to the cytosol, where it is cleaved by ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. Acetyl-CoA is then carboxylated to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, whereas oxaloacetate is reduced by malate dehydrogenase to malate. A cytosolic isoform of malic enzyme (ME1) converts malate into pyruvate, simultaneously yielding NADPH. Finally, pyruvate thus formed re-enters mitochondria to complete the pyruvate/citrate cycling process (see also Fig. 6). In a previous study (27Farfari S. Schulz V. Corkey B. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), we have shown that the dose dependence of GIIS correlated closely with the cellular concentrations of citrate, malate, and malonyl-CoA in INS 1 β-cells. Additional evidence supporting a role for pyruvate/citrate cycling in GIIS is as follows. The PC inhibitor phenylacetate curtailed fuel induced insulin secretion (23MacDonald M.J. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1229-1231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Lu et al. (25Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) have shown that pyruvate cycling activity correlates with the extent of GIIS. Furthermore, because very little glucose is metabolized through the pentose-phosphate pathway in the β-cells (20Schuit F. De Vos A. Farfari S. Moens K. Pipeleers D. Brun T. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18572-18579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), ME1 activity is thought to be the major source of NADPH in the β-cell, at least in human and rat islets, but perhaps not in mouse islets that might contain a very low level of the enzyme (30MacDonald M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E302-E310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Finally, recent studies have shown that inhibition of citrate export lowers GIIS (31Joseph J.W. Jensen M.V. Ilkayeva O. Palmieri F. Alarcon C. Rhodes C.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35624-35632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and that a decrease in ME1 expression alters glucose- and amino acid-induced insulin secretion (32Pongratz R.L. Kibbey R.G. Shulman G.I. Cline G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 200-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the present study, we continued our investigation of the role of pyruvate/citrate cycling in the regulation of GIIS using two complementary approaches in INS 832/13 cells. We sought to directly test the hypothesis that this particular pyruvate cycling process is important for GIIS. First, pharmacological inhibitors were used to block citrate export out of the mitochondria and to inhibit ACL. Second, shRNAs were designed to specifically decrease the expression levels of ACL and ME1. The results show that a reduction in mitochondrial citrate export, ACL inhibition, or a reduction in ACL and ME1 expression all lead to a decrease in GIIS. Altogether the data provide direct support for a role of pyruvate/citrate cycling in GIIS. Cell Culture—INS 832/13 cells (33Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) (passages 51–64) were grown in monolayer cultures in RPMI 1640 complete medium at 11.1 mmol/liter glucose supplemented with 10% (w/v) fetal bovine serum, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 1 mmol/liter sodium pyruvate and 50 μmol/liter β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air). For transfection experiments, the cells were seeded in 75-cm2 flasks at 4 × 106 cells 2 days prior to transfection and were at 60–70% confluency at the time of the transfection. For pharmaceutical inhibitor experiments, the cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. Short Hairpin RNA-mediated Gene Suppression—shRNAs directed against rat cytosolic NADP+-dependent malic enzyme (ME1; GenBank™ accession number NM_012600) or rat ACL (GenBank™ accession number NM_016987) were designed according to Ambion® (Austin, TX) siRNA design guidelines. Briefly, shRNA sequence included, from 5′ to 3′, BamHI restriction site (in bold type), the 19-nucleotide sense gene-targeting sequence (underlined), loop sequence (in italics), the 19-nucleotide antisense gene-targeting sequence (underlined), TTT TTT ending transcription sequence, and HindIII restriction site (in bold type). For each targeted-gene, four different shRNAs were designed and tested for their potency to decrease the targeted gene expression. The most efficient one was chosen for subsequent experiments and its sequence is listed here. The sense sequence for shRNA-ME1 (beginning at nucleotide 387 of ME1 sequence) is 5′-GAT CCG GGC ATA TTG CTT CAG TTC TTC AAG AGA GAA CTG AAG CAA TAT GCC CTT TTT TGG AAA-3′, and that for shRNA-ACL (begining at nucleotide 560 of ACL sequence) is 5′-GAT CCG ACA TTA AGA GAC ACC TGT TTC AAG AGA ACA GGT GTC TCT TAA TGT CTT TTT TGG AAA-3′. The sense sequences with no known target for appropriate scrambled control were 5′-GAT CCC AGT GCT GGT ACT TGT ACT TTC AAG AGA AGT ACA AGT ACC AGC ACT GTT TTT TGG AAA-3′ and 5′-GAT CCC TGA GAA TCT AAC GTA AGC TTC AAG AGA GCT TAC GTT AGA TTC TCA GTT TTT TGG AAA-3′ for Scr-ME1 and Scr-ACL, respectively. All of the oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by IDT (Coralville, IA). After annealing, the double-stranded oligonucleotides were ligated by self-formed restriction sites for BamHI and HindIII in pSilencer 2.0 vector (Ambion). shRNAs expression was under U6 promotor control. The pSilencer 2.0 empty vector (referred to as “mock” in the text) was also used as a control in most of the experiments. Cell Transfection—shRNA-pSilencer constructs were introduced into INS 832/13 cells using program T-27 and solution V of Amaxa Nucleofactor (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) at a concentration of 5 μg of DNA for 6 × 106 cells. After transfection, INS 832/13 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 0.3 × 106 cells (shRNA-ME1 or ScrME1) or at 0.6 × 106 cells (shRNA-ACL or ScrACL) for insulin secretion assays, protein content, and immunoblot analysis, in 60-mm tissue culture plates at 1.2 × 106 cells for malic enzyme activity, and in 25-cm2 flasks at 1.5 × 106 cells (shRNA-ME1 or ScrME1) or at 3.2 × 106 cells (shRNA-ACL or ScrACL) for glucose and fatty acid oxidation and glucose incorporation into fatty acids assays. Experiments for shRNA-ACL-transfected cells or appropriate controls were performed 48 h post-transfection, and experiments for shRNA-ME1 transfected cells or appropriate controls were performed 96 h post-transfection. Real Time Quantitative PCR Analysis—The cells were extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) from 12-well plates. RNA was reverse transcripted to cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and hexamers as described previously (34Roduit R. Morin J. Masse F. Segall L. Roche E.

Forward and reverse sequence primers (IDT) were designed specifically for ME1 or ACL and normalized to cyclophilin. Primer sequences were: ME1 forward, 5′-CCG CAT CTC AAC AAG GAC TTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCA TCA GTC ACC ACA ATA GCC-3′; ACL forward, 5′-TGC TTA GCC AGA GCT TGG TAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGA ATA GGC CGG AGA TGA AGC-3′; cyclophilin forward, 5′-CTT GCT GCA GAC ATG GTC AAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCC ATT ATG GCG TGT GAA GTC-3′. Real time quantitative PCR were performed on Rotor-Gene RG-3000 (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia) using LC Faststart DNA Masterplus SYBR Green reagent (Roche Applied Science). The results were analyzed using the Rotor-Gene software version 6.0.19 provided by Corbett Research. Cytosolic NADP+-dependent Malic Enzyme 1 Activity—Malic enzyme activity was assayed in fresh cytosolic cell extracts. Briefly, 96 h post-transfection, shRNA-ME1, ScrME1, or mock transfected cells were placed on ice, washed with cold PBS, extracted by scraping in ice-cold PBS/EGTA buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml of leupeptin and pepstatin, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5 μg/ml of aprotinin and referred to as protease inhibitor mix in the text). Cell suspension was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl in a ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 20 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 mol/liter sucrose, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, and protease inhibitor mix and homogenized using a 1-ml Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to discard nucleus and then at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to discard mitochondria. The post-mitochondrial supernatant content was concentrated using a Microcon® YM-30 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Final volume of the concentrate was adjusted to 100 μl with ice-cold homogenization buffer (see above), and 40 μl was used for malic enzyme assay. The assay system in 96-well plates contained 70 mmol/liter of triethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mmol/liter MnCl2, 0.3 mmol/liter NADP+, 3 mmol/liter of l-malate. The reactions were started adding cytosolic extracts immediately followed by shaking, and absorbance at 340 nm was read every 30 s for up to 10 min using Fluostar Optima (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany). For each set of experiments, background control was run without l-malate as substrate. Enzyme activity was determined by subtracting the activity of the background control to each sample. The resulting slopes of absorbance versus time were normalized to protein content using a BCA protein kit (Pierce). Immunoblot Analysis—shRNA-ACL, ScrACL, or mock transfected cells were collected at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h post-transfection. The cells were rinsed with cold PBS, trypsinized, and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed once with cold PBS, resuspended in 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl lysis buffer containing 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, supplemented with protease inhibitor mix, incubated on ice for 45 min, and centrifuged 10 000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing total cell extract was collected, and the protein content was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Aliquots of 20 μg of total cell extract were resolved on a 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Hahnestrabe, Dassel, Germany). The membranes were incubated with anti-ACL antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by secondary antibody treatment with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad). As a loading control, the membranes were incubated with anti-tubulin antibody (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA). Semi-quantitative analysis of immunoblot density was performed using the Genesnap software from the G-Box (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Insulin Secretion and Insulin Content Measurement—shRNA-transfected cells were preincubated during 2 h in RPMI complete medium at 1 mmol/liter glucose and then were equilibrated for 1 h in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 10 mmol/liter HEPES (KRBH, pH 7.4), 0.5% defatted BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 mmol/liter glucose. The cells were then incubated for 45 min in KRBH containing 0.5% BSA and 1, 5 or 10 mmol/liter glucose, in the presence or absence of 0.3 mmol/liter palmitate, or 35 mmol/liter KCl, and/or 20 μmol/liter diazoxide. Stock solution of diazoxide was prepared in Me2SO, and the final Me2SO concentration in KRBH was 0.5%. In experiments using inhibitors, INS 832/13 cells were incubated as described above in the presence or absence of 0.5 mmol/liter n-butylmalonate (BM) (Sigma) or 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate (BTC) (Sigma) or 50 μm radicicol (Sigma). Stock solution of radicicol was prepared in Me2SO, and the final Me2SO concentration in KRBH was 0.2%. At the end of incubation, the media were preserved for insulin determination. Total insulin content of the cells was measured after acid-ethanol (0.2 mmol/liter HCl in 75% ethanol) extraction. Insulin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay using a human insulin standard (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). The insulin levels were normalized to total insulin content and to protein content. Glucose and Fatty Acid Oxidation and Glucose Incorporation into Fatty Acids—Glucose oxidation to CO2, fatty acid (FA) oxidation to CO2 and acid-soluble products (essentially ketone bodies (35Fulgencio J.P. Kohl C. Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1556-1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and glucose incorporation into FA were measured in transfected cells preincubated as described for insulin secretion assay. For glucose oxidation experiments, the cells were incubated for 45 min in KRBH containing 0.5% BSA, 1 mmol/liter glucose, and 0.1 μCi/ml of [U-14C]glucose (Amersham Biosciences) or 10 mmol/liter glucose and 0.2 μCi/ml of [U-14C]glucose. At the beginning of the incubation, the 25-cm2 flasks were sealed with a stopper supporting a 3-cm length of PVC tubing (internal diameter, 4.7 mm) containing a piece of Whatman GF/B paper (half of a 25-mm-diameter circle) soaked in 5% KOH. At the end of incubation period, 0.2 ml of perchloric acid (40% v/v) was injected into each flask via a needle through the cap to acidify the medium and to liberate the CO2. After overnight isotopic equilibration at room temperature, the papers were removed, and the trapped 14CO2 was measured by liquid scintillation counting after overnight equilibration in scintillation fluid. For fatty acid oxidation experiments, the cells were incubated for 45 min in KRBH containing 0.5% BSA, 1, 5, or 10 mmol/liter glucose in the presence of 1 mmol/liter of carnitine plus 0.2 mmol/liter of palmitate, and 0.1 μCi/ml of [1-14C]palmitate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Oxidation to CO2 and acid-soluble products were performed as previously described (17Roduit R. Nolan C. Alarcon C. Moore P. Barbeau A. Delghingaro-Augusto V. Przybykowski E. Morin J. Masse F. Massie B. Ruderman N. Rhodes C. Poitout V. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1007-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For glucose incorporation into FA experiments, the cells were incubated for 2 h in KRBH containing 0.5% BSA, 1, 5, or 10 mmol/liter glucose, and 3 μCi/ml [U-14C]glucose (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 1 mmol/liter oleate. At the end of the incubation period, the media were removed, the cells were washed once with PBS, and 1 ml of PBS with 0.53 mmol/liter EDTA were added to the plated cells. The cells were collected with gentle pipetting, centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, dissolved in 3 ml of CHCL3:methanol:HCl (200: 100:1 v/v), and placed at –20 °C until the extraction. To perform the lipid extraction, 750 μl of H2O was added, and after vigorous vortexing, the phases were separated by centrifugation at 1 000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The organic lipid layer was extracted and evaporated under a steam of N2 to dryness. To separate [14C]FA and [14C]glycerol formed from [14C]glucose, esterification products were hydrolyzed for 1 h at 37° C in 100 μl of 0.1 mmol/liter of Tris buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5% of Triton X-100, 1% of acetonitrile, >30 units of both lipase and phospholipase C (Sigma) enzymes. At the end of incubation, 3 ml of chloroform:methanol:HCl (200:100:1 v/v/v) was added to the hydrolysis buffer. The lipids were re-extracted as described above and redissolved in 50 μl of chloroform and spotted onto a silica gel 60 TLC plate (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ). Extracted lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography using silica gel 60 plates in a solvent system containing petroleum ether:ethyl ether:acetic acid (70:30:1). Radioactive signal present on the TLC plate was transferred to a storage phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized after scanning of the screen on the Typhoon (Amersham Biosciences). Semi-quantitative analysis of [14C]FA (including FA from esterification products and very low level of NEFA) was performed, using [14C]palmitate standard as a reference, with ImageQuant TL software (Amersham Biosciences) and quantification of [14C]glucose incorporated into FA was performed using the [14C]glucose standard curve. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was calculated with two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant (*), whereas a p value of <0.01 was considered very significant (**). The statistical analyses were performed using the InStat program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

https://openalex.org/W2043713711,"Background EPC number and functionality are assumed to reflect the endogenous vascular repair capacity with the EPC pool declining in higher ages and being exhausted by unfavorable life-style and risk factors. This intriguing and clinically highly relevant concept, however, has so far been derived from small case-control studies and patient series. Methodology and Principle Findings In the population-based Bruneck Study EPC number and EPC-colony forming units (EPC-CFU) were assessed as part of the fourth follow-up evaluation (2005) in 571 and 542 subjects, respectively. EPC number declined with age (p = 0.013), was significantly lower in women (p = 0.006) and higher in subjects on statin, hormone replacement or ACE inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blockers, and correlated positively with moderate alcohol consumption. Unexpectedly, a positive relation between EPC number and several vascular risk factors emerged. In a step forward multivariate linear regression analysis EPC number was independently related with SDF1α, MMP-9, triglycerides, alcohol consumption, and Hba1c. EPC-CFU in turn was related to SDF1α and diastolic blood pressure. Moreover, EPC number showed a significant positive association with the Framingham risk score (P = 0.001). Finally, there was an inverse association between EPC number and common carotid artery intima-media thickness (p = 0.02) and the carotid artery atherosclerosis score (p = 0.059). Conclusions Our population-based data confirm the decline of EPC number with advancing age and lend first epidemiological support to a role of SDF-1α and MMP9 in EPC differentiation, mobilization and homing, but are conflict with the view that EPC number is unfavorably affected by cardiovascular risk factors. EPC number increases with the cardiovascular risk estimated by the Framingham risk score (FRS), which in the absence of similar changes for EPC-CFU. Finally, we demonstrate a significant inverse association between EPC number and extent of carotid atherosclerosis even though this association was only of moderate strength and not entirely consistent in other vascular territories."
https://openalex.org/W2105300608,"Background Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) which possess genes encoding Shiga toxin (stx), the major virulence factor, and adhesin intimin (eae). However, the frequency of stx-negative/eae-positive E. coli in stools of HUS patients and the clinical significance of such strains are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Between 1996 and 2006, we sought stx-negative/eae-positive E. coli in stools of HUS patients using colony blot hybridization with the eae probe and compared the isolates to EHEC causing HUS. stx-negative/eae-positive E. coli were isolated as the only pathogens from stools of 43 (5.5%) of 787 HUS patients; additional 440 (55.9%) patients excreted EHEC. The majority (90.7%) of the stx-negative/eae-positive isolates belonged to serotypes O26:H11/NM (nonmotile), O103:H2/NM, O145:H28/NM, and O157:H7/NM, which were also the most frequent serotypes identified among EHEC. The stx-negative isolates shared non-stx virulence and fitness genes with EHEC of the corresponding serotypes and clustered with them into the same clonal complexes in multilocus sequence typing, demonstrating their close relatedness to EHEC. Conclusions/Significance At the time of microbiological analysis, ∼5% of HUS patients shed no longer the causative EHEC, but do excrete stx-negative derivatives of EHEC that lost stx during infection. In such patients, the EHEC etiology of HUS is missed using current methods detecting solely stx or Shiga toxin; this can hamper epidemiological investigations and lead to inappropriate clinical management. While maintaining the paradigm that HUS is triggered by Shiga toxin, our data demonstrate the necessity of considering genetic changes of the pathogen during infection to adapt appropriately diagnostic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2092282650,"Modification of lipid A with the 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) moiety is required for resistance to polymyxin and cationic antimicrobial peptides in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. An operon of seven genes (designated pmrHFIJKLM in S. typhimurium), which is regulated by the PmrA transcription factor and is also present in E. coli, is necessary for the maintenance of polymyxin resistance. We previously elucidated the roles of pmrHFIJK in the biosynthesis and attachment of L-Ara4N to lipid A and renamed these genes arn-BCADT, respectively. We now propose functions for the last two genes of the operon, pmrL and pmrM. Chromosomal inactivation of each of these genes in an E. coli pmrA(c) parent switched its phenotype from polymyxin-resistant to polymyxin-sensitive. Lipid A was no longer modified with L-Ara4N, even though the levels of the lipid-linked donor of the L-Ara4N moiety, undecaprenyl phosphate-alpha-L-Ara4N, were not reduced in the mutants. However, the undecaprenyl phosphate-alpha-L-Ara4N present in the mutants was less concentrated on the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane, as judged by 4-5-fold reduced labeling with the inner membrane-impermeable amine reagent N-hydroxysulfosuccin-imidobiotin. In an arnT mutant of the same pmrA(c) parent, which lacks the enzyme that transfers the L-Ara4N unit to lipid A but retains the same high levels of undecaprenyl phosphate-alpha-L-Ara4N as the parent, N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin labeling was not reduced. These results implicate pmrL and pmrM, but not arnT, in transporting undecaprenyl phosphate-alpha-L-Ara4N across the inner membrane. PmrM and PmrL, now renamed ArnE and ArnF because of their involvement in L-Ara4N modification of lipid A, may be subunits of an undecaprenyl phosphate-alpha-L-Ara4N flippase."

TLR7 and TLR8 sense single-stranded RNA from viruses or host ribonucleoproteins and synthetic imidazoquinolines such as R848, whereas TLR9 senses unmethylated CpG motifs in viral and bacterial DNA and in host DNA. Here we report the endogenous interaction between Brutons's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and human TLR8 and TLR9 in the monocytic cell line THP1. We also show that R848, single-stranded RNA, and CpGB-DNA activate Btk in THP1 cells as shown by phosphorylation of the tyrosine 223 residue of Btk and also by increased autokinase activity. We demonstrate that Btk is required for NFκB activation, participating in the pathway to increased phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536 activated by TLR8 and TLR9. Finally we demonstrate that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA) that have dysfunctional Btk are impaired in the induction of interleukin-6 by CpGB-DNA. This study therefore establishes Btk as a key signaling molecule that interacts with and acts downstream of TLR8 and TLR9.

They activate signaling pathways that culminate in the induction of immune and inflammatory genes, including those encoding co-stimulatory molecules, antibodies, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. There are 10 TLRs in humans. The best characterized is TLR4, which recognizes the Gram-negative product lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The other antibacterial TLRs are TLR2, which in combination with TLR1 recognizes triacylated lipopeptides, or in combination with TLR6, recognizes diacylated lipopeptides, and TLR5, which recognizes bacterial flagellin. The antiviral TLRs are TLR3, which recognizes double-stranded RNA, TLR7 and TLR8, which recognize single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), and TLR9, which recognizes unmethylated CpG motifs that exist in both viral and bacterial DNA (1O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). All TLRs contain extracellular leucine-rich repeat domains and a cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain, which is crucial for signaling downstream of the TLR (2O'Neill L.A. Dinarello C.A. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 206-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Once activated, TLRs trigger a cascade of cellular signals, culminating in the eventual activation of the Rel family transcription factor NFκB (3Doyle S.L. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). NFκB binds to discrete nucleotide sequences in the upstream regions of genes that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6, thereby regulating their expression (4Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). Regulation of NFκB following stimulation with LPS occurs via activation of two pathways. The best characterized of these regulates the release of NFκB from its inhibitory protein IκBα, subsequently allowing NFκB to translocate to the nucleus and bind its target genes. However, this nuclear translocation of NFκB is not sufficient to activate NFκB-dependent gene transcription alone. The second pathway, which involves post-translational modifications, regulates the transactivating ability of the p65 subunit of NFκB once bound to its consensus sequence, i.e. the ability to recruit the transcriptional apparatus and stimulate target gene expression (5Schmitz M.L.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), a cytoplasmic non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is a member of the Tec family of protein kinases. It was first identified in the male immune disorder X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA). The XLA syndrome is manifested by severe defects in early B cell development, resulting in a nearly complete absence of peripheral B cells and immunoglobulins of all classes (6Bradley L.A. Sweatman A.K. Lovering R.C. Jones A.M. Morgan G. Levinsky R.J. Kinnon C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Various mutations in the human btk gene were identified as being responsible for the XLA phenotype (7Hashimoto S. Tsukada S. Matsushita M. Miyawaki T. Niida Y. Yachie A. Kobayashi S. Iwata T. Hayakawa H. Matsuoka H. Tsuge I. Yamadori T. Kunikata T. Arai S. Yoshizaki K. Taniguchi N. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1996; 88: 561-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These include mutations in both the kinase domain and the pleckstrin homology domain, which affect kinase activity and translocation to the membrane, respectively. The pleckstrin homology domain is important in the process of Btk activation since it localizes Btk to the membrane through its interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. In mice, a naturally occurring mutation in the pleckstrin homology domain has been mapped to arginine 28 (R28C), which causes X-linked immune deficiency (Xid) in these mice. Mutated Btk in Xid mice is prevented from associating with the membrane, thus inactivating it (8Park H. Wahl M.I. Afar D.E. Turck C.W. Rawlings D.J. Tam C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Immunity. 1996; 4: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We have previously described a key role for Btk in NFκB transactivation in response to LPS (9Doyle S.L. Jefferies C.A. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23496-23501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The ability of Btk to associate with the TIR domain of TLR4 was also demonstrated (10Jefferies C.A. Doyle S. Brunner C. Dunne A. Brint E. Wietek C. Walch E. Wirth T. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26258-26264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In addition, however, we found that Btk can interact with the TIR domains of TLR8 and TLR9. This suggested a possible role for Btk in TLR8 and TLR9 signaling, although this has never been examined directly. Btk-deficient mice have exhibited high susceptibility to acute mouse adenovirus type-1 (MAV-1) in contrast to controls, and XLA patients are highly susceptible to enteroviral infections, indicating a possible role for Btk in preventing virus-induced disease (11Moore M.L. McKissic E.L. Brown C.C. Wilkinson J.E. Spindler K.R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 5584-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Winkelstein J.A. Marino M.C. Lederman H.M. Jones S.M. Sullivan K. Burks A.W. Conley M.E. Cunningham-Rundles C. Ochs H.D. Medicine (Baltimore). 2006; 85: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). This could be due to a role for Btk in TLR8 or TLR9 signaling. Both TLR8 and TLR9 have been shown to be expressed in B cells, and their activation has been shown to induce antibody production and proliferation (13Chuang T.H. Ulevitch R.J. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2000; 11: 372-378PubMed Google Scholar, 14Schlaepfer E. Audige A. Joller H. Speck R.F. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 2888-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Dasari P. Nicholson I.C. Hodge G. Dandie G.W. Zola H. Cell. Immunol. 2005; 236: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Given these aspects and the apparent interaction between Btk and TLR8 and TLR9, we have examined a role for Btk in TLR8 and TLR9 signaling. We provide the first evidence for an interaction between Btk and these TLRs endogenously and for potent activation of Btk by TLR8 and TLR9, and we demonstrate that Btk is required for transactivation by p65. We also demonstrate impaired induction of IL-6 by TLR9 in PBMCs prepared from XLA patients. Our data therefore identify for the first time a key role for Btk in TLR8 and TLR9 signaling. Cell Culture—The HEK293 cell line and THP1 cell line were obtained from European Cell Culture Collection and were maintained as described previously (16Jefferies C.A. O'Neill L.A. Immunol. Lett. 2004; 92: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Female and Male CBA/CaHN-Btk<xid>J mice were gifts from Stephanie Vogel. We used female CBA/CaHN-Btk<xid>J that do not exhibit the disease and male CBA/CaHN-Btk<xid>J that are affected by the mutation. BMDMs were prepared from CBA/CaHN-Btk<xid>J mice and maintained as described previously (9Doyle S.L. Jefferies C.A. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23496-23501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Two male patients diagnosed with XLA, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, and two healthy age- and sex-matched controls, were included in this study after informed consent was obtained. This study was approved by the St. James's Hospital/Adelaide and Meath Hospital research ethics committee. Both patients were receiving regular intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy at 4-week intervals and were free of any serious infections at the time of blood sampling. Heparinized blood samples were collected prior to the infusion of intravenous immunoglobulins. PBMCs were generated as described previously (17Horwood N.J. Page T.H. McDaid J.P. Palmer C.D. Campbell J. Mahon T. Brennan F.M. Webster D. Foxwell B.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Plasmids and Reagents—The following plasmids were used: pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), the NFκB-reporter construct (Dr. R. Hofmeister, Universitat Regensburg, Germany); BtkK430R, BtkR28C, and wild type Btk (Dr. Cornelia Escher, Universität Ulm, Germany); phRL-TK (Promega); CD4-TLR8 and CD4-TLR9 (Adrian Ozinsky, University of Washington, Seattle, WA); the Gal4-p65(1–551) plasmid encoding full-length p65 subunit of NFκB fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Lienhard Schmitz, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidleberg, Germany); and the Gal-luciferase reporter gene (Stratagene). The following antibodies were used: anti-Btk (C-20) and anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); phospho-NFκB-p65 (Ser-536) and phospho-Btk (Tyr-223) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.); anti-calnexin (Stressgen Bioreagents, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada); anti-TLR8 and anti-TLR9 (Imgenex, San Diego, CA); and anti-goat IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-rabbit IgG Alexa fluor 647 (Invitrogen, Dun Laoghaire, Ireland). The following reagents were used: CpG-ODNs (Coley Pharmaceuticals, Langenfeld, Germany); ssRNA42 (IBA GmbH, Gottingen, Germany); R848 (Invivogen, San Diego, CA); the Btk-specific inhibitor, LFM-A13 (Calbiochem, Nottingham, United Kingdom); and the IL-6 ELISA duoset (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma with the exception of the following: GeneJuice® (Novagen), coelentrazine (Argus Fine Chemicals), and passive lysis buffer (Promega). Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected as described previously for both the NFκB-luciferase and the p65-luciferase assays (Doyle). For the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)-luciferase assay, HEK293 cells were seeded (1 × 105 ml-1) onto 96-well plates 24 h prior to transfection, and 80 ng of ISRE-luciferase, 40 ng of Renilla luciferase, and the indicated amount of Btk-expressing plasmid and/or CD4-TLR8/9 expressing plasmid (220 ng total) were transfected using GeneJuice according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence readings were assayed as described previously (9Doyle S.L. Jefferies C.A. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23496-23501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—THP1 cells were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh RPMI to give a total of 1 × 107 cells/ml. BMDMs were seeded at 2 × 106/3 ml in 6-well plates. After appropriate stimulation, cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS containing 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml sodium orthovanadate). Protein estimations of cell extracts were determined by the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein were resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were transferred to Immobilon™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After incubation with primary antibodies as indicated, blots were incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was carried out using Multigauge software, and pixel intensity (absorbance unit/mm2) was normalized to the corresponding total protein and expressed as -fold increase in intensity over the control unstimulated lane. Immunoprecipitation—THP1 cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml 18 h prior to stimulation. A total of 2 × 107 cells was used per point, and cells were stimulated with either CpGB (3 μg/ml) or R848 (1 μg/ml) for the time points indicated and lysed in 800 μl of high stringency lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v) containing 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml sodium orthovanadate) or 800 μl of CHAPS buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 0.5% CHAPS (w/v), containing 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml sodium orthovanadate) for 30 min on ice. Immune complexes were immunoprecipitated by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation with the appropriate antibody, which had been precoupled to protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight or with phospho-tyrosine beads. A portion of the lysate was retained to confirm that the protein of interest was expressed; this was added to the sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Following the 2-h incubation, the immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer. All supernatant was removed, and beads were resuspended in 30 μl of 5× sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. Btk Activation Assay—THP1 cells were prepared for autokinase assay as described previously (10Jefferies C.A. Doyle S. Brunner C. Dunne A. Brint E. Wietek C. Walch E. Wirth T. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26258-26264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). IL-6 ELISA—Human PBMCs were cultured at 2 × 106 cell/ml and stimulated with CpGB or R848 of varying concentrations and time points, as indicated. Supernatants were then harvested, and the concentration of IL-6 was determined by ELISA (R&D Systems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured on a spectrophotometric ELISA plate reader. Association of Endogenous Btk with TLR8 and TLR9—In a previous study, we found that a yeast two-hybrid screen carried out to search for possible interaction partners for Btk isolated a cDNA encoding human TLR8 (10Jefferies C.A. Doyle S. Brunner C. Dunne A. Brint E. Wietek C. Walch E. Wirth T. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26258-26264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It was found that Btk could also interact with the TIR domains of TLR4, TLR6, and TLR9. However, the strongest interaction was found with the TIR domain of TLR8 (10Jefferies C.A. Doyle S. Brunner C. Dunne A. Brint E. Wietek C. Walch E. Wirth T. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26258-26264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To confirm this interaction, we first carried out co-immunoprecipitation analysis. We chose THP1 monocytic cells as a model system since this cell line expressed both TLR8 (Fig. 1A) and TLR9 (Fig. 1B) and was responsive to the TLR8 ligand R848 (Fig. 1C) and the TLR9 ligand CpGB-DNA (Fig. 1D), as shown by IκBα degradation. Endogenous TLR8 or TLR9 was immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared from THP1 cells stimulated with either R848 or CpGB at various time points (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively, top panels). Immunopurified TLR from each time point was immunoblotted with a Btk-specific antibody. An interaction between Btk and TLR8 was detected both basally and after R848 treatment. However, we consistently found that the interaction appeared to be stronger at 15 and 30 min after R848 stimulation in comparison with basal levels of association (Fig. 2A, top panel). Similarly, an interaction between Btk and TLR9 was detected in unstimulated cells and cells treated with CpGB (Fig. 2B, top panel). Similar to the association between TLR8 and Btk, the interaction appeared to grow stronger upon CpG stimulation with an apparent increased interaction after 5 and 15 min of CpGB stimulation, decreasing again at 30 min of stimulation (Fig. 2B, top panel). In both cases, samples were blotted for Btk to ensure equal loading (Fig. 2, A and B, second panels). The specificity of these interactions was tested in THP1 lysates by comparing the ability of the relevant isotype-matched antibody, mouse IgG, with co-immunoprecipitate Btk to that of the TLR antibodies. No bands were detected at the same region in the IgG control lanes (Fig. 2, A and B, third panels). These samples were also blotted for Btk to ensure equal loading (Fig. 2, A and B, bottom panels).FIGURE 2Endogenous Btk and TLRs 8/9 interact in untreated and ligand treated THP1 cells. A and B, THP1 cells were treated with R848 (A) or CpGB (B) for the time points indicated. Cells were lysed in CHAPs buffer, and TLR8 (A, top panel), TLR9 (B, top panel), or mouse IgG (A and B, third panels) was isolated by immunoprecipitation (IP). Immune complexes were immunoblotted (WB) with Btk antibody to detect an interaction (top panels), and whole cell lysates were also immunoblotted for total Btk (A and B, second and fourth panels). Results are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stimulation of TLR8 and TLR9 Cause Btk Activation—We next examined the ability of R848 and CpGB to induce tyrosine phosphorylation on Btk, which is an indicator of Btk activation. Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared from THP1 cells treated with CpGB over various time points. Immunopurified tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from each time point was immunoblotted for Btk. Phosphorylated Btk was detected after 15 min of stimulation with CpGB (Fig. 3A, upper panel). Samples were also immunoblotted for total Btk to ensure equal loading (Fig. 3A, lower panel). An early substrate for Btk is Btk itself, which becomes phosphorylated on Tyr-223 (18Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); therefore the ability of immunopurified Btk to autophosphorylate in vitro, which is an indication of its autokinase activity, was next examined using an in vitro kinase assay. Treatment of THP1 cells with CpGB induced a rapid transient increase in phosphorylated Btk (Fig. 3C, upper panel). This was detected from 15 min. Samples were also blotted for total Btk to ensure equal loading (Fig. 3C, lower panel). The same assays were carried out on THP1 cells treated with R848, with similar results. Tyrosine phosphorylated proteins immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared from THP1 cells treated with R848 over various time points and immunoblotted for Btk detected phosphorylated Btk after 15 min of stimulation (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Samples were also blotted for total Btk to ensure equal loading (Fig. 3B, lower panel). Treatment of THP1 cells with R848 induced a rapid transient increase in the autophosphorylation activity of Btk, which was most evident at 30 min of stimulation (Fig. 3D, upper panel). Samples were also blotted for total Btk to ensure equal loading (Fig. 3D, lower panel). The autophosphorylation site on Btk has been identified as Tyr-223 (8Park H. Wahl M.I. Afar D.E. Turck C.W. Rawlings D.J. Tam C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Immunity. 1996; 4: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We therefore next examined the effect of CpG and R848 on this response using a phospho-tyrosine-specific antibody raised against phosphorylated Tyr-223 on Btk. Tyr-223 phosphorylation of Btk was weakly detectable after 5 min of stimulation with CpGB, with maximum phosphorylation detected at 15, 30, and 60 min (Fig. 3E, first upper panel). R848 also increased Tyr-223 phosphorylation on Btk, the effect being evident after 5 min of stimulation with R848, with maximum phosphorylation detected at 30 min and a decrease in phosphorylation from 60 min (Fig. 3E, second upper panel). We also tested the TLR7 ligand ssRNA42 for its ability to effect Btk phosphorylation on Tyr-223. A response was detected after 15 min of stimulation with maximum phosphorylation detected at 30 min and a decrease in phosphorylation from 60 min (Fig. 3E, third upper panel). In all cases, samples were also blotted for total Btk to ensure equal loading (Fig. 3E, first, second, and third lower panels, respectively). In some experiments, as shown in Fig. 3E, third and fifth panels, lane 1, basal levels were higher, but increases were still evident. Btk Is Involved on the Signaling Pathway from TLR8 and TLR9 to NFκB—The ability of both R848 and CpGB to activate Btk implied that Btk might be an important signaling modulator downstream of TLR8 and TLR9. We have previously shown that Btk is activated downstream of TLR4 and plays a role in the phosphorylation of the NFκB p65 subunit on Ser-536, which is essential for the efficient transactivation of NFκB in response to LPS (9Doyle S.L. Jefferies C.A. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23496-23501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether Btk played a role in TLR8 and TLR9 signaling to NFκB. To test this, we examined the effect of two mutant forms of Btk, Btk R28C, which is unable to localize to the membrane, and Btk K430R, a kinase-inactive form of Btk, on the induction of an NFκB-dependent reporter gene (NFκB-luciferase) by TLR8 and TLR9. The chimeric versions of TLR8 and TLR9, CD4-TLR8, and CD4-TLR9, respectively, comprising the murine extracellular CD4 domain fused to the cytoplasmic domains of the TLRs, are constitutively active. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, overexpression of CD4-TLR8 in HEK293 cells led to the induction of the NFκB reporter gene construct. This activation was dramatically inhibited by the two mutant forms of Btk, Btk R28C and Btk K430R. However, whereas overexpression of CD4-TLR8 in HEK293 cells also led to the induction of the ISRE-reporter gene construct, this activation was unaffected by overexpression of either Btk K430R or Btk R28C (Fig. 4C). Similarly, overexpression of CD4-TLR9 in HEK293 cells led to the induction of the NFκB reporter gene construct. This activation was also inhibited by the two mutant forms of Btk (Fig. 4B). However, as in the case of TLR8, whereas overexpression of CD4-TLR9 in HEK293 cells also led to the induction of the ISRE-reporter gene construct, this activation was unaffected by overexpression of either Btk K430R or Btk R28C (Fig. 4D). The lack of effect on the ISRE construct indicates an important specificity in the role of Btk in TLR8 and TLR9 signaling. We next examined the effect of Btk R28C and Btk K430R on the Gal4-p65(1–551) trans-reporting system using HEK293 cells to test for a role for Btk downstream of TLR8 and TLR9 in the p65 transactivation pathway. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding CD4-TLR8 displayed activation of the Gal4-p65(1–551) trans-reporting system (Fig. 4E). This ability of CD4-TLR8 to activate Gal4-p65(1–551) was abolished when cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding either Btk R28C or Btk K430R. Similarly, when CD4-TLR9 was transfected into HEK293 cells, the Gal4-p65(1–551) trans-reporting system was induced. This ability of CD4-TLR9 to activate Gal4-p65(1–551) was diminished when cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding either Btk R28C or Btk K430R (Fig. 4F). As we had previously shown that Btk is involved in the phosphorylation of p65 on Ser-536 in response to LPS, we next investigated whether Btk played a similar role in response to CpGB or R848. The phosphorylation of serine 536 in response to CpGB was tested in BMDMs from female and male Xid mice. Xid mice express a mutant form of Btk, Btk(R28C). In this case, the female BMDMs act as the control due to Xid being an X-linked disease with only one X chromosome being defective. CpGB increased p65 phosphorylation at 30 min (Fig. 4G, top panel). This response was significantly impaired in BMDMs from male Xid mice (Fig. 4G, bottom panel). When Xid BMDMs were stimulated with R848, there was also increased p65 phosphorylation, which occurred from 5 min, decreasing by 30 min (Fig. 4H, top panel). This response was also impaired in BMDMs from male Xid mice (Fig. 4H, bottom panel). XLA-PBMCs Have Impaired Capacity to Produce IL-6 in Response to TLR8 and TLR9 Stimulation—Finally we examined the induction of IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine known to be under the transcriptional regulation of NFκB, in PBMCs from XLA patients. Stimulation with CpGB failed to induce any IL-6 production by XLA-PBMCs after both 18 and 24 h treatments when compared with control PBMCs (Fig. 5A). We also examined control PBMCs pretreated with a Btk inhibitor LFM-A13 before CpGB stimulation. IL-6 production induced by CpGB was impaired in cells treated with LFM-A13 when compared with cells not treated with the inhibitor (Fig. 5B). We were unable to examine R848 in XLA PBMCs since no response was detected in normal PBMCs, which is likely to be due to low level expression of TLR8. Taken together, our data therefore indicate an important role for Btk in signaling by TLR8 and TLR9. In this study, we demonstrate that endogenous TLR8 and TLR9 interact with Btk by co-immunoprecipitation and that ligation of TLR8 or TLR9 results in the activation of Btk in a time-dependent manner. TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 belong to a subfamily of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs. Activation of TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 in response to their respective ligands depends on acidification and maturation of endosomes and targets MyD88 to vesicular structures with lysosomal characteristics (19Heil F. Ahmad-Nejad P. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Gellert T. Dietrich H. Lipford G. Takeda K. Akira S. Wagner H. Bauer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 2987-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Therefore TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 form a functional subgroup within the TLR family that recognizes nucleic acids in the acidic environment of an endosome/lysosome. Specifically, unmethylated bacterial and viral CpG-DNA is recognized by TLR9, and the natural ligands for TLR7 and TLR8 are guanosine- and uridine-rich ssRNA (20Heil F. Hemmi H. Hochrein H.

We have demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that Btk interacts with TLR8 and TLR9 endogenously and that ligation increased the association. Given that we have also shown that Btk can interact with MyD88 (10Jefferies C.A. Doyle S. Brunner C. Dunne A. Brint E. Wietek C. Walch E. Wirth T. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol.

Our present data clearly demonstrate that Btk is also tyrosine phosphorylated and subsequently activated in response to both R848 and CpG-DNA treatment in the human monocytic THP1 cell line. Our data identify Btk as an important tyrosine kinase activated by TLR8 and TLR9. Given that TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 activate both Btk and NFκB and having previously shown a role for Btk in LPS-induced NFκB activation (9Doyle S.L. Jefferies C.A. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23496-23501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Btk played a similar role in TLR7-, TLR8-, and TLR9-induced NFκB activation. Activation of an NFκB-linked reporter gene by TLR8 and TLR9 was inhibited by dominant negative forms of Btk. Interestingly the dominant negative forms of Btk had no effect on ISRE activation by TLR8 or TLR9, indicating that Btk acts selectively upstream of NFκB activation. It is now generally accepted that phosphorylation of the p65 subunit controls the nuclear transcriptional potential of NFκB and is required for efficient transcriptional activation. This phosphorylation of p65 is known to be required for transactivation of gene expression because mutating serine residues in the transactivation domains of p65 greatly impairs NFκB-dependent gene transcription (reviewed in Ref. 5Schmitz M.L. Bacher S. Kracht M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 186-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As we had previously placed Btk downstream of TLR4 in the transactivation of the p65 subunit of NFκB, we next examined whether Btk was similarly involved in TLR8- and TLR9-mediated p65 transactivation. TLR8 and TLR9 activated a p65 transactivation assay, and dominant negative forms of Btk diminished this response. Furthermore, we show here for the first time that CpGB and R848 induced phosphorylation of p65 on Ser-536 and that BMDMs defective in Btk were attenuated in this response. Although the roles of individual phospho-serines have not been fully determined, phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NFκB has emerged as a mechanism by which transcriptional activity of NFκB complexes is regulated in an IκB-independent manner. However, it is suggested that phospho-Ser-536 may contribute to promoter-specific assembly of the basal transcriptional machinery and/or coactivators. Indeed, the role of Ser-536 phosphorylation in coupling p65 to coactivators, corepressors, or components of the basal transcriptional machinery has been reported (25Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 26Buss H. Dorrie A. Schmitz M.L. Hoffmann E. Resch K. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55633-55643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Considering that Btk appears to play a role downstream of TLR8 and TLR9 in the transactivating potential of NFκB, it seemed likely that a lack of Btk might impact on the induction of NFκB-dependent genes in response to R848 or CpG-DNA. We found a clear impairment in IL-6 induction in response to CpGB in PBMCs from XLA patients relative to control PBMCs. The Btk inhibitor LFM-A13 also blocked induction of IL-6 by CpG in PBMCs. We were therefore able to confirm a key role for Btk in TLR9 signaling in human PBMCs. We found that PBMCs did not respond adequately to R848, and so we were unable to examine TLR8 in a similar fashion. However, impaired ssRNA-mediated IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α production has been reported in PBMC-derived dendritic cells from patients with XLA (27Sochorova K. Horvath R. Rozkova D. Litzman J. Bartunkova J. Sediva A. Spisek R. Blood. 2007; 109: 2553-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). From our data, it now seems likely that this impairment is due to attenuated TLR8 signaling in cells with defective Btk. These findings are important in relation to XLA patients because although regular intravenous immunoglobulin treatment leads to satisfactory levels of circulating antibodies, XLA patients frequently present with chronic and potentially severe and commonly fatal enteroviral infections, caused by ssRNA viruses. In fact, enteroviral infections are the most common cause of mortality in XLA patients (12Winkelstein J.A. Marino M.C. Lederman H.M. Jones S.M. Sullivan K. Burks A.W. Conley M.E.

Dis. 1987; 9: 334-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Additionally, patients with XLA are known to be susceptible to herpes viruses such as HHV-6, varicella-zoster, herpes simplex, and cytomegalovirus (29Stiehm E.R. Pediatrics. 2006; 117: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Herpes viruses have been shown to contain unmethylated CpG motifs (30Zheng M. Klinman D.M. Gierynska M. Rouse B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8944-8949Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and according to one study carried out on 96 XLA patients, herpes simplex virus infections represented 37% of all viral infections (31Lederman H.M. Winkelstein J.A. Medicine (Baltimore). 1985; 64: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 32Sanna P.P. Burton D.R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An impairment in TLR9 signaling due to the defect in Btk may help explain this susceptibility. Our data are also interesting in relation to certain systemic inflammatory diseases such as the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus. Aberrant B cell receptor signaling combined with inappropriate or overly active stimulation of TLR7/8 or TLR9 with host nucleic acids in immune complexes have been hypothesized to contribute dramatically toward the onset and severity of systemic lupus erythematosus (33Subramanian S. Tus K. Li Q.Z. Wang A. Tian X.H. Zhou J. Liang C. Bartov G. McDaniel L.D. Zhou X.J. Schultz R.A. Wakeland E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Given the role of Btk in signaling by TLR8 and TLR9 pharmacologically targeting Btk might be useful in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.

https://openalex.org/W1968122621,"ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification regulating protein function in which amino acid-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) transfer ADP-ribose from NAD onto specific target proteins. Attachment of the bulky ADP-ribose usually inactivates the target by sterically blocking its interaction with other proteins. P2X7, an ATP-gated ion channel with important roles in inflammation and cell death, in contrast, is activated by ADP-ribosylation. Here, we report the structural basis for this gating and present the first molecular model for the activation of a target protein by ADP-ribosylation. We demonstrate that the ecto-enzyme ART2.2 ADP-ribosylates P2X7 at arginine 125 in a prominent, cysteine-rich region at the interface of 2 receptor subunits. ADP-ribose shares an adenine-ribonucleotide moiety with ATP. Our results indicate that ADP-ribosylation of R125 positions this common chemical framework to fit into the nucleotide-binding site of P2X7 and thereby gates the channel."

ERK5 has a large C-terminal-half that contains a transcriptional activation domain. However, it has remained unclear how its transcriptional activation activity is regulated. Here, we show that the activated kinase activity of ERK5 is required for the C-terminal-half to enhance the AP-1 activity, and that the activated ERK5 undergoes autophosphorylation on its most C-terminal region. Changing these phosphorylatable threonine and serine residues to unphosphorylatable alanines significantly reduces the transcriptional activation activity of ERK5. Moreover, phosphomimetic mutants of the C-terminal-half of ERK5 without an N-terminal kinase domain are shown to be able to enhance the AP-1 activity in fibroblastic cells.

Moreover, knockdown studies in Xenopus have shown that ERK5 and MEK5 play an essential role in neural differentiation (28Nishimoto S. Kusakabe M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ERK5 has a large, unique C-terminal-half not found in other MAPK family members (19Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

The C-terminal-half of ERK5 has two proline-rich domains and a bipartite NLS, and shares no high homology with other proteins (19Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

It was subsequently shown that the ERK5 C-terminal-half is essential for transactivation of MEF2C (30Yan C. Luo H. Lee J.D. Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

Moreover, a recent study has shown that ERK5 has two transactivation domains in its C-terminal region (33Akaike M. Che W. Marmarosh N.L. Ohta S. Osawa M. Ding B. Berk B.C. Yan C. Abe J. Mol. Cell.

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the transcriptional activation activity of the ERK5 C-terminal region have remained elucidated. Here we show that the activated kinase activity of ERK5 is required for the C-terminal-half to enhance the transactivation activity of AP-1, and that the activated ERK5 undergoes autophosphorylation on its C-terminal-half. Furthermore, our results show that phosphorylation of the C-terminal-half of ERK5 is necessary for the enhancement of the transactivation activity of AP-1. These results reveal the importance of the ERK5 autophosphorylation in ERK5 signaling, and thus identify a novel role for the C-terminal-half of ERK5 in MAPK signal transduction mechanisms.

Several ERK5 fragments were generated by PCR. These cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3 Myc1. pAP-1-Luc was purchased from Stratagene. The MEF2 luciferase plasmids were constructed as follows. The MEF2 response sequence (34Woronicz J.D. Lina A. Calnan B.J. Szychowski S. Cheng L. Winoto A. Mol. Cell.

Antibodies—Antibodies were purchased as follows: rabbit anti-phospho-ERK5 antibody from Cell Signaling; mouse anti-Myc (9E10) and mouse anti-HA (F-7) antibodies from Santa Cruz; mouse anti-FLAG (M2) and rabbit anti-ERK5 antibodies from Sigma. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunoblotting—COS7 cells and NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% calf serum, respectively. These cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were split onto 12-well or 60-mm dishes at 1 × 105 or 4 × 105 cells per dish, respectively. The COS7 cells and NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 17 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm vanadate, 1% Triton-100). The supernatant of the cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody or anti-FLAG antibody. Luciferase Assay—Cells split onto 12-well dishes were harvested for assay 24 h after transfection. The luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured by the luciferase assay system (Promega). To determine transfection efficiency, co-expressed β-galactosidase activity was measured, and the data were normalized for β-galactosidase activities. The data represent means and standard deviations of at least two independent experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer A. Tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by incubation with anti-Myc antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed twice with TBS (20 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5)) and then incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with myelin basic protein (final concentration, 2 mg/ml) or purified FLAG-ERK5N protein in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Purification of Activated ERK5N Protein—FLAG-tagged ERK5N and MEK5D were transfected in COS7 cells. After 24 h, the cells were harvested with lysis buffer B (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 17 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm vanadate, 1% Triton-100). The supernatants of the cell lysates were incubated with the ANTI-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. Then the resin was washed twice with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)). The resin was incubated with five volumes of a solution containing 100 mg/ml FLAG peptide in elution buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)) for 30 min at 4 °C. The bound FLAG fusion protein was eluted by competitive elution. Phosphatase Treatment—Cells were lysed in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Briij 35, 2 mm MnCl2) and incubated with 40 units of purified λ-protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 45 min at 30 °C. Then samples were treated with Laemmili's sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by immunoblotting. Both the N-terminal- and the C-terminal-halves of ERK5 Are Required for the Activation of AP-1 Activity—To investigate a role of the unique C-terminal-half of ERK5 in its signaling mechanism, we made two deletion constructs of ERK5: ERK5N (residues 1–407) and ERK5C (residues 401–806) (Fig. 1A). ERK5N has a kinase catalytic domain and a Thr-Glu-Tyr (TEY) activation motif, whereas ERK5C has an NLS. We previously reported that activation of the ERK5 pathway is able to activate the transactivation activity of AP-1 and that the N-terminal-half of ERK5 alone is not enough for maximal activation of the transactivation activity of AP-1 (22Terasawa K.

Thus we examined whether the C-terminal-half of ERK5 is required for maximal activation of AP-1 activity. We expressed full-length ERK5 or ERK5N or ERK5C with or without MEK5D, a constitutively active form of MEK5 (17Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), in NIH 3T3 cells, and performed a reporter assay measuring the transcriptional activity of AP-1. Expression of ERK5 or MEK5D alone had negligible effects, but co-expression of ERK5 and MEK5D enhanced the AP-1 activity by 21-fold over the control (Fig. 1B). Co-expression of ERK5N and MEK5D enhanced it by 6-fold over the control, and co-expression of ERK5C and MEK5D by 2-fold (Fig. 1B). However, co-expression of ERK5N and ERK5C with MEK5D increased the AP-1 activity by 20-fold, the extent being nearly the same as that in the case of co-expression of full-length ERK5 and MEK5D (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that both the N-terminal- and C-terminal-halves of ERK5 are required for maximal activation of AP-1 activity and that co-expression of ERK5N and ERK5C is able to mimic full-length ERK5 expression in this transcriptional activation. It has been shown that the kinase activity of ERK5 is necessary for the activation of AP-1 activity induced by full-length ERK5 (22Terasawa K. Okazaki K. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We then examined whether the kinase activity of ERK5N was required for the enhancement of AP-1 activity by co-expression of ERK5N and ERK5C. We made two mutants of ERK5N, ERK5N AEF, and ERK5N KM. ERK5N AEF is an unphosphorylatable mutant, in which threonine and tyrosine residues at the activating phosphorylation sites (TEY) are replaced by alanine and phenylalanine, respectively. ERK5 KM is a kinase-deficient mutant, in which Lys84 is replaced by methionine. The reporter assay showed that ERK5N AEF or ERK5N KM did not stimulate the AP-1 activity when co-expressed with ERK5C and MEK5D (Fig. 1C). These results indicate clearly that the kinase activity of ERK5N is required for the enhancement of AP-1 activity. The N-terminal-half of ERK5 Phosphorylates the C-terminal-half of ERK5—We found that several mobility-shifted bands (slowly migrating bands) of ERK5C in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis appeared when co-expressed with ERK5N and MEK5D (Fig. 2A). All the shifted bands disappeared when incubated with λ-protein phosphatase in vitro (Fig. 2B), indicating that the shifted bands of ERK5C are caused by phosphorylation of ERK5C. It is likely that there are multiple phosphorylation states in ERK5C. It has previously been shown that ERK5 is able to undergo autophosphorylation on its own C-terminal domain at several sites (35Mody N. Campbell D.G. Morrice N. Peggie M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 567-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Buschbeck M. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2659-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that activated ERK5N phosphorylates ERK5C in our assay system. In fact, the shifted bands of ERK5C did not appear when co-expressed with ERK5N AEF or ERK5N KM in the presence of MEK5D or co-expressed with ERK5N WT in the absence of MEK5D (Fig. 2A). Then, we examined the substrate specificity of ERK5N against ERK5C in comparison with that of ERK5N against c-Fos. Under conditions of low amounts of ERK5N and MEK5D (15–0.5 ng), ERK5C, but not c-Fos, was phosphorylated by ERK5N (Fig. 2C). This result suggests that ERK5N phosphorylates ERK5C more efficiently than c-Fos. These results together with the results shown in Fig. 1 suggest the possibility that activated ERK5N-mediated phosphorylation of ERK5C is required for the maximal activity of ERK5C to enhance AP-1 activity. Phosphorylatable Sites in the C-terminal-half of ERK5—To elucidate a role of phosphorylation of the C-terminal-half of ERK5, we investigated the phosphorylation sites in ERK5C, which are responsible for the mobility shifts. There are five putative MAPK phosphorylation sites (S/TP sites) in the C-terminal region; Ser421, Ser433, Ser697, Thr723, and Ser793. Moreover, activated human recombinant ERK5 is shown to undergo autophosphorylation on several residues in its C-terminal region in vitro (35Mody N. Campbell D.G. Morrice N. Peggie M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 567-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), among which there are two non-proline-directed serines; Ser496 and Ser721. Then we generated seven mutant forms of ERK5C, in which each of the seven putative phosphorylation sites was replaced by alanine, and expressed them with ERK5N and MEK5D (Fig. 3A). Only in the Thr723 mutant ERK5C, the most slowly migrating band disappeared although other mobility-shifted bands remained (Fig. 3A), suggesting that Thr723 is one of several phosphorylation sites in ERK5C. To identify other sites, we generated three additional deletion constructs of ERK5C, ERK5C ΔC (residues 401–740), ERK5C ΔN (residues 514–806), and ERK5CΔNΔC (residues 514–740) (Fig. 3B, left). ERK5CΔN alone exhibited large mobility shift when co-expressed with ERK5N and MEK5D (Fig. 3B, right), suggesting that there may be one or several cooperative phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region, residues 740–806. In this region, there are five serine residues that are not proline-directed but are conserved among Xenopus, mouse and human ERK5 (Fig. 3C, upper). Therefore, we made several mutant forms of ERK5C in which, in addition to Thr723, one or several of these conserved serine residues were replaced by alanines. As shown in Fig. 3C, when consecutive three serines (Ser760, Ser764, and Ser766) and Thr723 were mutated, the mobility shift did not take place, suggesting that Thr723, Ser760, Ser764, and Ser766 are the sites responsible for the ERK5C mobility shifts induced by ERK5N-mediated phosphorylation. Next, we performed in vitro kinase assay using separately purified ERK5N and ERK5C proteins. The obtained result showed that ERK5C protein was phosphorylated in the presence of ERK5N protein, but not in the absence of ERK5N protein (Fig. 3D). Moreover, the mutant ERK5C, ERK5C 4A (T723, S760, S764, S766A) was much less phosphorylated than wild-type ERK5C (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that ERK5N directly phosphorylates ERK5C. We made an additional mutant, ERK5C S760, S764, S766A, and termed it ERK5C 3A. ERK5C T723A and ERK5C T723, S760, S764, S766A were also termed ERK5C 1A and ERK5C 4A, respectively (Fig. 4A). We also made phosphomimetic mutants of ERK5C, ERK5C T723D and ERK5C T723, S760, S764, S766D and termed them ERK5C 1D and ERK5C 4D, respectively (Fig. 4A). We then expressed each of them with ERK5N in the absence or presence of MEK5D. As already shown in Fig. 3C, ERK5C 4A did not show mobility shift, whereas ERK5C 1A (T723A) and 3A (S760, S764, S766A) did show mobility-shifted bands except for the most slowly migrating band when co-expressed with ERK5N and MEK5D (Fig. 4B, left). In contrast, both ERK5C 1D (T723D) and ERK5C 4D (T723, S760, S764, S766D) migrated more slowly than ERK5C WT in the absence of MEK5D (Fig. 4B, right). In the case of ERK5C 4D, co-expression of MEK5D did not further shift its migrating position (Fig. 4B, right). These results also support our idea that phosphorylation of these four sites is responsible for the ERK5C mobility shifts. Next, we made four mutant forms of full length ERK5, in which one (T723) or all of the four sites were mutated to alanines or aspartic acids (ERK5 1A, ERK5 4A, ERK5 1D and ERK5 4D), and expressed each of them with or without MEK5D. Their behaviors in electrophoresis with or without MEK5D were almost identical to those of the corresponding ERK5C mutants (Fig. 4C, see Fig. 4B), except that ERK5 4A and ERK5 4D still showed a small mobility shift when co-expressed with MEK5D. As the mobility-shifted band of ERK5 4A is similar to that of ERK5 KM, which does not undergo autophosphorylation, this mobility shift could be caused by MEK5D-dependent phosphorylation of ERK5 on the TEY site in the N-terminal-half of ERK5. All these results are consistent with our idea that the four sites are ERK5 autophosphorylation sites. Next, we examined when and how the C-terminal region of endogenous ERK5 is phosphorylated upon biological stimulation. The obtained results showed that endogenous ERK5 exhibited several mobility-shifted bands upon stimulation with EGF or H2O2 and the most slowly migrating band appeared at 10 min after EGF treatment (30 μm) or at 2 min after H2O2 treatment (100 mm) (Fig. 4D, upper and lower). An exogenously expressed ERK5 WT with MEK5D exhibited the mobility-shifted band that corresponded to the most slowly migrating band of endogenous ERK5, whereas an exogenously expressed ERK5 KM with MEK5D did not exhibit this band (Fig. 4C). Therefore, the most slowly migrating band of endogenous ERK5 results from the phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of ERK5. These results taken together suggest that the C-terminal region of ERK5 is phosphorylated in response to biological stimulation. We then examined the kinase activity of each full-length mutant form of ERK5. ERK5 1A, 4A, 1D, and 4D were all phosphorylated on the TEY activation sites by MEK5D, and their activated form exhibited nearly the same kinase activity toward myelin basic protein as compared with wild-type ERK5 (Fig. 4E). Phosphorylation of the C-terminal-half of ERK5 Is Necessary for the Maximal Enhancement of Its Transcriptional Activation Activity—To investigate the role of the phosphorylation of the C-terminal-half of ERK5 in its transcriptional activation activity, we examined the effect of expression of several ERK5 or ERK5C mutants on the transactivation activity of AP-1. In the reporter assay, expression of ERK5 1A or ERK5 4A with MEK5D enhanced the AP-1 activity less than wild-type ERK5; ERK5 4A was less potent than ERK5 1A (Fig. 5A, left). As no significant differences were found in the kinase activity among ERK5 WT, ERK5 1A, and ERK5 4A (Fig. 4D), the lower enhancement of AP-1 activity with ERK5 1A or ERK5 4A would result from the partial or complete lack of the autophosphorylation on the C-terminal region. In the reporter assay in which each ERK5C mutant was co-expressed with ERK5N and MEK5D, ERK5C 1A, ERK5C 3A, or ERK5C 4A enhanced the AP-1 activity less than wild-type ERK5C; ERK5C 4A was much less potent than others (Fig. 5A, right), suggesting also the importance of the phosphorylation of these sites. In addition, expression of ERK5C 4D alone without ERK5N and MEK5D enhanced the AP-1 activity by 4-fold over the control (Fig. 5B). These unexpected findings suggest that the phosphorylated C-terminal-half of ERK5 by itself without kinase activity is able to perform part of ERK5 function. However, our observation that ERK5 4A or ERK5C 4A still had the activity to enhance the AP-1 activity also suggests that the C-terminal region of ERK5 should have a basal transcriptional activation activity, which could be enhanced by its phosphorylation. ERK5 is also known to enhance the transcriptional activity of MEF2. We then investigated whether autophosphorylation of ERK5 is involved in the enhancement of MEF2 activity. Co-expression of wild-type ERK5 and MEK5D enhanced the MEF2 activity by 3-fold over the control, whereas co-expression of ERK5 4A and MEK5D enhanced the MEF2 activity to lesser extent (Fig. 5C, left). Moreover, expression of ERK5C 4D enhanced the MEF2 activity by 1.7-fold over the control (Fig. 5C, right). Therefore, these results suggest that autophosphorylation of the C-terminal-half of ERK5 is also important for the activation of MEF2 activity. Our results show firstly that the activated kinase activity of ERK5 is required for the C-terminal-half to maximally enhance the AP-1 activity and that the activated ERK5 undergoes autophosphorylation on its most C-terminal region. Subsequent analysis demonstrates that the C-terminal region phosphorylation is required for the maximal activation of the transcriptional activation activity of the ERK5 C-terminal region. Based on these results, we propose a hypothetical model, in which the activated kinase activity of ERK5 has two roles in gene expression; one role is to activate transcription factors by direct phosphorylation, and another is to activate the transcriptional activation activity of the C-terminal-half by autophosphorylation, presumably, intramolecular autophosphorylation (Fig. 5D). Two regions in the C-terminal region of ERK5 are autophosphorylated; T723 and a region containing S760, S764, and S766. These two important phosphorylation regions may additively enhance transcription and seem equally important for the transcriptional activation activity (see Fig. 5A). How autophosphorylation enhances the transcriptional activation activity of the C-terminal-half should be elucidated in future studies. We thank members of our laboratory for technical assistance and helpful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2024894588,"Myristoylation is the attachment of the 14-carbon fatty acid myristate to the N-terminal glycine residue of proteins. Typically a co-translational modification, myristoylation of proapoptotic cysteinyl-aspartyl proteases (caspase)-cleaved Bid and PAK2 was also shown to occur post-translationally and is essential for their proper localization and proapoptotic function. Progress in the identification and characterization of myristoylated proteins has been impeded by the long exposure times required to monitor incorporation of radioactive myristate into proteins (typically 1-3 months). Consequently, we developed a nonradioactive detection methodology in which a bio-orthogonal azidomyristate analog is specifically incorporated co- or post-translationally into proteins at N-terminal glycines, chemoselectively ligated to tagged triarylphosphines and detected by Western blotting with short exposure times (seconds to minutes). This represents over a million-fold signal amplification in comparison to using radioactive labeling methods. Using rational prediction analysis to recognize putative internal myristoylation sites in caspase-cleaved proteins combined with our nonradioactive chemical detection method, we identify 5 new post-translationally myristoylatable proteins (PKC epsilon, CD-IC2, Bap31, MST3, and the catalytic subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase). We also demonstrate that 15 proteins undergo post-translational myristoylation in apoptotic Jurkat T cells. This suggests that post-translational myristoylation of caspase-cleaved proteins represents a novel mechanism widely used to regulate cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2044805801,"At present, approximately 150 different members of the adhesion-G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family have been identified in metazoans. Surprisingly, very little is known about their function, although they all possess large extracellular domains coupled to a seven-transmembrane domain, suggesting a potential role in cell adhesion and signaling. Here, we demonstrate how the human-restricted adhesion-GPCR, EMR2 (epidermal growth factor-like module-containing mucin-like hormone receptor), regulates neutrophil responses by potentiating the effects of a number of proinflammatory mediators and show that the transmembrane region is critical for adhesion-GPCR function. Using an anti-EMR2 antibody, ligation of EMR2 increases neutrophil adhesion and migration, and augments superoxide production and proteolytic enzyme degranulation. On neutrophil activation, EMR2 is rapidly translocated to membrane ruffles and the leading edge of the cell. Further supporting the role in neutrophil activation, EMR2 expression on circulating neutrophils is significantly increased in patients with systemic inflammation. These data illustrate a definitive function for a human adhesion-GPCR within the innate immune system and suggest an important role in potentiating the inflammatory response. Ligation of the adhesion-GPCR EMR2 regulates human neutrophil function."
https://openalex.org/W2147855580,"Non-typeable Haemophilus influenza (NTHi) is an important human pathogen causing respiratory tract infections in both adults and children. NTHi infections are characterized by inflammation, which is mainly mediated by nuclear transcription factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent production of inflammatory mediators. The deubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD), loss of which was originally reported to cause a benign human syndrome called cylindromatosis, has been identified as a key negative regulator for NF-kappaB in vitro. However, little is known about the role of CYLD in bacteria-induced inflammation in vivo. Here, we provided direct evidence for the negative role of CYLD in NTHi-induced inflammation of the mice in vivo. Our data demonstrated that CYLD is induced by NTHi in the middle ear and lung of mice. NTHi-induced CYLD, in turn, negatively regulates NTHi-induced NF-kappaB activation through deubiquitinating TRAF6 and 7 and down-regulates inflammation. Our data thus indicate that CYLD acts as a negative regulator for NF-kappaB-dependent inflammation in vivo, hence protecting the host against detrimental inflammatory response to NTHi infection."

One member of the group (D7r1 or hamadarin) has also been shown to have an anticoagulant/antikinin activity. To understand the mechanistic details of its antihemostatic/anti-inflammatory effects, we have determined the crystal structure of one member of this group, D7r4, along with the structures of ligand complexes with serotonin, tryptamine, histamine, and norepinephrine. The D7 fold consists of an arrangement of eight α-helices stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The structure is similar to those of the arthropod odorant-binding proteins, a relationship that had been predicted based on sequence comparisons. Although odorant-binding proteins commonly have six α-helices, D7r4 has eight, resulting in significantly different positioning and structure of the ligand binding pocket. The pocket itself is lined by hydrophobic side chains along with polar and charged groups oriented to form hydrogen bonds with the aliphatic amino group and with groups on the aromatic portions of the ligands.

Anopheles gambiae is the major African vector of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum that infects 300-500 million people and causes 1-2 million deaths annually. Malaria transmission occurs during ingestion of a blood meal by the female mosquito when the sporozoite stage of the parasite is passed to the host in the insect saliva. Blood feeding is facilitated by a salivary mixture of biologically active peptides and small molecules that target the processes of blood clotting, vasodilation, inflammation, tissue remodeling, and immunity (1Ribeiro J.M.C. Infect. Agents Dis. 1995; 4: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of antihemostatic defenses by these components is essential for the efficient ingestion of blood and, consequently, for egg production and possibly parasite transmission.Saliva from female A. gambiae contains a plethora of potent antihemostatic proteins, including the thrombin inhibitor anophelin (2Valenzuela J.G.

Among the most abundant salivary molecules are the D7-related (D7r) proteins (7Calvo E. deBianchi A.G. James A.A. Marinotti O. Insect Biochem. Mol.

D7r1 (also known as hamadarin) was initially shown to have an anticoagulant/antikinin activity resulting from strong binding interactions with high molecular weight kininogen and factor XIIa, two components of the contact activation system of coagulation (8Calvo E.

Chinzei Y. Yuda M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 37: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). More recently, D7r1-D7r4 were found to bind the biogenic amines serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine, thereby reducing the concentrations of these effectors at the feeding site (8Calvo E.

Chem. 2006; 281: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).The process of blood clotting, the maintenance of vascular tone, and inflammatory responses are all regulated to some extent by biogenic amines. The widespread distribution of biogenic amine-binding lipocalin proteins in the saliva of tick and triatomine bug species suggests that inhibition of these processes is essential for efficient blood feeding (11Andersen J.F.

Interestingly, D7r5 does not bind biogenic amines but is also poorly expressed, suggesting that it may be nonfunctional and on an evolutionary path toward silencing (8Calvo E. Mans B.J. Andersen J.F.

All of the proteins, with the exception of D7r5, bind serotonin with high affinity and histamine with somewhat lower affinity. D7r2 and D7r3 bind epinephrine and norepinephrine with much higher affinity than D7r1 and D7r4 suggesting that these two members of the group may be specifically adapted for local catecholamine removal around a feeding site.Proteins showing sequence similarity to the D7r proteins occur in other blood-feeding Diptera, including mosquito species in the genera Anopheles (15Calvo E.

The selenomethionine media kit (SelenoMet) was obtained from Molecular Dimensions Ltd. Serotonin, tryptamine, and histamine were obtained from Sigma as hydrochloride salts. l-Norepinephrine bitartrate salt was also obtained from Sigma.Preparation of Protein and Crystallization—The D7r4 cDNA, cloned into the expression vector pET 17b, was used to produce recombinant protein in Escherichia coli as described previously. Inclusion bodies were prepared 3 h after induction, solubilized, and refolded as described by Calvo et al. (8Calvo E. Mans B.J. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol.

The refolded proteins were purified by a combination of gel filtration and cation exchange chromatography. Selenomethionine-containing protein was produced in E. coli using SelenoMet medium (Molecular Dimensions Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was refolded and purified in a manner similar to the wild type protein. Crystals were obtained using the hanging drop-vapor diffusion method with 20% polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, as a precipitant. Prior to data collection, crystals were flash-frozen after a short soak in 30% PEG 6000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10% glycerol. Co-crystals were grown by adding serotonin or tryptamine to the precipitant solution at a concentration of 1 mm. Ligands were soaked into crystals by placing a crystal into a 5-μl drop of cryoprotectant solution containing a 20-100 μm ligand concentration and allowing it to soak for several minutes before flash freezing.Data Collection and Structure Determination—Data were collected at beamlines 19-ID and 19-BM at the Structural Biology Center, APS, Argonne National Laboratory. Diffraction data for the selenomethionine derivative was collected at two wavelengths near the selenium edge and integrated and scaled using HKL 3000 (21Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Initial phases were also obtained using the HKL 3000 package which combines SHELXD-E (22Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

Some of the helical segments of the model were built using RESOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), whereas the remainder of the protein backbone structure and the side chains were built manually using a native D7r4 data set. Numerous cycles of rebuilding and refinement were performed with Coot (27Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22799) Google Scholar) and REFMAC (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Various manipulations of reflection and coordinate data during the course of structure determination were made using the CCP4 package (29P4 CC Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar). Model quality was checked using the MOLPROBITY web server (30Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall W.B. II I de Bakker P.I.

The structural figures presented here were produced with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific).In the histamine and norepinephrine complexes, where the crystals were soaked with ligand-containing cryoprotectant solutions, a change in unit cell dimensions was observed that resulted in two molecules of D7r4 in the asymmetric unit rather than one. The space group of both crystals was P43 and transformation from the small to the larger unit cell can be described as follows: a′= a + b, b′=-a + b, c′= c.The two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the large unit cell were positioned by molecular replacement using PHASER (31McCoy A.J.

Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis and Binding Studies—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a PCR-based procedure and verified by DNA sequencing. Protein expression and purification were performed using the same methods as for wild type D7r4. Binding studies were performed by isothermal titration calorimetry using a Microcal VP-ITC microcalorimeter at a temperature of 30 °C. Protein and ligand solutions were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl. The protein solution was added to the microcalorimeter sample cell, and ligand solutions were injected in 5-10-μl aliquots. The measured heats were converted to enthalpies (per injection) and analyzed using the Microcal-Origin software package.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructure of D7r4—The structure of D7r4 without ligands was determined by multiple anomalous dispersion methods using a selenomethionine derivative of the protein. Additionally, the structures of ligand complexes containing serotonin, tryptamine, norepinephrine, and histamine were determined using molecular replacement or difference Fourier methods. The serotonin and tryptamine complexes were obtained by co-crystallization of protein and ligand, whereas the norepinephine and histamine complexes were obtained by soaking crystals with ligand-containing solutions. In all cases, interpretable electron density was observed for the ligand (Fig. 2B).The D7r protein fold consists of an arrangement of eight helices stabilized by three disulfide bonds (Fig. 1). The helices surround a small, centrally located ligand binding pocket. A narrow channel bounded by helices B, G, and H leads to the binding pocket and is the most likely ligand entry path. In both the ligand-free and ligand-bound structures, the loops connecting helices A-B and B-C are more mobile than the rest of the structure, exhibiting larger temperature factors and poor electron density for the side chains. This suggests that flexibility in these areas of the protein may play a role in ligand entry.FIGURE 1Comparison of the D7r4 structure with the published structures of the pheromone-binding protein of the silkmoth, B. mori (Protein Data Bank code 1DQE (35Sandler B.H.

C, structure of the hemolymph protein THP12 (cyan) without ligands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Despite being only 12-15% identical in amino acid sequence (by alignment with ClustalW), D7r4 is similar in structure to the arthropod OBPs, a group of all-helical proteins that putatively function in shuttling odorant molecules from the surface of hair-like antennal olfactory sensillae, through the sensillar lymph to olfactory receptors at the neural membrane. The OBP group also contains THP12, a protein of unknown function found in the hemolymph of the beetle Tenebrio molitor (32Rothemund S. Liou Y.C. Davies P.L. Krause E. Sonnichsen F.D. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 1325-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Arthropod OBPs and THP12 are hexahelical proteins, lacking the C-terminal helices G and H of D7r4 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2A).The Bombyx mori pheromone-binding protein (BmPBP) and other olfactory OBPs contain three disulfide bonds connecting helix A with C, helix E with F, and helix C with F. The former two bonds are conserved in D7r4, linking Cys-6 with Cys-38 and Cys-77 with Cys-96 (Fig. 1). A third disulfide bond in D7r4 is unique to the group and links Cys-19 of helix B with Cys-144 of helix H (Fig. 1). THP12 retains the conserved disulfide bonds connecting helix A with C and helix E with F, but it is missing the bond linking helix C with F that is seen in BmPBP (Fig. 1).As a rule, members of the OBP family are either truncated at the end of helix F or have a nonhelical C-terminal portion. A functionally important exception is BmPBP that forms an additional helix in a pH-dependent conformational change. The ligand-bound protein found at pH 6.5 exhibits an extended conformation at the C terminus, which forms a seventh helix when the pH is lowered to 4.5 (33Horst R. Damberger F. Luginbuhl P. Guntert P. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 34Lee D. Damberger F.F. Peng G. Horst R.

Biol. 2000; 7: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The C-terminal helix inserts into the pheromone binding pocket and presumably displaces the pheromone ligand (33Horst R. Damberger F. Luginbuhl P. Guntert P. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of this process is potentially important because the pH at the receptor membrane surface, where ligand release occurs, is apparently lower than the pH of 6.5 measured for the bulk sensillar lymph (33Horst R. Damberger F. Luginbuhl P. Guntert P. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).Helix A of the OBPs is longer than that of D7r4 and contributes significantly to the structure of the binding pocket (Fig. 1B). THP12 also has an extended N terminus (Fig. 1), but it forms a disordered coil giving rise to an open binding groove, rather than the closed ligand-binding pocket of the OBPs (32Rothemund S. Liou Y.C. Davies P.L. Krause E. Sonnichsen F.D. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 1325-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). D7r4 has helices A-F arranged in a similar manner to THP12, but the binding pocket is closed by the additional C-terminal helical segments G and H (Fig. 1A and Fig. 2A). These differences significantly change the position and structure of the binding pocket in D7r4 relative to the sensory OBPs. In the latter, helices D-F make up a large part of the pocket structure, whereas in D7r4 they are largely displaced by helices G and H and, with the exception of Tyr-94, do not contribute to the structure of the pocket.Details of the Ligand Binding Pocket and Ligand Complex Structures—D7r proteins bind a variety of structurally distinct biogenic amines with high affinity, yet employ only a single binding site. This broad ligand specificity is accomplished via a generally hydrophobic binding pocket with polar or charged side chains placed at various locations where they can form hydrogen bonds with ligand functional groups in different arrangements (Fig. 4). The apparent entry path to the binding pocket is surrounded by the anionic side chains of Asp-111, Glu-114, and Asp-139, which act to stabilize the aliphatic amino group of the bound ligand (Fig. 4). The interior of the pocket is lined by aromatic and hydrophobic residues, including Tyr-24 and Phe-110, which contact the aromatic rings and aliphatic side chain of biogenic amine ligands (Fig. 3). At the closed end of the pocket, opposite the ligand entry channel, Glu-7 and His-35 are positioned to form hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups found on the aromatic portions of serotonin and norepinephrine (Figs. 3 and 5).FIGURE 4Stereoview showing the hydrogen bonding interactions in the serotonin (A) and tryptamine (B) complexes.

Hydrogen bonds are indicated as red dashed lines; water molecules are red spheres; protein residues are colored in green, and ligands are shown in cyan.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the serotonin complex, the ligand is oriented with its indole nucleus directed toward the closed end of the pocket and the aliphatic amino group toward the apparent access channel. The 5-hydroxyl group forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Glu-7 and His-35 (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4A). The side chain of Arg-22 extends from the protein backbone parallel to the plane of the indole ring system and crosses over it (Fig. 3). It is bent 90° at C-δ allowing the guanidino moiety to contact the edge of the ring as well as its face. The side chain of Tyr-24 forms a third side of the box-like pocket holding the ligand (Fig. 3). An apparent salt bridge between Arg-22 and Glu-114 positions the latter to form a hydrogen bond with the amino group of serotonin (Fig. 3). Also interacting with the amino group are Asp-111, which forms a hydrogen bond via its carboxylate, and Asp-139, which stabilizes a water molecule that forms a hydrogen bond with the amino group (Fig. 4A). The indole nitrogen of serotonin forms a long hydrogen bond (3.07 Å) with the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr-94, the only residue from helix D that impinges on the binding pocket (Fig. 4A).Not surprisingly, tryptamine and serotonin occupy nearly identical positions in the binding pocket despite the absence of a 5-hydroxyl group in tryptamine (Fig. 4B). All of the hydrogen bonding interactions with the aliphatic amino group seen in the serotonin complex are maintained in the tryptamine complex, as is the long hydrogen bond between the Tyr-94 hydroxyl and the indole nitrogen of the ligand (Fig. 4B). The near equivalence of the serotonin and tryptamine binding modes allowed us to estimate the energetic contributions of hydrogen bonding interactions with the 5-hydroxyl group of serotonin using isothermal titration calorimetry. The 4.7 kcal/mol difference in the binding enthalpy (ΔΔH) seen between the two ligands is apparently because of the loss of hydrogen bonding interactions with Glu-8 and His-35 in the D7r4-tryptamine complex (Table 2). The more favorable entropy change exhibited in the tryptamine binding reaction is probably due to the more hydrophobic nature of this compound.TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters for binding of serotonin (top) and tryptamine (bottom) with D7r4 and various binding pocket mutantsMutantLigandΔHaValues are given as kcal/mol.ΔΔHaValues are given as kcal/mol.,bΔΔH indicates ΔHmutant − ΔHwild type.TΔSaValues are given as kcal/mol.KdcValues are given as nanomolar.ΔGaValues are given as kcal/mol.ΔΔGaValues are given as kcal/mol.,dΔΔG indicates ΔGmutant − ΔGwild type.Wild typeSerotonin−21.1−9.22.4−11.9Tryptamine−16.4−6.353−10.1E7LSerotonin−14.86.3−4.984−9.82.1Tryptamine−10.06.4−1.7980−8.31.8H35LSerotonin−30.6−9.5−16.50.1−14.0−2.1Tryptamine−28.3−11.9−15.60.6−12.7−2.6E7L/H35LSerotonin−15.95.2−7.0360−8.93.0"

This finding suggests that 14-3-3 are redox-regulated proteins. Many cellular processes are known to be regulated through reduction and oxidation (redox) (1Halliwell B. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). This regulation is carried out by a set of designated proteins, oxidoreductases. The redox function of these proteins may be supported by protein-bound cofactors or involve redox-active cysteine residues. Previous research on thiol oxidoreductases has focused only on a few of these enzymes (2Lillig C.H. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 25-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Most prominent among them are proteins of the thioredoxin fold superfamily, such as thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, peroxiredoxin, glutathione peroxidase, and their more distant homologs (3Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Thiol oxidoreductases, however, are much more widespread, and most members of this protein class have not been functionally characterized (4Fomenko D.E. Xing W. Adair B.M. Thomas D.J. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2007; 315: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).

Selenium: Its Molecular Biology and Role in Human Health. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2006Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This rare amino acid is inserted into proteins contranslationally in response to a UGA codon. The human set of Sec-containing proteins (selenoproteomes) consists of 25 known members (7Kryukov G.V.

Several selenoproteins have recently been functionally characterized and found to be oxidoreductases (8Flohe L. Dev. Ophthalmol. 2005; 38: 89-102PubMed Google Scholar). For example, both major cellular redox systems, the thioredoxin and glutathione systems, are dependent on selenoproteins (thioredoxin reductases and glutathione peroxidases, respectively). However, the functions of the majority of selenoproteins are not known. selenocysteine nuclear Overhauser effect NOE spectroscopy. selenocysteine nuclear Overhauser effect NOE spectroscopy. We recently reported on a family of selenoproteins and their Cys homologs, designated as the Rdx family (9Dikiy A. Novoselov S.V. Fomenko D.E. Sengupta A. Carlson B.A. Cerny R.L. Ginalski K. Grishin N.V. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6871-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Mammalian members of this family include selenoproteins SelW, SelT, SelH, SelV, and a Cys-containing Rdx12 protein. Functions are not known for any of these proteins. Through sequence analysis and structure modeling, we predicted that these proteins possess a thioredoxin-like fold, suggesting a redox nature of catalytic Sec residues. Among Rdx proteins, the best characterized is SelW. It is a 9-kDa selenoprotein, abundant in muscle and brain (10Beilstein M.A. Vendeland S.C. Barofsky E. Jensen O.N. Whanger P.D. J. Inorg.

Native SelW was reported to occur in a complex with glutathione, which was attached to one of the Cys residues in the protein (10Beilstein M.A. Vendeland S.C. Barofsky E. Jensen O.N. Whanger P.D. J.

In addition, the SelW/14-3-3 interaction differs from that observed for other 14-3-3 partners, since SelW does not have canonical 14-3-3 binding motifs (R(S/X)XpSXPorRXXXpSXP, where X denotes any amino acid residue, and pS represents a phosphorylated serine (20Yaffe M.B.

One possibility is that SelW regulates 14-3-3 in a redox manner; in the oxidized form (e.g. with a disulfide or a glutathionylated cysteine), 14-3-3 may be inactive and require a reduced form of SelW for activation. Determination of the three-dimensional structure of SelW as well as structural information on the SelW/14-3-3 interaction would be key in understanding both the structural basis and biological relevance of this interaction. NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique for structural characterization of proteins in solution as well as for monitoring interactions between two or more proteins. Additionally, NMR provides valuable information regarding mobility of various parts of the protein and its residues. Here, we used high resolution NMR spectroscopy to determine the structure of a founding member of the Rdx family, SelW, and examined its interactions with 14-3-3 proteins. These data revealed the thioredoxin-like fold in SelW and, therefore, other Rdx proteins and provided structural insights into the interaction of SelW with 14-3-3. Expression and Purification of SelW—Structural analysis was carried out with a recombinant bacterially expressed mouse SelW tagged at the C terminus with a His6 tag and containing Cys in place of Sec13 and Ser in place of Cys10 (9Dikiy A. Novoselov S.V. Fomenko D.E. Sengupta A. Carlson B.A. Cerny R.L. Ginalski K. Grishin N.V. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6871-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To uniformly label SelW with 15Nor 15N/13C, cells were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 99% enriched (15NH4)2SO4 and 98% enriched 13C6-labeled d-glucose (Spectra Stable Isotopes). His6-SelW was overexpressed in Escherichia coli ER2566 (New England Biolabs) by growing cells at 37 °C until the A600 nm reached 0.6, followed by induction of protein synthesis by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm NaCl and 0.05% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Additionally, 1 mm lysozyme (Sigma) and a half-tablet of Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) were added to the solution. Following centrifugation, supernatant was applied onto a TALON Co-IMAC-Sepharose column (BD Biosciences). The column was washed with 20 mm imidazole in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, followed by elution of protein with 200 mm imidazole in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl buffer at 4 °C. Expression and Purification of 14-3-3—14-3-3 expression plasmids included constructs that coded for N-terminal His-tagged 14-3-3γ (pQE30 with the gene Ywhag, kindly provided by Dr. A. Aitken) and C-terminal His-tagged 14-3-3β and 14-3-3γ (pTvHR21-SGC derived from YWHABA-c007 and YWHAGA-s001 clones, kindly provided by Dr. D. Doyle). The plasmids were transformed into E. coli ER2566 (New England Biolabs). Unlabeled 14-3-3 proteins were prepared by growing cells in LB medium. Different 14-3-3 forms were overexpressed by growing cells at 37 °C up to A600 nm 0.6, followed by induction of protein synthesis with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells containing N-terminal His-tagged 14-3-3γ were collected by centrifugation and disrupted using BugBuster® Master Mix (Novagen) containing Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Following centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid His-Bind resin column (Novagen). The column was washed with 20 mm imidazole in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl buffer, followed by protein elution with 200 mm imidazole in WEB buffer at 4 °C. Cells expressing C-terminal tagged 14-3-3β/γ were harvested by centrifugation; disrupted by sonication in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol (Sigma); and supplemented with 1 mm lysozyme (Sigma) and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysate was applied onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid His-Bind resin column (Novagen). The column was washed with 25 mm imidazole in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol, followed by elution of protein with 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl at 4 °C. Sample Preparation—Samples for NMR studies contained 1-1.5 mm His6-SelW in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.1, with 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of either 95% H2O plus 5% D2O or 99.9% D2O. Interaction of SelW with 14-3-3—Interaction between SelW and 14-3-3 was investigated by mixing 0.2-0.5 mm 15N-labeled SelW with unlabeled 14-3-3 at a molar ratio of 1:1.1 (SelW/14-3-3]) in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. 15N HSQC spectra were recorded, and the spectral changes were quantified as ΔHSQC = |ΔνHN|. As control, bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was mixed with 15N-labeled SelW as described above for 14-3-3, and the spectra were recorded. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were recorded at 288 or 298 K on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm z-gradient TXI(H/C/N) cryogenic probe. 1H, 13C, and 15N, chemical shifts were referenced to sodium salt of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propanesulfonic acid as described in Ref. 22Zhang H.Y. Neal S. Wishart D.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 25: 173-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar. Sequence-specific backbone and side-chain assignments of SelW were accomplished using 15N HSQC, 13C HSQC, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, CBCANH, CBCA(CO)NH, HBHANH, HBHA(CO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY, and HCCH-COSY spectra. Aromatic ring system assignments were obtained from two-dimensional COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments. NOE assignments were derived from two-dimensional NOESY, three-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC-NOESY and 1H-13C HSQC-NOESY spectra. Dihedral angle constraints were derived from three-dimensional HNHA spectra. NMR data were processed with the BRUKER XWinNMR version 3.5 software, and spectral analysis was performed using CARA version 1.4 (23Keller R. Optimizing the Process of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrum Analysis and Computer Aided Resonance Assignment. Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). 15N-{1H} heteronuclear NOEs were calculated from two independently measured and integrated 15N-1H heteronuclear correlated spectra acquired using enhanced sensitivity sequence employing pulsed field gradients (24Farrow N.A.

Nuclear magnetic relaxation (T1 and T2) measurements of 15N were obtained by exponential fitting of peak intensities in 15N HSQC spectra acquired with different relaxation delays (24Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar, 25Kay L.E.

All NMR data reported in this work were collected at the faculty of Natural Sciences and Technology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology NMR center. Structure Calculation—NOE cross-peaks were identified, integrated, and assigned in the aforementioned NOESY spectra using the program CARA (23Keller R. Optimizing the Process of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrum Analysis and Computer Aided Resonance Assignment. Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). The CALIBA (26Güntert P. Qian Y.Q. Otting G. Müller M. Gehring W. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) subroutine in CYANA 2.1 was used to convert cross-peak intensities from NOESY spectra into distance constraints. Dihedral angle constraints were derived from three-dimensional HNHA spectra and were further confirmed and supplemented with backbone torsion angle restraints obtained from secondary chemical shifts using the TALOS program (27Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). On the basis of this input, the structure was calculated using the torsion angle dynamics program CYANA 2.1 (28Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar). Structure calculations started from 96 conformers with random torsion angle values, and the final 20 conformers with the lowest final CYANA target function values were energy-minimized in a vacuum using the AMBER force field (29Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11553) Google Scholar) with the aid of the AMBER 9.0 program. Modeling of Rdx Proteins—Structures of mouse Rdx12 and SelT were modeled using Modeler8 version 2 based on the experimental NMR structure of mouse SelW. General Description of the SelW Structure—Assignment of 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances for a recombinant C10S and U13C variant of mouse SelW (hereafter SelW) was achieved through standard two- and three-dimensional homo-/heteronuclear NMR experiments. The resonance assignment was confirmed at two temperatures, 288 and 298 K. A list of NMR experiments that resulted in the assignment together with the assignment itself were deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank under accession number 7324. Geometrical constraints were derived from two-dimensional homonuclear and three-dimensional heteronuclear 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY. Table 1 reports distribution of constraints among four different classes according to the types of constraints and distances. Dihedral angle constraints were derived from three-dimensional HNHA spectra and were further confirmed and supplemented using the TALOS program (27Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). In total, 1950 NOE upper distance limit constraints and 116 angle restraints were used to calculate the three-dimensional structure of SelW using the CYANA 2.1 program, assuring high quality of the calculated structure. The structures constituting the CYANA family were further subjected to refinement using the AMBER 9.0 program (29Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11553) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the final energy-refined family (20 conformers) together with the constraint files were deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 2NPB.TABLE 1Characterization of input NMR data and structural statistics for the solution structure of the reduced recombinant Sec13 → Cys form of mouse SelWParametersValuesInput data for structure calculation NOE distance constraintsTotal1950Intra1063Short341Medium236Long310 Torsion angle constraints116Structure statistics, 20 conformersaThe values given are the average and S.D. over the 20 energy-minimized conformers with the lowest CYANA (version 2.1.5) target function values that represent the NMR solution family CYANA target function value(Å2)3.53 ± 0.26 Maximum residual distance constraint violation (Å)0.4 ± 0.13 Maximal torsion angle constraint violations2.75 ± 0.75 Total AMBER energies (kcal·mol–1)– 1304.2 ± 292.7 PROCHECK Ramachandran plot analysisResidues in favored regions (%)81.6Residues in additionally allowed regions (%)16.3Residues in generously allowed regions (%)1.4Residues in disallowed regions (%)0.8 Root mean square deviation to the average coordinates (Å)bConcerns energy-minimized conformersN, Cα, C′ (residues 3–88)0.71 ± 0.12N, Cα, C′ (secondary structure)cResidues 3–9, 15–28, 34–40, 48–63, 70–880.41 ± 0.10Heavy atoms (residues 3–88)1.12 ± 0.11Heavy atoms (secondary structure)cResidues 3–9, 15–28, 34–40, 48–63, 70–880.86 ± 0.10a The values given are the average and S.D. over the 20 energy-minimized conformers with the lowest CYANA (version 2.1.5) target function values that represent the NMR solution familyb Concerns energy-minimized conformersc Residues 3–9, 15–28, 34–40, 48–63, 70–88 Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows a family of 20 conformers (A) and different orientations of the average three-dimensional structure (B and C) of SelW. Quality assessment for the calculated structure is reported in Table 1. The data suggest that the resulting SelW structure represents a low energy conformation with the structural data fitting well the experimentally found geometrical constraints. The observed structural family is well defined. Average backbone root mean square deviation value with respect to the mean structure is 0.71 ± 0.12 Å. If only the protein regions characterized by the presence of secondary structure are considered, the corresponding root mean square deviation value drops to 0.41 ± 0.10 Å. Indeed, the least defined regions in the SelW family are located in two external loops (Fig. 1A). Decreased resolution for these regions is due to a decreased number of geometrical constraints for residues constituting the two loops. One of the loops contains a predicted active site of SelW (e.g. the CXXU motif), whereas the second loop may be involved in substrate binding (see below). The decreased structural resolution observed for the two loops may be a consequence of increased mobility of these regions with respect to the rest of the protein. Moreover, the proposed mobility may have a physiological role (i.e. it may be required for induced fit binding between interacting partners). To examine this possibility, dynamic characterization of the protein by NMR spectroscopy was carried out (see below). The structure of SelW consists of a four-stranded β-sheet with two extended α helices and a short 310 helix, all located on one side of the β-sheet (Fig. 1, B and C). Besides these secondary structures, the protein contains two external loops and a type II turn. The molecule is characterized by a β1(3-9)-α1(15-28)-β2(34-40)-β3(48-52)-β4(54-60)-310(61-63)-α2(70-88) secondary structure pattern, wherein β1 and β2 are parallel strands forming a classical β1-α1-β2 motif, which is also observed in thioredoxin-like fold proteins (30Qi Y. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2005; 58: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The axis of α2-helix is at an ∼45° angle with respect to the axis of the α1-helix as a consequence of the β-sheet topology. The CXXU motif is located in the loop (residues 10-14) between β1 and α1. The second loop (residues 40-47) separates β2 and β3 strands. β3 and β4 strands form a β-hairpin with a type II turn (residues 52-54) in between. In the β4 strand, Val57 is flipped out as previously observed for Val56 in tendamistat (31Kline A.D. Braun W. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 675-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Electrostatic Surface Potential—The electrostatic surface potential of mouse SelW is shown in Fig. 1D. The data reveal that electrostatic charges are rather smoothly distributed over the protein surface. Indeed, the surface lacks strong positive or negative patches. Nevertheless, a small positively charged region is found in the 310 helix (residues 61-63). Both external loops (Tyr9-Ser10-Gly11-Ala12-Cys13-Gly14-Tyr15 and Glu39-Gly40-Thr41-Pro42-Asn43-Val44-Thr45-Gly46-Phe47) (indicated by circles in Fig. 1D) lack charged amino acids (with the possible exception of Cys in the CXXU motif). This observation suggests that the interaction between SelW and its physiological partner(s) takes place without the assistance of electrostatic forces. Moreover, it should be noted that three of the four loop ends contain aromatic amino acids. They might work as anchoring points for the loops in relation to the protein backbone core. Furthermore, these residues are often flanked by glycines (i.e. Gly14, Gly40, and Gly46) and a serine (Ser10), which might offer greater backbone flexibility and support loop mobility. Altogether, these residues may confer both rigidity to the structural elements and increased flexibility to the loops, resulting in an optimal structural network for the predicted catalytic site of SelW. Mobility Studies—As discussed above, the two external loops in the solution structure of SelW reveal a markedly lower resolution with respect to the rest of the protein that could be explained by increased loop mobility. To examine this possibility, we elucidated dynamic behavior of SelW in a ps/ns time scale through analysis of 15N backbone T1 and T2 and heteronuclear 15N-{1H} NOE values. Fig. 2 reports these parameters as a function of residue number. It is evident that the vast majority of residues exhibit T1, T2, and NOE values characteristic of nonmobile amino acids in a protein of the SelW size. However, the data cannot sufficiently describe the residues of the two external loops (i.e. residues 10-14 and 40-47). Intensities of the corresponding cross-peaks in 15N HSQC spectra are significantly lower with respect to those of other residues; therefore, the errors for relaxation times and heteronuclear NOEs are significantly higher. The significantly decreased intensity of the relevant cross-peaks in 15N HSQC spectra suggests that the loop residues are more mobile than the rest of the molecule. For the rigid part of SelW, the T1/T2 ratio was 4.37, which, assuming a spherical geometry of the particle, corresponds to an overall rotational correlation time τc = 5.8 ns (25Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). Structural Comparison of Mouse and Bacterial SelW Proteins—During the course of this study, an unpublished crystal structure of a distant bacterial SelW homolog appeared in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 2FA8). Structural comparison of mammalian and bacterial proteins is important from both functional and evolutionary points of view. Structure-assisted alignment of these two sequences (i.e. Protein Data Bank codes 2NPB and 2FA8) shows 18.2% identity in amino acid sequences. Interestingly, in pairwise alignments, BLAST and FASTA do not recognize these proteins as homologs with sufficient E values. Nevertheless, mouse SelW and bacterial SelW-like proteins show an overall conservation of both structure and the predicted active site CXXC/U motif. These proteins also conserve the β-hairpin (residues 48-56 in mouse SelW) as well as positively charged residues in the 310 helix. Side-by-side views of mouse and bacterial SelW structures are shown in Fig. 3 (this analysis was performed using the coordinates of one bacterial SelW monomer in the crystal structure of the tetramer). The calculated backbone root mean square deviation value was 1.43 Å, indicating very similar three-dimensional structures in mammalian and bacterial SelWs. In turn, close structural similarity suggests that the proteins may exhibit similar functions in bacteria and mammals. Fig. 3A shows the side chains of all aromatic residues in the mouse SelW structure. Of eight aromatic residues, six (9, 15, 19, 47, 48, and 66) form a cluster right behind the predicted active site of SelW. This cluster is situated too far from the CXXC(U) motif (average distance is ∼15 Å) to have a direct role in the redox reaction. However, it might be relevant for binding of interaction partners and/or maintaining the overall protein structure. This possibility is consistent with the strict conservation of all aromatic residues in the “aromatic cluster” (see also below) upon comparison of mouse (Fig. 3A) and bacterial (Fig. 3B) SelW structures. Structural Characterization of Other Rdx Family Members—The three-dimensional structure of SelW allowed us to model structures of other members of the Rdx family. Fig. 4A shows SelT, Rdx12, and SelW"

We investigated the expression profile of TRPC channels in adult rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after nerve injury and examined the role of TRPC4 in neurite outgrowth in cultured DRG neurons. Sciatic nerve transection and microinjection of dibutyryl cAMP were employed to induce axonal regeneration in vivo. TRPC4 mRNA was significantly increased whereas TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 remained unaltered after nerve injury or dibutyryl-cAMP microinjection. The increases in TRPC4 transcript and protein were transient with maximal levels reached at 2 or 7 days, respectively. In addition, TRPC4 transcript in ND7/23 and NDC cells, hybrid cell lines derived from neonatal DRG and neuroblastoma, was substantially increased on differentiation, characterized by neurite outgrowth. In adult DRG, TRPC4 immunoreactivity was found in small and large neurons, and nerve injury increased the number of TRPC4-immunoreactive cells, particularly in large neurons. TRPC4 immunoreactivity was present in growth cones at various stages of DRG neurite outgrowth in vitro. Suppression of TRPC4 by a specific small interfering RNA or antisense significantly reduced the length of neurites in cultured DRG neurons. Expression of short hairpin RNA significantly down-regulated TRPC4 protein level and shortened neurite lengths in differentiated ND7/23 cells.

Nature. 2005; 434: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Injury to the peripheral axons of primary sensory neurons induces changes in the cell bodies that support axonal regeneration. For example, the regrowth of injured axons in dorsal spinal roots or from dorsal columns of the spinal cord is enhanced strongly by a concomitant peripheral nerve injury (11Richardson P.M. Issa V.M. Nature. 1984; 309: 791-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 12Neumann S. Skinner K. Basbaum A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16848-16852Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Application of exogenous cAMP to DRG effectively mimics this conditioning effect both in vitro and in vivo (13Neumann S.

Richardson P.M. Exp. Neurol. 2007; 204: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the molecular changes within injured neurons that mediate this growth potential are only partially understood. In the present study, we have investigated possible changes in the expression of TRPC genes after sciatic nerve transection and intra-ganglionic microinjection of db-cAMP. We have found a marked transient increase in TRPC4 transcript and protein in DRG cells following either treatment. The elongation of neurites in DRG neurons was significantly impaired when TRPC4 expression was suppressed by siRNA (small interfering RNA) or antisense. Thus, our data have revealed a close relationship between TRPC4 expression and axonal regeneration in adult DRG neurons. Conditioning Nerve Lesion and Intra-ganglionic Injection—All experimental protocols were approved by the local animal care committee in accordance with UK Home Office regulations. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (∼250 g) were anesthetized, and the left sciatic nerve was exposed and transected at mid-thigh level. The contralateral sciatic nerve was exposed, but not transected. For DRG microinjection, a small laminectomy was performed to expose the left L5 DRG, and 1.5 μl of db-cAMP (dibutyryl cAMP; Sigma) at a concentration of 33 mm in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or a similar amount of PBS was injected into the exposed DRG using a Hamilton syringe with a 30-gauge needle. The overlying skin and muscle were sutured, and the animal was allowed to recover. DRG Cell Line Culture and Transfection—ND7/23 and NDC are hybrid cell lines derived from neonatal rat DRG neurons fused with a mouse neuroblastoma (16Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P.R. Dunn P.M. Harmar A. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Wheatley S. Proc. Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The cell lines were used for some experiments in preference to DRG primary cell cultures (see later) because of the greater ease of transfection. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. A Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-based medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and glutamine was used to culture PC12 cells. Nerve growth factor (NGF) 7s (100 ng/ml) was added to differentiate PC12 cells. Two complementary oligonucleotides specific to rat TRPC4 (17Wu X. Zagranichnaya T.K. Gurda G.T. Eves E.M. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43392-43402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were ordered from Invitrogen. The hairpin RNA oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into the linearized pSilencer 3.1 H1 hygro vector as described by the manufacturer (Ambion Inc.). The inserts were sequenced to confirm that there were no unwanted mutations. Transfection of ND7/23 was carried out using siPORT XP-1 as directed by the manufacturer's instruction manual (Ambion Inc.). Cells were grown in 6-well plates to 40–60% confluence, and each well was transfected with 1 μg of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in antibiotic-free medium. Hygromycin (250 μg/ml) was added 24 h after transfection. For mock control, a mismatch hairpin oligonucleotide duplex was inserted into pSilencer 3.1 vector followed by similar transfection. A stable cell line was established in selection medium following the transfection of TRPC4 shRNA or mismatch duplex. Cells were then grown in 125 μg/ml hygromycin for analysis. Transfection of shRNA-expressing ND7/23 cells with human TRPC4 (hTRPC4, a generous gift from Dr. John Wood) was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. For each 35-mm Petri dish, hTRPC4 (1 μg) together with enhanced green fluorescent protein (0.3 μg; Clontech) was mixed with diluted lipid reagent for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with the above complexes for 5 h at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. Green fluorescent protein was used as a visual marker for hTRPC4-expressing cells. To initiate differentiation, the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and stimulated with 100 ng/ml NGF 7s or 1 mm db-cAMP. Cells were fixed 2 days after differentiation and immunostained for β-tubulin III (1:1000, Sigma), and the length of the longest neurites was measured with ImageJ software. Median lengths and frequency histograms of neurite lengths of 200–350 cells in three bins (<30, 30–100, and >100 μm) were analyzed. The statistical significance was examined using χ2 analysis. RT-PCR and Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) from L4 and L5 DRG of rats subjected to the conditioning or the mock manipulation. Total RNA of DRG cell lines or PC12 cells was prepared similarly. First-strand cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of total RNA with random hexanucleotide primers using Superscript III® reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA was amplified by PCR using TRPC1- and TRPC3–7-specific primers (17Wu X. Zagranichnaya T.K. Gurda G.T. Eves E.M. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43392-43402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Each amplification reaction contained cDNA derived from 25 ng of RNA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 400 nm dNTP mix, 200 nm sense and 200 nm antisense primers, and 0.125 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich) in a final volume of 25 μl. Cycling conditions have been described previously (15Wu D. Zhang Y. Bo X. Huang W. Xiao F. Zhang X. Miao T. Magoulas C. Subang M.C. Richardson P.M. Exp. Neurol. 2007; 204: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An internal control of 18 S ribosomal RNA (18 S rRNA) was performed alongside the experimental samples. PCR products were run and visualized in 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed according to the protocol of the Qiagen QuantiTect™ SYBR® Green PCR kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) in a Rotor-Gene 3000TM thermocycler (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia). Melting curves were generated after the last extension step to verify the specificity and identity of PCR products. Each sample was tested in triplicate. The expression level of TRPC transcripts was normalized to the expression of 18 S rRNA and expressed as arbitrary units. When measuring 18 S rRNA, the cDNAs were diluted 200-fold due to its abundance. To compare the expression levels between different TRPC subunits, we calculated the absolute copy numbers of TRPC and 18 S rRNA using standard curves generated with PCR products containing the target sequences. Copy numbers of individual TRPC transcripts were then normalized to those of 18 S rRNA (18Kunert-Keil C. Bisping F. Kruger J. Brinkmeier H. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 159Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). DRG Neuron Culture and Transfection—DRG neurons were isolated from female Sprague-Dawley rats (∼250 g) by methods similar to those described previously (19Liu M. Willmott N.J. Michael G.J. Priestley J.V. Neuroscience. 2004; 127: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were killed by inhalation of a rising concentration of CO2 and cervical dislocation. Ganglia from the lumbar level were removed in Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution. DRG neurons were dissociated by incubation in 0.125% collagenase XI (Sigma) at 37 °C for 2 h. The dispersed cells were suspended, seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, and maintained in culture medium containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 1% N-2 supplement, and penicillin/streptomycin in Ham's F-12 basal medium (all regents from Invitrogen). After 24 h, neurons were transfected with TRPC4-specific siRNA (sense TACCAAGAGGTGATGAGGATT and antisense 5′-TCCTCATCACCTCTTGGTATT) with a fluorescein label at the 5′-end and mismatch control RNA duplexes (Block-it; Invitrogen) at the final concentration of 50 nm using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were then maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. TRPC4 sense (5′-GAAGATGGTGACATGTTTCATAATAG), antisense (5′-CTATTATGAAACATGTCACCATCTTC), and scrambled control oligonucleotides containing modified T-phosphorothioate bases were ordered from Invitrogen (20Fatherazi S. Presland R.B. Belton C.M. Goodwin P. Al-Qutub M. Trbic Z. Macdonald G. Schubert M.M. Izutsu K.T. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2007; 453: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A 5′-fluorescein was added to the primers when monitoring the transfection efficiency or examining the possible functional role of TRPC4 in DRG neurons. Freshly dissociated DRG neurons were mixed with oligonucleotide-Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) complexes on ice for 30 min before being plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. The final concentration of each oligonucleotide was 100 nm. Neurons were analyzed 48 h after transfection. To quantify the length of neurites, DRG neurons were fixed 2 days after transfection and immunostained for β-tubulin III (1:1000, Sigma), and the length of the longest neurites of each cell was measured with ImageJ software. Previous studies indicate that a subpopulation of DRG neurons identified by Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 give rise to little neurite outgrowth in normal culture conditions (21Leclere P.G. Norman E. Groutsi F. Coffin R. Mayer U. Pizzey J. Tonge D. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1190-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, we excluded those cells whose longest neurites failed to reach twice the length of the cell bodies. Median lengths and frequency histograms of neurite lengths of ∼100 cells were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry—Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg; Sagatal) and then perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at 12 h, 3 days, or 7 days after left sciatic nerve axotomy. Two rats were used for each time point, and two rats without sciatic nerve lesion were used as control. Cultured DRG neurons and ND7/23 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, for 15 min at room temperature. TRPC4 staining was visualized using the tyramide signal amplification technique. Briefly, sections were labeled with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against TRPC4 (1:1000; Alomone) overnight followed by incubation in donkey anti-rabbit biotin (1:400) for 90 min. Sections were then incubated in avidin-biotin peroxidase complex from an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) for 60 min, followed by incubation in cyanine 3 tyramide solution (1:75; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 7 min. TRPC4 peptide antigen was added to control slides to test the specificity of the primary antibody. Slides were also stained with mouse anti-200-kDa neurofilament (N52 clone, 1:5000; Sigma) and rabbit anti-P2X3 (1:1000; Neuromics) or rabbit anti-CGRP (1:1000) antibodies to visualize distinct DRG subpopulations. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig G (1:400; Jackson Laboratories) and 7-amino-3-methyl-coumarin acetic acid-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig G (1:400; Jackson Laboratories) were added for 2 h following rinses with PBS. All slides were pre-blocked in 10% normal donkey serum containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium azide. Sections were viewed on a Leica epifluorescence microscope (Wetzlar, Germany), and micrographs were taken at ×20 objective magnification. The total number of neurons per section was counted based on Hoechst labeling. Neurons showing TRPC4 immunoreactivity were counted and expressed as a percentage of total DRG neurons or a percentage of a subpopulation such as N52-positive or P2X3-positive neurons. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the numbers of TRPC4-positive cells from 0 to 3 days after nerve injury. For total DRG or TRPC4-immunoreactive cell size distribution, 250 DRG neurons were measured on randomly chosen sections using ImageJ software. Confocal Microscopy—DRG neurons or cell lines with TRPC4 labeling were examined using an upright Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope system (LSM 510) and a ×63 Plan Neofluor oil objective. Cells were scanned for cyanine 3 at 543 nm with an increment of 0.25 μm in the Z plane. Immunoblotting—Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed at 4, 7, or 14 days after left sciatic nerve axotomy. Two rats were used for each time point, and two rats without sciatic nerve lesion were used as control. The left L4 and L5 DRG were collected, cut into pieces using fine scissors, and homogenized in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). For cell line preparations, cells were washed in cold PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Samples were then solubilized by rotation at 4 °C for overnight. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was measured using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), and the lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on 6.5% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blotted with polyclonal rabbit TRPC4 antibody (1:100; Alomone) overnight at 4 °C. Anti-rabbit immunoglobulin horseradish-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used at a final dilution of 1:5000, and the signal was detected with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system. The membranes were subsequently stripped and re-blotted with mouse anti-actin antibody (1:500; Sigma). Protein levels of TRPC4 were determined using ImageJ software and were normalized to corresponding actin levels. TRPC Channels Are Present in Adult Rat Sensory Neurons—First, we used specific primers for rat TRPC1 and TRPC3-TRPC7 to determine whether DRG neurons express TRPC channels. Our RT-PCR analysis showed that variable levels of TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC5, and TRPC6 were expressed in dorsal root ganglia (Fig. 1A). TRPC7 was not detected in three separate tests. Quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed using SYBR® Green, and absolute copy numbers of various TRPC channels were calculated. We found that TRPC4 and TRPC5 appeared to be most abundant, followed by TRPC1 and TRPC3. TRPC6 and TRPC7 mRNAs were at much lower concentrations (Fig. 1B). Next, we examined TRPC4 protein expression in adult rat ganglia using immunohistochemical labeling. TRPC4 immunoreactivity was detected in ∼55% of total DRG neurons as identified by Hoechst staining. Schwann cells and satellite cells were weakly labeled with TRPC4. Staining with N52 and P2X3 or CGRP was used to label large and small neurons associated with myelinated or unmyelinated fibers. Fig. 1C shows representative images of DRG cryosections triple labeled with TRPC4, N52, and P2X3. The combined image shows TRPC4 immunoreactivity in different DRG subpopulations. Quantitative analysis showed that 38 ± 3% (n = 316) of N52-positive neurons were TRPC4-immunoreactive and 75 ± 6% (n = 300) of P2X3-positive neurons were TRPC4-immunoreactive. Approximately 69 ± 5% (n = 258) of CGRP-positive neurons were TRPC4-positive. TRPC4 Transcript Is Increased Following Nerve Injury and db-cAMP Injection—We have previously reported that both sciatic nerve axotomy and db-cAMP microinjection accelerate axonal regeneration after crush injury of the corresponding dorsal spinal nerve root (15Wu D. Zhang Y. Bo X. Huang W. Xiao F. Zhang X. Miao T. Magoulas C. Subang M.C. Richardson P.M. Exp. Neurol. 2007; 204: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here we found that the transcript levels of TRPC4 and TRPC5 were increased to 357 ± 20% (n = 3, p < 0.001) and 186 ± 14% (p < 0.01, n = 3) 2 days after nerve injury. Microinjection of db-cAMP up-regulated TRPC4 to 223 ± 35%, (p < 0.01, n = 3) but had no effect on TRPC5 (107 ± 21%, p > 0.05, n = 3). TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 were not markedly altered following sciatic nerve transection or db-cAMP injection (Fig. 2A). Next, we examined transcript levels of TRPC subunits at days 7 and 14 after a priming lesion in the left sciatic nerve (Fig. 2B). The concentration of TRPC4 transcript peaked at 2 days and fell to 56 ± 5% (n = 3, p < 0.05) and 43 ± 1% (n = 3, p < 0.001) at 7 and 14 days. TRPC5 mRNA was halved at 7 days (79 ± 14%, n = 3, p > 0.05) when compared with that of 2 days but was not further reduced at 14 days (76 ± 11%, n = 3, p > 0.05). Transcripts of TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC6 were not significantly changed from 2 to 7 days after nerve injury. However, TRPC7 mRNA levels were reduced to 70 ± 5% (n = 3, p < 0.01) at 7 days and 38 ± 4% (n = 3, p < 0.001) at 14 days. Thus, nerve injury elicited a transient increase in TRPC4 and a significant reduction in TRPC7. TRPC4 protein was analyzed in L4 and L5 DRG at days 4, 7, and 14 following nerve injury. A single band specific for TRPC4 was detected by rabbit anti-TRPC4 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2C). TRPC4 protein levels were expressed in relation to the loading control of actin using ImageJ analysis. TRPC4 protein was increased by 2.1- and 3-fold at 4 and 7 days and reduced to control level at day 14 after nerve injury. TRPC4 mRNA Is Substantially Increased in Differentiated NDC and ND7/23 Cells—Fig. 3A shows naïve and differentiated ND7/23 cells visualized under phase-contrast illumination. Naïve ND7/23 cells gave rise to short neurites 2 days after plating. In the presence of NGF (100 ng/ml) or db-cAMP (1 mm), cells stopped proliferating and generated long unbranched neurites. RT-PCR analyses were carried out on naïve and differentiated NDC and ND7/23 cells and in naïve and differentiated PC12 cells. Fig. 3B shows representative results from one of three similar experiments. Transcripts for TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5–7 were found in naïve and differentiated NCD cells, whereas transcripts for TRPC3–7 were found in naïve and differentiated ND7/23 cells. A discernible increase in TRPC4 mRNA was observed in differentiated NDC and ND7/23 cells, and a marked reduction in TRPC7 mRNA was observed in differentiated ND7/23 cells. In contrast, transcripts of TRPC1 and TRPC3–7 were found in both naïve and differentiated PC12 cells and no discernible changes were observed. We further quantified changes in TRPC1 and TRPC3–7 transcripts in naïve and differentiated NDC and ND7/23 cells using SYBR Green (Fig. 3C). TRPC4 transcript was increased by ∼10- and 13-fold in NDC cells after stimulation with NGF or db-cAMP for 2 days. An increase in TRPC4 mRNA of ∼3- and 7-fold was observed in differentiated ND7/23 cells. TRPC1 was not detected in ND7/23 cells and not markedly changed in NDC cells. TRPC3 was not detected in NDC cells and moderately increased in ND7/23 cells stimulated with NGF (1.6-fold) or db-cAMP (2.4-fold). A 3-fold increase in TRPC5 mRNA was observed in differentiated NDC cells, but no marked increase was observed in ND7/23 cells. db-cAMP increased the TRPC6 mRNA level by 3.5-fold in NDC cells and 2-fold in ND7/23 cells, whereas NGF did not markedly alter TRPC6 transcript in NDC and ND7/23 cells. A moderate increase of 2-fold was observed in TRPC7 mRNA in NDC cells treated with NGF, but not with db-cAMP. However, NGF and db-cAMP reduced the level of TRPC7 mRNA by ∼80% in ND7/23 cells. TRPC4 Is Present in the Growth Cone of Cultured DRG Neurons—To examine TRPC4 expression during different stages of neurite outgrowth, we fixed DRG neurons at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after plating. Fig. 4 shows confocal microscopic images of outgrowth of neurites at various stages from membrane expansion (Fig. 4A), neurite formation (Fig. 4, B and C), and neurite elongation (Fig. 4, D and E). The neurite process started as a membranous expansion around the soma, evolving into the extension of small sprouts from the membranous expansion and finally elongation into filopodia. Subsequently, some neurites were selected for extension by a mechanism that is not fully understood. We found that membranous expansions and filopodia were positively stained for TRPC4. Longer neurites appeared to be more intensely labeled with TRPC4 than shorter neurites of the same neurons (Fig. 4, D and E), an observation suggesting that TRPC4 was selectively enriched in elongating neurites. TRPC4 immunoreactivity was also found in all naïve and differentiated ND7/23 cells stimulated with db-cAMP (Fig. 4, F and G). TRPC4 staining as irregular punctae was present in the cell membrane, in the cytosol, along the neuronal process, and in finger-like projections characteristic of growth cones. Nerve Injury Increases TRPC4-immunoreactive DRG Neurons—Immunostaining of tissue sections was carried out to determine whether the increased TRPC4 expression observed in DRG after nerve injury occurs in neurons or glia. TRPC4 immunoreactivity increased from ∼50% of DRG neurons to 70% from 12 h to 3 days after sciatic nerve axotomy (p < 0.01, Fig. 5A). Schwann cells weakly express TRPC4; however, the increase in the percentage of TRPC4-positive Schwann cells was negligible (24 versus 25%). To investigate in which subpopulations of DRG neurons TRPC4 immunoreactivity was increased, we compared the total cell size distribution and TRPC4-positive cell size distribution at 1 and 2 h and 3 days after nerve transection (Fig. 5, B and C). Previous studies indicate that cells larger than 1000 μm2 in area correspond to cells with myelinated axons and Aα/β conduction velocities (22Harper A.A. Lawson S.N. J. Physiol. 1985; 359: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Thus, we adopted 1000 μm2 as a cutoff point to distinguish small and large sized neurons. It appears that nerve injury shifted the distribution of TR"
https://openalex.org/W1995218799,"Background A growing tumor in the body can be considered a complex ecological and evolutionary system. A new eco-evolutionary hypothesis (the “Growth Rate Hypothesis”, GRH) proposes that tumors have elevated phosphorus (P) demands due to increased allocation to P-rich nucleic acids, especially ribosomal RNA, to meet the protein synthesis demands of accelerated proliferation. Methodology/Principal Findings We determined the elemental (C, N, P) and nucleic acid contents of paired malignant and normal tissues from colon, lung, liver, or kidney for 121 patients. Consistent with the GRH, lung and colon tumors were significantly higher (by approximately two-fold) in P content (fraction of dry weight) and RNA content and lower in nitrogen (N):P ratio than paired normal tissue, and P in RNA contributed a significantly larger fraction of total biomass P in malignant relative to normal tissues. Furthermore, patient-specific differences for %P between malignant and normal tissues were positively correlated with such differences for %RNA, both for the overall data and within three of the four organ sites. However, significant differences in %P and %RNA between malignant and normal tissues were not seen in liver and kidney and, overall, RNA contributed only ∼11% of total tissue P content. Conclusions/Significance Data for lung and colon tumors provide support for the GRH in human cancer. The two-fold amplification of P content in colon and lung tumors may set the stage for potential P-limitation of their proliferation, as such differences often do for rapidly growing biota in ecosystems. However, data for kidney and liver do not support the GRH. To account for these conflicting observations, we suggest that local environments in some organs select for neoplastic cells bearing mutations increasing cell division rate (“r-selected,” as in colon and lung) while conditions elsewhere may select for reduced mortality rate (“K-selected,” as in liver and kidney)."
https://openalex.org/W2049029830,"Fibers composed of type I collagen triple helices form the organic scaffold of bone and many other tissues, yet the energetically preferred conformation of type I collagen at body temperature is a random coil. In fibers, the triple helix is stabilized by neighbors, but how does it fold? The observations reported here reveal surprising features that may represent a new paradigm for folding of marginally stable proteins. We find that human procollagen triple helix spontaneously folds into its native conformation at 30–34°C but not at higher temperatures, even in an environment emulating Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). ER-like molecular crowding by nonspecific proteins does not affect triple helix folding or aggregation of unfolded chains. Common ER chaperones may prevent aggregation and misfolding of procollagen C-propeptide in their traditional role of binding unfolded polypeptide chains. However, such binding only further destabilizes the triple helix. We argue that folding of the triple helix requires stabilization by preferential binding of chaperones to its folded, native conformation. Based on the triple helix folding temperature measured here and published binding constants, we deduce that HSP47 is likely to do just that. It takes over 20 HSP47 molecules to stabilize a single triple helix at body temperature. The required 50–200 µM concentration of free HSP47 is not unusual for heat-shock chaperones in ER, but it is 100 times higher than used in reported in vitro experiments, which did not reveal such stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2081281465,"Inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) plays a central role in the regulation of vascular function and response to injury. A central mediator controlling iNOS expression is transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which represses its expression through a mechanism that is poorly understood. We have identified a binding site in the iNOS promoter that interacts with the nuclear heterodimer TCF11/MafG using chromatin immunoprecipitation and mutation analyses. We demonstrate that binding at this site acts to repress the induction of iNOS gene expression by cytokines. We show that this repressor is induced by TGF-β1 and by Smad6-short, which enhances TGF-β signaling. In contrast, the up-regulation of TCF11/MafG binding could be suppressed by overexpression of the TGF-β inhibitor Smad7, and a small interfering RNA to TCF11 blocked the suppression of iNOS by TGF-β. The binding of TCF11/MafG to the iNOS promoter could be enhanced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and suppressed by the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine. Moreover, the induction of TCF11/MafG binding by TGF-β and Smad6-short could be blocked by staurosporine, and the effect of TGF-β was blocked by the selective protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C. Consistent with the in vitro data, we found suppression of TCF11 coincident with iNOS up-regulation in a rat model of endotoxemia, and we observed a highly significant negative correlation between TCF11 and nitric oxide production. Furthermore, treatment with activated protein C, a serine protease effective in septic shock, blocked the down-regulation of TCF11 and suppressed endotoxin-induced iNOS. Overall, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which iNOS expression is regulated in the context of inflammatory activation.

Moreover, the induction of TCF11/MafG binding by TGF-β and Smad6-short could be blocked by staurosporine, and the effect of TGF-β was blocked by the selective protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C. Consistent with the in vitro data, we found suppression of TCF11 coincident with iNOS up-regulation in a rat model of endotoxemia, and we observed a highly significant negative correlation between TCF11 and nitric oxide production. Furthermore, treatment with activated protein C, a serine protease effective in septic shock, blocked the down-regulation of TCF11 and suppressed endotoxin-induced iNOS. Overall, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which iNOS expression is regulated in the context of inflammatory activation. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important regulator and mediator of numerous and diverse processes, including vascular function, neurotransmission, tumor biology, and innate immune response (reviewed in Ref. 1Lirk P. Hoffmann G. Rieder J. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm. Allergy. 2002; 1: 89-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).

Shock. 2004; 21: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).During acute inflammatory insult, iNOS is synergistically induced by the TH-1 cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interferon-γ (5Taylor B.S. Alarcon L.H. Billiar T.R. Biochemistry (Mosc. 1998; 63: 766-781PubMed Google Scholar). Following cytokine activation and iNOS induction, vascular smooth muscle cells produces high levels of NO (6Finder J. Stark Jr., W.W. Nakayama D.K. Geller D. Wasserloos K. Pitt B.R. Davies P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L862-L867PubMed Google Scholar). A key factor in controlling iNOS expression is transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which has been shown to suppress the expression of iNOS at the mRNA level in a variety of cells (6Finder J. Stark Jr., W.W. Nakayama D.K. Geller D. Wasserloos K. Pitt B.R. Davies P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L862-L867PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schini V.B. Durante W. Elizondo E. Scott-Burden T. Junquero D.C.

Mosquera J.R. Sanchez de Miguel L. Millas I. de Frutos T. Monton M. Sierra M.P. Riesco A. Casado S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1263-1268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in an endotoxin model of septic shock, TGF-β1 treatment markedly reduced iNOS mRNA in several organs and blocked the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hypotension (10Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M.

A. 1996; 93: 2054-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Although the key factors involved in the induction of iNOS have been defined (reviewed in Ref. 11Vila-Del Sol V. Diaz-Munoz M. Fresno M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2007; 81: 272-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), little is known regarding the suppression of iNOS expression by factors such as TGF-β. In this study, we explored the mechanism by which TGF-β suppresses the expression of iNOS in human smooth muscle cells. We show that the nuclear factor TCF11/MafG interacts with an upstream suppressor element in the iNOS promoter, resulting in the inhibition of cytokine induction of iNOS mRNA. This factor is up-regulated by TGF-β and the agonist Smad6-short but suppressed by Smad7. In a model of endotoxemia, we show a strong negative relationship between TCF11 and iNOS, consistent with the results observed in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activated protein C, an agent effective in model and clinical sepsis, increased TCF11 levels concomitant with a suppression of endotoxin-induced iNOS expression. Overall our data provide new mechanistic understanding of the regulation of iNOS, a key regulatory factor in vascular function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Cell Culture—TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human aortic smooth muscle cells were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and grown as described previously (12Richardson M.A. Berg D.T. Calnek D.S. Ciaccia A.V. Joyce D.E. Grinnell B.W. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3908-3911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of poor transfection of primary smooth muscle cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Clonetics) grown in Clonetics endothelial growth media were used for small interfering (siRNA) experiments. All other reagents were of the highest quality available.DNA Binding Assay—The gene locus containing the Homo sapiens NOS2 gene promoter region was X85759.1. Bioinformatics analysis of the promoter region of iNOS was performed using MatInspector (release 6.2.1) and TRANSFAC Matrix (release 3.3; TFMATRIX version 1.3). For gel shift assay, the oligonucleotide sequence containing the TCF11/MafG site was 5′-CCTACCCAGATGCTGAAAGTGAGGCCATGTGGCTT-3′. Confirmation of the binding was performed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays as follows. The double-stranded probe was γ-32P-labeled, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (13Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions containing Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.125 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), poly(dI·dC), nuclear extract, and labeled oligonucleotide were incubated for 15–45 min and analyzed and quantified by a scanning phosphorimaging device as described previously (13Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, detection was done using fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotides obtained from LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE) that were 5′-end-labeled with IRDye 800 phosphoramidite. Unlabeled synthetic oligonucleotides used for competition studies were obtained from Operon Biotechnologies, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). Binding reaction conditions were 5 fmol/μl labeled oligonucleotide, 4 units/μl poly(dI·dC), and 0.3 μg/μl nuclear extract, and gels were scanned with the LI-COR Odyssey imaging system. Competition reactions contained from 1- to 100-fold molar excess unlabeled oligonucleotides. A mutant oligonucleotide containing changes to the core TGA with CTC binding sequence was used as a control. The TCF11/MafG binding site from the BK virus P2 strain, 5′-CCTAAGTGCATGACTGGGCAGCC AGCCATGGCAG-3′, was used as a control (14Grinnell B.W. Berg D.T. Walls J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and has a perfect core similarity of 1.0 to the consensus sequence. Antibody H-285, which binds to the leucine zipper of TCF11 (catalog no. sc-13031, anti-peptide 682–704, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), was included in some experiments to inhibit the heterodimerization required for binding.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to evaluate the association of TCF11 with its DNA binding site using a ChIP assay kit from Upstate (catalog no. 17-295-290, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in growth medium for 8 min at 37 °C and rinsed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. Chromatin from the cross-linked cells was sheared by sonication with three 15-s pulses at one-third power and then incubated overnight with a TCF11-specific antibody (catalog no. sc-721, Nrf1C19) or anti-Maf antibody (catalog no. sc-479, C20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Antibody-chromatin complexes were immunoprecipitated using protein G-Sepharose saturated with salmon sperm DNA. Precipitated DNA-antibody complexes were first prepared using a Qiagen PCR purification kit (catalog no. 28106) and then analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using the ABI 7900 HT sequence detection system. The following primers and probe specific for the TCF11 binding site in the iNOS promoter region were used for TaqMan analysis: forward primer, 5′-GAGCTCCCTGCTGAGGAAAA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAAGCCACATGGCCTCACTT-3′; and probe, 5′-ATCTCCCAGATGCTG-3′. siRNA Inhibition of TCF11-TCF11 siRNA Transfection of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells—Cells were seeded at 105 cells/well in 6-well collagen-coated plates (BD Biosciences) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h. Following the incubation the monolayers were transfected with siRNA for TCF11, ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool human NFE2L1 or ON-TARGETplus siCONTROL (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) with Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h. The medium was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml/well serum-free medium, 100 μg/ml bovine albumin fraction V (Invitrogen), insulin/transferrin/selenium supplement (Invitrogen), 20 mm HEPES (Invitrogen), and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen) ±1 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R&D Systems), and after 4 h a cytokine mixture was added to each well for a final concentration of 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α, 10 ng/ml interleukin-1β, and 25 ng/ml interferon-γ (all R&D Systems). After 24 h, the conditioned medium was assayed for iNOS expression by NO generation as described previously (17Gupta A. Sharma A.C. Shock. 2003; 20: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Analysis of iNOS Expression—The level of iNOS mRNA in human smooth muscle cells was determined by ribonuclease protection assay as described previously (15Calnek D. Grinnell B. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The iNOS riboprobe was prepared from a PstI/EcoRV restriction digest of the cDNA for iNOS, yielding a 393-nucleotide protect fragment. As a control, an actin antisense riboprobe was synthesized from the TR1-β-actin-125 human template. Both the iNOS and actin mRNA levels were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics 445SI PhosphorImager.Multimers of the TCF11/MafG binding site and of a mutated site converting the TGA sequence to CTC were cloned into plasmid pAT153 as described previously (13Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate plasmids pTCF-BS, containing the intact binding site, and pTCD-mBS, containing the mutant binding site. Cells were transfected with these decoy plasmids as described previously (13Reifel-Miller A.E. Berg D.T. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the level of iNOS mRNA was determined as above.In some experiments, a control pCIneo vector (Promega, Madison, WI) or the expression vectors for Smad6-short and Smad7 (16Berg D.T. Myers L.J. Richardson M.A. Sandusky G. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14943-14947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were transfected into cells with Lipofectin, and the level of TCF11/MafG binding was determined in cell lysates 24 h later. The effect of TGF-β (1 ng/ml) on TCF11/MafG levels was determined 24 h after addition to the maintenance medium.Analysis of TCF11 and iNOS in Rat Endotoxemia—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan) weighing 350–400 g were used in the study. Endotoxemia was induced by administration of Escherichia coli LPS (10 mg/kg, intravenous infusion for 30 min; lipopolysaccharide W E. coli 0127:B8; Sigma) using a jugular vein catheter. The control group received a pyrogen-free saline infusion (1 ml/kg, infusion for 30 min). In the activated protein C-treated groups, activated protein C (100 μg/kg, bolus) was administered 30 min prior to the administration of LPS and saline in the respective groups. All experimental methods were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with the institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.Total RNA was purified from rat kidney using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA integrity was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Purified total RNA was used to synthesize first strand cDNA and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR with an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system using an iNOS assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). An internal standard curve was generated by serial dilution of an appropriate cDNA reaction and used for relative quantification. The 18 S rRNA eukaryotic endogenous control kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to normalize iNOS levels.Protein lysates were made from the rat kidney tissues using tissue protein extraction reagent. The lysates were quantified by Pierce BCA, and 17 μg of lysate were loaded on a NuPAGE 4–12% bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride. The anti-TCF11 primary antibody H-285 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The secondary antibody was a biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories BA-1000). Western blots were developed using Pierce Super-Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate. Blots were stripped using Restore Western blot stripping buffer and rehybridized using an anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for normalization. The secondary antibody was a biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories BA-9200). The films were quantified using Silk Scientific Un-Scan-It software.The concentration of NO byproducts NOx (nitrate + nitrite) was determined as described previously (17Gupta A. Sharma A.C. Shock. 2003; 20: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Tissue was homogenized with cold phosphate-buffered saline on ice; the homogenate was centrifuged (3000 × g, 5 min, Beckman); and the supernatant was collected. The NOx concentration was then determined in the supernatant using the standard Griess reaction method.Statistical Analyses—Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and analysis of covariance using JMP5.1 software (SAS Institute). After obtaining a significant F value, post hoc Student's t test was performed for inter- and intra-group comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSTranscription Factor TCF11/MafG Binds to the iNOS Promoter Region—To explore the factors that might contribute to negative regulation of iNOS, we examined nuclear factor binding sites in the promoter. We identified the sequence 5′-334TGCTGAAAGTGAG332-3′ as containing homologies to an NF-E2-like site, with TGCTG and CTCAC (reverse strand) being homologous to the T-mare and AP-1 half-sites, respectively, and interacting with nuclear factor TCF11/Maf heterodimers (18Johnsen O. Skammelsrud N. Luna L. Nishizawa M. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4289-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Johnsen O. Murphy P. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Using a DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we assessed nuclear factor binding to this iNOS promoter sequence and observed a major band (Fig. 1A, lane 1) that could be competed with a cold probe for the iNOS binding site (lane 2). To determine whether this site interacted with the TCF11/MafG heterodimer, we performed competition with a TCF11/MafG binding sequence described previously as a transcriptional repressor from BK virus (14Grinnell B.W. Berg D.T. Walls J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the iNOS binding site was completely competed with a probe for the TCF11/MafG binding site (lane 3) but not by a mutant site (lane 4). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TCF11/MafG mutant probe could not compete with the TCF11/MafG wild type probe for TCF11/MafG binding (lane 7).As further confirmation, we utilized an anti-TCF11 antibody against the C-terminal leucine zipper region, i.e. the heterodimerization domain for TCF11/MafG (19Johnsen O. Murphy P. Prydz H. Kolsto A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and we observed significant inhibition of DNA binding (Fig. 1C).A ChIP assay was used to evaluate the association of TCF11 with the iNOS promoter in cells using both anti-TCF11 and anti-Maf antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2A, we were able to detect significant association of TCF11 with the iNOS binding site. As the data in Fig. 1C suggested that TCF11 was binding with its heterodimerization partner, MafG, we would expect to detect interaction with an anti-Maf antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, this was observed. There was no difference in ChiP assays between no-antibody controls and nonbinding isotype antibody controls.FIGURE 2Analysis of TCF11/MafG binding to the iNOS promoter by ChIP assay. A, determination of binding of TCF11 to the –344 to –309 region in the iNOS promoter using an antibody to TCF11. The values represent the percent of signal from the input DNA using quantitative real-time PCR.

Calnek D. Grinnell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15447-15450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the level of iNOS mRNA significantly increased in the presence of the transfected decoy vector but not in the presence of a decoy vector with the mutation in the TCF11/MafG binding site that could not compete at the iNOS site. As competition for the native binding sequence resulted in an increase in iNOS mRNA expression, the data suggest that TCF11/MafG binding is a negative regulator of iNOS.FIGURE 3Level of iNOS gene expression in cells transfected with decoy TCF11/MafG sites or mutated TCF11/MafG sites. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of control plasmid/106 cells, pTCF-BS containing multimers of the intact TCF11/MafG site, and pTCF-mBS containing multimers of the mutated binding site. After 96 h, cells were harvested, and iNOS and control actin mRNA levels were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inset shows ribonuclease protection assay of the level of iNOS mRNA in cells transfected with the control and pTCF-BS vectors. The data are the mean ± S.E. (n = six transfection experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TGF-β1 Induces TCF11/MafG Binding to the iNOS Promoter in a Smad-dependent Manner—The level of iNOS expression was determined in human smooth muscle cells following induction by a cytokine mixture as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The level of iNOS mRNA was significantly induced by the cytokine mixture treatment but blocked by the treatment of cells with TGF-β1 (data not shown). This inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 was concentration-dependent, resulting in inhibition of both mRNA (data not shown) and protein levels, consistent with the previous reports described above.To determine whether the ability of TGF-β to inhibit iNOS expression might be related to the negative regulation through TCF11/MafG, we determined if TGF-β could increase binding of this factor to the iNOS promoter element. As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment of cells with TGF-β resulted in a significant increase in binding to the TCF11/MafG site, which could be competed with the cold binding site. Previous studies have shown that Smad6-short and Smad7 can agonize and antagonize TGF-β signaling in vascular cells, respectively (16Berg D.T. Myers L.J. Richardson M.A. Sandusky G. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14943-14947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Smad6-short, which enhances TGF-β signaling, resulted in an increase in TCF11/MafG binding (Fig. 4B). In contrast, overexpression of Smad7, the negative regulator of TGF signaling, blocked the induction by Smad6-short. As expected, the overexpression of Smad7 alone, in the absence of induction, had no effect. Taken together, the above data suggest that TGF-β induces TCF11/MafG binding in a Smad-dependent manner, thereby suppressing iNOS expression.FIGURE 4Effect of TGF-β1 on TCF11/MafG binding. A, effect of TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) on the level of TCF11/MafG binding in the presence and absence of the cold competitor (Comp) binding site as described in the legend to Fig. 1. B, effect of overexpression of Smad6-short and Smad7 on TCF11/MafG binding. Cells were transfected with the control vector or with expression vectors pSmad6, pSmad7, or the combination, and after 24 h the level of TCF11/MafG binding was determined and quantified as described above. Data are the mean ± S.D. (n = 3). NS, not significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Knockdown of TCF11 Blocks the TGF-β-dependent Suppression of iNOS—To confirm the dependence of TCF11 in the negative regulation of iNOS by TGF-β, we utilized an siRNA to inhibit its expression and examined TGF-β-dependent iNOS regulation. As shown in Fig. 5, the level of iNOS induction, as measured by NO production, was increased by the cytokine mixture and, as expected, completely suppressed by TGF-β1. However, in cells pretreated with siRNA to TCF11 for 48 h to reduce TCF11 levels, we observed a complete block in ability of TGF-β to inhibit iNOS expression. These data strongly suggest that the negative regulation of iNOS by TGF-β is dependent on TCF11.FIGURE 5Effect of siRNA inhibition of TCF11 on the negative regulation of iNOS by TGFβ. Cells were treated with a cytokine mixture (CM; 10 ng/ml interleukin-1β, 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α, and 25 ng/ml interferon-γ), cytokine mixture plus TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml), or cytokine mixture plus TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) in cells pretreated for 48 h with an siRNA to TCF11 or a control nonspecific siRNA. A, the effect of siRNA to TCF11 on the TCF11 mRNA expression level was determined by TaqMan. B, the level of iNOS expression was determined by NOx as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are the mean ± S.E.

Previous studies have demonstrated that activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway can negatively regulate iNOS gene expression (22Geng Y. Wu Q. Hansson G. Biochim. Biophys.

Moreover, studies have shown that TGF-β can mediate its effects via PKC pathway activation (24Lim J. Park S. Hwang H. Park E. Nam J. Kim J. Park S. J. Mol. Cell.

To determine whether PKC might play a role in our observations, we examined the effect of its activation and inhibition on the TCF11/MafG DNA binding. As shown in Fig. 6A, activation of PKC with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in a 3-fold induction of TCF11/MafG binding. Treatment of cells with staurosporine (ST) at concentrations known to inhibit PKC resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of basal TCF11/MafG binding (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the increase in TCF11/MafG binding following activation of the PKC pathway with PMA could be completely inhibited by treatment with ST (Fig. 6B). Moreover, we examined the effect of ST on TGF-β induction of TC"
https://openalex.org/W1982731945,"Energy conservation directed at accelerating body fat recovery (or catch-up fat) contributes to obesity relapse after slimming and to excess fat gain during catch-up growth after malnutrition. To investigate the mechanisms underlying such thrifty metabolism for catch-up fat, we tested whether during refeeding after caloric restriction rats exhibiting catch-up fat driven by suppressed thermogenesis have diminished skeletal muscle phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) activity or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling-two pathways required for hormone-induced thermogenesis in ex vivo muscle preparations. The results show that during isocaloric refeeding with a low-fat diet, at time points when body fat, circulating free fatty acids, and intramyocellular lipids in refed animals do not exceed those of controls, muscle insulin receptor substrate 1-associated PI3K activity (basal and in vivo insulin-stimulated) is lower than that in controls. Isocaloric refeeding with a high-fat diet, which exacerbates the suppression of thermogenesis, results in further reductions in muscle PI3K activity and in impaired AMPK phosphorylation (basal and in vivo leptin-stimulated). It is proposed that reduced skeletal muscle PI3K/AMPK signaling and suppressed thermogenesis are interdependent. Defective PI3K or AMPK signaling will reduce the rate of substrate cycling between de novo lipogenesis and lipid oxidation, leading to suppressed thermogenesis, which accelerates body fat recovery and furthermore sensitizes skeletal muscle to dietary fat-induced impairments in PI3K/AMPK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2007034352,"Curacin A is a mixed polyketide/nonribosomal peptide possessing anti-mitotic and anti-proliferative activity. In the biosynthesis of curacin A, the N-terminal domain of the CurF multifunctional protein catalyzes decarboxylation of 3-methylglutaconyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) to 3-methylcrotonyl-ACP, the postulated precursor of the cyclopropane ring of curacin A. This decarboxylase is encoded within an “HCS cassette” that is used by several other polyketide biosynthetic systems to generate chemical diversity by introduction of a β-branch functional group to the natural product. The crystal structure of the CurF N-terminal ECH2 domain establishes that the protein is a crotonase superfamily member. Ala78 and Gly118 form an oxyanion hole in the active site that includes only three polar side chains as potential catalytic residues. Site-directed mutagenesis and a biochemical assay established critical functions for His240 and Lys86, whereas Tyr82 was nonessential. A decarboxylation mechanism is proposed in which His240 serves to stabilize the substrate carboxylate and Lys86 donates a proton to C-4 of the acyl-ACP enolate intermediate to form the Δ2 unsaturated isopentenoyl-ACP product. The CurF ECH2 domain showed a 20-fold selectivity for ACP-over CoA-linked substrates. Specificity for ACP-linked substrates has not been reported for any other crotonase superfamily decarboxylase. Tyr73 may select against CoA-linked substrates by blocking a contact of Arg38 with the CoA adenosine 5′-phosphate.

Polyketides and nonribosomal peptides are important secondary metabolites possessing an array of biological activities and broad chemical diversity (1Hill A.M. Nat. Prod.

The biosynthetic machinery generates tremendous structural variation in these compounds by use of specific reductive domain combinations within modules and/or gene cassettes that encode proteins capable of producing unique functionalities. The natural product curacin A is a mixed polyketide/nonribosomal peptide produced by the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. Curacin A contains a unique combination of functionalities, including a cyclopropyl ring, a cis-vinyl thiazoline heterocycle, and a terminal alkene (Fig. 1A). Curacin A was first shown in 1994 to possess anti-mitotic activity by the inhibition of tubulin polymerization, cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition, and anti-proliferative activity against colon, renal, and breast cancer-derived cell lines (5Gerwick W.H. Proteau P.J. Nagle D.G. Hamel E. Blokhin A. Slate D.L. J. Org. Chem. 1994; 59: 1243-1245Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Further studies have demonstrated rapid, essentially irreversible binding of curacin A to tubulin with potent inhibition of colchicine binding (6Verdier-Pinard P. Sitachitta N. Rossi J.V. Sackett D.L. Gerwick W.H. Hamel E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The biosynthetic gene cluster (cur) for curacin A was recently identified and characterized, revealing that the metabolite is generated by a hybrid type I PKS/NRPS (7Chang Z. Sitachitta N. Rossi J.V. Roberts M.A. Flatt P.M. Jia J. Sherman D.H. Gerwick W.H. J. Nat. Prod. 2004; 67: 1356-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The first six genes in the cur cluster (curA-curF) have been implicated in the formation of the cyclopropyl ring as well as the thiazoline ring of curacin A. Genes within this region include an “HCS cassette” that encodes an acyl carrier protein (ACP) (CurB), a putative ketosynthase (CurC), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase (HCS) (CurD), and two domains containing similarity to enoyl-CoA hydratases (CurE (ECH1) and the N-terminal ∼260 residues of CurF (ECH2)) (Fig. 2). HCS cassettes are important sources of β-branches in polyketides and allow for the generation of wide chemical diversity at the branch point (Fig. 1). Among the functional groups generated are the cyclopropyl ring of curacin A (7Chang Z. Sitachitta N. Rossi J.V. Roberts M.A. Flatt P.M. Jia J. Sherman D.H. Gerwick W.H. J. Nat.

Subsets of the HCS-containing gene cassette are found in gene clusters that specify production of the bryostatins (17Sudek S. Lopanik N.B. Waggoner L.E. Hildebrand M. Anderson C. Liu H. Patel A.

Recently, the unique catalytic activities of CurE ECH1 and the CurF ECH2 domain have been ascertained (8Gu L.C. Jia J.Y. Liu H.C. Hakansson K. Gerwick W.H. Sherman D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 9014-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). CurE ECH1 catalyzes conversion of (S)-HMG-ACP to 3-methylglutaconyl-ACP. Subsequently, the N-terminal ECH2 domain of CurF catalyzes decarboxylation to 3-methylcrotonyl-ACP, the postulated precursor of the cyclopropane ring of curacin A (Fig. 1A). The analogous activities of two other ECH1/ECH2-like enzyme pairs was demonstrated for the HCS cassettes of myxovirescin A and bacillaene (11Calderone C.T. Iwig D.F. Dorrestein P.C. Kelleher N.L.

Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8977-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Based on the structures of pathway end products, decarboxylation by ECH2-type enzymes are postulated to be followed by proton donation at C-4 leading to a Δ2 unsaturated product in curacin A, bacillaene, virginiamycin M, mupirocin, or myxovirescin A or at C-2 leading to a Δ3 unsaturated product in jamaicamide and pederin (Fig. 1). Thus, ECH2 represents a critical point of divergence for the generation of correct downstream functionalities in the corresponding natural product. Understanding how these enzymes control product double bond regiochemistry will facilitate the prediction of enzymatic activity for this class of enzymes, as well as aid protein engineering attempts to tailor chemistry for the production of novel natural products. Enoyl-CoA hydratases belong to the crotonase superfamily, consisting of a wide variety of mechanistically diverse enzymes that exhibit various activities, such as hydratase (19Engel C.K. Mathieu M.

Because of this catalytic diversity, the low sequence identity superfamily lacks an invariant catalytic residue, and superfamily membership is established through crystal structures. The common mechanistic theme of the superfamily is the stabilization of an enolate anion intermediate of phosphopantetheine-linked substrates by two backbone amide groups forming an oxyanion hole (29Holden H.M. Benning M.M. Haller T. Gerlt J.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). CurF ECH2 has less than 20% sequence identity to identified members of the superfamily. A unique feature of the ECH2-like enzymes involved in natural product biosynthesis is that they are thought to depend exclusively on ACP-linked substrates in vivo. Structural clues that enable these enzymes to discriminate between CoA and ACP-linked substrates will increase our understanding of the evolutionary changes that have occurred to favor one substrate over another, as well as to control functional group diversity in the final natural product. In this paper we report the 1.85 Å crystal structure of the wild type, N-terminal ECH2 domain of CurF and the 1.65 Å structure of the corresponding Y82F variant. Modeling of the substrate of CurF ECH2 was performed, and Tyr82, Lys86, and His240 were identified as potential catalytic or substrate-binding residues. Site-directed mutagenesis in a coupled ECH1/ECH2 dehydration/decarboxylation assay with ACP-linked substrates demonstrated that CurF ECH2 His240 and Lys86 are critical to catalysis. Finally, we demonstrated that the 3-methylglutaconyl-ACP substrate is preferred over 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA, a preference that may be controlled by a conserved bulky amino acid residue in the HCS cassette class of decarboxylases. Cloning, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Protein Expression—The plasmid pMCSG7::CurFd17 was generated by PCR amplification of coding sequence corresponding to residues 17-257 of CurF from the pML9 cosmid DNA (7Chang Z. Sitachitta N. Rossi J.V. Roberts M.A. Flatt P.M. Jia J. Sherman D.H. Gerwick W.H. J. Nat.

Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The plasmid pMCSG7::CurFd17 was transformed into BL21(DE3) and grown at 37 °C in 2×YT medium to an A600 of 0.6-0.8 in 2L baffle flasks. The cultures were adjusted to 18 °C, and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to final concentration of 0.4 mm and allowed to grow 8-16 h with shaking. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell pellets were frozen immediately at -20 °C. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was produced in BL21(DE3) using selenomethionine minimal medium according to the protocol of Guerrero et al. (31Guerrero S.A. Hecht H.J. Hofmann B. Biebl H. Singh M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the QuikChange method (Stratagene) (see supplemental materials). All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. CurA (2057-2146)-ACP(II) with a C-terminal His6 tag was constructed by inserting synthetic DNA (a kind gift from Christopher Calderone and Christopher T. Walsh, Harvard Medical School) into pET29a using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. Protein overexpression and purification of CurA-ACP(II) were performed as described previously for CurB (8Gu L.C.

Protein Purification—All of the steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell pellet from 1 liter of culture was resuspended in 35 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole). Cellytic Express (200-300 mg) was added prior to lysis by sonication (Sigma-Aldrich). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at >38,000 × g for 45 min. Supernatant was filtered by a 0.45-μm filter, loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap (GE Healthcare) nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column, and washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A. The protein was eluted with ∼200 mm imidazole by a linear gradient of buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 750 mm imidazole). For His tag removal, the fractions were pooled, and buffer was exchanged with buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at 4 °C for 24-72 h with 2% (w/w) His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease. The reaction mixture was reloaded onto the HisTrap column, and flow-through fractions were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The fractions were then combined, concentrated to 20 mg/ml, and either flash frozen in liquid N2 or stored at 4 °C. Crystallization—The crystals were grown in 24-72 h at 4 °C by microseeding in hanging drops using the vapor diffusion method. Equal volumes were mixed of protein solution and mother liquor containing 1.3-1.8 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, and 0-25 mm 2-ethanamidoethyl 3-methylbut-2-enethioate. The crystals were harvested in loops and directly frozen by plunging into liquid N2. Both trigonal (P321) and rhombohedral (R32) crystals grew in the above crystallization condition from the same seed stock. Data Collection and Structure Determination—The diffraction data were collected at 100 K on GM/CA-CAT beamlines 23ID-B and 23ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source in the Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). The data were processed using the HKL2000 suite (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Initial phasing was performed using a three-wavelength multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data set from a single trigonal wild type selenomethionine-labeled protein crystal. SOLVE was used to find the four selenium sites (average figure of merit (FOM) = 0.47, score = 25.07) and for multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing (overall FOM = 0.57) (33Terwilliger T.C.

The reactions were terminated by 10% formic acid immediately before loading the reaction mixture on the Jupiter C4 (5 μ, 300 A) reverse phase column (Phenomenex), and the proteins were eluted with CH3CN (0.05% HCOOH and 0.05% CF3COOH)/H2O (0.05% HCOOH and 0.05%CF3COOH). The chromatogram peaks were normalized by 32 Karat software (Beckman Coulter) and subjected to base-line subtraction before peak area calculations. Preparation of 3-Methylglutaconyl-CoA and ACP—To separate the dehydration and decarboxylation steps catalyzed by ECH1 and ECH2, 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA was prepared by enzymatic dehydration of (R,S)-HMG-CoA. (R,S)-HMG-CoA was incubated with ECH1 at 37 °C for 5 h, and the dehydration product was isolated using XBridge Prep C18 column (Waters, 10 × 250 mm, 5 μm) under the similar HPLC conditions reported (8Gu L.C.

The fractions were pooled and lyophilized. ∼0.5 mg of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA was generated from 6 mg of (R,S)-HMG-CoA. 3-Methylglutaconyl-ACP was prepared with the Sfp protocol (8Gu L.C. Jia J.Y. Liu H.C. Hakansson K. Gerwick W.H. Sherman D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 9014-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). ECH1 and ECH2 Assays for ACP and CoA Substrates—(R,S)-HMG-CoA/ACP and 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA/ACP were employed to test the ECH1 and ECH2 activities. 2 μm ECH1 or ECH2 was incubated with 50 μm ACP or CoA substrates in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 1 h. The CoA samples were analyzed by XBridge Prep C18 column (Waters, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) and eluted with MeOH/H2O (10 mm CH3COONH4), and ACP samples were analyzed by Jupiter C4 column and eluted with CH3CN (0.05% HCOOH and 0.05% CF3COOH)/H2O (0.05% HCOOH and 0.05% CF3COOH). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Multiply protonated CurA-ACP(II) with or without treatment with ECH1 and/or ECH2 was generated by electrospray ionization (ESI) at 70 μl/h (Apollo ion source; Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) of a solution containing 2 μm CurA-ACP(II) (55:45 CH3CN:H2O with 0.05% HCOOH and 0.05% CF3COOH). All of the mass spectra were collected with an actively shielded 7 Tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer with a quadrupole front end (APEX-Q, Bruker Daltonics). Ions produced by ESI were externally accumulated in a hexapole for 1 s, transferred via high voltage ion optics, and captured in an ICR cell by gated trapping. This accumulation sequence was looped six times. The ESI capillary voltage was set to -3.8 kV. Nitrogen drying gas (200-250 °C) was employed to assist desolvation of ESI droplets. All of the data were acquired with XMASS software (version 6.1; Bruker Daltonics) in broadband mode from m/z = 200-2000 with 512,000 data points and summed over 10 scans. The mass spectra were analyzed with MIDAS analysis software (49Senko M.W. Canterbury J.D. Guan S.H. Marshall A.G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1839-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—Initial crystal screening with a polypeptide including residues 1-257 of CurF produced crystals that diffracted to only ∼3.8 Å, but an N-terminal truncation including residues 17-257 yielded crystals that diffracted to beyond 2 Å. The structure was solved by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using selenomethionyl CurF ECH2 (Table 1). The resulting model was refined against the 2.0 Å data set in crystal form I and used to solve the structures by molecular replacement in crystal form II (Table 2).TABLE 1Data collectionParameterCrystal form ICrystal form IISelenomethionine wild typePeakInflectionRemoteSelenomethionine wild typeY82FSpace groupP321P321P321P321R32R32Dimensions (Å) a, c105.4, 46.3105.6, 46.1105.7, 46.1105.8, 46.2106.2, 118.5106.1, 119.5X-ray source23ID-B23ID-B23ID-B23ID-B23ID-D23ID-DWavelength λ (Å)1.03320.979420.979560.953731.03321.0332dmin (Å)2.02.302.402.301.851.65Unique observations20,39013,39411,84213,37922,40231,221Rmerge(%)aThe values in parentheses are for the outer shell.,bRmerge = ∑|Ii − <I>|/∑Ii, where Ii is the intensity of the ith observation, and <I> is the mean intensity.6.3 (68)10.1 (66)10.2 (71)8.8 (67)7.2 (57)6.1 (61)<I/σ>aThe values in parentheses are for the outer shell.36.2 (3.6)18.3 (2.9)18.4 (2.7)18.9 (2.3)27.7 (4.3)34.7 (3.7)Completeness (%)aThe values in parentheses are for the outer shell.99.9 (100)100 (100)100 (100)100 (100)100 (100)99.9 (100)Average redundancyaThe values in parentheses are for the outer shell.11.0 (10.4)5.9 (5.8)5.9 (5.8)5.9 (5.6)11.0 (10.3)10.9 (9.6)a The values in parentheses are for the outer shell.b Rmerge = ∑|Ii − <I>|/∑Ii, where Ii is the intensity of the ith observation, and <I> is the mean intensity.

https://openalex.org/W1993029728,"ZO-1 is a multidomain protein involved in cell-cell junctions and contains three PDZ domains, which are necessary for its function in vivo. PDZ domains play a central role in assembling diverse protein complexes through their ability to recognize short peptide motifs on other proteins. We determined the structure of the second of the three PDZ domains of ZO-1, which is known to promote dimerization as well as bind to C-terminal sequences on connexins. The dimer is stabilized by extensive symmetrical domain swapping of beta-strands, which is unlike any other known mechanism of PDZ dimerization. The canonical peptide-binding groove remains intact in both subunits of the PDZ2 dimer and is created by elements contributed from both monomers. This unique structure reveals an additional example of how PDZ domains dimerize and has multiple implications for both peptide binding and oligomerization in vivo."

Serine/threonine kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B, plays important roles in cellular processes such as cell growth, metabolism, proliferation, and survival (1Brazil D.P. Yang Z.Z.

Following production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate at the plasma membrane, Akt is recruited to the membrane from the cytosol, through specific binding of the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain to these 3′ phosphoinositides (4Andjelkovic M.

Two phosphorylation events following translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane have been shown to be critical, leading to the full activation of Akt (6Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P.

Phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1 is known to phosphorylate Akt at threonine 308 (Thr308 in Akt-1) in the activation loop of the catalytic/kinase domain (7Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), some important steps in the activation process are still not clearly understood. Specifically, the mechanism by which active Akt molecules dissociate from the membrane remains to be elucidated (11Astoul E. Watton S. Cantrell D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Such membrane dissociation is critical for Akt to gain access to various substrates in different subcellular locations by translocating to cytosol and nucleus (4Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R.

Borgatti P. Capitani S. Martelli A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that nuclear Akt activity accumulates, whereas there are still high levels of 3′ phosphoinositides present at the plasma membrane, suggesting departure of Akt from the membrane occurs prior to massive degradation of 3′ phosphoinositides (13Ananthanarayanan B. Ni Q. Zhang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15081-15086Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that a conformational change generated within Akt during its activation facilitates its dissociation from the membrane despite the presence of high levels of 3′ phosphoinositides. Here we employed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based fluorescence imaging to reveal the conformational changes within full-length Akt and further utilized fluorescence-based membrane recruitment assay to evaluate its membrane association. Taking advantage of the availability of known mutations that affect phosphoinositide binding and individual phosphorylation events of Akt, we set out to investigate the conformational changes and functional effects associated with critical phosphorylation events in Akt activation. ReAktion and Mutant Construction—The cDNA of enhanced cyan fluorescent protein and citrine were fused to human Akt-1/protein kinase B-α by PCR with SphI and BglII incorporated at the 5′ and 3′ ends of Akt-1 and subcloned into a modified pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). All of the point mutations were generated by either QuikChange method (Stratagene) or overlap extension PCR. For plasma membrane targeting, GCIKSKRKD was added to the N terminus. The plasma membrane-targeted (pm) catalytic domain (residues 117-480) and the PH domain (residues 1-116) were cloned by PCR, and the HA tag was fused to the PH domain. Cell Culture and Imaging—HEK-293, NIH3T3 cells were plated onto sterilized glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes and grown to 30-90% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2). The cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or calcium phosphate. For live-cell imaging, the cells were maintained in buffer in the dark at room temperature and imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m microscope with a cooled charge-coupled device camera MicroMAX BFT512 (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) controlled by METAFLUOR 6.2 software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA) as described before (13Ananthanarayanan B. Ni Q. Zhang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15081-15086Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, dual emission ratio imaging used a 420DF20 excitation filter, a 450DRLP dichroic mirror, and two emission filters (475DF40 for CFP and 535DF25 for YFP) alternated by a filter changer Lambda 10-2 (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Fluorescence images were background-corrected by subtracting autofluorescence intensity of untransfected cells (or background with no cells) from the emission intensities of cells expressing fluorescent reporters. The ratios of yellow-to-cyan emissions were then calculated at different time points. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—The cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration in the lysate was determined using BCA protein quantitation assay (Pierce). For Western blotting, 10-30 μg of total protein were solubilized in SDS sample buffer by boiling and fractionated in a polyacrylamide gel. Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to primary and secondary antibody incubation. Antibodies used in Western blotting were anti-Akt, anti-Thr(P)308 (Cell Signaling Technology), and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Pierce). The membranes were developed using horseradish peroxidase-based chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For co-immunoprecipitation, 100-200 μg of lysate was immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) or an anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4 °C, and the resulting immune complexes were captured by incubating with protein A/G beads for 3 h (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following three washes with RIPA, the beads were dissolved in Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and probed with anti-Akt, anti-Thr(P)308, or anti-HA antibodies, respectively. Reporter for Akt Action (ReAktion) Reports Akt Translocation and Conformational Change—To detect the conformational change within full-length Akt in living cells, we constructed a FRET-based reporter of Akt action (ReAktion), where full-length Akt-1 is fused to donor CFP at the N terminus and acceptor YFP at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). When ReAktion was expressed in NIH3T3 cells, uniform distribution of fluorescence was observed (Fig. 1B, first panel), and no proteolysis was detected (Fig. 1C). Stimulation of endogenous PDGF receptor resulted in the translocation of ReAktion to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B, second panel), similarly to endogenous Akt detected by immunofluorescence (not shown). In addition, ReAktion generated an increase in the ratio of yellow-to-cyan emissions (Fig. 1D), which was detectable within several seconds and reached a plateau of 5.5 ± 1.7% (average ± S.D.) (n = 8) within 3-4 min (t½ = 1.65 ± 0.09 min) (Fig. 1E). To verify that the FRET response and the translocation event were dependent on PI3K activity, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was added after the response reached a plateau. LY294002 indeed reversed the FRET response (Fig. 1F) as the levels of 3′ phosphoinositides decreased (13Ananthanarayanan B. Ni Q. Zhang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15081-15086Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of ReAktion also returned to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B, third panel). Hence, ReAktion was capable of displaying the same characteristics of Akt upon upstream PI3K activation, consistent with previous observations that tagging Akt at both termini does not change its translocation or phosphorylation (14Calleja V. Ameer-Beg S.M. Vojnovic B. Woscholski R. Downward J. Larijani B. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Calleja V. Alcor D. Laguerre M. Park J. Vojnovic B. Hemmings B.A. Downward J. Parker P.J. Larijani B. PLoS. Biol. 2007; 5: e95Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition to the translocation event, a change in FRET between two fluorophores flanking the full-length Akt was also observed, indicating a conformational change within Akt during its activation. Previous studies showed that the PH domain is responsible for binding to 3′ phosphoinositides, thus driving Akt to the membrane (4Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 10Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We therefore constructed a PH domain deletion mutant of ReAktion, ΔPH-ReAktion, and the R23A/R25A ReAktion construct where two key residues involved in binding to anionic lipid head-group (16Thomas C.C. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) were mutated to alanines. Both constructs showed neither translocation nor a FRET change (Fig. 1, G and H), indicating that phosphoinositide binding by the PH domain, as the first step during Akt activation, is required for conferring the conformational change associated with this activation process. The two events observed during Akt activation, translocation, and conformation change can be separated by taking advantage of the targetability of FRET-based reporters. ReAktion was targeted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B) by attaching an N-terminal Lyn targeting sequence (Fig. 2A). This construct, plasma membrane-targeted ReAktion (pm ReAktion), upon PDGF stimulation showed an increase in emission ratio (yellow-to-cyan) of 7.1 ± 3.1% (n = 4), which could be reversed by LY294002 (Fig. 2, B and C and Table 1). Intracellular FRET efficiencies were measured by acceptor photobleaching to be 11 ± 1 and 15 ± 1% (n = 4), before and after PDGF stimulation, respectively. These experiments further demonstrated that a conformational change occurred within Akt during its activation following 3′ phosphoinositide production and eliminated the possibility that the FRET change observed with ReAktion was a mere consequence of the translocation event.TABLE 1Responses of ReAktion phosphorylation mutants in NIH3T3 cells upon PDGF stimulationReAktion construct and mutantsFRET change (plasma membrane-targeted)aFRET changes are represented by the average percentage changes in emission ratio (yellow/cyan).Translocation (untargeted)averages ± S.D.ReAktion7.1 ± 3.1% (n = 4)Yes (n = 8)T308A/S473ANone (n = 4)Yes (n = 4)T308D/S473DNone (n = 4)No (n = 4)T308ANone (n = 4)Yes (n = 2)T308DNone (n = 4)No (n = 4)S473A11.2 ± 0.8% (n = 4)Yes (n = 5)S473D13.4 ± 3.0% (n = 4)Yes (n = 4)a FRET changes are represented by the average percentage changes in emission ratio (yellow/cyan). Open table in a new tab Thr308 Phosphorylation and Conformational Change—Phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 leads to full activation of Akt (6Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). To evaluate the contributions of these phosphorylation events to the conformational change of Akt, we mutated pm ReAktion to mimic constitutive phosphorylation (T308D/S473D) or to generate a nonphosphorylatable mutant (T308A/S473A). Interestingly, both types of double mutations, T308D/S473D and T308A/S473A, abolished the ability of plasma membrane targeted ReAktion to generate a conformational change (Fig. 3, A and B, and Table 1). Both mutants showed no sign of misfolding with uniform distribution of fluorescence from both N-terminal CFP and C-terminal YFP. The fact that Thr308 and Ser473 mutations abolished the observed conformational change suggested that phosphorylation events play an important role in the observed conformational change. Next we mutated individual phosphorylation sites to evaluate the contributions of either phosphorylation event. Mutation of Thr308 to either Ala or Asp in membrane attached pm ReAktion generated mutants that did not show any emission ratio change upon PDGF stimulation or LY294002 treatment, whereas variants with Ser473 mutations, i.e. S473D and S473A, responded to PDGF stimulation in a similar fashion as previously seen with pm ReAktion (Fig. 3, C and D, and Table 1). Thus, mutating Thr308 to either a phosphorylation mimic Asp or a nonphosphorylatable Ala abolished the FRET change, independent of mutations at the Ser473 position. The mutational analysis collectively showed that eliminating the process of Thr308 phosphorylation severely hindered the conformational change undergone by the protein, suggesting that phosphorylation at Thr308 critically contributes to the conformational change. It is known that phosphorylation at Thr308 is a critical step in Akt activation (6Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). Such PDGF-induced phosphorylation of ReAktion was seen in parallel with endogenous Akt in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4A). However, previously published studies reported that the plasma membrane-bound Akt molecule is a constitutively active form of Akt, thus capable of mimicking the oncogenicity of viral v-Akt, which is also attached to the membrane through myristoylation of Gag (viral group-specific antigen) protein at the N terminus (17Aoki M. Batista O. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14950-14955Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To determine whether the observed FRET response correlated with an increase in Thr308 phosphorylation in plasma membrane targeted ReAktion, we probed lysates expressing pm ReAktion with anti-Thr(P)308 antibody. Western blot analysis showed basal phosphorylation at Thr308 in pm ReAktion, which was further enhanced upon PDGF stimulation (Fig. 4B). This result was in accordance with the observed stimulant-induced increase in Thr308 phosphorylation in the plasma membrane-targeted Akt (18Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These experiments show that the conformational change that occurs within Akt during the activation process not only requires a phosphorylatable Thr308 but also correlates with its phosphorylation. Thr308 Phosphorylation and Membrane Association—To determine the consequence of this conformational change to Akt protein, particularly on its membrane association, we evaluated the membrane recruitment of various mutants by monitoring the translocation of untargeted reporters from the cytosol to membrane upon stimulation. The effects of phosphorylation were evaluated by examining ReAktion variants with double mutations at both Thr308 and Ser473 sites. As shown in Table 1, nonphosphorylatable mutant T308A/S473A ReAktion was able to translocate from cytosol to plasma membrane upon PDGF stimulation. By contrast, the mutant mimicking the constitutively phosphorylated form, T308D/S473D ReAktion, showed no translocation (Table 1). When contributions from individual phosphorylation events were evaluated, S473A and S473D ReAktion both showed clear translocation (Table 1). T308A ReAktion upon stimulation also showed translocation to the membrane, consistent with a previous report (10Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). On the other hand T308D ReAktion, which mimics monophosphorylated Akt molecule, showed no translocation. This membrane translocation assay provides direct evaluation of the association of Akt with the plasma membrane containing 3′ phosphoinositides. Reduced membrane association for T308D ReAktion in comparison with wt and T308A ReAktion suggests that Thr308 phosphorylation plays a role in modulating the membrane association. To further eliminate the possibility of disruption of Ser473-dependent changes by the C-terminal YFP fusion, we omitted YFP and only fused CFP to the N terminus of Akt and some of the Akt mutants to monitor their membrane translocation. Our wild type positive control construct CFP-Akt showed translocation to the membrane upon stimulation as observed in previous studies (Fig. 5) (11Astoul E. Watton S. Cantrell D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). CFP-S473D, which mimics single phosphorylation status at Ser473, showed clear translocation, and the same was true for the unphosphorylatable CFP-T308A/S473A construct (Fig. 5). Consistent with the data obtained using dual fluorophore-labeled constructs (Table 1), the CFP-T308D/S473D construct showed no discernable membrane translocation (Fig. 5). Thr308 (in Akt-1) is located in an activation segment or loop that plays a central role in regulating the catalytic activity of many kinases (19Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The aforementioned data suggest that, in addition to the role in regulating kinase activity, Thr308 phosphorylation may also reduce the membrane binding affinity of Akt, possibly facilitating its detachment from the membrane despite the presence of high levels of 3′ phosphoinositides. Association between PH Domain and Catalytic Domain—An implication of the aforementioned data is that phosphorylation at Thr308 in Akt reduces its membrane association. Yet, how does phosphorylation of Thr308, located in the catalytic domain, affect membrane association, a function specifically assigned to the N-terminal PH domain? We hypothesize that a conformational change induced by Thr308 phosphorylation relies on some interdomain communication between the PH domain and catalytic domain to generate such functional effects. To understand how phosphorylation of Thr308 in the catalytic domain translates to a loss of membrane association of N-terminal PH domain, we tested whether there exists any direct or indirect interaction between these two domains of Akt in cells. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged PH domain and a plasma membrane-targeted catalytic domain (pm catalytic domain) and stimulated with insulin-like growth factor (IGF). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with an anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were probed for the catalytic domain. As shown in Fig. 6A, the catalytic domain was found associated with PH domain and appeared as a distinct band in the co-immunoprecipitate. To determine whether the interaction between the PH domain and catalytic domain is dependent on the phosphorylation of Thr308, HEK293 cells expressing HA-PH and pm catalytic domain were subject to different treatments. Lysates were then prepared from cells that were unstimulated, pretreated with LY294002, stimulated with IGF-1 to activate PI3K, or stimulated with IGF-1 in the presence of LY294002 to block PI3K activity, respectively. The catalytic domain was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with a monoclonal anti-Akt antibody. The immunoprecipitates were next probed with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 6B). Conversely, the HA-PH domain was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody and then probed with anti-Akt antibody and anti-Thr(P)308 antibody (Fig. 6C). The catalytic domain was found to co-immunoprecipitate with the HA-PH domain from cells stimulated with IGF-1, and to a lesser degree, from the unstimulated cells (Fig. 6, B and C). More importantly, the association was correlated with phosphorylation of Thr308, with diminished association and Thr308 phosphorylation in the LY294002-treated samples (Fig. 6C). To verify that phosphorylation of Thr308 was required for association of the catalytic domain with the PH domain, the co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed using cells expressing the PH domain and a mutant plasma membrane catalytic domain carrying the T308A mutation (Fig. 6D). The T308A mutation in the catalytic domain abolished IGF-1-induced association with the PH domain, demonstrating the requirement of phosphorylation of Thr308 for the interdomain communication between the PH domain and catalytic domain. These experiments identified a novel association between PH domain and catalytic domain in the presence of a phosphorylated Thr308, providing a possible mechanism for modulating the properties of the PH domain following changes in the catalytic domain during activation. New Approaches for Examining Akt Activation—FRET-based live-cell imaging has found increasingly widespread use in the investigation of molecular mechanisms of cellular processes because of its capability of monitoring dynamic molecular events in real time and space (20Miyawaki A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 21Zhang J. Campbell R.E. Ting A.Y. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). In this study, an approach combining mutational analysis with live-cell fluorescence imaging was used to dissect how various regulatory elements contribute to the conformational changes of Akt and its association with the plasma membrane. Compared with complementary in vitro approaches that evaluate Akt conformations in solution (22Huang B.X. Kim H.Y. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 1045-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the native live-cell environment allows us to assess the activation process in the presence of multiple cellular factors that are required for Akt activation. A FRET-based reporter, ReAktion, was employed to examine the conformational changes undergone by Akt during its activation. In the same vein, a construct consisting of Akt sand-wiched between GFP and YFP was constructed by Calleja et al. (14Calleja V. Ameer-Beg S.M. Vojnovic B. Woscholski R. Downward J. Larijani B. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and studied using a combination of FRET and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy techniques. This GFP-Akt-YFP construct showed a loss of energy transfer between the two fluorophores upon stimulation. In contrast, ReAktion and plasma membrane-targeted ReAktion both showed a gain of FRET upon stimulation. This reversal of the sign in the FRET change is likely due to the difference in the actual fluorophores and in the linkers connecting the fluorophores to Akt, thereby resulting in a difference in the distance and relative orientation between the FRET pairs (23Allen M.D. Zhang J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 716-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Since both distance and orientation contribute to FRET, the increase in the energy transfer between the CFP and YFP in ReAktion clearly indicates a conformational change, although the exact nature of the change may not be directly deduced from the sign of the FRET change. In this study, combining mutational analysis with live-cell imaging using ReAktion, we demonstrated that the conformational change observed during Akt activation requires a phosphorylatable Thr308. This initial finding further led to a series of experiments that unraveled the new regulatory roles of Thr308 phosphorylation. Membrane recruitment assay was used to evaluate membrane association of various mutants in a series of experiments. Direct visualization of membrane departure of Akt requires synchronized action of a significant number of Akt molecules and can be achieved when massive degradation of 3′ phosphoinositides occurs upon inhibition of PI3K in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1B, third panel). In the absence of PI3K inhibitors, the levels of 3′ phosphoinositides remain high for an extended period of time after PDGF stimulation of NIH3T3 cells (13Ananthanarayanan B. Ni Q. Zhang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15081-15086Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24Kunkel M.T. Ni Q. Tsien R.Y. Zhang J. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5581-5587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It can be envisioned that at a given time, a subpopulation of already activated Akt molecules depart from the membrane, and some, upon deactivation, travel back to get reactivated. Visualization of such trafficking of individual Akt molecules may be achieved with single-molecule imaging in future studies. Of note, the kinetics of Akt activation and patterns of trafficking can be cell type-specific. In fact, ligation of B cell antigen receptor was shown to induce a transient localization of Akt to the plasma membrane and a sustained membrane localization of PH domain itself, which led to the speculation that a molecular mechanism exists to cause active Akt to dissociate from the plasma membrane in B cells despite the continued generation of 3′ phosphoinositides (11Astoul E. Watton S. Cantrell D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study, a series of experiments based on the membrane recruitment assay revealed critical involvement of Thr308 phosphorylation in regulation of dissociation of active Akt from the plasma membrane. Effects of Thr308 Phosphorylation—Thr308 (in Akt-1) is located in an activation segment or loop that is housed in the kinase domain of all AGC kinases (25Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R521-R524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This activation loop plays a central role in regulating the catalytic activity of the kinases, where phosphorylation of a threonine residue between the invariant DFG and APE motifs is required for enzyme activation (19Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 26Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). By analogy, Thr308 present in the activation segment of Akt is crucial for its activity, and its phosphorylation alone increases the activity of Akt-1 by 10-fold (6Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). Does this phosphorylation have any other functional consequence? By monitoring membrane translocation of various ReAktion mutants, a permanently phosphorylated Thr308 was found to prevent the membrane translocation of the protein upon stimulation, which indicated reduced association with the plasma membrane containing 3′ phosphoinositides. Hence, Thr308 phosphorylation not only enhances Akt activity, but may also reduce the membrane binding affinity of Akt, facilitating its detachment from the membrane despite the presence of high levels of 3′ phosphoinositides. On the other hand, phosphorylation of Ser473 does not appear to have such a significant effect. Of note, recent studies showed that Akt with defective Ser473 phosphorylation affected only a subset of substrate targets in vivo, suggesting that Ser473 phosphorylation is dispensable to some extent (27Jacinto E. Facchinetti V. Liu D. Soto N. Wei S. Jung S.Y. Huang Q. Qin J. Su B. Cell. 2006; 127: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). In light of the demonstration that Thr308 phosphorylation is the second phosphorylation event (28Scheid M.P. Marignani P.A. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6247-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), we propose that this phosphorylation enables the final step of departure of Akt from the plasma membrane after it is fully activated. Communication between Domains—Different domains of Akt are known to have distinct functions. For instance, PH domain is involved in binding to 3′ phosphoinositides and association with the plasma membrane, and the catalytic domain is responsible for the kinase activity. However, our experiments suggest that these domains do not function completely independent of one another, and there exists a functional “communication” between them. A phosphorylation event in the catalytic domain (at Thr308) may affect the membrane association via the PH domain. To understand the molecular basis for such “communication,” we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments and detected a novel association between the PH domain and catalytic domain, which is correlated with the phosphorylation state of Thr308. Such interaction could be direct or via other interaction partners. Recent studies suggest that individual PH domains, in addition to binding phosphoinositides, may interact with protein binding partners to play more specific regulatory roles (29Varnai P. Bondeva T. Tamas P. Toth B. Buday L. Hunyady L. Balla T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4879-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PH domain has also been shown to be involved in interacting with Tcl1 (T-cell leukemia-1), a protein involved in Akt regulation (30Kunstle G. Laine J. Pierron G. Kagami S.S. Nakajima H. Hoh F. Roumestand C. Stern M.H. Noguchi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1513-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Teitell M.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Involvement of potential interacting partners and the effect of different phosphorylation events on such interdomain interaction will be subjects of further studies. New Regulatory Roles of Activation Loop Phosphorylation—A model of Akt activation is shown in Fig. 7, where new regulatory roles of Thr308 phosphorylation are depicted. Phosphorylation at Thr308 triggers a conformational change within active Akt, which alters the membrane binding properties of the PH domain via the association and functional “communication” between the PH domain and catalytic domain. The reduced membrane association may result from shielding of the phosphoinositide-binding region of the PH domain by direct interaction with the catalytic domain or via recruitment of other interaction partners. Future studies will look into the nature of this new mode of dynamic regulation of PH domain function. A direct functional effect of Thr308 phosphorylation is therefore reduced membrane affinity of Akt despite high levels of 3′ phosphoinositides, which facilitates dissociation of active Akt from the membrane to phosphorylate its target substrates in other cellular compartments. Akt molecules that have been inactivated by phosphatases could also be recruited to these vacant phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-rich membrane-binding sites and get reactivated until lipid phosphatases degrade 3′-phosphoinositides. Thus, this mechanism for the departure of Akt from the membrane prior to massive degradation of phosphoinositides would ensure appropriate temporal control and accumulation of Akt activity in various subcellular locations, which would not be solely dependent on the levels of lipid second messengers. Illustrated here are novel roles of activation loop phosphorylation in regulating the spatial and temporal distribution of the activity of a kinase, the generality of which awaits further investigation. The live-cell fluorescence-based molecular approach used in this study should also be generally applicable to facilitate such investigations in the native cellular environment to delineate molecular mechanisms of cell signaling. We thank Dr. Peter Devreotes for providing valuable discussions."

Tocopherol deficiency in the vitamin E2 mutant vte2-1 of Arabidopsis thaliana leads to massive lipid oxidation and MDA accumulation shortly after germination. MDA accumulation correlates with a strong visual phenotype (growth reduction, cotyledon bleaching) and aberrant GST1 (glutathione S-transferase 1) expression. We suppressed MDA accumulation in the vte2-1 background by genetically removing tri-unsaturated fatty acids. The resulting quadruple mutant, fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8 vte2-1, did not display the visual phenotype or the aberrant GST1 expression observed in vte2-1. Moreover, cotyledon bleaching in vte2-1 was chemically phenocopied by treatment of wild-type plants with MDA. These data suggest that products of tri-unsaturated fatty acid oxidation underlie the vte2-1 seedling phenotype, including cellular toxicity and gene regulation properties. Generation of the quadruple mutant facilitated the development of an in situ fluorescence assay based on the formation of adducts of MDA with 2-thiobarbituric acid at 37 °C. Specificity was verified by measuring pentafluorophenylhydrazine derivatives of MDA and by liquid chromatography analysis of MDA-2-thiobarbituric acid adducts. Potentially applicable to other organisms, this method allowed the localization of MDA pools throughout the body of Arabidopsis and revealed an undiscovered pool of the compound unlikely to be derived from trienoic fatty acids in the vicinity of the root tip quiescent center.

Potentially applicable to other organisms, this method allowed the localization of MDA pools throughout the body of Arabidopsis and revealed an undiscovered pool of the compound unlikely to be derived from trienoic fatty acids in the vicinity of the root tip quiescent center. The in vivo oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and the diverse compounds generated by this process in healthy and diseased organisms are of increasing interest. Higher plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana offer particularly good systems in which to study many aspects of the biology of this type of molecule because of the availability of mutants in fatty acid synthesis and metabolism. Indeed, the complex cellular organization of plants offers many possibilities to explore the physiological effects, genesis, and distribution of nonenzymatic lipid oxidation products at the whole-organism level. The latter aspect, the whole-body distribution of lipid oxidation products at the cell and tissue level, is largely unexplored in complex organisms like plants.The interest in nonenzymatic products of lipid oxidation stems in part from the fact that they provide markers in pathogenesis (1Muckenschnabel I. Goodman B.A. Williamson B. Lyon G.D. Deighton N. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2Loeffler C. Berger S. Guy A. Durand T. Bringmann G. Dreyer M. von Rad U. Durner J. Mueller M.J. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 328-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and that they may also have powerful biological activities in the control of stress response gene expression (2Loeffler C.

Stolz S. Chetelat A. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2000; 24: 467-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the susceptibility of fatty acids to oxidation is reported to increase in some mutants with decreased thermotolerance (6Larkindale J. Hall J.D. Knight M.R. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 882-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In most cases, lipid oxidation has been studied in aerial tissues, where organelles such as chloroplasts and also mitochondria are particularly rich in the trienoic fatty acid α-linolenic acid (7Harwood, J. L. (1982) in The Biochemistry of Plants: A Comprehensive Treatise (Stumpf, P. K., and Conn, E. E., eds) Vol. 4, pp. 1-55, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 8Falcone D.L. Ogas J.P. Somerville C.R. BMC Plant Biol. 2004; 4: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), a fatty acid that is highly susceptible to nonenzymatic oxidation (9Frankel, E. N. (2005) The Oily Press Lipid Library: Lipid Oxidation, 2nd Ed., Vol. 18, PJ Barnes & Associates, Bridgwater, UKGoogle Scholar).One of the α-linolenic acid oxidation products that has been studied in some detail in plants in terms of its origin and biological activities is malondialdehyde (MDA) 3The abbreviations used are: MDA, malondialdehyde; TBA, 2-thiobarbituric acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 3The abbreviations used are: MDA, malondialdehyde; TBA, 2-thiobarbituric acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. (3Farmer E.E. Davoine C. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2007; 10: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 10Weber H. Chetelat A. Reymond P. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2004; 37: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). MDA is a three-carbon aldehyde that is a major product of the oxidation of many fatty acids with three or more double bonds and is one of the most ubiquitous small molecules produced by lipid oxidation in many organisms (9Frankel, E. N. (2005) The Oily Press Lipid Library: Lipid Oxidation, 2nd Ed., Vol. 18, PJ Barnes & Associates, Bridgwater, UKGoogle Scholar, 11Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5846) Google Scholar). In the mature expanded leaves of Arabidopsis, MDA is known to be produced in vivo from at least two genetically separable sources. The principal source, accounting for ∼75% of MDA in expanded leaves, is trienoic fatty acids, whereas the origin(s) of the second pool of MDA identified in leaves is currently unknown (10Weber H. Chetelat A. Reymond P. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2004; 37: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Like other products of nonenzymatic lipid oxidation in plants, the localization of MDA at the level of tissues and organs is unknown. This latter problem presents a challenge, and a factor limiting the analysis of molecules like MDA in complex multicellular organisms is that it can be difficult to detect individual molecular species without first extracting the compounds and thus destroying tissue structure. Currently, it is not possible to localize the sites of accumulation of discrete molecular products of lipid oxidation in intact plant tissues. We have attempted to solve this problem for MDA.To localize MDA within the body of plants, several genetic backgrounds with altered abilities to produce MDA would ideally be employed. Fortunately, Arabidopsis mutants exist with either decreased or increased ability to accumulate MDA. For example, the fatty acid desaturase triple mutant fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8 (12McConn M. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 403-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has lower MDA levels in mature leaves compared with the wild type (10Weber H. Chetelat A. Reymond P. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2004; 37: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In contrast, the vitamin E2 mutant vte2-1 (13Sattler S.E. Gilliland L.U. Magallanes-Lundback M. Pollard M. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), a loss-of-function mutant in homogentisate phytyltransferase, lacks both tocopherols and redox-active tocopherol pathway intermediates and overaccumulates MDA (14Sattler S.E. Mène-Saffrané L. Farmer E.E. Krischke M. Mueller M.J. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3706-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although the nonenzymatic oxidation of di-and tri-unsaturated fatty acids is pronounced in the vte2-1 mutant, there is little or no activation of the synthesis of enzymatically derived jasmonates (which are derived from trienoic fatty acids). Furthermore, the transcripts for key jasmonate-responsive marker genes are not up-regulated in vte2-1 relative to the wild type. The vte2-1 mutant strongly overproduces MDA as well as stable phytoprostanes during early the post-germination phase (14Sattler S.E. Mène-Saffrané L. Farmer E.E. Krischke M. Mueller M.J. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3706-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and the seedlings also show a strong visual phenotype upon germination. Typically, on emerging from the testa, the seedlings display defects in their cotyledons. These defects are asymmetric; they affect one cotyledon more strongly than the other, often leaving this cotyledon poorly developed and with a bleached appearance (13Sattler S.E. Gilliland L.U. Magallanes-Lundback M. Pollard M. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar).We compared the phenotypes and MDA levels in seedlings of the vte2-1 mutant and the fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8 triple mutant (hereafter termed fad3 fad7 fad8) with those of a novel quadruple mutant (fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8 vte2-1, hereafter termed fad3 fad7 fad8 vte2) derived from crossing the two parents. The results showed that the oxidation of trienoic fatty acids is specifically responsible for the vte2-1 phenotype, including cotyledon defects and up-regulation of GST1 expression. Furthermore, liquid chromatography analysis indicated that the only small 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive substance produced by these plants is MDA. Supported by quantitative MDA measurements using pentafluorophenylhydrazine derivatives, this genetic system was then used as a basis for the development of a controlled in situ method for the detection of MDA-(TBA)2 adducts, which can be excited to fluoresce in a region where chlorophyll absorption and fluorescence are nearly minimal. The new in situ assay allowed the comparison of the vte2-1 phenotype with MDA distribution throughout the plant. Additionally, the assay allowed the localization of a pool of nontrienoic fatty acid-derived MDA in Arabidopsis root tips. The method should facilitate the mapping of MDA pools in the tissues of complex organisms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant Growth Conditions—The seedlings were grown for 2 or 3 days on agar (1%, w/v) containing 0.5× Murashige and Skoog basal medium during a 12-h photoperiod (100 μmol of photons·m-2·s-1) at 20 °C.Construction and Selection of fad3 fad7 fad8 vte2 Quadruple Mutants—All mutants used are in the Columbia genetic background. The male sterile fad3 fad7 fad8 mutant was fertilized with vte2-1 pollen, and F1 plants were allowed to self-pollinate. The homozygous fad3 fad7 fad8 mutants were isolated from the F2 progeny (960 plants) by gas chromatography analysis for 18:3 (15Miquel M. Browse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1502-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ten plants homozygous for the fad3 fad7 fad8 mutations were detected. Three vte2 heterozygotes were detected among these plants. Homozygous vte2 mutants were isolated from the following (F3) generation by cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence analysis. For VTE2/vte2 differentiation, a 632-bp-long fragment was amplified with forward primer 5′-TTTCACTGGCATCTTGGAGGTAATG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAGTGGCAACTGTTTGTAGTAGAAG-3′ in a PCR carried out at an annealing temperature of 51 °C. Restriction enzyme digestion of the vte2 allele with SacI endonuclease (Fermentas, Ontario, Canada) generated two fragments (477 and 154 bp), whereas VTE2 was not digested. Three quadruple mutant lines were obtained. Two of these lines (733 and 782) were propagated. Seed production from the quadruple mutants was rescued by spraying with methyl jasmonate (30 μm, sonicated in water containing 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20) at 2-day intervals. At the F5 generation, sufficient seeds were obtained for experiments.RNA Gel Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from 2-day-old seedlings grown on wet filter papers at 20 °C during a 12-h photoperiod (100 μmol of photons·m-2·s-1). RNA was extracted as described (5Vollenweider S. Weber H. Stolz S. Chetelat A. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2000; 24: 467-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), separated by electrophoresis, and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed with a cDNA corresponding to the GST1 gene At1g02930 (5Vollenweider S. Weber H. Stolz S. Chetelat A. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2000; 24: 467-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).MDA Quantification—Seedlings (2 days old, 200 mg fresh weight) were harvested frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder. MDA levels in different mutants of Arabidopsis were quantified by a gas chromatography/mass spectrophotometry method as described (10Weber H. Chetelat A. Reymond P. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2004; 37: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 16Yeo H.C. Liu J. Helbock H.J. Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The internal standard for quantification was D2-MDA generated from (2D2)-1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane (Dr. Ehrenstorfer GmbH, Augsburg, Germany) as described (10Weber H. Chetelat A. Reymond P. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2004; 37: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Detection of Aldehyde-TBA Adducts—A fluorescence filter with a 515 ± 10-nm excitation filter and a 555 ± 15-nm emission filter was constructed by Leica Microsystems (Glattbrugg, Switzerland) based on fluorescence values in Ref. 17Yagi K. Biochem. Med. 1976; 15: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar. Fluorescence was detected with a Leica MZ16 FA microscope and photographed with a Leica DC300F camera.TBA Treatments—Plant tissues were treated at 37 °C for 5 h with either 35 mm TBA (Sigma) or 35 mm trichloroacetic acid (Merck) as a control. Tissues were examined by microscopy within 1 h of the end of the 5-h staining period.HPLC Analysis—MDA-TBA adducts were separated based on Ref. 18Scott I.M. Clarke S.M. Wood J.E. Mur L.A. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar. All solutions and mobile phases were prepared in purified water (NANOpure, Skan AG, Basel-Allschwil, Switzerland). Wild-type (Col-0), vte2-1, and fad3 fad7 fad8 seeds were germinated in the dark in water for 3 days. These seedlings were then incubated in 35 mm TBA solution (0.02 g of seedlings (fresh weight)/ml) for 5 h at 37 °C. The seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted in 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) butylated hydroxytoluene (0.02 g of seedlings/ml). The suspensions were shaken for 5 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was directly analyzed by HPLC. A standard MDA-TBA adduct was prepared from 5 mm 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane (Sigma) incubated in 35 mm TBA for 5 h at 37 °C. The reaction was diluted in 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 0.1% (w/v) butylated hydroxytoluene for injection. HPLC was performed using a LaChrom Elite HPLC system (Merck-Hitachi, Dietikon, Switzerland): L-2100 pump, L-2200 autosampler, L-2300 column oven, L-2450 diode array detector, and L-2480 fluorescence detector. HPLC was controlled with the EZChrom Elite Program Version 3.1.7 (Merck-Hitachi). Separation was performed by injection of a 10-μl sample into a ChromCart column (Nucleosil 120-5 C18, 5 μm, 4 × 250 mm; Macherey-Nagel, Ohringen, Switzerland). The autosampler was maintained at 4 °C and the column at 26 °C. The mobile phase was 24% (v/v) acetonitrile (Merck) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) run isocratically for 8 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Detector wavelengths were set to 515 nm (excitation) and 555 nm (emission). The MDA-(TBA)2 adduct eluted at 3 min. In separate experiments designed to look for additional fluorescent compounds eluted from plant materials treated with TBA, a gradient of acetonitrile (from 24 to 100% (v/v) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was introduced after the 8-min isocratic run (same flow rate). The solvent system was then changed to 0-100% (v/v) methanol in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (same flow rate and fluorescence parameters). The MDA-(TBA)2 adduct eluted at 21.7 min.Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Ultra-HPLC/time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses were performed on a Micromass LCT Premier time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) with an electrospray interface and coupled with an ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters). Electrospray ionization conditions were as follows: capillary voltage, 2500 V; cone voltage, 90 V; microchannel plate detector voltage, 2650 V; source temperature, 120 °C; desolvation temperature, 250 °C; cone gas flow, 10 liters/h; and desolvation gas flow, 550 liters/h. Detection was in the negative ion mode in the m/z range 100-1000, with a scan time of 0.25 s, and interscan delay of 0.01 s, and a centered mode. A solution of leucine/enkephalin (Sigma) was used for the lock mass. Separation was carried out on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (50 × 1.0-mm inner diameter, 1.7 μm). Gradient analysis was performed at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min with solvent system A (0.1% formic acid and water) and solvent system B (0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile) producing a gradient of 5-98% solvent system B in 3.0 min. The injected volume was 2 μl.Chemical Phenotype of vte2-1—Wild-type (Col-0) and vte2-1 (13Sattler S.E. Gilliland L.U. Magallanes-Lundback M. Pollard M. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) seeds were imbibed in water at 20 °C during a 16-h photoperiod (100 μmol of photons·m-2·s-1) for 1 day. The seedlings were then incubated on wet filter papers for 2 days in the presence of MDA (0 or 1 μmol) in 1-liter glass jars during the same 16-h photoperiod and at the same temperature. MDA was generated from 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane by addition to freshly prepared 1 m HCl (100 μl) at room temperature. The MDA solution was applied to cotton wicks. For the wild-type control (0 μm MDA), only HCl was applied. vte2-1 seedlings (1 day post-imbibition) were incubated under the same conditions but in the absence of MDA. After 3 days, seedlings were photographed under the Leica MZ16 FA microscope with the Leica DC300F camera using IM50 software (Leica Microsystems).RESULTSGenetic Suppression of the vte2-1 Seedling Phenotype—During germination, the tocopherol-deficient mutant vte2-1 exhibits a strong phenotype that includes a failure to fully expand one (or, more rarely, both) cotyledons. Additionally, the affected cotyledon is often devoid of chlorophyll (13Sattler S.E. Gilliland L.U. Magallanes-Lundback M. Pollard M. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Moreover, this phenotype is correlated with the accumulation of potentially toxic compounds derived mainly from the nonenzymatic oxidation of trienoic fatty acids (10Weber H. Chetelat A. Reymond P. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2004; 37: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 13Sattler S.E. Gilliland L.U. Magallanes-Lundback M. Pollard M. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). To test whether the vte2-1 phenotype is specifically associated with trienoic fatty acids, two fad3 fad7 fad8 vte2 quadruple mutant lines were isolated from a cross between the trienoic fatty acid-deficient mutant fad3 fad7 fad8 (12McConn M. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 403-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and vte2-1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Three days after germination of the tocopherol-deficient vte2-1 seedlings, the plants were smaller than Col-0 and displayed a clear vte2-1 phenotype (Fig. 1) (13Sattler S.E. Gilliland L.U. Magallanes-Lundback M. Pollard M. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). However, the wild-type/fad3 fad7 fad8 triple mutant visual phenotype was restored in the two lines of the quadruple mutant (Fig. 1). The growth of seedlings of quadruple mutants (lines 733 and 782) appeared to be highly similar to that of the wild type and the fad3 fad7 fad8 triple mutant, and no bleaching was observed on the cotyledons of the fad3 fad7 fad8 vte2 quadruple mutants. Indeed, none of the fad3 fad7 fad8 vte2 quadruple mutant seedlings presented the cotyledon defects that typify the vte2-1 mutant at this stage of growth.MDA Levels and GST1 Gene Expression in Different Arabidopsis Mutants—The vte2-1 phenotype in seedlings is associated with a strong increase in nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, resulting in the production of hydroperoxy and hydroxyl fatty acids, linear phytoprostanes, and MDA (13Sattler S.E. Gilliland L.U. Magallanes-Lundback M. Pollard M. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 14Sattler S.E. Mène-Saffrané L. Farmer E.E. Krischke M. Mueller M.J. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3706-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Moreover, the accumulation of these compounds in the vte2-1 mutant correlates with the up-regulation of 160 genes (14Sattler S.E. Mène-Saffrané L. Farmer E.E. Krischke M. Mueller M.J. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3706-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To further test the correlation between the accumulation of trienoic fatty acid oxidation products and the modification of gene expression, MDA levels were quantified, and the transcript levels for GST1, an oxidative stress marker gene (19Alvarez M.E. Pennell R.I. Meijer P.J. Ishikawa A. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Cell. 1998; 92: 773-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), were monitored in 2-day-old seedlings of the different mutants (Fig. 2). In the vte2-1 seedlings, the MDA concentration increased strongly to levels 14-fold higher than in Col-0 and 22-fold higher than in the fad3 fad7 fad8 triple mutant. In the fad3 fad7 fad8 vte2 quadruple mutants (lines 733 and 782), we observed a lower MDA level than in the wild type. This level was comparable with the MDA level in the fad3 fad7 fad8 triple mutant. The restoration to a nearly wild-type visual phenotype in the quadruple mutant correlated with a low MDA level. To further test the correlation between the accumulation of trienoic fatty acid oxidation products and gene expression observed in the vte2-1 mutant, the expression of the GST1 gene was analyzed. GST1 is up-regulated in the vte2-1 mutant (14Sattler S.E. Mène-Saffrané L. Farmer E.E. Krischke M. Mueller M.J. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3706-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and also responds strongly to MDA (5Vollenweider S. Weber H. Stolz S. Chetelat A. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2000; 24: 467-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Weber H. Chetelat A. Reymond P. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2004; 37: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). GST1 mRNA was strongly expressed in vte2-1 mutant seedlings (2 days), but not in the wild type (Fig. 2A). The elimination of trienoic fatty acids in the fad3 fad7 fad8 vte2 quadruple mutant, which correlated with suppression of MDA accumulation, led to a strong reduction of GST1 transcript levels compared with vte2-1 (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2MDA levels and GST1 gene expression in the different Arabidopsis mutants. A, quantification of MDA levels in the different Arabidopsis mutants. Seedlings were 2 days old. F.W., fresh weight. B, GST1 gene expression tested for the wild type (Col-0) and fad3 fad7 fad8 triple, vte2-1, and fad3 fad7 fad8 vte2 quadruple (lines 733 and 782) mutants 2 days after germination (mean ± S.D., n = 5-8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Chemical Phenotype of vte2-1—To further investigate the potential role of α-linolenic acid oxidation products in the vte2-1 phenotype, we attempted to chemically phenocopy the vte2-1 mutation. This was achieved by exposing germinated seeds of Col-0 to MDA. Wild-type seedlings exposed to MDA partially resembled vte2-1 seedlings and displayed one bleached cotyledon and shorter and narrower hypocotyls (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Chemical phenocopy of the vte2-1 phenotype. A, wild-type (WT) seedlings; B, vte2-1 seedlings; C, wild-type seedlings exposed to MDA. Seedlings were photographed at 3 days. The arrowheads indicate the bleached cotyledons in the vte2-1 mutant and in the wild-type plants treated with MDA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Development of an in Situ Test to Detect MDA in Plant Tissues—To facilitate the in situ microscopic detection of MDA, a custom fluorescence filter was constructed. The filter parameters were based on specific fluorescence values for the adduct between MDA and TBA (17Yagi K. Biochem. Med. 1976; 15: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar), with a 515 ± 10-nm excitation filter and a 555 ± 15-nm emission filter. The filter was first tested on germinating Col-0 and vte2-1 seedlings to see whether fluorescence could be observed in the seedlings. A stronger fluorescence in vte2-1 than in wild-type seedlings was expected because of the higher measurable levels of MDA in the former. Fig. 4 shows wild-type (Col-0) and vte2-1 seedlings (3 days post-germination) that had been incubated with 35 mm TBA for 5 h at 37 °C and then observed by microscopy. Under white light, a weak red coloration was observed in the root tips of both Col-0 and the vte2-1 mutant. In parallel, the fluorescence at 555 ± 15 nm was observed in each genotype. For wild-type seedlings, strong fluorescence was observed at the root tip, with weaker fluorescence in the cotyledons. On the other hand, in the vte2-1 mutant, the fluorescence was present throughout the entire seedling. This observation is consistent with the fact that the MDA level in the vte2-1 mutant is 14-fold higher than that in Col-0 3 days after germination (14Sattler S.E. Mène-Saffrané L. Farmer E.E. Krischke M. Mueller M.J. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3706-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Development of an assay for the in situ detection of MDA. Seedlings of Col-0 and vte2-1 (3 days post-germination) were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h in 35 mm TBA solution. A weak red coloration at the root tips corresponding to TBA adducts was observed under white light in the wild type and in the vte2-1 mutant (upper panels). Fluorescence (fluor.) was detected at 555 nm (lower panels). Scale bars = 1 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)At this point, it was not certain that the fluorescence observed emanated specifically from MDA-(TBA)2 adducts. To test for the specificity of fluorescence in the vte2-1 mutant, extracts of this plant previously incubated with TBA (for 5 h at 37 °C) were analyzed by HPLC. Using the same wavelengths as used for the fluorescence microscopy, the HPLC chromatograms (Fig. 5) revealed a single peak for the synthetic reference adduct. Only one fluorescent peak was detectable by HPLC analysis of wild-type and fad3 fad7 fad8 triple mutant seedlings, and a larger single peak was observed with vte2-1. These peaks migrated at the same retention time as the synthetic MDA-(TBA)2 adduct. More extensive HPLC analysis of the wild type using gradients of methanol or acetonitrile revealed only one peak corresponding to the MDA-(TBA)2 adduct from wild-type plants. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to verify the identity of the MDA-(TBA)2 adduct produced in both the wild-type and fad3 fad7 fad8 triple mutant samples. The mass for the adduct obtained in the negative ion mode (M - H = 322.99) corresponded to that for the synthetic adduct (Fig. 6).FIGURE 5Liquid chromatography analysis of fluorescent MDA-TBA adducts.

https://openalex.org/W2087028407,"The Hedgehog signaling pathway regulates the development and function of numerous tissues and when mis-regulated causes tumorigenesis. To assess the role of a deregulated Hedgehog signaling pathway in the mammary gland we targeted the expression of the Hedgehog effector protein, GLI1, to mammary epithelial cells using a bigenic inducible system. A constitutively active Hedgehog signaling pathway resulted with 100% penetrance in an undifferentiated mammary lobuloalveolar network during pregnancy. GLI1-expressing transgenic females were unable to lactate and milk protein gene expression was essentially absent. The inability to lactate was permanent and independent of continued GLI1 transgene expression. An increased expression of the GLI1 response gene Snail coupled to reduced expression of E-cadherin and STAT5 in the transgenic mammary gland provides a likely molecular explanation, underlying the observed phenotypic changes. In addition, remodeling of the mammary gland after parturition was impaired and expression of GLI1 was associated with accumulation of cellular debris in the mammary ducts during involution, indicating a defect in the clearance of dead cells. Areas with highly proliferative epithelial cells were observed in mammary glands with induced expression of GLI1. Within such areas an increased frequency of cells expressing nuclear Cyclin D1 was observed. Taken together the data support the notion that correct regulation of Hedgehog signaling within the epithelial cell compartment is critical for pregnancy-induced mammary gland development and remodeling.

The molecular details of the Hh signaling pathway have been thoroughly investigated using genetic studies in Drosophila melanogaster (for review see Refs. 1Cohen Jr., M.M. Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2003; 123: 5-28Crossref Scopus (375) Google Scholar and 2Hooper J.E. Scott M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The hh signaling cascade starts by binding of hh to the receptor protein ptc, which abrogates its inhibitory effect on smoothened (smo), a 7-span transmembrane co-receptor protein. The active smo protein signals downstream to a microtubule-associated multiprotein complex resulting in a switch from generation of the proteolytically cleaved repressor form of the transcription factor ci to release of a full-length activator form of ci that enters the nucleus and activates target genes. The Hh signaling pathway is well conserved through evolution. However, it is far more complicated in vertebrates with three Hh genes, Sonic, Indian, and Desert (Shh, Ihh, and Dhh); two ptc genes (Ptch1 and Ptch2); and three ci homologues (Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3). In vertebrates, the Hh signal activates Gli2 initiating transcription of Hh target genes, including Ptch1 and Gli1 (3Bai C.B. Auerbach W. Lee J.S. Stephen D. Joyner A.L. Development. 2002; 129: 4753-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Gli2 and Gli3 can be expressed in the absence of Hh signaling, whereas Gli1 is strictly dependent on Hh signaling for its expression, which makes Gli1 an excellent reporter of active Hh signaling (3Bai C.B. Auerbach W. Lee J.S. Stephen D. Joyner A.L. Development. 2002; 129: 4753-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Bai C.B. Stephen D. Joyner A.L. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Gli2 and Gli3 are bifunctional in that they like ci can be processed into a repressor form and function as transcriptional activators (5Wang Q.T. Holmgren R.A. Development. 2000; 127: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because Gli1 can replace Gli2 function in vivo, it is likely that Gli2 lacks a significant repressor function (6Aza-Blanc P. Lin H. Ruiz i Altaba A. Kornberg T.B. Development. 2000; 127: 4293-4301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gli1 is apparently not proteolytically processed and is acting as a strong transcriptional activator (7Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Maekawa T. Nakafuku M. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8143-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 8Lee J. Platt K.A. Censullo P. Ruiz i Altaba A.

Remarkably, Gli1-/- mice are viable and appear normal, whereas Gli1/Gli2 double mutants have a more severe phenotype than Gli2 mutants indicating that Gli1 and Gli2 have overlapping functions (10Park H.L. Bai C. Platt K.A. Matise M.P. Beeghly A. Hui C.C. Nakashima M. Joyner A.L. Development. 2000; 127: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Hh signaling pathway is essential for the development of numerous tissues and organs including many vertebrate ectodermal appendages that arise as a result of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions (11Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar, 12McMahon A. Ingham P. Tabin C. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 53: 1-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In analogy mammary gland development is dependent on epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and the Hh pathway is emerging as one important factor during mammary gland development (13Hatsell S.J.

Development of the mouse mammary gland is initiated around day 10.5 of embryonic development with the formation of bilateral milk lines running between the fore and hind limbs. Epidermal cells within the milk line become columnar and multilayered, defining a ridge that protrudes above and below the plane of the single layered primitive epidermis. Five pair of placodes are formed at specific locations along the mammary line. Invaginations of cells within the placode into the underlying mesenchyme establish a bud, which elongates and gradually establish a rudimentary ductal tree. During puberty, body and cap cells of the terminal end buds are hormonally stimulated to differentiate and to form an open ductal tree that eventually fills the entire mammary fat pad. During pregnancy, hormonal stimulation alters the morphology of the mammary gland from a ductal to a more lobuloalveolar morphology via branching morphogenesis. At this point, lobuloalveolar progenitor cells in the ducts proliferate and form alveolar buds, which further differentiate into alveoli. After parturition, upon suckling, milk is released until suckling ceases and the gland undergoes involution. During this process most alveolar cells are committed to apoptosis as part of the gland remodeling process. However, a small portion of fully committed alveolar cells escape the involution process and function as alveolar progenitors during subsequent pregnancies (18Wagner K.U. Boulanger C.A. Henry M.D. Sgagias M. Hennighausen L. Smith G.H. Development. 2002; 129: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Hh homologues Shh, Ihh, and Dhh are expressed in the mouse mammary gland (19Kouros-Mehr H. Werb Z. Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 3404-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 20Michno K. Boras-Granic K. Mill P. Hui C.C. Hamel P.A. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Most likely, Ihh and Shh have redundant functions in mammary gland development during embryogenesis, since the embryonic mammary gland develops normally in Shh and Ihh knock-out mice (21Bitgood M.

Biol. 2002; 249: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, it is interesting to note that Ihh expression is regulated by progesterone, one of the key steroid hormones controlling ductal and alveolar development in the mammary gland (23Lee K.

The core components (Shh, Ihh, Dhh, Ptch1, Smo, Gli1, Gli2, Gli3) of the Hh signaling pathway have been reported to be expressed during essentially all stages of mammary gland development (13Hatsell S.J. Cowin P. Development. 2006; 133: 3661-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Lewis M.T. Ross S. Strickland P.A. Sugnet C.W. Jimenez E. Hui C. Daniel C.W. Dev.

Furthermore, the Hedgehog signaling components PTCH1, GLI1, and GLI2 are expressed in normal human mammary progenitor cells (26Liu S. Dontu G. Mantle I.D. Patel S. Ahn N.S. Jackson K.W. Suri P. Wicha M.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6063-6071Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). When it comes to studies of the role of Hh signaling during mammary gland development a complication resides in the fact that homozygous null mutations of several key network genes, including Shh, Ihh, Ptch1, Smo, Sufu, Gli2, and Gli3 are embryonic or perinatally lethal. However, hyperplastic changes appear in mammary glands from virgin heterozygous Ptch1+/- mice, in mice expressing constitutively active Smo in the mammary epithelium, in embryonic mammary transplants from Gli2 null mice, and in humanized fatpads of NOD-SCID mice transplanted with Gli2 overexpressing mammosphere initiating cells (14Lewis M.T.

Furthermore, Gli3xt/xt mutants lack two pairs of mammary buds, which supports a role for Hh signaling during embryonic mammary gland development. In addition, loss of Gli3 expression induces Gli1 mis-expression in the mammary mesenchyme supporting the conclusion that during embryonic mammary gland formation the primary role for Gli3 is to repress Hh inducible target genes (13Hatsell S.J. Cowin P. Development. 2006; 133: 3661-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that targeted expression of GLI1 in the mammary epithelial cell compartment results in a reduced mammary epithelial network and alveologenesis during pregnancy. Transgenic female mice are unable to lactate and on a molecular level, the lack of terminal development and differentiation is reflected by impaired milk (WAP, α-lactalbumin, and β-casein) gene expression. We propose that the effects observed are due to GLI1 induction of Snail coupled to reduced expression of E-cadherin and STAT5, which results in a reduced alveolar differentiation. Strikingly, in subsequent pregnancies, without induced GLI1 expression, the glands do not fully develop and the dams fail to lactate, showing profound and long lasting effects of a temporally restricted GLI1 expression. Moreover, the involution process is impaired in GLI1-induced mammary glands, which may explain the sustained defects in the multiparous mice with induced GLI1 expression only during the first pregnancy. In addition, an increase of Cyclin D1 expression and epithelial cell proliferation rate was observed, which frequently was associated with the formation of expanded clusters of epithelial cells. Transgenic Mice and Genotyping—A tetracycline-regulated GLI1 transgenic construct was made by subcloning a PCR amplified tetracycline responsive promoter consisting of five tetracycline (tet) responsive elements (TRE) and the minimal cytomegalovirus promoter region of pTRELuc (Clontech Inc.) in front of the human full-length GLI1 (human and mouse Gli1 show 85% similarity at the amino acid level). This construct was subcloned into the SalI/BamI-digested Bluescript KS(-) vector (pBSpA) harboring a 0.6-kb fragment of a rabbit β-globin intron and a 1.1-kb fragment containing two 3′-poly(A) signal sequences from the p5′BK5II plasmid, obtained from Dr. Jose Jorcano (CIEMAT, Madrid, Spain). The 3.6-kb fragment of GLI1 cDNA was cleaved with NheI/SnaBI and introduced into the corresponding site of the TRE/pBSA plasmid. The construct was verified by sequencing and tested for its tetracycline inducibility in a reporter-based assay in a 293TetTOn cell line purchased from Clontech. The 5.3-kb transgene was isolated by digestion with NotI/SalI and injected into pronuclei of fertilized [C57BL/6J × CBA] F2 oocytes. The putative founder transgenic mice were genotyped by PCR amplification of sequences specific for the TREGLI1 using tail genomic DNA and primers TREGLI1: R1 primer (5′-CGGTGTCTTCTATGGAGGTCAA-3′), F1 primer (5′-ACCCGGGTCGAGTAGGCGTGTA-3′). Founders were crossed with negative littermates to establish the F1 generation. The level of expression of GLI1 was studied in five transgenic lines by crossing TREGLI1 F1 mice with K5rtTA F1 mice, which carry a mutated form of the reverse tet activator gene downstream of the skin-specific keratin 5 (K5) promoter (27Ramirez A. Bravo A. Jorcano J.L. Vidal M. Differentiation. 1994; 58: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar). As a target line for studies in breast, one of the three TREGLI1 F1 lines that exhibited similar GLI1 expression levels in the skin and profound phenotype was chosen. This TREGLI1 F1 line was crossed with mice carrying the MMTVrtTA promoter upstream of the tet activator gene (28Gunther E.J. Belka G.K. Wertheim G.B. Wang J. Hartman J.L. Boxer R.B. Chodosh L.A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and the offspring were used for the experiments. Doxycycline (2 mg/ml) and 5% sucrose was added to the drinking water and doxycycline treatment was continued until the animal was sacrificed if not stated otherwise. The bitransgenic mice were hemizygous for each transgene and compared with non-treated bigenic animals or WT-treated siblings. Genotyping of mice was performed by PCR and primers for TREGLI1 were as described above and for MMTVrtTA: pA primer (5′-ATCCGCACCCTTGATGACTCCG-3′) and pB primer (5′-GGCT ATCAACCAACACACTGCCAC-3′). All transgenic mice were generated within an SPF barrier facility according to local and national regulations, and experimental conditions were approved by the Stockholm South Animal Ethics Committee. Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was isolated using RNA-zolB (CRP Inc.) and random hexamer-primed complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated using the reverse transcription system (Promega). Primer pairs specific for Ptch1 (Ptch1.f 5′-GAATCCAGGCATCACCCACC-3′, Ptch1.B 5′-CCACGTCCTGCAGCTCAATG-3′), Gli1 (Gli1.a.F 5′-AGACCAGCAGCTGCACTGAA-3′), Gli1.b.B 5′-TGGCAGGTTGCACGTGGTC-3′), rtTA (rtTA-404.F 5′-TGACCTCCATAGAAGACACC-3′, Gli1-474.r 5′-GGGCCCTTTTTGGTGATTCA-3′), and Actin (actin.F 5′-GACAGGATGCAGAAGGAGAT-3′, actin.B 5′-TTGCTGATCCACATCTGCTG-3′) were used for analysis of mRNA levels. All experiments were independently repeated at least three times and no amplification was obtained without reverse transcriptase (data not shown). All cDNA products were resolved by electrophoresis using 1-4% agarose gels. Histological Analysis, Preparation of Mammary Whole Mounts, and TUNEL Assays—Gland fragments from different developmental stages (5 weeks, 10 weeks, 6.5 days of pregnancy (dpc), 18.5 dpc, lactation day 1 (L1, also termed parturition day), lactation day 2 (L2, 1 day after parturition), and involution day 14 (I14, 14 days after parturition)) were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and hematoxylin/eosin stained. Mammary glands for whole mounts were spread on glass slides and fixed 4 h in Carnoy fixative. The tissue slides were sequentially rehydrated 15 min each in a graded ethanol (70, 50, 30, 10%, and H2O) and stained overnight (0.2% (w/v) carmine (Sigma), 0.5% (w/v) aluminum potassium sulfate (Sigma)). The slides were dehydrated 15 min each in a graded ethanol (70, 95, 100%) and Xylene and mounted with Pertex (Histolab). To detect apoptotic nuclei, paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin sections were analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase digoxygenin nick-end labeling using the Apoptag kit (Chemicon) following the manufacturer's instructions. For quantitative analysis 1000 nuclei from three separate areas in three samples were counted. Immunohistochemical Analysis—Mammary glands were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde or Feketes fixative (29Shillingford J.M. Miyoshi K. Robinson G.W. Bierie B. Cao Y. Karin M. Hennighausen L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and paraffin embedded. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene, passed through a graded alcohol series and then either microwaved for 10 min, boiled at 97.5 °C for 30 min in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or trypsinized with Digest-All 2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After rinsing in water, sections were incubated in 2.5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were washed in PBS and blocked in 5% serum in PBS. Sections were incubated with primary antibody in 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, sections used for immunohistochemistry were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) in PBS containing 5% serum, washed in PBS, and incubated with streptavidin peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The sections were washed in PBS, visualized using the DAB substrate kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and counterstained with hematoxylin. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (all 1:300, Molecular Probes) were used for immunofluorescence labeling and the nuclei were stained using 5 μm Draq5 (Alexis Biochemicals). Primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-GLI1 (Abcam), 1:2000; rabbit polyclonal anti-Ptch1 generated using the C-terminal 18 amino acids as antigen (custom made by Research Genetics) 1:200; rabbit polyclonal anti-AQP5 (Alpha Diagnostics) 1:200; rabbit polyclonal anti-Snail (Abcam) 1:800; anti-Laminin (Sigma) 1:100; and rabbit polyclonal anti-Cyclin D1 (Labvision) 1:100. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing Slc12a2 1:1000 and Slc34a2 1:250 were obtained from Dr. Jim Turner (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and Dr. Juerg Biber (University of Zurich, Switzerland), respectively. Detection of BrdUrd (1:25, BD Biosciences), E-cadherin (1:11000, BD Transduction Laboratories), smooth muscle actin (1:50, Novocastra), β-catenin (1:5000, BD Transduction Laboratories), and F4/80 (1:500, Serotec) was performed using mouse monoclonal antibodies and the Histomouse kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. As negative controls, all experiments were performed without the primary antibody in the presence of equal concentrations of normal rabbit, goat, or mouse IgG. Northern Blot Hybridization—RNA from mammary gland tissues was obtained and the Northern blot was performed according to the NorthernMax™ (Ambion) manual. Probes against WAP, α-lactalbumin, β-casein, and Gapdh were a kind gift from Dr. Stephan Teglund (30Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D. Wang D. Brown M. Bodner S. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). All probes were labeled with 32P using the High Prime labeling kit (Roche). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Mammary fat pads were dissected, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Western blot analysis were performed on tissue protein lysates using the primary antibodies anti-GLI1 (1:4,000, Abcam), anti-E-cadherin (1:2,500, BD Biosciences), anti-STAT5 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), or anti-Actin (1:10,000, Sigma) and immunoprecipitated proteins using the primary antibody anti-P-STAT5 (Y694, 1:100 Epitomics) essentially as described else-where (31Agren M. Kogerman P. Kleman M.I. Wessling M. Toftgard R. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 330: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Generation of Mice with Targeted Expression of the Hh Effector GLI1 in the Mammary Gland—To study the influence of a deregulated Hh signaling pathway during postnatal development in the mouse mammary gland, we employed a bigenic transgenic system to express the hedgehog effector GLI1 in the mammary epithelium (Fig. 1A). The reverse tet-responsive transactivator (rtTA) was expressed under the control of a mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV LTR) and administration of doxycycline resulted in activation of the TRE-linked transgene, GLI1. The bitransgenic and WT animals were induced either continuously from mating or starting 3 weeks after birth. The time of GLI1 expression did not influence the phenotypes observed in the GLI1-induced transgenic mammary glands nor did it alter the GLI1 expression levels in the mammary gland during pregnancy as measured by RT-PCR (data not shown). The bigenic doxycycline-treated mice were normal from birth and indistinguishable from their WT littermates in weight, size, development, fertility, and behavior. All mice were genotyped by PCR analysis, confirming the presence of both the TREGLI1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3-6) and the MMTVrtTA allele (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-5, 7, 8, and 10) in the bigenic mice (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3-5). Expression of Hedgehog Pathway Components in WT and GLI1-expressing Mammary Glands—To investigate the expression pattern of Gli1 and Ptch1 in the mammary gland, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed at various developmental stages. The Gli1 primer pair used for RT-PCR was designed to recognize both human and mouse Gli1 mRNA. The RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression of Gli1 and Ptch1 in the mammary gland from doxycycline-treated bigenic mice was enhanced during pregnancy at all time points analyzed (6.5 dpc, 18.5 dpc, and L1), when compared with WT mice (Fig. 1C). In addition, immunohistochemistry revealed enhanced cytosolic and nuclear expression of the GLI1 protein in mammary tissue from GLI1 expressing mice during pregnancy (6.5 and 18.5 dpc) and parturition (L1) when compared with WT mice at the same developmental stage (Fig. 1D, a-f). The GLI1 expression was essentially homogenous in the mammary epithelial cell compartment. However, a small fraction of predominantly luminal cells were GLI1 negative. The Ptch1 expression in the WT and induced bigenic mammary gland followed the GLI1 expression as expected due to the autoregulatory properties of the Hh signaling pathway (Fig. 1D, g-l) (32Hahn H. Wicking C. Zaphiropoulous P.G. Gailani M.R. Shanley S. Chidambaram A. Vorechovsky I. Holmberg E. Unden A.B. Gillies S. Negus K. Smyth I. Pressman C. Leffell D.J. Gerrard B. Goldstein A.M. Dean M. Toftgard R. Chenevix-Trench G. Wainwright B. Bale A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). The GLI1 and Ptch1 expression levels were below detection level in induced bigenic virgin (5 and 10 weeks) mice (data not shown). GLI1-expressing Mice Fail to Lactate—GLI1 transgenic females exposed to doxycycline gave birth to live pups of normal size and number with the expected Mendelian distribution of genotypes. Maternal behavior appeared normal with respect to nursing and the pups showed no craniofacial alterations or apparent neurological defects. All pups, irrespective of genotype, born to GLI1 expressing females died from failure to nurse and consequently no milk spots could be detected (Fig. 1E). The phenotype showed a 100% penetration rate among the GLI1 expressing mothers (n > 30) and could not be compensated for by subsequent pregnancies (n = 10). Furthermore, addition of doxycycline during the second or later pregnancies to previously un-induced females replicated these findings. Non-induced bigenic mice were able to nurse their pups and showed normal development of the mammary glands (data not shown). Expression of GLI1 Impairs the Lobuloalveolar Development of the Mammary Gland—Whole mount and immunohistological analysis were performed at different developmental stages and compared with WT mice. At 5 and 10 weeks of age, analysis of mammary glands from doxycycline-induced bigenic mice showed no alterations when compared with WT animals at the same age and the mammary fat pads were to an equal degree occupied with mammary epithelium (data not shown). In contrast, whole mounts from 6.5 dpc (Fig. 2A, a), 18.5 dpc (Fig. 2A, c), and L1 (Fig. 2A, e) demonstrated that induced bigenic mice had a reduced alveolar network, with minimal side branching and ductal sprouting, when compared with WT mice (6.5 dpc (Fig. 2A, b), 18.5 dpc (Fig. 2A, d), and L1 (Fig. 2A, f)). The number of secretory alveoli was reduced during pregnancy at all time points when compared with WT glands and the bigenic GLI1 expressing alveoli were smaller, with small or closed lumina (Fig. 2A, g-l). Variability in number and size of alveoli in the mammary glands of different bitransgenic females were observed, however, when compared with WT the bitransgenic alveoli were always fewer and less developed.

https://openalex.org/W1990760228,"In this study, we provide novel insight into the mechanism of how ERK2 can be sorted to different intracellular compartments and thereby mediate different responses. MEK1-activated ERK2 accumulated in the nucleus and induced proliferation. Conversely, MEK2-activated ERK2 was retained in the cytoplasm and allowed survival. Localization was a determinant for ERK2 functions since MEK1 switched from providing proliferation to be a mediator of survival when ERK2 was routed to the cytoplasm by the attachment of a nuclear export site. MEK1-mediated ERK2 nuclear translocation and proliferation were shown to depend on phosphorylation of S298 and T292 sites in the MEK1 proline-rich domain. These sites are phosphorylated on cellular adhesion in MEK1 but not MEK2. Whereas p21-activated kinase phosphorylates S298 and thus enhances the MEK1-ERK2 association, ERK2 phosphorylates T292, leading to release of active ERK2 from MEK1. On the basis of these results, we propose that the requirement of adhesion for cells to proliferate in response to growth factors, in part, may be explained by the MEK1 S298/T292 control of ERK2 nuclear translocation. In addition, we suggest that ERK2 intracellular localization determines whether growth factors mediate proliferation or survival and that the sorting occurs in an adhesion-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1971778386,"Inbreeding depression occurs when the offspring produced as a result of matings between relatives show reduced fitness, and is generally understood as a consequence of the elevated expression of deleterious recessive alleles. How inbreeding depression varies across environments is of importance for the evolution of inbreeding avoidance behaviour, and for understanding extinction risks in small populations. However, inbreeding-by-environment (IxE) interactions have rarely been investigated in wild populations.We analysed 41 years of breeding events from a wild great tit (Parus major) population and used 11 measures of the environment to categorise environments as relatively good or poor, testing whether these measures influenced inbreeding depression. Although inbreeding always, and environmental quality often, significantly affected reproductive success, there was little evidence for statistically significant I x E interactions at the level of individual analyses. However, point estimates of the effect of the environment on inbreeding depression were sometimes considerable, and we show that variation in the magnitude of the I x E interaction across environments is consistent with the expectation that this interaction is more marked across environmental axes with a closer link to overall fitness, with the environmental dependence of inbreeding depression being elevated under such conditions. Hence, our analyses provide evidence for an environmental dependence of the inbreeding x environment interaction: effectively an I x E x E.Overall, our analyses suggest that I x E interactions may be substantial in wild populations, when measured across relevant environmental contrasts, although their detection for single traits may require very large samples, or high rates of inbreeding."

However, the mechanisms by which mutant SOD1 contributes to formation of LBHI/Ast-HI in FALS remain poorly defined. Here, we report induction of LBHI/Ast-HI-like hyaline inclusions (LHIs) in vitro by ER stress in neuroblastoma cells. These LHI closely resemble LBHI/Ast-HI in patients with SOD1-linked FALS. LHI and LBHI/Ast-HI share the following features: 1) eosinophilic staining with a pale core, 2) SOD1, ubiquitin and ER resident protein (KDEL) positivity and 3) the presence of approximately 15–25 nm granule-coated fibrils, which are morphological hallmark of mutant SOD1-linked FALS. Moreover, in spinal cord neurons of L84V SOD1 transgenic mice at presymptomatic stage, we observed aberrant aggregation of ER and numerous free ribosomes associated with abnormal inclusion-like structures, presumably early stage neuronal LBHI. We conclude that the LBHI/Ast-HI seen in human patients with mutant SOD1-linked FALS may arise from ER dysfunction."

The ribosome activates the latent GTPase activities of EF-Tu and EF-G. These factors, in turn, regulate protein synthesis by promoting specific molecular movements in the ribosome during protein synthesis.

GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu and EF-G occurs on their G domains, which are similar to one another in their amino acid sequences and their core tertiary structures. The hydrolysis reaction involves in-line nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on the γ-phosphorus of GTP (2Eccleston J.F. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5046-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On EF-Tu (and possibly also EF-G), this reaction is catalyzed by a conserved histidine residue (3Daviter T. Wieden H.J. Rodnina M.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whose side chain is believed to rotate to a position next to the water molecule (4Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In contrast to EF-Tu, EF-G contains a G′ subdomain, which is invariably inserted between α-helices DG and EG (5Czworkowski J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3661-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The G′ subdomain is also present in the same location in EF-2, the eukaryotic cytoplasmic homolog of EF-G (6Jorgensen R. Ortiz P.A. Carr-Schmid A. Nissen P. Kinzy T.G. Andersen G.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the G′ subdomains of EF-G and EF-2 are unrelated in their amino acid sequences and tertiary structures. The functional significance of the G′ subdomain in either factor has not been determined. How the bacterial ribosome activates GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu and EF-G remains obscure. Early research identified L7/L12, 4L7 and L12 refer to the N-acetylated and unacetylated forms of the same protein. 4L7 and L12 refer to the N-acetylated and unacetylated forms of the same protein. a protein component of one of the peripheral stalks of the ribosome, as an important contributor to GTPase activation of both factors (7Kischa K.

More recent studies identified residues of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of L7/L12, important for GTPase activation and rapid association of both factors with the ribosome (9Kothe U. Wieden H.J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12520-12528Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have also been implicated in GTPase activation of these factors. The sites on EF-Tu and EF-G that interact with L7/L12 are only beginning to be elucidated. For EF-Tu, mutational studies identified negatively charged residues in its helix DG that may interact with positively charged residues of L7/L12 (9Kothe U. Wieden H.J. Mohr D. Rodnina M.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1011-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For EF-G, no functional studies of this type have been reported so far. However, two topographic studies indicated that the G′ subdomain of EF-G is proximal to L7/L12. First, residues 209 and 231, flanking helix AG′, of Escherichia coli EF-G were cross-linked to L7/L12 (13Nechifor R. Wilson K.S. J. Mol.

In the same study, no cross-links were detected from two other EF-G residues (156 and 160) of helix DG, whose sequence is completely different from the corresponding helix of EF-Tu. Second, a cryo-EM study localized EF-G residue 209 near the base of the ribosomal stalk, which was interpreted as an interaction with the CTD of L7/L12 (14Datta P.P. Sharma M.R. Qi L. Frank J. Agrawal R.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 723-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This study was undertaken to investigate the potential functional roles of the G′ subdomain of EF-G. We present results from kinetic experiments that provide evidence for interactions between residues of helix AG′ of EF-G and L7/L12, which are important for activating GTP hydrolysis and ribosomal translocation. Materials—E. coli 70 S ribosome and phage T4 gene 32 mRNA were prepared as described (15Wilson K.S. Nechifor R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). L7/L12 was specifically stripped from the ribosome by an ethanol-NH4Cl washing procedure (12Mohr D. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12520-12528Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The extent of L7/L12 stripping was assessed by immunoblotting using a L7/L12 polyclonal antibody (13Nechifor R. Wilson K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1412-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). E. coli tRNAfMet and tRNAPhe were purchased from Sigma. The mRNA, 5′-AAGGAGGUAAAAAUGUUUGCU(N6)-3′, was synthesized by Dharmacon and conjugated at its 3′ end with pyrene as described (16Studer S.M. Feinberg J.S. Joseph S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mant-labeled nucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. Buffers—Buffer 1 consists of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol in water. Buffer 2 consists of 80 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.7), 50 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol in water. Buffer 3 consists of 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.7), 100 mm NH4Cl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol in water. The AlF4- complex consists of 100 μm AlCl3, 10 mm NaF in buffer 2. GTP Binding and Hydrolysis Assays—All fluorescence measurements described below were made by a QM-6 fluorimeter (Photon Technology International). Binding of mant-GTP to EF-G was measured by titrating mant-GTP (1 μm) in 2 ml of buffer 2 with EF-G (0-15 μm). After adding each EF-G aliquot, mixing with a stir bar, and allowing the solution to reach equilibrium, fluorescence (excitation 362 ± 2 nm; emission 438 ± 4 nm) was recorded. Multiple-turnover GTP hydrolysis was assayed as described (13Nechifor R. Wilson K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1412-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. EF-G (0.04 μm) and ribosomes (variable concentration) were preincubated (37 °C, 10 min) in 9 μl of buffer 2. Reactions (10 μl) were started by adding 1 μl of 500 μm GTP (containing 0.05 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP). Samples (2 μl) were withdrawn after appropriate time intervals, during the linear kinetics of the reaction. Samples were quenched and analyzed by TLC as described (13Nechifor R. Wilson K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1412-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Data of GTP molecules hydrolyzed per EF-G molecule/s (vo) as a function of ribosome concentration [R] were calculated and fitted (via SigmaPlot2000 software) to: vo = kcat × [EF-G] × [R]/(KMR + [R]). Multiple-turnover mant-GTP hydrolysis was detected by the fluorescence change between mant-GTP and mant-GDP bound to EF-G. The fluorescence of mant-GTP (120 μm) in 250 μl of buffer 2 was monitored by exciting the fluorophore at 362 nm and detecting its emission at 438 nm. EF-G (25 μm) and vacant ribosomes (0.7 μm) were added in successive steps and mixed by pipetting. Samples (20 μl) were removed from the cuvette and precipitated with 0.2 m HCl. The supernatants of the samples were concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge to ∼8 μl, and 2 μl of each sample (∼500 pmol) was analyzed by TLC (17Wilden B. Savelsbergh A. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13670-13675Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Single-turnover mant-GTP hydrolysis was monitored in a stopped-flow device (MiniMixer, KinTek), which contained two reactant syringes. Syringe A contained 1 ml of 24 μm vacant ribosomes in buffer 2 at ∼22 °C. Syringe B contained 1 ml of 20 μm EF-G and 10 μm mant-GTP (same buffer and temperature). In some experiments, AlF4- complex (100 μm) was included in syringe B. Samples (∼200 μl) from each syringe were rapidly mixed together (dead time of ∼3.5 ms) and injected into a cuvette in our fluorimeter. Fluorescence (excitation 362 ± 2 nm; emission 438 nm ± 4) was monitored over 40-400 s, with measurements taken every 50-1000 ms, depending on the rate constant of the EF-G protein being tested. Data for each reaction were fitted to a single exponential equation, Ft = F∞ + ΔFmax × exp(-kobs × t), where F0 is the initial fluorescence at time = 0; Ft is the fluorescence at time t; ΔFmax is the maximum fluorescence change (F0 - F∞), and kobs is the observed reaction rate constant. Ribosomal Translocation Assays—Multiple-turnover ribosomal translocation was monitored by the toeprinting method (18Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Traut R. Gold L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A pretranslocation complex (1 μm) was formed in 90 μl of buffer 3 with E. coli ribosomes (1 μm) containing phage T4 gene 32 mRNA (0.8 μm) and uncharged tRNAfMet (1.2 μm) and tRNAPhe (1.2 μm) bound in the P and A sites, respectively, of the ribosome (15Wilson K.S. Nechifor R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). EF-G (0.1 μm) and GTP (500 μm) were added, and reactions were incubated at 37 °C. Samples (10 μl) were removed after various time intervals (as indicated) and analyzed by toeprinting (15Wilson K.S. Nechifor R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Single-turnover ribosomal translocation was monitored by the change in fluorescence of mRNA labeled with pyrene at its 3′ end (16Studer S.M. Feinberg J.S. Joseph S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A pretranslocation complex (0.5 μm) was formed in 5 ml of buffer 3, similar to the above complex except substituting pyrene-mRNA (0.4 μm). This complex was divided into five equal aliquots, which were loaded successively into syringe A of the stopped-flow device. Syringe B contained the various EF-G proteins (1.25-12 μm) and GTP (2 mm) in 1.2 ml of buffer 3. Reactions were started by rapidly mixing 200 μl samples from each syringe. Fluorescence (excitation 332 ± 4 nm; emission 377 ± 8 nm) was monitored over 200-300 s, with averaged measurements taken every 60-200 ms, depending on the rate constant of the EF-G protein being tested. Data were fitted to a double exponential equation: Ft = F∞ +ΔF1 × exp(-k1 × t) + ΔF2 × exp(-k2 × t). Observed translocation rates as a function of EF-G concentration were fitted to Reaction 1. A1+B1k1[A1]⇄k-1A1·B1k2→A2·B1k3→A2·B2REACTION 1 where A1 = EF-G·GTP; A2 = EF-G·GDP; B1 = pretranslocational complex; B2 = post-translocational complex; kobs = A1/(C1 × A1 + C2); C1 = (k2 + k3)/k2 × k3; and C2 = (k-1 + k2)/k1 × k2. To investigate the function of the G′ subdomain, we first genetically replaced the entire subdomain of E. coli EF-G (residues 166-261) with a single Gly residue. The N- and C-terminal ends of the G′ subdomain are closely juxtaposed in the x-ray crystal structures of Thermus thermophilus EF-G proteins (5Czworkowski J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3661-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 19Connell S.R. Takemoto C. Wilson D.N. Wang H. Murayama K. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Rost M. Schuler M. Giesebrecht J. Dabrowski M. Mielke T. Fcini P. Yokoyama S. Spahn C.M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 751-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting that this deletion would not perturb the folding of the rest of EF-G. We introduced this genetic deletion into a plasmid encoding E. coli EF-G with a C-terminal His6 tag (15Wilson K.S. Nechifor R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the mutant protein could be produced at high levels in E. coli, it aggregated in cellular inclusion bodies, and we were unable to refold it after purification under denaturing conditions. We then replaced single amino acid residues of the G′ subdomain. In selecting these mutations, we considered three sources of information as follows: (i) our previous cross-linking results indicating the proximity of L7/L12 to EF-G residues 209 and 231, which flank helix AG′ (13Nechifor R. Wilson K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1412-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); (ii) an alignment of the amino acid sequences of the G′ subdomain from bacterial and mitochondrial phyla (supplemental Fig. 1); and (iii) a study identifying conserved, positively charged residues of L7/L12 important for EF-G GTPase activity (10Diaconu M. Kothe U. Schlunzen F. Fischer N. Harms J.M. Tonevitsky A.G. Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Wahl M.C. Cell. 2005; 121: 991-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), suggesting that L7/L12 interacts with conserved, negatively charged residues of EF-G. The G′ subdomain is generally poorly conserved in relation to other EF-G domains. We chose to mutate the three most conserved, negatively charged residues corresponding to Glu-224, Glu-228, and Glu-231 of E. coli EF-G. In the structures of T. thermophilus EF-G proteins, residues equivalent to Glu-224 and Glu-228 are located within helix AG′, and the residue equivalent to Glu-231 is at the N terminus of helix BG′ (Fig. 1). The side chains of all three residues are exposed to solvent. We replaced these Glu residues with oppositely charged Lys residues, either individually or in combination, hoping that these mutations would repel interactions with L7/L12. The His6-tagged EF-G proteins (four G′ mutants and wild type) were produced and purified under native conditions (15Wilson K.S. Nechifor R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). G′ Mutations Hinder Ribosome-activated GTP Hydrolysis—We first examined the GTP hydrolysis activities of the purified EF-G proteins, activated by vacant ribosomes (lacking tRNA and mRNA). Experiments were performed under multiple-turnover conditions of fixed EF-G concentration (0.04 μm), saturating GTP concentration (500 μm), and increasing ribosome concentration. As shown in Fig. 2A, the initial velocity (vo) of GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by wild type EF-G increased with increasing ribosome concentrations up to ∼2 μm, followed by a drop in vo at higher ribosome concentrations, because of turnover inhibition effects as reported previously (20Rohrback M.S. Bodley J.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4565-4569Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based on fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data up to 2 μm ribosome, wild type EF-G and the E231K mutant displayed nearly the same turnover (kcat = 9.9 and 7.7 s-1, respectively) and apparent ribosome binding (Km = 0.91 and 1.5 μm). In contrast, the other three G′ mutants, E224K, E228K, and the triple Lys mutant (TK), were severely defective, to the extent that their vo values were not measurable at any ribosome concentration above a control reaction containing only the ribosome. The latter three G′ mutants were specifically defective in ribosome-activated GTP hydrolysis. In the absence of the ribosome, the basal GTPase activities of all four G′ mutants varied between ∼3 × 10-4 and 3 × 10-3 s-1, slightly faster than ∼4 × 10-4 s-1 for the wild type protein, at the same EF-G and GTP concentrations indicated above (data not shown). Under multiple-turnover conditions, the defects in ribosome-activated GTP hydrolysis could, in principle, be manifested at one or several kinetic steps in the uncoupled GTPase reaction cycle (20Rohrback M.S. Bodley J.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4565-4569Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We could exclude effects on the initial binding of GTP to EF-G, as all four G′ mutants bound a fluorescent substrate derivative, mant-GTP, with affinities (Kd values: 2.2-3.7 μm) that were indistinguishable from the wild type (Fig. 2B). To try to localize the defects of the G′ mutants to specific steps in the reaction cycle, we sought a GTPase kinetic assay performed under single-turnover conditions. Using mant-GTP as a fluorescent reporter, we observed that its fluorescence increased substantially when wild type EF-G was added (Fig. 3A), as reported previously (21Savelsbergh A. Mohr D. Wilden B. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 890-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). When we subsequently added a limiting amount of the ribosome, the fluorescence gradually dropped to a lower plateau. This suggested that mant-GTP was slowly hydrolyzed to mant-GDP, although it was bound to EF-G, activated by a limiting amount of ribosome that was recycled. To test this hypothesis, we removed three samples (S1, S2, and S3) at different time points during the fluorescence decay. These samples were immediately quenched by acid precipitation and subsequently analyzed by TLC (Fig. 3B). According to the mobilities of known molecular markers resolved on the same TLC, S1 (taken after EF-G addition) contained only mant-GTP; S2 (taken after ribosome addition, near the end of the fluorescence decay) contained mostly mant-GDP and small amounts of mant-GTP, and S3 (taken in the fluorescence plateau) contained only mant-GDP. Thus, these experiments clearly show that the fluorescence decrease was because of mant-GTP hydrolysis. The fluorescence decrease of the mant group presumably reflects a conformational change in EF-G. It is unclear whether this occurs during cleavage of the phosphoanhydride bond or during the subsequent release of the Pi product from EF-G. To characterize the mechanism further, we monitored single-turnover mant-GTP hydrolysis by using a stopped flow device that rapidly mixed EF-G·mant-GTP with a stoichiometric amount of the ribosome. We compared reactions in the presence or absence of AlF4-, an analog of the planar transition state structure of the γ-phosphate leaving group, which binds tightly to many G protein·GDP complexes. Under single-turnover conditions, the fluorescence signal decayed exponentially with much faster kinetics and similar in amplitude (Fig. 3C). When AlF4- was included with EF-G·mant-GTP before mixing them with the ribosome, the rapid fluorescence decrease was followed by an increase, which was slower and smaller in amplitude. As a positive control, when EF-G·mant-GDP and AlF4- were mixed with the ribosome, only a larger fluorescence increase was observed. As a negative control, when EF-G·mant-GDP was mixed with the ribosome, a smaller fluorescence increase was observed. Collectively, these results suggest that the initial fluorescence decrease encompasses both mant-GTP hydrolysis and Pi release from EF-G. The subsequent fluorescence increase is because of AlF4- binding to EF-G·mant-GDP, which follows Pi release. The small fluorescence increase seen in the negative control most likely reflects binding of EF-G·mant-GDP to the ribosome. We then applied the above assay to compare the G′ mutants and wild type EF-G proteins in catalyzing mant-GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 4). Under single-turnover conditions, wild type EF-G catalyzed this reaction with kobs of 1.8 s-1 (Table 1). This value is ∼10-fold slower than previously reported for Pi release (20 s-1), and much slower than GTP hydrolysis (80 s-1), as measured by other methods under comparable conditions (22Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Mohr D. Peske F. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1517-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These comparisons further suggest that the fluorescence decrease is not caused by the hydrolysis reaction itself, but rather because of a slower EF-G conformational change that follows Pi release. Alternatively, the slower rate may arise from the mant group partially interfering with the hydrolysis reaction.TABLE 1Functional effects of stripping L7/L12 from the ribosome Values represent the averages ± S.D. of three or four independent reactions (stopped flow injections).+EF-GMant-GTP hydrolysis, kobsmRNA translocation, kobs+L7/L12–L7/L12+L7/L12–L7/L12s–1s–1Wild type1.8 ± 0.10.149 ± 0.0070.58 ± 0.020.067 ± 0.004E224K0.028 ± 0.0010.027 ± 0.0010.055 ± 0.0030.051 ± 0.006E228K0.027 ± 0.0010.024 ± 0.0010.059 ± 0.0020.050 ± 0.005E231K0.8 ± 0.10.088 ± 0.0030.27 ± 0.010.057 ± 0.006TK0.009 ± 0.0010.022 ± 0.0010.029 ± 0.0010.029 ± 0.001 Open table in a new tab Regardless of the precise explanation, the G′ mutants showed substantially reduced rates of mant-GTP hydrolysis, in comparison to wild type EF-G (Table 1). The most defective single G′ mutants were E224K and E228K, whose kobs values were both 65-fold lower than wild type. The E231K mutant was the most active, with kobs only 2-fold lower than wild type, in accord with the multiple-turnover GTP hydrolysis assay (Fig. 2A). The TK mutant was the most defective of all, with kobs that was 200-fold lower than wild type. However, the TK mutant still displayed significant ribosome-activated GTPase activity, relative to controls of the ribosome alone (Fig. 4) and the basal GTPase activity of the TK mutant in the absence of the ribosome. In summary, results from multiple- and single-turnover assays both identified mutants E224K and E228K as having large defects in GTP hydrolysis. The single-turnover assays provide the more direct and accurate measurements, but they are ambiguous with regard to effects on hydrolysis or Pi release. It is also possible that the apparent defects in mant-GTP hydrolysis are manifested because of an impaired association of G′ mutants with the ribosome. The latter possibility is addressed below. G′ Mutations Reduce Ribosomal Translocation Kinetics—Previous studies have indicated that GTP hydrolysis by EF-G is strongly coupled to ribosomal translocation, the coordinated movement of tRNA and mRNA in the ribosomal cavity. Upon binding of EF-G·GTP to a pretranslocational ribosome complex, GTP hydrolysis occurs rapidly (23Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Wintermeyer W. Nature. 1997; 385: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), which is thought to induce conformational rearrangements in the complex that drive the subsequent steps of Pi release from EF-G·GDP and translocation (22Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Mohr D. Peske F. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1517-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 24Katunin V.I. Savelsbergh A. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12806-12812Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although translocation can occur in the presence of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs, GTP hydrolysis strongly promotes translocation both kinetically and thermodynamically (24Katunin V.I. Savelsbergh A. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12806-12812Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Pan D. Kirillov S.V. Cooperman B.S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Given the effects of the G′ mutations on GTP hydrolysis activated by the vacant ribosome, we reasoned that these mutations might also exert effects on translocation if, as in the wild type situation, GTP hydrolysis and translocation remain strongly coupled mechanisms. We assembled a pretranslocational ribosome complex that contained a model mRNA and two tRNAs bound in the A and P sites of the ribosome (15Wilson K.S. Nechifor R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We first measured translocation in the toeprinting assay, which monitors the position and movement of the ribosome relative to its bound mRNA, as detected by reverse transcription of a DNA primer annealed to the mRNA downstream of the ribosome (18Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Traut R. Gold L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Because reverse transcription is much slower than ribosomal translocation, we examined translocation reactions under multiple-turnover conditions of limiting EF-G (0.1 μm), saturating GTP (500 μm), and pretranslocational complex (1 μm). Fig. 5 compares ribosomal translocation profiles catalyzed by wild type EF-G and the TK mutant. At the start of reactions, the pretranslocational complex was indicated by two primer extension products, a major one stopping at +17 and minor one at +16, relative to the initiation codon of the mRNA. Following addition of wild type EF-G and GTP, the +17 product was converted rapidly (within the 1st min) to a +19 product, indicating the post-translocational complex. The +16 product was converted more slowly to the same +19 product. Following addition of TK and GTP, both +16 and +17 products were converted to the +19 product at about the same kinetics and much slower than the wild type reaction. The E224K and E228K mutants catalyzed slower translocation similar to the TK mutant, whereas E231K catalyzed faster translocation between the rates of wild type and TK (supplemental Fig. 2). To measure accurately the kinetics of translocation under single-turnover conditions, we took advantage of a fluorescence assay that monitors the movement of pyrene attached to the 3′ end of a short mRNA that just spans the ribosome (16Studer S.M. Feinberg J.S. Joseph S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A pretranslocational complex (0.5 μm) containing pyrene-labeled mRNA and the same two tRNAs was rapidly mixed with wild type EF-G (1.25 μm) and saturating GTP. The fluorescence decay associated with translocation followed distinctly biphasic kinetics (supplemental Fig. 3). In the first phase of the reaction, kobs was 0.58 s-1, whereas kobs of the second phase was 0.056 s-1. It should be noted that the rate constant of the faster phase is comparable with the original report (16Studer S.M. Feinberg J.S. Joseph S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) but slower than reported in other studies (22Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Mohr D. Peske F. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Mol.

Alignment of sequences of the M1 family members led to the identification of Asp-221 as a significant residue of APA among the family members. Replacement of Asp-221 with Asn or Gln resulted in a loss of Ca2+ responsiveness toward synthetic substrates. These enzymes were also unresponsive to Ca2+ when peptide hormones, such as angiotensin II, cholecystokinin-8, neurokinin B, and kallidin, were employed as substrates. These results suggest that the negative charge of Asp-221 is essential for Ca2+ modulation of the enzymatic activity of APA and causes preferential cleavage of acidic amino acid at the N-terminal end of substrate peptides.

The extracellular domain of APA is composed of two subdomains, a 107-kDa catalytic domain containing an HEXXH motif and a 45-kDa C-terminal domain (19Hesp J.R. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3000-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain is required for the dimerization of the enzyme and acts as an intramolecular chaperone necessary for the correct folding, intracellular trafficking, and activity of the enzyme (20Ofner L.D.

It has also been identified as a murine B lymphocyte differentiation antigen (BP-1/6C3) and a human kidney (gp160) differentiation antigen (16Wu Q. Lahti J.M. Air G.M. Burrows P.D. Cooper M.D. Proc.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7069-7073Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Employing highly selective APA and APN inhibitors, Reaux et al. (12Reaux A. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. David C. Zini S. Roques B. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13415-13420Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) elucidated the important roles of these two enzymes in the renin-angiotensin system. It was shown that APA is responsible for the conversion of Ang II to Ang III in the brain, and then Ang III mediates the increase in blood pressure. These results indicate that APA is an important regulator of blood pressure and a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension. To develop a targeting molecule, it is important to clarify the structural features of the enzyme.It was shown that Ca2+ up- or down-regulates the enzymatic activity of APA, depending on the substrates tested (22Danielsen E.M. Noren O. Sjostrom H. Ingram J. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1980; 189: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Goto Y. Hattori A. Ishii Y. Mizutani S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23503-23513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although the enzyme has rather broad specificity toward synthetic substrates in the absence of Ca2+, acidic amino acids are preferentially released in the presence of 1.0 mm Ca2+, indicating that Ca2+ modulates the substrate specificity of APA, increasing its preference for the acidic amino acids, and thus functions as a blood pressure regulator through conversion of Ang II to Ang III (23Goto Y. Hattori A. Ishii Y. Mizutani S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23503-23513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Among the M1 family of aminopeptidases, APA is the only enzyme whose activity is modulated by Ca2+.It is well known that the extracellular concentration of Ca2+ is strictly regulated and, in general, maintained at ∼1.0–2.0 mm. Since the catalytic domain of APA is exposed to and functions in extracellular fluids, it is reasonable to assume that the Ca2+-mediated preference of the enzyme to the N-terminal acidic amino acids of substrates has some physiological and/or pathological relevance (24Wang J. Cooper M.D. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 1002-1005Google Scholar).In this study, we searched for an amino acid residue of human APA (hAPA) responsible for Ca2+ modulation. We identified Asp-221 as a responsive residue. Replacement of Asp-221 with either Asn or Gln caused an almost complete loss of Ca2+ modulation of hAPA. Our data indicate that Asp-221 is essential for Ca2+ modulation and plays an important role in the enzymatic properties of hAPA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis—The cDNAs encoding for mutant hAPAs were generated by two-step PCR. PCRs were carried out in 0.2-ml tubes with a 30-μl reaction volume. First PCR was performed out for one cycle at 98 °C for 3.5 min, followed by 15 cycles at 95 °C for 0.5 min, at 55 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 2 min using Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). Sense primer A (5′-CACCAACTCCTAAAAAACCGCCACCATGAATCTACTTCTGATCC-3′), containing an initial CACC sequence for directional cloning and initiation ATG codon (underlined) and antisense primers complementary to the desired sequences were employed for the amplification of upstream fragments. Downstream fragments with the sequence for His6 tag at the 3′-end were amplified using mutagenic sense primers and primer B (5′-TTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGACCACTCTCAAGTAA-3′).The two products of these reactions were used as templates for the second round of PCR. Secondary PCR was carried out with primers A and B for 1 cycle at 98 °C for 3.5 min, followed by 25 cycles at 95 °C for 0.5 min, at 55 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 2 min. The resultant products were inserted into the entry vector, pENTR-D-TOPO, using a TOPO-cloning system (Invitrogen). The products were confirmed by automated sequencing on an Applied Biosystems model 377 DNA sequencer.Expression and Purification of a Soluble Form of Wild-type and Mutant Human APAs in a Baculovirus System—Expression of soluble forms of wild-type and mutant APAs were performed by the method described previously (23Goto Y. Hattori A. Ishii Y. Mizutani S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23503-23513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In brief, the cDNA for soluble forms of wild-type and mutant hAPAs was transferred into a baculovirus transfer vector, pDEST8, using LR clonase (Invitrogen). Then the plasmid was introduced into DH10Bac cells to produce recombinant bacmid DNA containing the cDNA for the soluble form of APA. Next, Sf-9 cells were transfected with the bacmid using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen), and after 72 h, recombinant baculoviruses were harvested. For the expression of the soluble forms of hAPAs, Sf-9 cells (2.0 × 106/ml) infected with the recombinant baculovirus (multiplicity of infection of ∼1–3) were cultured for 72 h in 100 ml of SFM-900 III medium (Invitrogen) at 27 °C.The conditioned medium was collected, dialyzed against 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5), and then applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) column (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted with 200 mm NaCl. The hAPA-containing fractions were pooled, applied to a Co2+-charged chelating Toyopearl (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) column (1.0 × 10 cm), and then eluted with 200 mm imidazole. The active fractions were collected, concentrated, and subjected to further analysis.Measurement of Aminopeptidase Activity of APA—The aminopeptidase activity of the recombinant hAPA was determined with various fluorogenic aminoacyl-4-metheylcoumaryl-7-amides (aminoacyl-MCAs) as substrates. Typically, the reaction mixture containing various concentrations of aminoacyl-MCA and the enzyme in 0.5 ml of 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) with or without 1.0 mm Ca2+ ion was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 2.5 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.3) containing 0.1 m sodium monochloroacetate. The amount of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin released was measured by spectrofluorophotometry (F-2000; Hitachi) at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm and shown as arbitrary units. The kinetic parameters were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. The results are represented by Km, kcat, and kcat/Km values. Ki values were calculated from the Dixon plot using Glu-MCA as a substrate. In this study, each enzyme was used at either 0.5 or 1.0 μg/ml. Enzymatic activity was not affected by dilution, since there was no difference between activity measured in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin. All measurements were performed in triplicate.Cleavage of Peptide Hormones by APA—Peptide hormones (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) (25 μm) were incubated with the enzyme (1.0 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl. The reaction was terminated by adding 2.5% (v/v) formic acid. The peptides generated were separated by reverse phase HPLC (AT-10; Shimazu) on a COSMOSIL (4.6 × 250-mm) column (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The buffers used for the isocratic separation of the peptides were as follows: for the peptides from Ang II or kallidin, 19% acetonitrile containing 0.086% trifluoroacetic acid; for the peptides from CCK8 or neurokinin B, 35% acetonitrile containing 0.083% trifluoroacetic acid. The molecular masses of peptides were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS with a REFLEX mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytik) using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix.Molecular Modeling of Human APA—The recently published x-ray crystallographic structures of human leukotriene A4 hydrolase (25Thunnissen M.M.G.M. Nordlund P. Haeggstrom J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and Thermoplasma acidophilum TIFF3 (Tricorn-interacting factor F3) (26Kyrieleis O.J.P. Goettig P. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 787-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were used as templates for modeling the catalytic site of hAPA using the SWISS-MODEL Internet server. The structure was displayed using the CueMol program (R. Ishitani, CueMol: Molecular Visualization Framework).Materials—Asp-, Gln-, and Glu-MCAs were purchased from BACHEM AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Ala-, Arg-, Leu-, Lys-, and Met-MCAs and all peptide hormones were obtained from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Amastatin was purchased from Sigma.RESULTSIdentification of a Residue Responsive to Ca2+ Modulation of APA—Among the M1 family of aminopeptidases, only APA is modulated in its enzymatic activity by Ca2+. To identify a residue responsible for Ca2+ modulation, we reasoned that the critical residue should be polar as a Ca2+-binding residue and unique among the family. We also postulated that the corresponding residue should be important for the enzymatic activity of the family members. Hence, we searched for a residue conserved among all of the M1 aminopeptidases except for APA. As shown in Fig. 1, alignment of the M1 family indicated that Asp-221 of hAPA is significant in that all other members of the family besides leukocyte-derived arginine aminopeptidase and aminopeptidase O carry Gln at the corresponding site (27Tanioka T. Hattori A. Masuda S. Nomura Y. Nakayama H. Mizutani. S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32275-32283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of this residue in the Ca2+-responsive enzymatic activity of hAPA hereafter.Preparation of Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes—To elucidate the significance of Asp-221 in the Ca2+ modulation as well as the enzymatic activity of hAPA, wild-type, and mutant hAPAs carrying a single substitution of this residue (i.e. D221E, D221Q, D221N, and D221A hAPAs) were transiently expressed in a baculovirus system and purified to homogeneity on SDS-PAGE. As expected, all of the enzymes showed a single band with apparent molecular masses of ∼115 kDa in the reducing condition (data not shown).Characterization of the Hydrolytic Activities of Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes toward Synthetic Substrates—Fig. 2 shows enzymatic activity of wild-type and mutant hAPAs toward various synthetic substrates measured in the presence or absence of Ca2+. The hydrolytic activity of wild-type enzyme toward Glu-MCA was up-regulated 2.1-fold, and that toward Gln-MCA was reduced to 15% in the presence of 1.0 mm Ca2+, confirming Ca2+ modulation of this enzyme as reported previously (23Goto Y. Hattori A. Ishii Y. Mizutani S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23503-23513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When the enzymatic activity of D221E hAPA was tested, this mutant still retained some Ca2+ modulation, although the overall hydrolytic activity was significantly lower. Namely, Ca2+ caused a 30% enhancement of hydrolytic activity toward Glu-MCA and a 52% decrease toward Gln-MCA compared with the mutant activity in the absence of Ca2+. On the other hand, both D221Q and D221N hAPAs revealed no Ca2+ modulation at all, although they retained Glu-MCA hydrolytic activity comparable with that of wild-type enzyme in the absence of Ca2+. The enzymatic activity of D221A hAPA was significantly reduced. This mutant also lost Ca2+ modulation. These results strongly suggested that Asp is the most favorable residue at amino acid 221 of hAPA, both for its enzymatic activity and Ca2+ modulation.FIGURE 2Enzymatic activities of wild-type and mutant hAPAs toward synthetic peptides. Purified enzymes (1.0 μg/ml) were incubated with various aminoacyl-MCA substrates (50 μm) for 15 min in the presence (black bar) or absence (white bar) of 1.0 mm CaCl2. Results are expressed as arbitrary units. Each bar shows the mean ± S.D. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table 1 shows the kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant hAPAs toward Glu-MCA measured in the presence or absence of 1.0 mm Ca2+. Ca2+ decreased the Km values and thus enhanced the catalytic efficiency of both wild-type and D221E hAPAs. Two mutant enzymes, D221N and D221E hAPAs have values comparable with wild-type hAPA in all kinetic parameters in the absence of Ca2+. Moreover, Ca2+ had little effect on the parameters to these mutants. D221E and D221A hAPAs had lower aminopeptidase activity due to the decrease in the affinity and the turnover numbers, causing a significant decrease in the catalytic efficiency to the substrates.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant hAPAs toward Glu-MCA Kinetic parameters were determined from a Lineweaver-Burk plot.

(n = 3) Open table in a new tab We then examined the effects of Ca2+ and Zn2+ on the enzymatic activities of wild-type, D221E, and D221N hAPAs. As shown in Fig. 3A, Ca2+ enhanced the hydrolytic activity of wild-type enzyme in a dose-dependent manner, with the maximum activity obtained at around 0.1 mm, as reported previously (23Goto Y. Hattori A. Ishii Y. Mizutani S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23503-23513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). D221E hAPA activity was also enhanced clearly by Ca2+ in a dose-dependent manner, although it was less responsive than that of wild-type. On the other hand, Ca2+ had little influence on the enzymatic activity of D221N hAPA, even at concentrations as high as 2.5 mm.FIGURE 3Effects of Ca2+ and Zn2+ on the enzymatic activity of wild-type and mutant hAPAs. Purified enzymes (1.0 μg/ml) were incubated with 50 μm Glu-MCA for 15 min in the presence of various concentrations of CaCl2 (A) or ZnCl2 (B). The hydrolytic activity measured in the absence of metal ions was taken as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although the mechanism is unknown, Zn2+ is a strong and general inhibitor of the M1 family of aminopeptidases (3Tsujimoto M. Hattori A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, Zn2+ inhibited the enzymatic activities of these three enzymes equally, indicating the specific role of Asp-221 in the Ca2+ modulation.Effects of Ca2+ on the Hydrolytic Activities of Wild-type and D221N hAPAs toward Peptide Substrates—We compared hydrolytic activities of wild-type and D221N hAPAs toward natural hormones that were cleaved by the enzyme. It was shown that Ca2+ enhances the hydrolytic activity of hAPA toward several peptides having acidic amino acids at their N-terminal ends, such as Ang II, CCK8, and neurokinin B (23Goto Y. Hattori A. Ishii Y. Mizutani S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23503-23513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Fig. 4 compares the cleavage of Ang II by wild-type and D221N hAPAs. The wild-type enzyme cleaved 90% Ang II to Ang III within 20 min in this assay system in the presence of 1.0 mm Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+, the conversion to Ang III was only 41%, indicating that the cleavage of Ang II to Ang III by the enzyme is Ca2+-responsive, as reported previously (23Goto Y. Hattori A. Ishii Y. Mizutani S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23503-23513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, conversion of Ang II to Ang III by Ca2+-irresponsive D221N hAPA was nearly the same both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, indicating that, as in the case with synthetic substrates, hydrolytic activity of this mutant enzyme toward Ang II was not modulated by Ca2+. However, to our surprise, irrespective of the presence of Ca2+, hydrolytic activity of D221N hAPA was comparable with that of wild-type enzyme measured in the presence of Ca2+. D221N hAPA cleaved 89% Ang II in the presence of Ca2+, and 98% conversion was observed in its absence. A similar tendency was observed when the concentration of the mutant was reduced. Almost the same result was obtained with D221Q hAPA. It should be noted that probably because of decreased enzymatic activity, Ca2+-mediated enhancement of the hydrolytic activity of D221E hAPA toward Ang II was barely detectable in the same assay (data not shown). As expected, the hydrolytic activity of D221A hAPA was significantly reduced and also irresponsive to Ca2+ (data not shown).FIGURE 4Cleavage of angiotensin II by wild-type and mutant hAPAs. Ang II (25 μm) was incubated with purified enzymes (1.0 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min in the presence or in the absence of 1.0 mm CaCl2. The peptides generated were loaded onto an HPLC column and separated, and their amino acid sequences were determined by MALDI-TOF MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The hydrolytic activities of wild-type and D221N hAPAs toward CCK8 and neurokinin B were then compared (Fig. 5). As shown previously (23Goto Y. Hattori A. Ishii Y. Mizutani S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23503-23513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), Ca2+ enhanced the hydrolytic activity of wild-type enzyme toward these substrates. Again, D221N hAPA was rather irresponsive to Ca2+, with comparable activity observed both in the presence and absence of Ca2+. However, in contrast to Ang II, irrespective of the presence of Ca2+, the hydrolytic activities of this mutant enzyme were comparable with those of wild type measured in the absence of Ca2+, suggesting that the activity remained low despite the presence of Ca2+. Taken together, Asp-221 of the wild-type hAPA is crucial for Ca2+ modulation of the enzymatic activity toward peptide substrates with an acidic amino acid at their N-terminal ends as well as toward synthetic substrates.FIGURE 5Cleavage of cholecystokinin-8 and neurokinin B by wild-type and D221N hAPAs. CCK8 (25 μm)(A) and neurokinin B (25 μm)(B) were incubated with purified enzymes (0.5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of 1.0 mm CaCl2.

Chem. 2006; 281: 23503-23513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), Ca2+ reduced the activity of wild-type enzyme. Although 74% conversion was observed within 20 min in the absence of Ca2+, only 37% was observed with Ca2+. On the other hand, the enzymatic activity of D221N hAPA toward kallidin was rather high both in the presence (80% conversion) and absence (96% conversion) of Ca2+, indicating that D221N hAPA is also less responsive to the ion than wild-type in this conversion assay. The converting activity of D221N hAPA was slightly higher than that of wild type measured in the absence of Ca2+, suggesting that the mutant enzyme retained high activity irrespective of the presence of Ca2+. These results indicate that Asp-221 is also responsible for Ca2+ down-regulation of hAPA activity toward kallidin, which has a basic amino acid at the N-terminal end.FIGURE 6Conversion of kallidin to bradykinin by wild-type and D221N hAPAs. Kallidin (25 μm) was incubated with purified APAs (0.5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min in the presence or absence of 1.0 mm CaCl2.

In the absence of Ca2+, D221N hAPA showed values in all kinetic parameters comparable with those of wild-type enzyme toward CCK8 and neurokinin B. On the other hand, this mutant had higher affinity toward Ang II and higher turnover numbers toward kallidin, causing higher catalytic efficiency than wild-type enzyme in the absence of Ca2+.

https://openalex.org/W2090982930,"Calcium levels in the presynaptic nerve terminal are altered by several pathways, including voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, Ca2+-ATPase, and the mitochondria. The influx pathway for homeostatic control of [Ca2+]i in the nerve terminal has been unclear. One approach to detecting the pathway that maintains internal Ca2+ is to test for activation of Ca2+ influx following Ca2+ depletion. Here, we demonstrate that a constitutive influx pathway for Ca2+ exists in presynaptic terminals to maintain internal Ca2+ independent of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and Na+/Ca2+ exchange, as measured in intact isolated nerve endings from mouse cortex and in intact varicosities in a neuronal cell line using fluorescence spectroscopy and confocal imaging. The Mg2+ and lanthanide sensitivity of the influx pathway, in addition to its pharmacological and short hairpin RNA sensitivity, and the results of immunostaining for transient receptor potential (TRP) channels indicate the involvement of TRPC channels, possibly TRPC5 and TRPC1. This constitutive Ca2+ influx pathway likely serves to maintain synaptic function under widely varying levels of synaptic activity. Calcium levels in the presynaptic nerve terminal are altered by several pathways, including voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, Ca2+-ATPase, and the mitochondria. The influx pathway for homeostatic control of [Ca2+]i in the nerve terminal has been unclear. One approach to detecting the pathway that maintains internal Ca2+ is to test for activation of Ca2+ influx following Ca2+ depletion. Here, we demonstrate that a constitutive influx pathway for Ca2+ exists in presynaptic terminals to maintain internal Ca2+ independent of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and Na+/Ca2+ exchange, as measured in intact isolated nerve endings from mouse cortex and in intact varicosities in a neuronal cell line using fluorescence spectroscopy and confocal imaging. The Mg2+ and lanthanide sensitivity of the influx pathway, in addition to its pharmacological and short hairpin RNA sensitivity, and the results of immunostaining for transient receptor potential (TRP) channels indicate the involvement of TRPC channels, possibly TRPC5 and TRPC1. This constitutive Ca2+ influx pathway likely serves to maintain synaptic function under widely varying levels of synaptic activity. Regulation of cytosolic [Ca2+] in the presynaptic nerve terminal is critical to synaptic transmission. The primary means by which presynaptic [Ca2+]i is increased from basal resting levels is through activation of an array of local voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) 6The abbreviations used are: VGCC, voltage-gated calcium channel; CICR, calcium-induced calcium release; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; SOC, store-operated channel; TRP, transient receptor potential; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; RNAi, interfering RNA. (1Reid C.A. Bekkers J.M. Clements J.D. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 683-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) in response to the wave of depolarization of an invading action potential. In a variety of preparations, it has also been shown that Ca2+ release from internal stores in the presynaptic terminal, mainly through a ryanodine-sensitive pathway (via Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release; CICR), contributes to regulation of synaptic neurotransmitter release (reviewed in Ref. 2Bouchard R. Pattarini R. Geiger J.D. Prog. Neurobiol. 2003; 69: 391-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), mainly as a function of action potential frequency or, in some cases, presynaptic receptor action (3Brain K.L. Trout S.J.

Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Following bursts of activity, partial store depletion may thus occur, necessitating the replenishment of the internal Ca2+ stores to restore resting homeostasis in the terminal. In addition, changes in external [Ca2+] as a result of synaptic activity (6Nicholson C. Bruggencate G.T. Steinberg R. Stockle H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1287-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 7Nicholson C. Fed. Proc. 1980; 39: 1519-1523PubMed Google Scholar, 8Benninger C. Kadis J. Prince D.A.

Physiol. 1999; 521: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), may alter presynaptic [Ca2+]i homeostasis, as will various pathological conditions (e.g. hypoparathyroidism, secondary to hypomagnesia). In non-neuronal cells, various store-operated channels (SOCs) appear to function in the maintenance of internal Ca2+ stores, although they also contribute to regulated changes in cytosolic [Ca2+]i under some circumstances (15Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.-T. Gill D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 16Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar). In the presynaptic terminal, the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) (17Ruat M. Molliver M.E. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3161-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and various TRPC channel subunits (18Goel M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48303-48310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) have been detected, as has the neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) (19Jinno S. Jeromin A. Roder J. Kosaka T. Neuroscience. 2002; 113: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), although the case for the latter has been controversial (20Martone M.E. Edelmann W.M. Ellisman M.H. Nef P. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, a clear case for SOCs has not been forthcoming. Rather, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was originally implicated as a possible pathway for Ca2+ entry following nerve activity, but despite an internal “Na+ load” with sustained activity, the inward-directed Na+ gradient still provides sufficient drive on the exchanger to favor Ca2+ efflux, even during nerve activity (Refs. 21Blaustein M.P. Oborn C.J. J. Physiol. 1975; 247: 657-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Nachshen D.A. J. Physiol. 1985; 363: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Scotti A.L. Chatton J.-Y. Reuter H. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; however, see Ref. 24Åkerman K.E. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger largely contributes to clearance of [Ca2+]i, and not Ca2+ influx. In addition, the mitochondria (when present) and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase appear to play dominant roles in resetting the final resting [Ca2+]i (25Nicholls D.G. Åkerman K.E.O. Philos. Trans. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1981; 296: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Budd S.L. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Here, we have identified a presynaptic calcium influx pathway for restoring homeostasis, revealed upon depletion of external calcium using isolated adult mature nerve endings from mouse cortex. Purification of Intact Isolated Presynaptic Nerve Endings (Synaptosomes)—The protocol used in this study was approved by the Drexel University College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The intact isolated presynaptic nerve endings were purified as described previously (27Nayak S.V. Dougherty J.J. McIntosh J.M. Nichols R.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1860-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In brief, cortices from adult C57/Bl6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were removed and placed into ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose. The cortices were homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose with a glass-Teflon tissue grinder. Synaptosomes were isolated using the Percoll step gradient method (28Dunkley P.R. Jarvie P.E. Health J.W. Kidd G.J. Rostas J.A.P. Brain Res. 1986; 327: 115-129Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The purified synaptosomes were washed with oxygenated HEPES-buffered saline (HBS, pH 7.4) containing 142 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, plus 1 mm Ca2+. Under these conditions, the terminals are intact, closed structures, as they respire, maintain ionic gradients and functional ion channels, transport and secrete neurotransmitter in a Ca2+-dependent fashion (29Nicholls D.G. Neurochem. Res. 2003; 28: 1433-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). That they are fully intact functional structures is also evidenced by retention of fluorescent dyes (27Nayak S.V. Dougherty J.J. McIntosh J.M. Nichols R.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1860-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Nichols R.A. Mollard P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and patch clamp recording (31Smith S.M. Bergsman J.B. Harata N.C. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 2004; 41: 243-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cell Culture of NG108-15 Cells—The neuronal cell line NG108-15 was cultured under differentiation conditions (32Nelson P. Christian C. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with Cell-Tak (BD Biosciences) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm dibutyryl adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate for 3-5 days. Under these conditions, the cells extend long neurites, each with multiple, large presynaptic-like axonal varicosities, capable of Ca2+-dependent secretion of acetylcholine (33McGee R. Simpson P. Christian C. Mata M. Nelson P. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and synaptic innervation of rodent myotubes (32Nelson P. Christian C. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The presynaptic-like varicosities contain voltage-gated ion channels typical of presynaptic sites (34Lukyanetz E.A. Piper T.P. Sihra T.S. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35Rondé P. Dougherty J.J. Nichols R.A. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), synaptic vesicles and mitochondria, and Ca2+ stores (35Rondé P. Dougherty J.J. Nichols R.A. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Expression of shRNA Constructions in Differentiated NG108-15 Cells—Transfection of mouse shRNA constructs into differentiated NG108-15 cells was accomplished using FuGene (Roche Diagnostics), with which we typically obtain 80-90% transfection efficiency as gauged by expression of green fluorescent protein. Effects of mouse TRPC1, TRPC5, and TRPC3 (as control) shRNAs were assessed after 3-4 days, using Ca2+ imaging and immunoblot analysis. Measurement of Relative Ca2+ Levels—The purified synaptosomes or differentiated NG108-15 cells were loaded with 5 μm of various fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dyes (fluorimetric studies: fura-2, fluo-4, mag-fluo-4, mag-fura-2, X-rhod-1, fura-2FF; confocal imaging: fluo-4) in HBS containing 1 mm Ca2+ using the acetoxymethyl ester derivatives of the dyes for 45-60 min at 37 °C as previously described (27Nayak S.V. Dougherty J.J. McIntosh J.M. Nichols R.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1860-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Nichols R.A. Mollard P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the case of mag-fluo-4 or X-rhod-1, the synaptosomes were further incubated at room temperature for 30 min, to favor localization of the dyes into compartmentalized or cytosolic sites, respectively (36Li N. Sul J.Y. Haydon P.G. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10302-10310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dye-loaded synaptosomes were then washed by centrifugation and resuspended in HBS made without Ca2+ (nominal Ca2+; nCa2+), unless otherwise indicated, to better control the Ca2+ concentration with or without EGTA. For fluorimetric studies, aliquots of the dye-loaded synaptosomes were suspended in HBS in a stirred quartz cuvette held at 37 °C in a temperature-controlled PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer. For most experiments, fura-2 was used to detect changes in Ca2+ levels under ratiometric conditions (emission at 510 nm in response to alternating excitation at 340 and 380 nm). Although maximum and minimum ratio values were determined at the end of control runs with fura-2-loaded synaptosomes by adding 5 μm ionomycin followed by 4 mm EGTA, Ca2+ depletion during a run led to spurious calculations of Ca2+ levels using the Grynkiewicz equation (37Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Hence, the data using fura-2 are presented simply as raw ratios. In addition, caffeine, which has been reported to quench certain fluorescent dyes (38Muschol M. Dasgupta B.R. Salzberg B.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), had no discernible quenching effect on fura-2 in synaptosome preparations. In experiments where recording at high time resolution was necessary, fluo-4 was used with 0.1-s sampling intervals. For the low affinity dye mag-fluo-4, emission was recorded at 515 nm in response to 490 nm. For the intermediate affinity dye X-rhod-1, fluorescent emission was recorded at 605 nm in response to 505 nm. For the high affinity dye fluo-4, fluorescence was recorded at 506 nm in response to 488 nm. For confocal imaging, the synaptosomes or differentiated NG108-15 cells were plated onto coverslips coated with Cell-Tak and then inserted into a rapid-exchange Warner perfusion system mounted on a Nikon Diaphot microscope attached to a Nikon PCM 2000 laser-scanning confocal imaging system. Fluorescent images were recorded in response to excitation at 488 nm. During the confocal imaging, the preparations were under constant perfusion at ∼5 ml/min with HBS without or with Ca2+, as appropriate. Images were typically collected at 2- or 4-s intervals, with the first 5 consecutive images collected as a baseline. Each experiment corresponds to sequential images collected from a single preparation. The quantification of fluorescence intensities associated with individual synaptosomes or varicosities recorded in digitized images was calculated using MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA) and corrected for photobleaching based on the baseline images (typically <3%). Analysis was performed by an observer blind to the experimental conditions. Response to depolarization evoked by elevated extracellular K+ was used as a criterion for synaptosomal or varicosity viability. Data are presented as normalized responses (F/F0, where F0 is the fluorescence intensity associated with a given structure at t0). All reagents were used at or above maximal concentrations based on literature values (e.g. Ref. 39Tozzi A. Bengston C.P. Longone P. Carignani C. Fusco F.R. Bernardi G. Mercuri N.B. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 2133-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Depletion was initially accomplished using 0.1 mm EGTA, final concentration. Note that the preparations were partially depleted prior to addition of EGTA, because of a final wash with nominally Ca2+-free HBS during preparation. For sequential depletion, EGTA was initially added at 0.1 mm and then following Ca2+ re-addition to 0.5 mm net concentration, EGTA was re-added to 0.8 mm concentration (see Fig. 1A). For experiments involving lanthanides (Gd3+ and La3+) at <10 μm, preparations were pre-depleted and then washed free of EGTA, due to the very high stability constants of the lanthanides for EGTA (40Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants, Volume 1: Amino Acids. Plenum Press, New York1974Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Immunostaining was performed as described (27Nayak S.V. Dougherty J.J. McIntosh J.M. Nichols R.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1860-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 41Nayak S.V. Rondé P. Spier A.D. Lummis S.C.R. Nichols R.A. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 42Rondé P. Nichols R.A. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In brief, the synaptosomes or differentiated NG108-15 cells on Cell-Tak-coated coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in HBS for 30-45 min. The preparations were then permeabilized by incubation with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris pH 7.2, 0.9% NaCl) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, followed by extensively washing with Tris-buffered saline. For double immunolabeling, the preparations were first incubated for 60-120 min at room temperature with affinity purified primary rabbit antibodies for specific TRP channels (1:100-200) and, in the case of the synaptosomes, a mouse monoclonal antibody for synaptophysin (clone SVP38; 1:500), which serves as a highly specific nerve terminal marker (43Navone F. Jahn R. Di Gioia G. Stukenbrok H. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2511-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). After extensive washing with Tris-buffered saline, the synaptosomes were incubated for 60-120 min at room temperature with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) and, in the case of the synaptosomes, rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500) secondary antibodies in the presence of 10% goat serum in Tris-buffered saline. Control preparations were incubated without primary antibodies but with secondary antibodies. After extensive washing, stained preparations were mounted and imaging of the synaptosomes was performed using the confocal microscope, recording the fluorescence emitted in response to excitation at 488 (fluorescein) or 568 nm (rhodamine) as described (27Nayak S.V. Dougherty J.J. McIntosh J.M. Nichols R.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1860-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 41Nayak S.V. Rondé P. Spier A.D. Lummis S.C.R. Nichols R.A. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 42Rondé P. Nichols R.A. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In particular, the black level was set using the control preparations incubated with secondary antibodies only, eliminating the low level of background fluorescence. This black level was used when imaging all subsequent samples stained with primary and secondary antibodies. For immunostaining of synaptosomes, merged images are shown; for immunostaining of the NG108-15 cells, images of fluorescence in the fluorescein channel are shown in grayscale. Positive immunostaining for TRP subunits in the synaptosomes was denoted by fluorescence contained within the margins of the staining for synaptophysin (see Ref. 44Wu J. Dougherty J.J. Nichols R.A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 481-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar for discussion). The specificity of the anti-TRPC antibodies was verified via immunoblotting of SDS extracts of synaptosomal preparations (18Goel M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48303-48310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Reagents—The fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dyes were purchased from TefLabs (Austin, TX), with the exception of Fluo-4, which was purchased from Molecular Probes. The adhesive matrix Cell-Tak was from BD Sciences. Percoll was originally from Amersham Biosciences AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Ultrapure sucrose was from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). HEPES (ULTROL grade), KB-R7943, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, and ionomycin were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). CGP37157, SKF96365, and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone were from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). ω-Conotoxin MVIIC, ω-conotoxin GVIA, agatoxin TK, and thapsigargin were from Alomone (Jerusalem, Israel). Anti-synaptophysin monoclonal antibody (clone SVP-38), flufenamic acid, ruthenium red, ryanodine, (-)-xestospongin C, cyclopiazonic acid, 2,5-di-(t-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone, pertussin toxin, and caffeine were purchased from Sigma. All anti-TRPC antibodies were from Alomone Labs. Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody came from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The mouse shRNA containing pLKO.1 constructs were obtained from the Drexel University RNAi Resource Center (under management of Dr. Aleister Saunders in the Department of Bioscience), having originally been obtained from the Open Biosystems Mouse Arrest™ shRNAmir Library (Huntsville, AL). Each construct was optimized for selective RNA knock-down. Separate constructs were engineered to co-express green fluorescent protein to assess transfection efficiency. All other chemicals were of the highest reagent grade. Statistics—All experiments were independently replicated at least 3 times. Where indicated, the significance of the difference between mean values was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffé F test or t test. Differences were considered significant when p was minimally <0.05. Ca2+ Depletion Reveals a Presynaptic Ca2+ Influx Pathway—Using a variety of fluorescent dyes with varying relative affinities for Ca2+, an increase in [Ca2+]i occurred on re-addition of Ca2+ to isolated mouse cortical nerve terminals following depletion of Ca2+ by incubation in Ca2+-free HBS containing EGTA (Fig. 1), with responses evident at the level of individual terminals (Fig. 1F). This increase in [Ca2+]i following re-addition of Ca2+ to depleted synaptosomal preparations has been previously noted in numerous studies of synaptosomal Ca2+ regulation (e.g. Refs. 45Komulainen H. Bondy S.C. Neurochem. Int. 1987; 10: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 46Xu F. Sarti P. Zhang J. Blanck T.J.J. Anesth. Analg. 1998; 87: 701-710PubMed Google Scholar, 47Bergsman J.B. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4368-4378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The time course for the increase in [Ca2+]i was fairly rapid, as seen using non-ratiometric Ca2+-sensitive dyes (e.g. Fluo-4) at high time resolution (Fig. 1, B, F, and G; 0.1-s sampling interval). With direct addition of fluorescent dye as a measure of the time limitation for mixing (0.7 ± 0.17 s, mean ± S.D., n = 3), the time course for the initial increase in [Ca2+]i measured for synaptosomes loaded with Fluo-4 was 1.55 ± 0.5 s (mean ± S.D., n = 18; binding of Ca2+ to Fluo dyes is diffusion-limited (48Eberhard M. Erne P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)). This time course was similar to that found for K+ depolarization-induced increases in [Ca2+]i (1.61 ± 0.13 s, mean ± S.D., n = 9), measured after re-equilibration of the preparation with Ca2+. It was also similar to the increase observed in preparations twice-rewashed with HBS to remove any residual extracellular dye (2.0 ± 0.12 s, mean ± S.D., n = 3; Fig. S1A, inset). The time course for the initial depletion was slower (e.g. fluo-4, 3.1 ± 0.87, mean ± S.D.; n = 3; Fig. S1A, inset), but this response was highly variable. For the Ca2+ dyes having relative lower affinities, fura-2FF and the less specific mag-fluo-4, the Ca2+ changes with depletion and re-addition will reflect a mixture of cytosolic and compartmentalized Ca2+ (Fig. 1, D and E). Depletion in the presence of these dyes displayed a second, slower phase, as compared with the high affinity dyes. In contrast, X-rhod-1, a higher affinity Ca2+ dye, was loaded under conditions favoring localization to the cytosol (see Ref. 36Li N. Sul J.Y. Haydon P.G. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10302-10310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Thus, there is an indication of Ca2+ present in a store/mitochondrial compartment(s) in addition to the cytosol. Influx was confirmed using Mn2+ as the divalent cation in a typical fura-2 quench assay (Fig. 2; see also, Ref. 49Drapeau P. Nachshen D.A. J. Physiol. 1984; 348: 493-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The initial rate of Mn2+ influx was not significantly affected following addition of Ca2+ (Fig. 2, inset). In addition, Ca2+ influx via this pathway could be detected with in 1 s of depletion (partial) of the preparation, and had kinetics that did not change with longer periods of depletion (Fig. 1G) or with repetitive depletion (Fig. 1A). The increase in [Ca2+]i on re-addition of Ca2+ to depleted preparations was insensitive to prior treatment with pertussis toxin (see Ref. 50Millan C. Luján R. Shigemoto R. Sanchez-Prieto J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), nor was it affected by pretreatment with the permeant diacylglycerol analog 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, the apparent influx pathway for Ca2+ into the depleted nerve terminal has kinetic features of a channel activity independent of a pertussin toxin-sensitive or DAG-coupled pathway; however, receptor regulation of this pathway is not excluded by these results. Ca2+ Influx Revealed by Ca2+ Depletion Is Independent of VGCCs, Na+/Ca2+ Exchange, and Ca2+ Stores—Although K+ depolarization-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were invariably elicited following re-equilibration of the depleted preparations with Ca2+, the extent to which VGCCs are involved in the influx pathway revealed by Ca2+ depletion was assessed using VGCC blockers. In the presence of a mixture of peptide toxin blockers (agatoxin and conotoxins) that completely suppressed K+-induced Ca2+ increases (27Nayak S.V. Dougherty J.J. McIntosh J.M. Nichols R.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1860-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 51Rondé P. Nichols R.A. J.

In addition, depolarization in the presence of VGCC blockers prior to addition of Ca2+ back to depleted synaptosomes had no effect on the Ca2+ influx (Fig. 3B). Moreover, Sr2+, which is conducted poorly by classical SOCs but is carried by TRPC channels (52Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), could substitute for Ca2+ in the influx pathway (Fig. 3C), whereas Gd3+ had little if any effect, either as a SOC blocker (53Trebak T.

Ba2+, which also appears to be poorly conducted by SOCs in many cases (54Chernaya G. Vasquez M. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5378-5385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), could also substitute for Ca2+ (Fig. 3E). Mg2+ from 1 to 5 mm had no effect on the responses (not shown); however, reduced levels of external Mg2+ (<1 mm) resulted in a substantial increase in the extent (Fig. 3F; 153 ± 8% relative to 1 mm) and rate (Fig. 3F, inset) of the initial phase of Ca2+ influx, as did relatively high concentrations (≥25 μm) of the lanthanides La3+ (Fig. 3G; 173 ± 20% (mean ± S.E.) of control, p < 0.05; n = 3) or Gd3+ (Fig. 3D; 210 ± 43% (mean ± S.E.) of control, p < 0.05; n = 3), these effects being indicative of the presence of TRPC5 containing channels (55Strűbing C.

Finally, the Ca2+ concentration dependence of the influx pathway has a distinctly lower apparent EC50 than that of the VGCCs (Fig. 1H). To address other potential sources of Ca2+, blockade of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was performed using the inhibitor KB-R7943 (58Iwamoto T. Watano T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22391-22397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and had no detectable effect when used at 5 μm. Block by KB-R7943 at 50 μm did result in an enhanced second phase of the Ca2+ influx after Ca2+ re-addition (Fig. 4A), indicating no direct involvement of the exchangers in the depletion-coupled influx per se but an involvement in the equilibration of [Ca2+]i, as expected (59Juhaszova M.

https://openalex.org/W2116616161,"In mammalian prion diseases, an abnormally folded, aggregated form of the prion protein (PrP(Sc)) appears to catalyze a conformational switch of its cellular isoform (PrP(C)) to an aggregated state. A similar prion-like phenomenon has been reported for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae translation termination factor Sup35p that can adopt a self-propagating conformation. We have compared aggregation propensities of chimeric proteins derived from the Sup35p prion domain NM and PrP in vitro and in the cytosol of mammalian cells. Sup35p-NM and PrP displayed strikingly different aggregation behaviors when expressed in mammalian cells, with NM remaining soluble and cytosolic PrP spontaneously aggregating due to the globular domain of PrP. When fused to PrP(90-230), Sup35p-M exhibited an inhibitory effect for nucleation but increased aggregate growth, potentially by facilitating recruitment of newly synthesized chimeric proteins into the growing aggregates. This effect, however, could, to some extent, be counteracted by the prion-forming region Sup35p-N, thereby increasing aggregate frequency. Interestingly, a lowered nucleation rate was also observed in the presence of the amino-terminal region of PrP, suggesting that Sup35p-M and PrP(23-90) share some biological function in prion protein assembly. Our results provide new insights into prion protein aggregation behaviors, demonstrating the impact of dynamic interactions between prion domains and suggesting that aggregation of yeast and mammalian prion proteins is strongly influenced by yet unidentified cellular conditions or factors."
https://openalex.org/W2140188122,"We detected 19 complete endogenous retroviruses of the K family in the genome of rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta; RhERV-K) and 12 full length elements in the genome of the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes; CERV-K). These sequences were compared with 55 human HERV-K and 20 CERV-K reported previously, producing a total data set of 106 full-length ERV-K genomes. Overall, 61% of the human elements compared to 21% of the chimpanzee and 47% of rhesus elements had estimated integration times less than 4.5 million years before present (MYBP), with an average integration times of 7.8 MYBP, 13.4 MYBP and 10.3 MYBP for HERV-K, CERV-K and RhERV-K, respectively. By excluding those ERV-K sequences generated by chromosomal duplication, we used 63 of the 106 elements to compare the population dynamics of ERV-K among species. This analysis indicated that both HERV-K and RhERV-K had similar demographic histories, including markedly smaller effective population sizes, compared to CERV-K. We propose that these differing ERV-K dynamics reflect underlying differences in the evolutionary ecology of the host species, such that host ecology and demography represent important determinants of ERV-K dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2096975926,"In our current political climate, decisions about whether to fund research on new stem cell lines or do chimera experiments seem to arbitrarily depend on the religious and economic interests of the administration. Not unreasonably, many scientists believe that science should be left to its own devices in determining research priorities and conducting research. When nonscientific considerations constrain research, it is claimed that values are inappropriately dictating scientific decisions. This assumes, however, that all ethical and social values are irrelevant to such decisions. Using the case of embryonic stem cell research to illustrate the debate, we argue here that this position is untenable for several reasons. First, the aims of science, particularly in the case of the biomedical sciences, cannot be completely extricated from ethical and social aims. Hence, value judgments will be necessary to assess research priorities and methodologies. Second, maintaining this position is inconsistent with actual scientific practices. Scientists already recognize that there are some ethical values that appropriately constrain research, such as in human subject experimentation. Therefore, the problem cannot be that ethical values are brought to bear on science per se but that those values are highly questionable or are imposed by those who often lack the scientific expertise necessary to understand how ethical concerns may relate to the research. Finally, we argue that to the extent value judgments must be made, consensus about such values should be reached by a diverse group of stakeholders, including scientists, community members, policymakers, and ethicists."
https://openalex.org/W2097513230,"With HIV persisting lifelong in infected persons, therapeutic vaccination is a novel alternative concept to control virus replication. Even though CD8 and CD4 cell responses to such immunizations have been demonstrated, their effects on virus replication are still unclear. In view of this fact, we studied the impact of a therapeutic vaccination with HIV nef delivered by a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara vector on viral diversity. We investigated HIV sequences derived from chronically infected persons before and after therapeutic vaccination. Before immunization the mean +/- se pairwise variability of patient-derived Nef protein sequences was 0.1527 +/- 0.0041. After vaccination the respective value was 0.1249 +/- 0.0042, resulting in a significant (P<0.0001) difference between the two time points. The genes vif and 5'gag tested in parallel and nef sequences in control persons yielded a constant amino acid sequence variation. The data presented suggest that Nef immunization induced a selective pressure, limiting HIV sequence variability. To our knowledge this is the first report directly linking therapeutic HIV vaccination to decreasing diversity in patient-derived virus isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2038379107,"Presenilin 1 (PS1) forms the gamma-secretase complex with at least three components: nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2. This complex mediates intramembrane cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) as well as other type 1 transmembrane proteins. Although PS1 mutations linked to familial Alzheimer's disease influence these cleavages, their biological consequences have not been fully understood. In this study, we used mRNA differential display analysis to identify a gene, denoted adoplin-1/ORMDL-1, which displays significantly reduced expression in association with PS1 mutations. Adoplin-1 and two highly homologous genes (adoplin-2, -3) constitute a gene family that encodes transmembrane proteins. The mRNA and protein levels of adoplins (particularly adoplin-1, -2) were markedly elevated in PS-deficient fibroblasts, compared to wild-type cells. Moreover, knockdown of the three adoplins by RNA interference affected maturation of nicastrin and its association with PS1. Adoplin knockdown additionally resulted in elevated levels of APP C-terminal fragments and decreased Abeta production, suggestive of reduced gamma-secretase activity. Our data collectively indicate that adoplins are unique molecules with PS-related expression and functions that may play important role(s) in the maturation and activity of the gamma-secretase complex."
https://openalex.org/W2042329780,"The energy minimization of a small molecule alone does not automatically stop at a local minimum of the potential energy surface of the molecule if the minimum is shallow, thus leading to folding of the molecule and consequently hampering the generation of the bound conformation of a guest in the absence of its host. This questions the practicality of virtual screening methods that use conformations at local minima of their potential energy surfaces (local minimum conformations) as potential bound conformations. Here we report a normal-mode-analysis–monitored energy minimization (NEM) procedure that generates local minimum conformations as potential bound conformations. Of 22 selected guest–host complex crystal structures with guest structures possessing up to four rotatable bonds, all complexes were reproduced, with guest mass–weighted root mean square deviations of <1.0 Å, through docking with the NEM–generated guest local minimum conformations. An analysis of the potential energies of these local minimum conformations showed that 22 (100%), 18 (82%), 16 (73%), and 12 (55%) of the 22 guest bound conformations in the crystal structures had conformational strain energies of less than or equal to 3.8, 2.0, 0.6, and 0.0 kcal/mol, respectively. These results suggest that (1) the NEM procedure can generate small–molecule bound conformations, and (2) guests adopt low-strain–energy conformations for complexation, thus supporting the virtual screening methods that use local minimum conformations."
