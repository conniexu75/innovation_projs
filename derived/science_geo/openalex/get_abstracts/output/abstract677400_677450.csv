https://openalex.org/W3046296398,"In recent times, deep artificial neural networks have achieved many successes in pattern recognition. Part of this success can be attributed to the reliance on big data to increase generalization. However, in the field of time series recognition, many datasets are often very small. One method of addressing this problem is through the use of data augmentation. In this paper, we survey data augmentation techniques for time series and their application to time series classification with neural networks. We propose a taxonomy and outline the four families in time series data augmentation, including transformation-based methods, pattern mixing, generative models, and decomposition methods. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate 12 time series data augmentation methods on 128 time series classification datasets with six different types of neural networks. Through the results, we are able to analyze the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and recommendations of each data augmentation method. This survey aims to help in the selection of time series data augmentation for neural network applications."

Large studies with diverse populations evaluating statin use and outcomes in COVID-19 are lacking. Methods and results We used data from 10,541 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 through September 2020 at 104 US hospitals enrolled in the American Heart Association’s COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Registry to evaluate the associations between statin use and outcomes. Prior to admission, 42% of subjects (n = 4,449) used statins (7% on statins alone, 35% on statins plus anti-hypertensives). Death (or discharge to hospice) occurred in 2,212 subjects (21%). Outpatient use of statins, either alone or with anti-hypertensives, was associated with a reduced risk of death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.50–0.69), adjusting for demographic characteristics, insurance status, hospital site, and concurrent medications by logistic regression. In propensity-matched analyses, use of statins and/or anti-hypertensives was associated with a reduced risk of death among those with a history of CVD and/or hypertension (aOR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58–0.81). An observed 16% reduction in odds of death among those without CVD and/or hypertension was not statistically significant. Conclusions Patients taking statins prior to hospitalization for COVID-19 had substantially lower odds of death, primarily among individuals with a history of CVD and/or hypertension. These observations support the continuation and aggressive initiation of statin and anti-hypertensive therapies among patients at risk for COVID-19, if these treatments are indicated based upon underlying medical conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3179222497,"The Miocene Pisco Formation, broadly exposed in the Ica Desert of southern Peru, is among the most outstanding Cenozoic marine Fossil-Lagerstätten worldwide. It is renowned for its exceptional preservation and abundance of vertebrate fossils, including a rich assemblage of whales and dolphins (Cetacea). Here, we integrate taphonomic data on 890 marine vertebrate fossils, gathered through 16 different localities. Our observations range from the taxonomic distribution, articulation, completeness, disposition and orientation of skeletons, to the presence of bite marks, associations with shark teeth and macro-invertebrates, bone and soft tissue preservation, and the formation of attendant carbonate concretions and sedimentary structures. We propose that the exceptional preservation characterising many Pisco vertebrates, as well as their exceptionally high abundance, cannot be ascribed to a single cause like high sedimentation rates (as proposed in the past), but rather to the interplay of several favourable factors including: (i) low levels of dissolved oxygen at the seafloor (with the intervention of seasonal anoxic events); (ii) the early onset of mineralisation processes like apatite dissolution/recrystallisation and carbonate mineral precipitation; (iii) rapid burial of carcasses in a soupy substrate and/or a novel mechanism involving scour-induced self-burial; and (iv) original biological richness. Collectively, our observations provide a comprehensive overview of the taphonomic processes that shaped one of South America's most important fossil deposits, and suggest a model for the formation of other marine vertebrate Fossil-Lagerstätten."
https://openalex.org/W3138413298,"Rapid advancements in long-read sequencing technologies have transformed read lengths from bps to Mbps, which has enabled chromosome-scale genome assemblies. However, read lengths are now becoming limited by the extraction of pure high-molecular weight DNA suitable for long-read sequencing, which is particularly challenging in plants and fungi. To overcome this, we present a protocol collection; high-molecular weight DNA extraction, clean-up and size selection for long-read sequencing. We optimised a gentle magnetic bead based high-molecular weight DNA extraction, which is presented here in detail. The protocol circumvents spin columns and high-centrifugation, to limit DNA fragmentation. The protocol is scalable based on tissue input, which can be used on many species of plants, fungi, reptiles and bacteria. It is also cost effective compared to kit-based protocols and hence applicable at scale in low resource settings. An optional sorbitol wash is listed and is highly recommended for plant and fungal tissues. To further remove any remaining contaminants such as phenols and polysaccharides, optional DNA clean-up and size selection strategies are given. This protocol collection is suitable for all common long-read sequencing platforms, such as technologies offered by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore. Using these protocols, sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore MinION can achieve read length N50 values of 30-50 kb, with reads exceeding 200 kb and outputs ranging from 15-30 Gbp. This has been routinely achieved with various plant, fungi, animal and bacteria samples."
https://openalex.org/W3180296007,"Loss of mitochondrial function contributes to fatigue, exercise intolerance and muscle weakness, and is a key factor in the disability that develops with age and a wide variety of chronic disorders. Here, we describe the impact of a first-in-class cardiolipin-binding compound that is targeted to mitochondria and improves oxidative phosphorylation capacity (Elamipretide, ELAM) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.Non-invasive magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy provided measures of mitochondrial capacity (ATPmax) with exercise and mitochondrial coupling (ATP supply per O2 uptake; P/O) at rest. The first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle was studied in 39 healthy older adult subjects (60 to 85 yrs of age; 46% female) who were enrolled based on the presence of poorly functioning mitochondria. We measured volitional fatigue resistance by force-time integral over repetitive muscle contractions.A single ELAM dose elevated mitochondrial energetic capacity in vivo relative to placebo (ΔATPmax; P = 0.055, %ΔATPmax; P = 0.045) immediately after a 2-hour infusion. No difference was found on day 7 after treatment, which is consistent with the half-life of ELAM in human blood. No significant changes were found in resting muscle mitochondrial coupling. Despite the increase in ATPmax there was no significant effect of treatment on fatigue resistance in the FDI.These results highlight that ELAM rapidly and reversibly elevates mitochondrial capacity after a single dose. This response represents the first demonstration of a pharmacological intervention that can reverse mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo immediately after treatment in aging human muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3180835051,"Agrivoltaic combines crop planting and electricity generation on the same land, it is considered as an opportunity to resolve the competition for land use between food and energy production. In addition to growing crops, farmers can gain electricity with the installation of agrivoltaic systems on their farmland. They can use this clean energy for agricultural production or sell it for extra income. The Chinese government considers it an important strategy for ""Targeted Poverty Alleviation"". However, current methods of agrivoltaic provide uneven and low irradiance for crops, which usually results in reduced yield and low quality. In this study, an improved agrivoltaic system with a grooved glass plate has been designed, manufactured, and investigated, called Even-lighting Agrivoltaic System (EAS). Two experiments were conducted to test the effectiveness of the improvement. We measured the crops' light environment, the crop growth process, the crop yield and quality, the electricity generation, and calculated the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) as well as the comprehensive economic benefits on the farmland per hectare. Under the EAS, crops grew fast and the yield was similar or better than that under the natural state. By adding supplementary LED lamps into the EAS, the soluble sugar content of lettuce increased by 72.14% and the nitrate content of lettuce decreased by 21.51%. The average LER of the EAS for common vegetables was 1.64 as demonstrated in this work. Comprehensive economic benefits outperform the installation and maintenance costs, thus, the EAS can increase farmers' income by an average of 5.14 times. The EAS provides new ideas and directions for the future development of agrivoltaic."
https://openalex.org/W3178395993,"Significant concern has been raised regarding the effect of COVID-19 on medical education. This study aimed to shed light on the distance learning experiences of medical students and their instructors at the Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences (MBRU) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. A convergent mixed methods approach was utilized. Qualitative and quantitative data was collected using a survey of closed-ended followed by open-ended questions. The percentage of the total average of satisfaction among stakeholders was 76.4%. The qualitative analysis led to developing the 4Ps Model of Transitioning to Distance Learning, which encapsulates four interrelated themes. It would be helpful to leverage the lessons learned to tailor blended medical programs with a reasonable mélange of experiences. The study also contributes to the mixed methods research by showcasing a means of adapting it to evaluate critical situations reliably and rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W3182001102,"Atherosclerosis (AS) is closely associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and gut dysbiosis. Metformin (MET) presents pleiotropic benefits in the control of chronic metabolic diseases, but the impacts of MET intervention on gut microbiota and inflammation in AS remain largely unclear. In this study, ApoE-/- mice with a high-fat diet (HFD) were adopted to assess the MET treatment. After 12 weeks of MET intervention (100mg·kg-1·d-1), relevant indications were investigated. As indicated by the pathological measurements, the atherosclerotic lesion was alleviated with MET intervention. Moreover, parameters in AS including body weights (BWs), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were elevated; whereas high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) levels were decreased, which could be reversed by MET intervention. Elevated pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and lipopolysaccaride (LPS) in AS were decreased after MET administration. However, anti-inflammatory IL-10 showed no significant difference between AS group and AS+MET group. Consistently, accumulated macrophages in the aorta of AS were conversely lowered with MET treatment. The results of 16S rRNA sequencing and analysis displayed that the overall community of gut microbiota in AS was notably changed with MET treatment mainly through decreasing Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Romboutsia, Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, as well as increasing Akkermansia, Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacterium. Additionally, we found that microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and valeric acid in AS were decreased, which were significantly up-regulated with MET intervention. Consistent with the attenuation of MET on gut dysbiosis, decreased intestinal tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO)-1 in AS was restored after MET supplementation. Correlation analysis showed close relationships among gut bacteria, microbial metabolites SCFAs and inflammation. Collectively, MET intervention ameliorates AS in ApoE-/- mice through restoring gut dysbiosis and anti-inflammation, thus can potentially serve as an inexpensive and effective intervention for the control of the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W3183136104,"The Internet revolution has radically changed the means of conducting business all over the world in the past few decades. The digital medium enables consumers worldwide to shop online through B2C e-commerce websites in a convenient manner. Online websites compete to provide a compelling and seamless brand experience to retain their customers. In order to achieve this, fostering a state of flow may help the brands increase customer experience, customer satisfaction and loyalty. In this study, the aforementioned phenomenon is tested against Turkish university students.The study was conducted against 538 valid respondents. The results of the survey were interpreted with the structural equation modeling method. Quantitative data were obtained using a five-point Likert scale. Initially, confirmatory factor analyses and reliability analysis were performed, respectively in order to determine the validity and reliability of the scale.As a result of the analyses, it has been empirically proven that an online flow state, which is a momentary phenomenon, helps online e-commerce websites build customer satisfaction and customer loyalty indirectly through customer experience. These results are partly parallel with those in the extant literature.This study is significant in the literature in that, as opposed to the extant literature, online flow state is found to influence customer satisfaction and customer loyalty rather indirectly via moderating effect of customer experience. Additionally, it is the first to incorporate customer satisfaction along with customer loyalty as a new construct affected by online flow state and customer experience. The results also have important managerial implications."
https://openalex.org/W3179828951,"Background Biodiversity is being lost rapidly and its conservation is thus one of the most urgent tasks today. For biodiversity conservation to be successful, the public needs to gain an awareness and understanding of biodiversity and its importance. Moreover, species experts are needed who have the skills necessary for identifying and recording biodiversity. Previous research showed that citizen science projects can contribute to educating the public about biodiversity. However, it is still unclear how project characteristics connect to participants’ knowledge and skills and how citizen science projects should be designed if they are to foster participants’ learning. Aim We aimed to investigate specific characteristics of biodiversity citizen science projects that could potentially influence participants’ learning. We explored the following project characteristics from both the project coordinators’ and the participants’ perspectives: information and training provided to participants, social interaction among participants, contact between participants and staff, and feedback and recognition provided to participants. Methods and results In order to examine the extent to which these project characteristics are connected to participants’ gains in knowledge and skills, we conducted a comprehensive study across 48 biodiversity citizen science projects in Europe and Australia. We found that participants’ perceived gains in knowledge and skills were significantly related to the five project characteristics as reported by the participants: information received by the participants, training received by the participants, social interaction among participants, contact between participants and staff, and feedback and recognition received by the participants. Conclusion We conclude that by deliberately designing citizen science projects to include features such as interaction and feedback, these projects could achieve higher learning outcomes for the participants. Thereby, suitable modes of communication between projects and their participants are crucial. We provide specific suggestions for the design of biodiversity citizen science projects and for future research on project characteristics and participant outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3178542449,"With an objective of mapping novel low soil P (Phosphorus) tolerance loci in the non-Pup1 type donor rice line, Wazuhophek, we screened a recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population consisting of 330 lines derived from the cross Wazuhophek x Improved Samba Mahsuri (which is highly sensitive to low soil P) in a plot with low soil P for tolerance associated traits. Molecular mapping with SSR markers revealed a total of 16 QTLs (seven major and nine minor QTLs), which are associated with low soil P tolerance related traits. Interestingly, a QTL hotspot, harbouring 10 out of 16 QTLs were identified on the short arm of chromosome 8 (flanked by the makers RM22554 and RM80005). Five major QTLs explaining phenotypic variance to an extent of 15.28%, 17.25%, 21.84%, 20.23%, and 18.50%, associated with the traits, plant height, shoot length, the number of productive tillers, panicle length and yield, respectively, were located in the hotspot. Two major QTLs located on chromosome 1, associated with the traits, total biomass and root to shoot ratio, explaining 15.44% and 15.44% phenotypic variance, respectively were also identified. Complex epistatic interactions were observed among the traits, grain yield per plant, days to 50% flowering, dry shoot weight, and P content of the seed. In-silico analysis of genomic regions flanking the major QTLs revealed the presence of key putative candidate genes, possibly associated with tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3179729759,"The importance of goldmining to Ghana's development cannot be overestimated. However, the associated morbidities and mortalities resulting from occupational exposure to health hazards and the general cost associated with it is critical. In managing occupational health, a simple comprehension of the main determinants of the problem is required.A cross-sectional survey of 504 goldminers was fitted to a nested binary logistic regression model to evaluate the independent effect of subsector departments, compositional attributes, contextual factors and working conditions on goldminers' likelihood of experiencing occupational related health problems.Subsector department was robust and persisted in predicting experiencing occupational related health problems in all three models. Goldminers who were in artisanal small scale (ASM) non-production, large scale (LSM) production and LSM non-production were less likely to experience occupational related health problems as compared to their counterparts in ASM production. For the compositional factors, female goldminers were more likely to experience occupational related health problems as compared to their male co-workers. Goldminers who were married and also older miners were more likely to experience occupational related health problems as compared to the unmarried and the relatively younger goldminers. At the contextual level, miners who worked on shift-based schedule and also miners who lived close to mine sites were more likely to experience occupational related health problems. Among the working conditions, goldminers who worked in good health conditions were less likely to experience occupational related health problems. Surprisingly, goldminers who rated their safety conditions as good were more likely to experience occupational related health problems.Gold miners are exposed to different health risk scenarios across subsectors and departments. These conditions need critical attention and action from industry stakeholders. Programs that promote self-care culture should be promoted, especially in the ASM subsector. PPE's could be relied on for protection in the mining industry but they should be the last line of defense and not to replace preventive measures and actions."
https://openalex.org/W3180823642,"Background In response to the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), plenty of control measures were proposed. To assess the impact of current control measures on the number of new case indices 14 countries with the highest confirmed cases, highest mortality rate, and having a close relationship with the outbreak’s origin; were selected and analyzed. Methods In the study, we analyzed the impact of five control measures, including centralized isolation of all confirmed cases, closure of schools, closure of public areas, closure of cities, and closure of borders of the 14 targeted countries according to their timing; by comparing its absolute effect average, its absolute effect cumulative, and its relative effect average. Results Our analysis determined that early centralized isolation of all confirmed cases was represented as a core intervention in significantly disrupting the pandemic’s spread. This strategy helped in successfully controlling the early stage of the outbreak when the total number of cases were under 100, without the requirement of the closure of cities and public areas, which would impose a negative impact on the society and its economy. However, when the number of cases increased with the apparition of new clusters, coordination between centralized isolation and non-pharmaceutical interventions facilitated control of the crisis efficiently. Conclusion Early centralized isolation of all confirmed cases should be implemented at the time of the first detected infectious case."
https://openalex.org/W3178582054,"Lane detection in complex road scenes is still a challenging task due to poor lighting conditions, interference of irrelevant road markings or signs, etc. To solve the problem of lane detection in the various complex road scenes, we proposed a geometric attention-aware network (GAAN) for lane detection. The proposed GAAN adopted a multi-task branch architecture, and used the attention information propagation (AIP) module to perform communication between branches, then the geometric attention-aware (GAA) module was used to complete feature fusion. In order to verify the lane detection effect of the proposed model in this paper, the experiments were conducted on the CULane dataset, TuSimple dataset, and BDD100K dataset. The experimental results show that our method performs well compared with the current excellent lane line detection networks."
https://openalex.org/W3178693773,"Several factors have played a strong role in influencing the dynamics of COVID-19 in the U.S. One being the economy, where a tug of war has existed between lockdown measures to control disease versus loosening of restrictions to address economic hardship. A more recent effect has been availability of vaccines and the mass vaccination efforts of 2021. In order to address the challenges in analyzing this complex process, we developed a competing risk compartmental model framework with and without vaccination compartment. This framework separates instantaneous risk of removal for an infectious case into competing risks of cure and death, and when vaccinations are present, the vaccinated individual can also achieve immunity before infection. Computations are performed using a simple discrete time algorithm that utilizes a data driven contact rate. Using population level pre-vaccination data, we are able to identify and characterize three wave patterns in the U.S. Estimated mortality rates for second and third waves are 1.7%, which is a notable decrease from 8.5% of a first wave observed at onset of disease. This analysis reveals the importance cure time has on infectious duration and disease transmission. Using vaccination data from 2021, we find a fourth wave, however the effect of this wave is suppressed due to vaccine effectiveness. Parameters playing a crucial role in this modeling were a lower cure time and a signficantly lower mortality rate for the vaccinated."
https://openalex.org/W3181351158,"GRF genes have been confirmed to have important regulatory functions in plant growth, development and response to abiotic stress. Although the genome of Jatropha curcas is sequenced, knowledge about the identification of the species' GRF genes and their expression patterns is still lacking. In this study, we characterized the 10 JcGRF genes. A detailed investigation into the physic nut GRF gene family is performed, including analysis of the exon-intron structure, conserved domains, conserved motifs, phylogeny, chromosomal locations, potential small RNA targets and expression profiles under both normal growth and abiotic stress conditions. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the 10 JcGRF genes were classified into five groups corresponding to group I, II, III, IV and V. The analysis of conserved domains showed that the motifs of JcGRF genes were highly conserved in Jatropha curcas. Expression analysis based on RNA-seq and qRT-PCR showed that almost all JcGRF genes had the highest expression in seeds, but very low expression was detected in the non-seed tissues tested, and four JcGRF genes responded to at least one abiotic stress at at least one treatment point. Our research will provide an important scientific basis for further research on the potential functions of JcGRF genes in Jatropha curcas growth and development, and response to abiotic stress, and will eventually provide candidate genes for the breeding of Jatropha curcas."
https://openalex.org/W3182057995,"University students commonly experience sleep problems which have implications for daily functioning and academic achievement. For this reason, research is needed to identify modifiable individual difference variables that may contribute to better sleep in this population. Temperament and sleep hygiene may be two such factors. As part of a larger study, 167 university students (61.7% female) completed online questionnaires that inquired about temperament (the Adult Temperament Questionnaire; ATQ), sleep hygiene behavior (the Sleep Hygiene Index; SHI), global sleep quality (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; PSQI), and insomnia severity (the Insomnia Severity Index; ISI). Correlations amongst the included measures were in the predicted direction: effortful control was negatively associated with the SHI composite, PSQI global scores, and ISI scores; extraversion was negatively related to PSQI global scores; and negative affect was positively associated with the SHI composite and ISI scores. In addition, the SHI composite mediated the association between effortful control and the PSQI global scores as well as the association between negative affect and PSQI global scores; similar patterns of mediation were found when considering ISI scores, although the direct effects differed. That is, negative affect was directly associated with ISI scores but not PSQI global scores. These findings suggest that interventions designed enhance effortful control, reduce negative affect, and improve sleep hygiene may contribute to better global sleep quality and decrease insomnia in university students."
https://openalex.org/W3181481541,"Globally, fermented foods (FFs), which may be traditional or industrially-produced, are major sources of nutrition. In the traditional practice, the fermentation process is driven by communities of virtually uncharacterized microflora indigenous to the food substrate. Some of these flora can have virulent or antibiotic resistance properties, posing risk to consumers. Others, such as Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, may also be found in such foods. Enterococci that harbor antibiotic resistance or virulence factors can cycle among animals, food, humans and the environment, thereby transferring these harmful properties at the gene level to harmless commensals in the food matrix, animals and humans. In this work, several microbial isolates obtained from different FF sources were analyzed for their identity and virulence and/or antibiotic resistance properties. For identification aiming at enterococci, isolates that were Gram-positive and catalase- and oxidase-negative were subjected to multiple tests including for growth in broth containing 6.5% NaCl, growth and hydrolytic activity on medium containing bile-esculin, hemolytic activity on blood agar, and growth at 45°C and survival after incubation at 60°C for 30 min. Furthermore, the isolates were tested for susceptibility/resistance to a select group of antibiotics. Finally, the isolates were molecularly-characterized with respect to species identity and presence of virulence-encoding genes by amplification of target genes. Most sources contained enterococci, in addition to most of them also containing Gram-negative flora. Most of these also harbored virulence factors. Several isolates were also antibiotic-resistant. These results strongly suggest attention should be given to better control presence of such potentially pathogenic species."
https://openalex.org/W3182846908,"Background To develop a clinical prediction model to identify children at risk for revisits with serious illness to the emergency department. Methods and findings A secondary analysis of a prospective multicentre observational study in five European EDs (the TRIAGE study), including consecutive children aged &lt;16 years who were discharged following their initial ED visit (‘index’ visit), in 2012–2015. Standardised data on patient characteristics, Manchester Triage System urgency classification, vital signs, clinical interventions and procedures were collected. The outcome measure was serious illness defined as hospital admission or PICU admission or death in ED after an unplanned revisit within 7 days of the index visit. Prediction models were developed using multivariable logistic regression using characteristics of the index visit to predict the likelihood of a revisit with a serious illness. The clinical model included day and time of presentation, season, age, gender, presenting problem, triage urgency, and vital signs. An extended model added laboratory investigations, imaging, and intravenous medications. Cross validation between the five sites was performed, and discrimination and calibration were assessed using random effects models. A digital calculator was constructed for clinical implementation. 7,891 children out of 98,561 children had a revisit to the ED (8.0%), of whom 1,026 children (1.0%) returned to the ED with a serious illness. Rates of revisits with serious illness varied between the hospitals (range 0.7–2.2%). The clinical model had a summary Area under the operating curve (AUC) of 0.70 (95% CI 0.65–0.74) and summary calibration slope of 0.83 (95% CI 0.67–0.99). 4,433 children (5%) had a risk of &gt; = 3%, which was useful for ruling in a revisit with serious illness, with positive likelihood ratio 4.41 (95% CI 3.87–5.01) and specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.95–0.96). 37,546 (39%) had a risk &lt;0.5%, which was useful for ruling out a revisit with serious illness (negative likelihood ratio 0.30 (95% CI 0.25–0.35), sensitivity 0.88 (95% CI 0.86–0.90)). The extended model had an improved summary AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.68–0.75) and summary calibration slope of 0.84 (95% CI 0.71–0.97). As study limitations, variables on ethnicity and social deprivation could not be included, and only return visits to the original hospital and not to those of surrounding hospitals were recorded. Conclusion We developed a prediction model and a digital calculator which can aid physicians identifying those children at highest and lowest risks for developing a serious illness after initial discharge from the ED, allowing for more targeted safety netting advice and follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3180622750,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound worldwide impact. Vietnam, a lower middle-income country with limited resources, has successfully slowed this pandemic. The objectives of this report are to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the research activities of an ongoing hypertension trial using a storytelling intervention in Vietnam. Methods Data were collected in a mixed-methods study among 86 patients and 10 health care workers participating in a clinical trial designed to improve hypertension control. Several questions related to the impact of COVID-19 on patient’s daily activities and adherence to the study interventions were included in the follow-up visits. A focus group discussion was conducted among health care workers to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on research related activities. Results Fewer patients in the intervention group reported that they faced difficulties in adhering to prescribed study interventions, wanted to receive a call from a dedicated hotline, or have a visit from a community health worker as compared with those in the comparison group. Most study patients are willing to participate in future health research studies. When asked about the potential use of mobile phones in health research studies, fewer patients in the intervention group felt comfortable using a mobile phone for the delivery of intervention and interviews compared with those in the comparison condition. Community health workers shared that they visited patient’s homes more often than previously due to the pandemic and health care workers had to perform more virus containment activities without a corresponding increase in ancillary staff. Conclusions Both patients and health care workers in Vietnam faced difficulties in adhering to recommended trial interventions and procedures. Multiple approaches for intervention delivery and data collection are needed to overcome these difficulties during future health crises and enhance the implementation of future research studies.

https://openalex.org/W3181548249,"Background Lower socioeconomic status (SES) may be related to inactivity lifestyle; however, the association between SES and physical inactivity has not been sufficiently investigated in Japan. Methods The study population is the participants of NIPPON DATA2010, which is a prospective cohort study of the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2010 in Japan. They were residents in 300 randomly selected areas across Japan. This study included 2,609 adults. Physical activity was assessed by physical activity index (PAI) calculated from activity intensity and time. The lowest tertile of PAI for each 10-year age class and sex was defined as physical inactivity. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association of SES (employment status, educational attainment, living status, and equivalent household expenditure (EHE)) with physical inactivity. Results In the distribution of PAI by age classes and sex, the highest median PAI was aged 30–39 years among men (median 38.6), aged 40–49 years among women (38.0), and median PAI was decreased with increasing age. Multivariable-adjusted model shows that not working was significantly associated with physical inactivity after adjustment for age in all age groups and sexes. Not living with spouse for adult women and elderly men was significantly associated with physical inactivity compared to those who living with spouse. However, neither educational attainment nor EHE had any significant associations with physical inactivity. Conclusions The result indicated that physical inactivity was associated with SES in a general Japanese population. SES of individuals need to be considered in order to prevent inactivity lifestyle."
https://openalex.org/W3182649433,"Purpose Identifying axial length growth rate as an indicator of fast progression before initiating atropine 0.01% for myopia progression in children. Method From baseline, axial length growth over six months was measured prospectively. Subjects were then initiated on atropine 0.01% if axial length growth was greater than 0.1mm per 6 months (fast progressors), axial length and spherical equivalent change measurements recorded every six months. The rate of change was compared to the baseline pre-treatment rate. If axial length change was below the threshold, subjects received monitoring only. Results 73 subjects were identified as fast progressors and commenced atropine 0.01%, (mean baseline refraction of OD -2.9±1.6, OS -2.9±1.8 and a mean baseline axial length OD 24.62 ± 1.00 mm, OS 24.53 ± 0.99 mm). At six months, the mean paired difference of axial length growth rate was significantly reduced by 50% of baseline (all 73 subjects, p&lt;0.05). 53 subjects followed to 12 months, and 12 to 24 months maintained a reduced growth rate. Change in mean spherical equivalent was significantly reduced compared to pre-treatment refractive error (mean paired difference p&lt;0.05) and at each subsequent visit. 91 children were slow progressors and remained untreated. Their axial length growth rate did not change significantly out to 24 months. Spherical equivalent changed less than -0.5D annually in this group. Conclusion Identifying fast progressors before treatment initiation demonstrated a strong treatment effect with atropine 0.01% reducing their individual rate of myopia progression by 50%. Another large group of myopic children, slow progressors, continued without medical intervention. A baseline axial length growth rate is proposed as a guideline to identify fast progressors who are more likely to benefit from atropine 0.01%."
https://openalex.org/W3182774916,"Nearly 90% of deaths from cervical cancer occur in a low resource setting. In Ethiopia, the magnitude of precancerous cervical lesions ranges from 7% to 28%. Precancerous cervical lesions may progress to cervical cancer. Early screening and treatment of precancerous cervical lesions is a cost-effective way to avert the growth of cervical cancer. However, there has been limited research on risk factors for precancerous cervical lesions in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to identify risk factors for precancerous cervical lesions among women screened for cervical cancer in south Ethiopia.A facility-based unmatched case-control study was carried out in five health facilities in south Ethiopia between 8 May to 28 September 2018. Interviewer administered questionnaires were used to collect data from 98 cases and 197 controls. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify determinants of precancerous cervical lesions.Women aged 30-39 years (AOR = 2.51, 95% CI: 1.03-6.08), monthly income ≤66 (AOR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.77-6.97), initiation of first sexual intercourse at age less than or equal to 20 (AOR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.14-5.47), having more than one lifetime sexual partner (AOR = 4.70, 95% CI: 2.02-10.95), having a partner/ husband with more than one lifetime sexual partner (AOR = 2.98, 95% CI: 1.35-6.65) had higher odds of precancerous cervical lesions.Strategies to prevent precancerous cervical lesions should focus on modification of lifestyle and sexual behaviour. The findings of this study highlight several implications for policymakers: targeting older women for cervical cancer screening, addressing inequalities and education relating to risky sexual behaviour may reduce precancerous cervical lesions. Furthermore, future longitudinal studies are needed to assess the awareness of women about cervical cancer screening."
https://openalex.org/W3179823666,"Primary hyperhidrosis, excessive focal sweating is a common disease equally affecting men and women. Women tend to seek care more often and assess being more affected by hyperhidrosis in their daily life. The aim of this study was to explore experiences of living with primary hyperhidros in a sample of 15 women.Individual, semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 15 women diagnosed with primary hyperhidrosis and analysed by qualitative content analysis utilising an inductive approach.The analysis resulted in a theme, constantly guarding the female image, based on three categories, misfitting the feminine norms, avoiding the attention of others and passing like any woman. Primary hyperhidrosis in women disrupted the ideal feminine appearance. Wearing clothes that concealed hyperhidrosis and distancing from social gatherings, in combination with negative remarks by others, created stress and anxiety and had a negative effect on self-esteem. Women felt poorly understood by others regarding the extent of their sweating and were misunderstood in intimate situations while trying to reduce the sweat production. Choices regarding education and career opportunities were affected, since being exposed and receiving attention due to primary hyperhidrosis was unwanted. Treatment with botulinum toxin liberated women from excessive sweating and removed a social handicap they described living with.Primary hyperhidrosis in women disrupts the feminine appearance, lowers self-esteem and hinders social interactions. Clinicians assessing primary hyperhidrosis need to be aware that women may report the impairments from primary hyperhidrosis as being more associated with body image and appearance than with functional reductions in daily life. Educating patients, providing accurate information regarding the disease via media and cooperating with patient groups are important for increasing awareness and achieving progress in care for women with primary hyperhidrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3179974601,"In the poverty alleviation supply chain, subsidies for enterprises or farmers are widely implemented as part of government policy. However, subsidy fraud often occurs, such as misreporting cost information to secure subsidies. Inspired by this, our study aims to explore the optimal decision-making problem of the three-level (government + enterprises + farmers) poverty alleviation supply chain under asymmetric cost information. Four-stage models are constructed to capture the interactions among these three players. Additionally, numerical examples are used to analyze the implications of key parameters, such as cost coefficient and punitive measures coefficient, on supply chain members' optimal decision and profit. Our findings demonstrate that both the enterprise and the farmer can obtain maximum profit from the misreporting behavior. Unfortunately, this behavior always damages the profit of other participants and weakens the efficiency of subsidy policy. Moreover, to mitigate the negative implication of misreporting behavior, the government can establish punitive measures to curtail misreporting. Our work provides important policy implications for governments and enterprises. To ensure that more consumers have access to poverty alleviation products, government organizations should prioritize such projects. In addition, the provision of public facilities and technical guidance should be more effective and prompt to share enterprises' and farmers' costs. We further recommend that subsidy policies be formulated according to recipients' performance in poverty alleviation projects, with corresponding supervision and punitive measures. Finally, in cooperating with farmers in poverty alleviation, enterprises should maximize their interests and reduce costs through technological innovation and channel sharing."

Twenty-two of a planned 45 cisgender MSM with CUD were enrolled and had weekly follow-up visits during a 12-week treatment period, with substance use counseling, urine specimen collection, and completion of audio-computer assisted self-interview (ACASI) behavioral risk assessments. Adherence was measured by medication event monitoring systems (MEMS) caps and self-report. This study was terminated early because of an FDA safety alert for lorcaserin's long-term use.Eighty-six percent completed the trial, with 82% of weekly study follow-up visits completed. Adherence was 55.3% (lorcaserin 51.6% vs. placebo 66.2%) by MEMS cap and 56.9% (56.5% vs. placebo 57.9%) by self-report and did not differ significantly by treatment assignment. Intention-to-treat analyses (ITT) did not show differences in cocaine positivity by urine screen between the lorcaserin and placebo groups by 12 week follow-up (incidence risk ratio [IRR]: 0.96; 95%CI = 0.24-3.82, P = 0.95). However, self-reported cocaine use in timeline follow-back declined more significantly in the lorcaserin group compared to placebo (IRR: 0.66; 95%CI = 0.49-0.88; P = 0.004).We found that it is feasible, acceptable, and tolerable to conduct a placebo-controlled pharmacologic trial for MSM with CUD who are actively using cocaine. Lorcaserin was not associated with significant reductions in cocaine use by urine testing, but was associated with significant reductions in self-reported cocaine use. Future research may be needed to continue to explore the potential utility of 5-HT2cR agonists."
https://openalex.org/W3182100183,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the HXBM408 bacteria on the diversity of rat intestinal bacteria and the metabolism of soybean isoflavones. The control group was administered sterilized water and daidzein by gavage for 7 days. Conversely, the experimental group was administered HXBM408 solution and daidzein by gavage for 7 days. The content of the daidzein metabolite equol in rat feces in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05) on the 7th and 14th days. However, the content of daidzein and its metabolites in feces was not significantly different (P > 0.05). On the 7th day, the relative abundance of Streptococcus in the feces of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05), but the difference disappeared over time (P > 0.05). In the intestinal digesta of rats, the proteobacteria of the experimental group was significantly lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05). HXBM408 can increase the degradation ability of soybean isoflavones in a short period after ingestion, increase the number of beneficial intestinal flora, and improve the structure of the flora."
https://openalex.org/W3177723856,"Chytridiomycosis, a disease caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ( Bd ), has been linked with the disappearance of amphibian populations worldwide. Harlequin toads ( Atelopus ) are among the most severely impacted genera. Two species are already considered extinct and most of the others are at high risk of extinction. The recent rediscovery of harlequin toad populations coexisting with Bd suggest that the pathogen can maintain enzootic cycles at some locations. The mechanisms promoting coexistence, however, are not well understood. We explore the dynamics of Bd infection in harlequin toads by modeling a two-stage host population with transmission through environmental reservoirs. Simulations showed that variations in the recruitment of adults and the persistence of zoospores in the environment were more likely to drive shifts between extinction and coexistence than changes in the vulnerability of toads to infection with Bd . These findings highlight the need to identify mechanisms for assuring adult recruitment or minimizing transmission from potential reservoirs, biotic or abiotic, in recovering populations."
https://openalex.org/W3178076906,"In the past years, several plant breeding programs have been done to select outstanding genotypes of sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) for restoration purposes. Such programs have been focused mainly on agronomic traits; however, little attention has been paid to the genetic structure and environmental adaptation of the selected genotypes. Thus, in this study we evaluated the genetic structure of 85 sideoats grama populations in Mexico. In addition, we modeled the past, present and future environmental niche of the genetic clusters of this species. Ninety sideoats grama populations were genetically analyzed through AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms) markers. The environmental niche of the population clusters was modeled by using the maximum entropy method. The genetic analysis separated the populations into two genetically different clusters (p = 0.0003). The differentiation of these lineages can be partially explained by the paleoclimatic events experienced during the last interglacial and glacial maximums. Consequently, the genetic clusters have different environmental niche at the present time. Suitability areas for the distribution of Cluster I are mainly located in the central part of the country while the environmental niche of Cluster II is located in the semiarid region, close to the mountain range of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Thus, selection and restoration programs with sideoats grama must be carried out using local germplasm from each environmental niche. Given the environmental niche of both genetic clusters will suffer changes in the near and mid-century future, climate change must be considered for genotypes selection and restoration programs."
https://openalex.org/W3178967516,"There is growing evidence of the potential effects of musical training on the human brain, as well as increasing interest in the potential contribution of musical experience to healthy ageing. Conducting research on these topics with older adults requires a comprehensive assessment of musical experience across the lifespan, as well as an understanding of which variables might correlate with musical training and experience (such as personality traits or years of education). The present study introduces a short questionnaire for assessing lifetime musical training and experience in older populations: the Edinburgh Lifetime Musical Experience Questionnaire (ELMEQ). 420 participants from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 completed the ELMEQ at a mean age of 82 years. We used their responses to the ELMEQ to address three objectives: 1) to report the prevalence of lifetime musical experience in a sample of older adults; 2) to demonstrate how certain item-level responses can be used to model latent variables quantifying experience in different musical domains (playing a musical instrument, singing, self-reported musical ability, and music listening); and 3) to examine non-musical (lifespan) correlates of these domains. In this cohort, 420 of 431 participants (97%) completed the questionnaire. 40% of participants reported some lifetime experience of playing a musical instrument, starting at a median age of 10 years and playing for a median of 5 years. 38% of participants reported some lifetime experience of singing in a group. Non-musical variables of childhood environment, years of education, childhood cognitive ability, female sex, extraversion, history of arthritis and fewer constraints on activities of daily living were found to be associated, variously, with the domains of playing a musical instrument, singing, self-reported musical ability, and music listening. The ELMEQ was found to be an effective research tool with older adults and is made freely available for future research."
https://openalex.org/W3179083032,"Taiga bean goose ( Anser fabalis fabalis ) is an endangered subspecies that breeds sporadically in remote habitats in the arctic and boreal zones. Due to its elusive behaviour, there is a paucity of knowledge on the behaviour of taiga bean goose during the breeding season, and survey methods for monitoring numbers in the breeding areas are lacking. Camera traps are a useful tool for wildlife monitoring, particularly when there is a need for non-invasive methods due to the shy nature of the species. In this study, we tested the use of camera traps to investigate seasonal and diel activity patterns of taiga bean goose in Finland over two successive breeding seasons, 2018 and 2019. We did this by modelling counts of geese from images with generalized linear and additive mixed models. The camera type (cameras placed by experts specialized in bean goose ecology vs randomly placed cameras) did not influence the count of taiga bean goose (p = 0.386). However, the activity varied significantly by region, Julian day, time of day and temperature, with the study site (individual peatland) and year adding substantial random variation and uncertainty in the counts. Altogether, the best fitting model explained nearly 70% of the variation in taiga bean goose activity. The peak in activity occurred about a month later in the southernmost region compared to the more northern regions, which may indicate behaviours related to migration rather than breeding and moulting. Our results show that long-term monitoring with game camera traps provide a potential unobtrusive approach for studying the behavioural patterns of taiga bean goose and can increase our ecological knowledge of this little-known subspecies. The results can be applied to planning of the annual censuses and finding the optimal time frame for their execution."
https://openalex.org/W3180094868,"We explore a doubly-greedy approach to the issue of community detection in feature-rich networks. According to this approach, both the network and feature data are straightforwardly recovered from the underlying unknown non-overlapping communities, supplied with a center in the feature space and intensity weight(s) over the network each. Our least-squares additive criterion allows us to search for communities one-by-one and to find each community by adding entities one by one. A focus of this paper is that the feature-space data part is converted into a similarity matrix format. The similarity/link values can be used in either of two modes: (a) as measured in the same scale so that one may can meaningfully compare and sum similarity values across the entire similarity matrix (summability mode), and (b) similarity values in one column should not be compared with the values in other columns (nonsummability mode). The two input matrices and two modes lead us to developing four different Iterative Community Extraction from Similarity data (ICESi) algorithms, which determine the number of communities automatically. Our experiments at real-world and synthetic datasets show that these algorithms are valid and competitive."
https://openalex.org/W3180245025,"Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) are major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide with a substantial burden of the disease being borne by the low and middle income countries (LMICs). Interventions to change health behaviour which aim to improve the quality of life and reduce disease burden due to CRD require knowledge of the problem and factors influencing such behaviour. Our study sought to appreciate the lived experiences of people with CRD, their understanding of the disease and its risk factors, and usual practice of health behaviour in a rural low-literate community in southern India.Qualitative data were collected between September and December 2018 through eight focus group discussions (FGDs), five in-depth interviews and four key-informant interviews from patients and community members. Community engagement was undertaken prior to the study and all interviews and discussions were recorded with permission. Inductive coding was used to thematically analyse the results.Major themes included understanding of chronic lung disease, health behaviours, lived experiences with the disease and social norms, attitudes and other factors influencing health behaviour.Poor understanding of CRDs and their risk factors affect health seeking behaviour and/or health practices. Stigma associated with the disease and related health behaviours (e.g. inhaler use) creates emotional challenges and mental health problems, besides influencing health behaviour. However barriers can be circumvented by increasing community awareness; communication and connection with the community through community based health care providers can turn challenges into opportunities for better health care."
https://openalex.org/W3180370989,"We present a restricted infection rate inverse binomial-based approach to better predict COVID-19 cases after a family gathering. The traditional inverse binomial (IB) model is inappropriate to match the reality of COVID-19, because the collected data contradicts the model’s requirement that variance should be larger than the expected value. Our version of an IB model is more appropriate, as it can accommodate all potential data scenarios in which the variance is smaller, equal, or larger than the mean. This is unlike the usual IB, which accommodates only the scenario in which the variance is more than the mean. Therefore, we propose a refined version of an IB model to be able to accommodate all potential data scenarios. The application of the approach is based on a restricted infectivity rate and methodology on COVID-19 data, which exhibit two clusters of infectivity. Cluster 1 has a smaller number of primary cases and exhibits larger variance than the expected cases with a negative correlation of 28%, implying that the number of secondary cases is lesser when the number of primary cases increases and vice versa. The traditional IB model is appropriate for Cluster 1. The probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.13 among the primary, but is 0.75 among the secondary in Cluster 1, with a wider gap. Cluster 2, with a larger number of primary cases, exhibits smaller variance than the expected cases with a correlation of 79%, implying that the number of primary and secondary cases do increase or decrease together. Cluster 2 disqualifies the traditional IB model and requires its refined version. The probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.74 among the primary, but is 0.72 among the secondary in Cluster 2, with a narrower gap. The advantages of the proposed approach include the model’s ability to estimate the community’s health system memory, as future policies might reduce COVID’s spread. In our approach, the current hazard level to be infected with COVID-19 and the odds of not contracting COVID-19 among the primary in comparison to the secondary groups are estimable and interpretable."
https://openalex.org/W3180532111,"The present work explores the distinctive contribution of motor planning and control to human reaching movements. In particular, the movements were triggered by the selection of a prepotent response (Dominant) or, instead, by the inhibition of the prepotent response, which required the selection of an alternative one (Non-dominant). To this end, we adapted a Go/No-Go task to investigate both the dominant and non-dominant movements of a cohort of 19 adults, utilizing kinematic measures to discriminate between the planning and control components of the two actions. In this experiment, a low-cost, easy to use, 3-axis wrist-worn accelerometer was put to good use to obtain raw acceleration data and to compute and break down its velocity components. The values obtained with this task indicate that with the inhibition of a prepotent response, the selection and execution of the alternative one yields both a longer reaction time and movement duration. Moreover, the peak velocity occurred later in time in the non-dominant response with respect to the dominant response, revealing that participants tended to indulge more in motor planning than in adjusting their movement along the way. Finally, comparing such results to the findings obtained by other means in the literature, we discuss the feasibility of an accelerometer-based analysis to disentangle distinctive cognitive mechanisms of human movements."
https://openalex.org/W3181942371,"Kenya started implementing voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) for HIV prevention in 2008 and adopted the use of decision makers program planning tool version 2 (DMPPT2) in 2016, to model the impact of circumcisions performed annually on the population prevalence of male circumcision (MC) in the subsequent years. Results of initial DMPPT2 modeling included implausible MC prevalence estimates, of up to 100%, for age bands whose sustained high uptake of VMMC pointed to unmet needs. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among adolescents and men aged 10-29 years to determine the population level MC prevalence, guide target setting for achieving the goal of 80% MC prevalence and for validating DMPPT2 modelled estimates.Beginning July to September 2019, a total of 3,569 adolescents and men aged 10-29 years from households in Siaya, Kisumu, Homa Bay and Migori Counties were interviewed and examined to establish the proportion already circumcised medically or non-medically. We measured agreement between self-reported and physically verified circumcision status and computed circumcision prevalence by age band and County. All statistical were test done at 5% level of significance.The observed MC prevalence for 15-29-year-old men was above 75% in all four counties; Homa Bay 75.6% (95% CI [69.0-81.2]), Kisumu 77.9% (95% CI [73.1-82.1]), Siaya 80.3% (95% CI [73.7-85.5]), and Migori 85.3% (95% CI [75.3-91.7]) but were 0.9-12.4% lower than DMPPT2-modelled estimates. For young adolescents 10-14 years, the observed prevalence ranged from 55.3% (95% CI [40.2-69.5]) in Migori to 74.9% (95% CI [68.8-80.2]) in Siaya and were 25.1-32.9% lower than DMMPT 2 estimates. Nearly all respondents (95.5%) consented to physical verification of their circumcision status with an agreement rate of 99.2% between self-reported and physically verified MC status (kappa agreement p-value<0.0001).This survey revealed overestimation of MC prevalence from DMPPT2-model compared to the observed population MC prevalence and provided new reference data for setting realistic program targets and re-calibrating inputs into DMPPT2. Periodic population-based MC prevalence surveys, especially for established programs, can help reconcile inconsistencies between VMMC program uptake data and modeled MC prevalence estimates which are based on the number of procedures reported in the program annually."
https://openalex.org/W3182900493,"Persons with COPD experience co-occurring dyspnea and pain. Little is known about the relationship between symptom co-occurrence with physical activity (PA) and exercise. Novel diagnostic tools are needed for accurate symptom discrimination. In this secondary analysis, we examined relationships between baseline assessments of pain, dyspnea, objectively measured PA, and exercise capacity in persons with COPD who previously enrolled in three PA studies. Pain was assessed with the bodily pain domain of the Veterans RAND-36 (VR-36), and dyspnea with the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale. Average daily step count was assessed with the Omron HJ-720ITC or FitBit Zip pedometer, and exercise capacity with 6-minute walk test (6MWT). We also conducted a pilot neuroimaging study. Neuroimaging data were acquired on a Siemens 3-Tesla Magnetom Prismafit whole-body scanner. Analysis of variance assessed trends in daily step count and 6MWT distance across categories of co-occurring pain and dyspnea. General linear models examined relationships between cortical thickness and resting state functional connectivity (fc) with symptoms and functional status. In 373 Veterans, 98% were male with mean age 70.5± 8.3 years and FEV1% predicted 59 ± 21%. Compared to those with no co-occurrence of pain and dyspnea, those with co-occurrence walked 1,291-1,444 fewer steps per day and had an 80-85 m lower 6MWT distance. Ten males participated in the pilot neuroimaging study. Predominant findings were that lower cortical thickness and greater fc were associated with higher pain and dyspnea, p<0.05. Greater cortical thickness and lower fc were associated with higher daily step count and 6MWT distance, p<0.05. Regional patterns of associations differed for pain and dyspnea, suggesting that cortical thickness and fc may discriminate symptoms. Co-occurring dyspnea and pain in COPD are associated with significant reductions in PA and exercise capacity. It may be feasible for neuroimaging markers to discriminate between pain and dyspnea."

In this study, we evaluated the effects of different types of N sources on rice growth, yield, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP), amylose and cooked rice elongation. Two indica rice cultivars, Basmati 385 (B385), Xiangyaxiangzhan (XYXZ) and two japonica cultivars, Yunjingyou (YJY), Daohuaxiang (DHX) were grown in experimental pots with six replications under four N sources: Potassium nitrate (KNO3), ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), urea (H2NCONH2) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3) in 2019 and 2020 early seasons. Our results showed that N dynamics regulated the number of panicles, 1000-grain weight, grain yield, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, amylose and cooked rice elongation across all the four treatments. The NH4HCO3 treatment significantly increased the number of panicles and grain yield across the four rice varieties compared with KNO3, H2NCONH2 and NaNO3 N sources in both 2019 and 2020 early season, The KNO3 treatment significantly showed higher 1000-grain weight in B-385, YJY, XYXZ and DHX compared to other N sources. Compared with other N sources treatment, the NH4HCO3 treatments significantly increased the 2AP contents in heading stage leaves, matured leaves and grains of B-385, YJY, XYXZ and DHX respectively. Cooked rice elongation percentage also showed significant difference in all treatments studied with KNO3 recorded the highest across the four varieties. Analysis of major enzymes and compounds such as P5C, P5CS, PDH, Pyrroline, proline and Methylglyoxal showed remarkable differences in each cultivar at heading and maturity stages with higher activity in NH4HCO3 and H2NCONH2 treatments. Similarly, in all treatments, we also observed significant increase in amylose content percentage, with NH4HCO3 having greater percentage of amylose."
https://openalex.org/W3177818432,"This study aimed to assess the value of quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) combined with other risk factors in predicting in-hospital mortality in patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected infection. This post-hoc analysis of a prospective multicenter study dataset included 34 emergency departments across Japan (December 2017 to February 2018). We included adult patients (age ≥16 years) who presented to the emergency department with suspected infection. qSOFA was calculated and recorded by senior emergency physicians when they suspected an infection. Different types of sepsis-related risk factors (demographic, functional, and laboratory values) were chosen from prior studies. A logistic regression model was used to assess the predictive value of qSOFA for in-hospital mortality in models based on the following combination of predictors: 1) qSOFA-Only; 2) qSOFA+Age; 3) qSOFA+Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS); 4) qSOFA+Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI); 5) qSOFA+lactate levels; 6) qSOFA+Age+CCI+CFS+lactate levels. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and other key clinical statistics at Youden's index, where the sum of sensitivity and specificity is maximized. Following prior literature, an AUC >0.9 was deemed to indicate high accuracy; 0.7-0.9, moderate accuracy; 0.5-0.7, low accuracy; and 0.5, a chance result. Of the 951 patients included in the analysis, 151 (15.9%) died during hospitalization. The AUC for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.627 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.580-0.673) for the qSOFA-Only model. Addition of other variables only marginally improved the model's AUC; the model that included all potentially relevant variables yielded an AUC of only 0.730 (95% CI: 0.687-0.774). Other key statistic values were similar among all models, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.55-0.65 and 0.60-0.75, respectively. In this post-hoc data analysis from a prospective multicenter study based in Japan, combining qSOFA with other sepsis-related risk factors only marginally improved the model's predictive value."

Based on the framework of GVCs'decomposition, we establish a hierarchical linear model (HLM) withthe data from 2007 to 2017 in the ADB MIRO, WTO BaTiS and WITS databases to analyze the impact of producer services imports in RCEP economies on the value-added domestic exports of manufacturing in countries around the world, and the conclusions are as follows: (1) Producer service imports have a significant positive impact on the domestic value-added of manufacturing exports through direct effects, upstream effects and downstream effects. The downstream effect is the main driving force for the improvement of manufacturing. After using instrumental variables to resolve endogeneity, the conclusion remains stable; (2) The downstream effect of insurance imports is the largest among producer services imports. After the outbreak of the world financial crisis, the transmission effect of the industry chain was higher in 2008 than before the crisis. (3) Due to the high degree of specialization of industrial division in developed economies, the transfer effect of the three major industrial chains is greater than that of developing countries and regions."
https://openalex.org/W3178160938,"The aim was to predict and understand variations in swimmer performance between individual and relay events, and develop a predictive model for the 4x200-m swimming freestyle relay event to help inform team selection and strategy.Race data for 716 relay finals (4 x 200-m freestyle) from 14 international competitions between 2010-2018 were analysed. Individual 200-m freestyle season best time for the same year was located for each swimmer. Linear regression and machine learning was applied to 4 x 200-m swimming freestyle relay events.Compared to the individual event, the lowest ranked swimmer in the team (-0.62 s, CI = [-0.94, -0.30]) and American swimmers (-0.48 s [-0.89, -0.08]) typically swam faster 200-m times in relay events. Random forest models predicted gold, silver, bronze and non-medal with 100%, up to 41%, up to 63%, and 93% sensitivity, respectively.Team finishing position was strongly associated with the differential time to the fastest team (mean decrease in Gini (MDG) when this variable was omitted = 31.3), world rankings of team members (average ranking MDG of 18.9), and the order of swimmers (MDG = 6.9). Differential times are based on the sum of individual swimmer's season's best times, and along with world rankings, reflect team strength. In contrast, the order of swimmers reflects strategy. This type of analysis could assist coaches and support staff in selecting swimmers and team orders for relay events to enhance the likelihood of success."
https://openalex.org/W3179115426,"The best agro-industrial performance presented by a crop genotype in one environment may not be reproduced in another owing to complex edaphoclimatic variations. Therefore, breeding programs are constantly attempting to obtain, through artificial hybridization, novel genotypes with high adaptability and stability potential. The objective of this study was to analyze genetic divergence in sugarcane based on the genotypic values of adaptability and stability. A total of 11 sugarcane genotypes were analyzed for eight agro-industrial traits. The genotypic values of the traits were determined using mixed model methodology, and the genetic divergence based on phenotypic and genotypic values was measured using the Mahalanobis distance. The distance matrices were correlated using the Mantel test, and the genotypes were grouped using the Tocher method. Genetic divergence is more accurate when based on genotypic values free of genotype-environment interactions and will differ from genetic divergence based on phenotypic data, changing the genotype allocations in the groups. The above methodology can be applied to assess genetic divergence to obtain novel sugarcane genotypes with higher productivity that are adapted to intensive agricultural systems using diverse technologies. This methodology can also be tested in other crops to increase accuracy in selecting the parents to be crossed."
https://openalex.org/W3179129367,"Intermediate risk prostate cancer represents a largely heterogeneous group with diverse disease extent. We sought to establish rates of adverse pathological features important for radiation planning by analyzing surgical specimens from men with intermediate risk prostate cancer who underwent immediate radical prostatectomy, and to define clinical pathologic features that may predict adverse outcomes.A total of 1552 men diagnosed with intermediate risk prostate cancer who underwent immediate radical prostatectomy between 1/1/2005 and 12/31/2015 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included available preoperative PSA level, pathology reports of transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, and radical prostatectomy. Incidences of various pathological adverse features were evaluated. Patient characteristics and clinical disease features were analyzed for their predictive values.Fifty percent of men with high risk features (defined as PSA >10 but <20 or biopsy primary Gleason pattern of 4) had pathological upstage to T3 or higher disease. The incidence of upgrade to Gleason score of 8 or higher and the incidence of lymph node positive disease was low. Biopsy primary Gleason pattern of 4, and PSA greater than 10 but less than 20, affected adverse pathology in addition to age and percent positive biopsy cores. Older age and increased percentage of positive cores were significant risk factors of adverse pathology.Our findings underscore the importance of comprehensive staging beyond PSA level, prostate biopsy, and CT/bone scan for men with intermediate risk prostate cancer proceeding with radiation in the era of highly conformal treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3180681759,"The efficacy of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) depends on how closely electrodes are implanted relative to an individual's ideal stimulation location. Yet, previous studies have assessed how closely electrodes are implanted relative to the planned location, after homogenizing data to a reference. Thus here, we measured how accurately electrodes are implanted relative to an ideal, dorsal STN stimulation location, assessed on each individual's native imaging. This measure captures not only the technical error of stereotactic implantation but also constraints imposed by planning a suitable trajectory.This cross-sectional study assessed 226 electrodes in 113 consecutive PD patients implanted with bilateral STN-DBS by experienced clinicians utilizing awake, microelectrode guided, surgery. The error (Euclidean distance) between the actual electrode trajectory versus a nominated ideal, dorsal STN stimulation location was determined in each hemisphere on native imaging and predictive factors sought.The median electrode location error was 1.62 mm (IQR = 1.23 mm). This error exceeded 3 mm in 28/226 electrodes (12.4%). Location error did not differ between hemispheres implanted first or second, suggesting brain shift was minimised. Location error did not differ between electrodes positioned with (48/226), or without, a preceding microelectrode trajectory shift (suggesting such shifts were beneficial). There was no relationship between location error and case order, arguing against a learning effect.The proximity of STN-DBS electrodes to a nominated ideal, dorsal STN, stimulation location is highly variable, even when implanted by experienced clinicians with brain shift minimized, and without evidence of a learning effect. Using this measure, we found that assessments on awake patients (microelectrode recordings and clinical examination) likely yielded beneficial intraoperative decisions to improve positioning. In many patients the error is likely to have reduced therapeutic efficacy. More accurate methods to implant STN-DBS electrodes relative to the ideal stimulation location are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3181188183,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in many complex diseases. Efficient and accurate evaluation of mitochondrial functionality is crucial for understanding pathology as well as facilitating novel therapeutic developments. As a popular platform, Seahorse extracellular flux (XF) analyzer is widely used for measuring mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in living cells. A hidden feature of Seahorse XF OCR data is that it has a complex data structure, caused by nesting and crossing between measurement cycles, wells and plates. Surprisingly, statistical analysis of Seahorse XF data has not received sufficient attention, and current methods completely ignore the complex data structure, impairing the robustness of statistical inference.To rigorously incorporate the complex structure into data analysis, here we developed a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework, OCRbayes, and demonstrated its applicability based on analysis of published data sets.We showed that OCRbayes can analyze Seahorse XF OCR experimental data derived from either single or multiple plates. Moreover, OCRbayes has potential to be used for diagnosing patients with mitochondrial diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3182392245,"Low-normal thyroid function is associated with numerous metabolic risk factors including insulin resistance (IR). Triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is a new surrogate marker of IR calculated by fasting triglyceride and glucose levels. Here, we investigated the association between thyroid function and TyG index in non-diabetic euthyroid adults.This cross-sectional study was based on data from the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 2015 including 1482 individuals (741 men and 741 women). Serum thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) levels were measured.After adjusting for confounders, there was an inverse relationship of TyG index with fT4 in men (β = -0.094, P = 0.009) and a positive relationship of TyG index with TSH in women (β = 0.078, P = 0.018). The lowest fT4 tertile in men (P = 0.001) and the highest TSH tertile in women (P = 0.010) exhibited increased TyG index after adjusting for confounders. The lowest fT4 tertile also showed increased homeostatic model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR) only in men (P = 0.006). Odds ratios (ORs) for the high TyG index, which was defined as the highest TyG quartile decreased in the highest and second highest tertile of fT4 in men (OR = 0.41 and OR = 0.45, respectively; P < 0.001) and increased in highest tertile of TSH in women (OR = 1.81, P = 0.031) after adjusting for confounders. The OR for high HOMA-IR defined as the highest HOMA-IR quartile was also lower in the highest and second highest fT4 tertiles in men (both OR = 0.47; P = 0.003).This is the first study to suggest that TyG index is a good surrogate marker of IR in evaluating its relationship with thyroid function."
https://openalex.org/W3179453825,"Responsible for at least one in nine pediatric deaths, diarrheal diseases are the leading, global cause of death. Further abetted by improper antibiotic use in a hospital setting, children with acute watery diarrhea can see prolonged hospital stays, and unwanted adverse effects such as antibiotic resistance. Hence, this study is aimed to identify the association between antibiotic usage for the treatment of acute watery diarrhea in children, and the impact this line of management has on the duration of their hospital stay.A retrospective review was conducted at the department of Pediatric of Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) in Karachi. A total of 305 records of children aged 6 months to 5 years who were admitted with a diagnosis of acute watery diarrhea from June 2017 -December 2018 was screened, of which 175 fulfilled the eligibility criteria. A predesigned questionnaire was used to collect demographic information, comorbidities, and clinical features, severity of dehydration, clinical examination, treatment received, and laboratory investigations. The primary outcome of this study was the length of hospital stay measured against the number of hours a child stayed in hospital for treatment of acute watery diarrhea. The statistical analysis was carried out using STATA version 14 to reach conclusive results.175 patients presented with acute watery diarrhea, out of which 106 (60.6%) did not receive antibiotics. The median (IQR) age of the group that did not receive antibiotics was 12.0 (12.0) months compared to 15.0 (12.0) months for the group that did receive antibiotics. In both groups, there were more males than females, less than 15% of the patients were severely malnourished (WHZ score -3SD) and less than 10% of the patients were severely dehydrated. The median (IQR) length of hospital stay (hours) was 32.0 (19.0) respectively for the group that did not receive antibiotic and 41.0 (32.0) for the group that did receive antibiotic therapy. The expected length of hospital stay for the group that received antibiotic therapy was 0.22 hours higher than the group that did not. Finally, as compared to females, hospital stay for males was longer by 0.25 hours.In conclusion, antibiotic use was associated with a prolonged hospital stay in children with acute watery diarrhea as compared to children who did not receive antibiotics. Large scale robust prospective studies are needed to establish this association using this observational data."
https://openalex.org/W3181122285,"Unsafe abortion is a leading cause of maternal mortality, and access to safe abortion services remains a public health priority in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A considerable amount of abortion research exists in the region; however, the spread of existing evidence is uneven such that some countries have an acute shortage of data with others over-researched. The imbalance reflects the complexities in prioritization among researchers, academics, and funders, and undeniably impedes effective policy and advocacy efforts. This scoping review aims to identify and map the landscape of abortion research in SSA, summarize existing knowledge, and pinpoint significant gaps, both substantive and geographic, requiring further investigation. This review will provide direction for future research, investments, and offer guidance for policy and programming on safe abortion.We utilize the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodology for conducting scoping reviews. We will perform the search for articles in 8 electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, AJOL, Science Direct, SCOPUS, HINARI, Web of Knowledge, CINAHL, and WHO Regional Databases). We will include studies written in English or French language, produced or published between January 1, 2011, and July 31, 2021, and pertain directly to the subject of abortion in SSA. Using a tailored extraction frame, we will extract relevant information from publications that meet the inclusion criteria. Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis in response to key review questions.Formal ethical approval is not required, as no primary data will be collected. The findings of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations."
https://openalex.org/W3181355478,"Head injury, a common presentation to the emergency department (ED), is a substantial problem in developing countries like Nepal. The current national institute for health and clinical excellence (NICE) guideline revised in January 2014 focuses on effective clinical assessment and early management of head injuries according to their severity in all age groups. This study assessed the impact of implementing this guideline on the proportions of computed tomography (CT) head scans, guideline adherence, and confidence level of the attending physicians.We consecutively recruited 139 traumatic head injury (THI) patients in this prospective pre-post interventional study conducted in the ED of a tertiary care center. We implemented the NICE guideline into routine practice using multimodal intervention through physicians' education sessions, information sheets and guideline-dissemination. The pre and post-implementation CT head scan rates were compared. The post-implementation guideline adherence was assessed. Online Google form-questionnaires including 12 validated case scenarios were distributed to the attending physicians at the end of both phases to assess their confidence levels.The implementation resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of CT head scan rates from 92.0% to 70.0% (p-value = 0.005). Following educational interventions, improved guideline adherence of 20.3 percentage points (p-value = 0.001) was observed. Nine ED attending physicians were enrolled in the study who showed statistically significant improvement in their confidence level following the intervention. The NICE guideline showed a sensitivity and specificity of 93.6% and 76.4% with 82.6% accuracy compared to that of clinical judgment (100%, 34.6%, and 58.1% respectively) in detecting intracranial lesions.The implementation was successful in satisfying the aim of the NICE guideline by decreasing the proportion of CT head scans, improving guideline adherence and increasing the confidence of the attending physicians."
https://openalex.org/W3181816680,"In the present preregistered study, we evaluated the possibility of a shared cognitive mechanism during verbal and non-verbal tasks and therefore the implication of domain-general cognitive control during language comprehension. We hypothesized that a behavioral cost will be observed during a dual-task including both verbal and non-verbal difficult processing. Specifically, to test this claim, we designed a dual-task paradigm involving: an auditory language comprehension task (sentence comprehension) and a non-verbal Flanker task (including congruent and incongruent trials). We manipulated sentence ambiguity and evaluated if the ambiguity effect modified behavioral performances in the non-verbal Flanker task. Under the assumption that ambiguous sentences induce a more difficult process than unambiguous sentences, we expected non-verbal flanker task performances to be impaired only when a simultaneous difficult language processing is performed. This would be specifically reflected by a performance cost during incongruent Flanker items only during ambiguous sentence presentation. Conversely, we observed a facilitatory effect for the incongruent Flanker items during ambiguous sentence suggesting better non-verbal inhibitory performances when an ambiguous sentence was simultaneously processed. Exploratory data analysis suggests that this effect is not only related to a more difficult language processing but also to the previous (n-1) Flanker item. Indeed, results showed that incongruent n-1 Flanker items led to a facilitation of the incongruent synchronized Flanker items only when ambiguous sentences were conjointly presented. This result, even if it needs to be corroborated in future studies, suggests that the recruitment of executive control mechanisms facilitates subsequent executive control implication during difficult language processing. The present study suggests a common executive control mechanism during difficult verbal and non-verbal tasks."
