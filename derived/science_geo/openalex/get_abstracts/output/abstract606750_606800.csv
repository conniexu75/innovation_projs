https://openalex.org/W2787816121,"Accurate pathological diagnosis is crucial for optimal management of patients with cancer. For the approximately 100 known tumour types of the central nervous system, standardization of the diagnostic process has been shown to be particularly challenging—with substantial inter-observer variability in the histopathological diagnosis of many tumour types. Here we present a comprehensive approach for the DNA methylation-based classification of central nervous system tumours across all entities and age groups, and demonstrate its application in a routine diagnostic setting. We show that the availability of this method may have a substantial impact on diagnostic precision compared to standard methods, resulting in a change of diagnosis in up to 12% of prospective cases. For broader accessibility, we have designed a free online classifier tool, the use of which does not require any additional onsite data processing. Our results provide a blueprint for the generation of machine-learning-based tumour classifiers across other cancer entities, with the potential to fundamentally transform tumour pathology. An online approach for the DNA methylation-based classification of central nervous system tumours across all entities and age groups has been developed to help to improve current diagnostic standards. Precise cancer diagnoses are essential to ensure the best treatment plans for patients, but standardization of the diagnostic process has been challenging. The authors present a comprehensive approach for DNA-methylation-based classification of brain tumours. The tool improves diagnostic precision of standard methods, and is made available online for broad accessibility. The results illustrate the potential applications of molecular diagnosis tools."
https://openalex.org/W2761412195,"The modern theory of electric polarization in crystals associates the dipole moment of an insulator with a Berry phase of its electronic ground state [1, 2]. This concept constituted a breakthrough that not only solved the long-standing puzzle of how to calculate dipole moments in crystals, but also lies at the core of the theory of topological band structures in insulators and superconductors, including the quantum anomalous Hall insulator [3, 4] and the quantum spin Hall insulator [5-7], as well as quantized adiabatic pumping processes [8-10]. A recent theoretical proposal extended the Berry phase framework to account for higher electric multipole moments [11], revealing the existence of topological phases that have not previously been observed. Here we demonstrate the first member of this predicted class -a quantized quadrupole topological insulator- experimentally produced using a GHz-frequency reconfigurable microwave circuit. We confirm the non-trivial topological phase through both spectroscopic measurements, as well as with the identification of corner states that are manifested as a result of the bulk topology. We additionally test a critical prediction that these corner states are protected by the topology of the bulk, and not due to surface artifacts, by deforming the edge between the topological and trivial regimes. Our results provide conclusive evidence of a unique form of robustness which has never previously been observed."

https://openalex.org/W2790485917,"Nuclear pore complexes play central roles as gatekeepers of RNA and protein transport between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. However, their large size and dynamic nature have impeded a full structural and functional elucidation. Here we determined the structure of the entire 552-protein nuclear pore complex of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae at sub-nanometre precision by satisfying a wide range of data relating to the molecular arrangement of its constituents. The nuclear pore complex incorporates sturdy diagonal columns and connector cables attached to these columns, imbuing the structure with strength and flexibility. These cables also tie together all other elements of the nuclear pore complex, including membrane-interacting regions, outer rings and RNA-processing platforms. Inwardly directed anchors create a high density of transport factor-docking Phe-Gly repeats in the central channel, organized into distinct functional units. This integrative structure enables us to rationalize the architecture, transport mechanism and evolutionary origins of the nuclear pore complex. The structure of the yeast nuclear pore complex, determined at sub-nanometre precision using an integrative approach that combines a wide range of data, reveals details of its architecture, transport mechanism and evolutionary origins. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the gateways for the transport of RNA and proteins into and out of the nucleus. Although previous work has provided structural insights into parts of NPCs, getting a full picture of these complexes has proved difficult owing to their large size and dynamic nature. A multidisciplinary team of researchers now report the structure of the entire 552-protein NPC of the yeast at a sub-nanometre level using an integrative approach including mass spectrometry, cryo-electron tomography and chemical crosslinking. The structure provides a detailed view of the functional elements of the NPC and clarifies its architecture, mechanism of action and evolutionary origins."
https://openalex.org/W2736547131,"Understanding how gene regulatory networks control the progressive restriction of cell fates is a long-standing challenge. Recent advances in measuring gene expression in single cells are providing new insights into lineage commitment. However, the regulatory events underlying these changes remain unclear. Here we investigate the dynamics of chromatin regulatory landscapes during embryogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq), we profiled chromatin accessibility in over 20,000 single nuclei from fixed Drosophila melanogaster embryos spanning three landmark embryonic stages: 2-4 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 5 blastoderm nuclei), when each embryo comprises around 6,000 multipotent cells; 6-8 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 10-11), to capture a midpoint in embryonic development when major lineages in the mesoderm and ectoderm are specified; and 10-12 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 13), when each of the embryo's more than 20,000 cells are undergoing terminal differentiation. Our results show that there is spatial heterogeneity in the accessibility of the regulatory genome before gastrulation, a feature that aligns with future cell fate, and that nuclei can be temporally ordered along developmental trajectories. During mid-embryogenesis, tissue granularity emerges such that individual cell types can be inferred by their chromatin accessibility while maintaining a signature of their germ layer of origin. Analysis of the data reveals overlapping usage of regulatory elements between cells of the endoderm and non-myogenic mesoderm, suggesting a common developmental program that is reminiscent of the mesendoderm lineage in other species. We identify 30,075 distal regulatory elements that exhibit tissue-specific accessibility. We validated the germ-layer specificity of a subset of these predicted enhancers in transgenic embryos, achieving an accuracy of 90%. Overall, our results demonstrate the power of shotgun single-cell profiling of embryos to resolve dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape during development, and to uncover the cis-regulatory programs of metazoan germ layers and cell types."

https://openalex.org/W2793618798,"We demonstrate a synchronized readout (SR) technique for spectrally selective detection of oscillating magnetic fields with sub-millihertz resolution, using coherent manipulation of solid state spins. The SR technique is implemented in a sensitive magnetometer (~50 picotesla/Hz^(1/2)) based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, and used to detect nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals from liquid-state samples. We obtain NMR spectral resolution ~3 Hz, which is nearly two orders of magnitude narrower than previously demonstrated with NV based techniques, using a sample volume of ~1 picoliter. This is the first application of NV-detected NMR to sense Boltzmann-polarized nuclear spin magnetization, and the first to observe chemical shifts and J-couplings."
https://openalex.org/W2789302016,"Large-scale phenotyping efforts have demonstrated that approximately 25-30% of mouse gene knockouts cause intrauterine lethality. Analysis of these mutants has largely focused on the embryo and not the placenta, despite the crucial role of this extraembryonic organ for developmental progression. Here we screened 103 embryonic lethal and sub-viable mouse knockout lines from the Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders program for placental phenotypes. We found that 68% of knockout lines that are lethal at or after mid-gestation exhibited placental dysmorphologies. Early lethality (embryonic days 9.5-14.5) is almost always associated with severe placental malformations. Placental defects correlate strongly with abnormal brain, heart and vascular development. Analysis of mutant trophoblast stem cells and conditional knockouts suggests that a considerable number of factors that cause embryonic lethality when ablated have primary gene function in trophoblast cells. Our data highlight the hugely under-appreciated importance of placental defects in contributing to abnormal embryo development and suggest key molecular nodes that govern placenta formation."

https://openalex.org/W2793869426,"In an Arabidopsis model, repression of cytokinin in the root meristem produces a distinct population of xylem-pole endodermal cells, which resist suberization to become passage cells that enable transport across the otherwise-impermeable endodermis. In plant roots, the central fluid that transports tissues—the phloem and the xylem—are surrounded by a protective sheet, the endodermal cell layer. This layer contains specialized cellular structures called Casparian strips and suberin, which restrict diffusion. However, the endodermis is 'dotted' with a varying number of unsuberized cells known as passage cells, which seem to act as passageways along an otherwise impermeable sheet. Niko Geldner and team investigated the formation and function of these cells. They report that the endodermis consists of two distinct cell groups—xylem-pole endodermis and phloem-pole endodermis—that differ in their responses to the hormones cytokinin and auxin. As a consequence, the xylem-pole endodermis develops resistance to suberization of some of its cells to form passage cells. The authors also show that the number of passage cells and the local nutrient status have a dynamic regulatory relationship. In vascular plants, the root endodermis surrounds the central vasculature as a protective sheath that is analogous to the polarized epithelium in animals, and contains ring-shaped Casparian strips that restrict diffusion1. After an initial lag phase, individual endodermal cells suberize in an apparently random fashion to produce ‘patchy’ suberization that eventually generates a zone of continuous suberin deposition2. Casparian strips and suberin lamellae affect paracellular and transcellular transport, respectively. Most angiosperms maintain some isolated cells in an unsuberized state3 as so-called ‘passage cells’, which have previously been suggested to enable uptake across an otherwise-impermeable endodermal barrier3,4. Here we demonstrate that these passage cells are late emanations of a meristematic patterning process that reads out the underlying non-radial symmetry of the vasculature. This process is mediated by the non-cell-autonomous repression of cytokinin signalling in the root meristem, and leads to distinct phloem- and xylem-pole-associated endodermal cells. The latter cells can resist abscisic acid-dependent suberization to produce passage cells. Our data further demonstrate that, during meristematic patterning, xylem-pole-associated endodermal cells can dynamically alter passage-cell numbers in response to nutrient status, and that passage cells express transporters and locally affect the expression of transporters in adjacent cortical cells."

https://openalex.org/W2792705680,"MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is one of the most abundant microRNAs in mammalian cells. It has been intensively studied for its role in regulating apoptosis and oncogenic transformation. However, the impact of miR-21 on host anti-tumor immunity remains unknown. Tumor-associated macrophages are a major leukocyte type that infiltrates tumors and predominantly develops into immunosuppressive, tumor-promoting M2-like macrophages. In contrast, the pro-inflammatory M1−like macrophages have tumoricidal activity. In this study, we show that genetic deficiency of miR-21 promotes the polarization of macrophages toward an M1-like phenotype in vivo and in vitro in the presence of tumor cells; thus it confers host mice with enhanced anti-tumor immunity. By downregulating JAK2 and STAT1, miR-21 inhibits the IFN-γ-induced STAT1 signaling pathway, which is required for macrophage M1 polarization. We also show that the expression of miR-21 in macrophages is regulated upon polarization stimuli as well as upon macrophages co-culturing with tumor cells. Thus, tumor cells may stimulate miR-21 expression in tumor-associated macrophages to prevent tumoricidal M1 polarization. However, augmented STAT1 signaling mediated by miR-21 deficiency upregulates PD-L1 expression in macrophages, which is known to inhibit phagocytic anti-tumor activity. This adverse effect can be alleviated by PD-1 blockade; indeed, miR-21 depletion in macrophages and PD-1 antibody treatment offer superior anti-tumor activity than either agent alone. These studies shed lights on potential application of the combination of miR-21 inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade to target the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2793778731,"The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is an ATP-driven proton pump involved in many cellular processes. An important mechanism by which V-ATPase activity is controlled is the reversible assembly of its two domains, namely the peripheral V1 domain and the integral V0 domain. Although reversible assembly is conserved across all eukaryotic organisms, the signaling pathways controlling it have not been fully characterized. Here, we identify glucose starvation as a novel regulator of V-ATPase assembly in mammalian cells. During acute glucose starvation, the V-ATPase undergoes a rapid and reversible increase in assembly and activity as measured by lysosomal acidification. Because the V-ATPase has recently been implicated in the activation of AMP kinase (AMPK), a critical cellular energy sensor that is also activated upon glucose starvation, we compared the time course of AMPK activation and V-ATPase assembly upon glucose starvation. We observe that AMPK activation precedes increased V-ATPase activity. Moreover, the starvation-induced increase in V-ATPase activity and assembly are prevented by the AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin. These results suggest that increased assembly and activity of the V-ATPase upon glucose starvation are dependent upon AMPK. We also find that the PI3K/Akt pathway, which has previously been implicated in controlling V-ATPase assembly in mammalian cells, also plays a role in the starvation-induced increase in V-ATPase assembly and activity.

The function of the EGF-induced increase in V-ATPase assembly and activity is thought to be in providing adequate levels of amino acids derived from lysosomal protein degradation to allow maximal activation of mTORC1 signaling (21Xu Y. Parmar A. Roux E. Balbis A. Dumas V. Chevalier S. Posner B.I. Epidermal growth factor-induced vacuolar H+-ATPase assembly: a role in signaling via mTORC1 activation.J. Biol.

Elevated glucose concentrations have also been shown to stimulate V-ATPase assembly and acidification of intracellular compartments in a PI3K-dependent manner (18Sautin Y.Y. Lu M. Gaugler A. Zhang L. Gluck S.L. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated effects of glucose on vacuolar H+-ATPase assembly, translocation, and acidification of intracellular compartments in renal epithelial cells.Mol.

This increase in V-ATPase assembly and activity at high glucose concentrations may provide cells with a mechanism to reduce the increased acid load during periods of enhanced glycolysis. Finally, during amino acid starvation, we have shown that the V-ATPase also undergoes increased assembly on lysosomal membranes (20Stransky L.A. Forgac M. Amino acid availability modulates vacuolar H+-ATPase assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 (26378229): 27360-2736910.1074/jbc.M115.659128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that this represents a primitive cellular response to starvation that increases lysosomal protein degradation as a way to restore cellular stores of amino acids. Interestingly, unlike the cases described above, amino acid-dependent assembly of the V-ATPase is independent of both PI3K and mTORC1 (20Stransky L.A. Forgac M. Amino acid availability modulates vacuolar H+-ATPase assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 (26378229): 27360-2736910.1074/jbc.M115.659128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recently, V-ATPases have been shown to play a critical role in regulating the activity of the cellular energy sensor 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (24Zhang C.-S. Jiang B. Li M. Zhu M. Peng Y. Zhang Y.-L. Wu Y.-Q. Li T.Y. Liang Y. Lu Z. Lian G. Liu Q. Guo H. Yin Z. Ye Z. et al.The lysosomal v-ATPase-ragulator complex is a common activator for AMPK and mTORC1, acting as a switch between catabolism and anabolism.Cell Metab. 2014; 20 (25002183): 526-54010.1016/j.cmet.2014.06.014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). AMPK is activated in response to glucose starvation. Because V-ATPase assembly in yeast changes in response to glucose starvation, we hypothesized that regulated assembly of the V-ATPase may play a role in AMPK activation during glucose starvation in mammalian cells. Here, we demonstrate that glucose starvation does indeed increase both V-ATPase assembly and activity in mammalian cells, and we examine the relationship between AMPK activation and assembly changes. Furthermore, we sought to identify the signaling pathways that are involved in glucose-mediated changes in V-ATPase assembly and activity in mammalian cells. To determine whether glucose starvation affects V-ATPase assembly, HEK293T cells conditioned to serum-free DMEM containing 5 mm glucose were either subjected to acute glucose starvation by replacement of the media with serum-free DMEM containing 0 mm glucose for 10 min or were maintained in fresh serum-free DMEM containing 5 mm glucose. Because exposure to elevated glucose has previously been reported to increase V-ATPase assembly after 1 h (17Marjuki H. Gornitzky A. Marathe B.M. Ilyushina N.A. Aldridge J.R. Desai G. Webby R.J. Webster R.G. Influenza A virus-induced early activation of ERK and PI3K mediates V-ATPase-dependent intracellular pH change required for fusion: ERK and PI3K regulate V-ATPase activity.Cell. Microbiol. 2011; 13 (21129142): 587-60110.1111/j.1462-5822.2010.01556.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), cells were also treated with serum-free DMEM containing 25 mm glucose for 1 h as a positive control. After treatment, cells were harvested, homogenized, and separated into their membrane and cytosolic fractions by sedimentation. Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed using an antibody directed against subunit A of the V1 domain. The amount of V1 present in the membrane fraction is a reflection of the level of V-ATPase assembly. As shown in Fig. 1A, glucose starvation led to an increase in V-ATPase assembly as reflected by the increase in subunit A staining in the membrane fraction following incubation of cells at 0 mm glucose relative to cells maintained at 5 mm glucose. Consistent with previous results, we also observed an increase in assembly upon incubation of cells at elevated glucose. It should be noted that a relatively large fraction of subunit A remains in the cytosol under all conditions. Although it is possible that this may be due to a relatively large pool of cytosolic V1 domains, it is also possible that some V1 dissociates from V0 during cell homogenization and fractionation. Thus, the absolute degree of in vivo V-ATPase assembly may be underestimated in our experiments. Quantitation of Western blots was performed by densitometric analysis using ImageJ software. To correct for any variations in protein loading, the intensity of staining of subunit A relative to a membrane marker (subunit d) was determined. Values were then expressed relative to those obtained at 5 mm glucose (defined as 1.0). As shown in Fig. 1B, glucose starvation increased assembly by 1.9 ± 0.5-fold (p < 0.02) whereas incubation at elevated glucose concentrations increased assembly by 1.4 ± 0.1-fold (p < 0.02). Glucose re-addition for 10 min returned V-ATPase assembly to baseline levels (0.9 ± 0.1), suggesting V-ATPase assembly changes rapidly and reversibly in response to glucose levels. To confirm that these results were not specific to HEK293T cells, the porcine epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 was treated as described above (using Medium 199 in place of DMEM). We found that glucose starvation increased assembly by 2.6 ± 1.0-fold (n = 2), whereas elevated glucose increased assembly 1.9 ± 0.2-fold (n = 2) in these cells (Fig. S1, A and B). Taken together, these results indicate that acute glucose starvation is a novel positive regulator of V-ATPase assembly in mammalian cells. To determine whether the increase in V-ATPase assembly observed upon glucose starvation results in a corresponding increase in V-ATPase activity, we used FITC-dextran, a pH-dependent probe, to quantify the rate of proton pumping into lysosomes. FITC-dextran was loaded into HEK293T cells through fluid-phase endocytosis and was chased to lysosomes by incubation in dye-free media. Cells were then incubated under the conditions described above followed by cell homogenization and sedimentation to obtain the membrane fraction. Although lysosomes were not isolated, this was not necessary for these experiments because the FITC fluorescence signal was localized exclusively to lysosomes present in the membrane fraction. Because the FITC signal is quenched at low pH, the rate of V-ATPase-dependent proton pumping into lysosomes was measured as the rate of ATP-dependent, concanamycin A-sensitive fluorescence quenching (concanamycin A is a specific V-ATPase inhibitor (25Dröse S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Inhibitory effect of modified bafilomycins and concanamycins on P- and V-type adenosinetriphosphatases.Biochemistry. 1993; 32 (8385991): 3902-390610.1021/bi00066a008Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar)). After normalizing the data to the initial fluorescence reading to control for the number of lysosomes added to the cuvette, the initial rate of fluorescence quenching was determined using linear regression analysis, and activity values are expressed relative to those observed for lysosomes obtained from cells incubated at 5 mm glucose (defined as 1.0). As shown in Fig. 2A, glucose starvation led to a 17 ± 2% increase in lysosomal V-ATPase-dependent proton transport (p < 0.01, n = 20), whereas elevated glucose increased activity by 13 ± 2% (p < 0.01, n = 20). The effect of glucose starvation was again reversed upon re-addition of 5 mm glucose to cells. To confirm that these results were not specific to HEK293T cells, LLC-PK1 cells were treated as described above. We found that glucose starvation increased lysosomal V-ATPase activity by 35% (n = 2; Fig. S1C). We conclude that both glucose starvation and elevated glucose cause an increase in lysosomal V-ATPase activity through increased assembly. Although the results described above clearly indicate an increase in V-ATPase-dependent proton transport into lysosomes isolated from glucose-starved cells, we wished to determine whether this resulted in a detectable change in lysosomal pH in intact cells. To accomplish this, we stained cells with LysoTracker Red DND-99, which is a cell-permeable red fluorescent dye linked to a weak base that accumulates in acidic compartments in vivo. As intracellular compartments become more acidic, accumulation of the dye generates a more intense fluorescence signal. HEK293T cells were treated as described above, and LysoTracker was added to cells 10 min before collection. As shown in Fig. 2B, incubation of cells at both 0 and 25 mm glucose increased the number and intensity of fluorescent puncta relative to that observed at 5 mm glucose. To confirm that the observed increase in intracellular acidification was V-ATPase-dependent, the above experiments were repeated following incubation of cells with concanamycin A (5 μm) for 1 h. As shown in Fig. 2B, concanamycin completely abolished LysoTracker staining of cells, indicating that the observed fluorescence signal is due to the activity of the V-ATPase. These results indicate that glucose starvation results in a measurable increase in acidification of intracellular compartments in HEK293T cells. To better characterize the observed changes in V-ATPase activity, the time course of this change was monitored following glucose starvation. As shown in Fig. 2C, lysosomal V-ATPase activity reaches a maximum within 10–15 min of glucose deprivation, with a small but not statistically significant reduction at later times. These results suggest that the observed changes are too rapid to involve new protein synthesis, consistent with glucose-dependent changes in assembly in yeast. Previous work in our lab has shown that, in yeast, activation of the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway, which plays a crucial role in metabolic control, prevents V-ATPase disassembly upon glucose starvation (13Bond S. Forgac M. The Ras/cAMP/protein kinase a pathway regulates glucose-dependent assembly of the vacuolar H+-ATPase in yeast.J. Biol.

In mammalian cells, both PI3K and ERK, major regulators of cell homeostasis and growth, have been implicated in V-ATPase assembly in response to a variety of stimuli (15Liberman R. Bond S.

Because of their known involvement in the V-ATPase assembly process, the activity of these signaling molecules was determined upon glucose starvation. Additionally, we tested the activity of AMPK, a key regulator of energy homeostasis, because this pathway is known to be activated upon glucose starvation. HEK293T cells were conditioned to serum-free DMEM containing 5 mm glucose and then subjected to either acute glucose starvation or continued incubation in fresh serum-free DMEM at 5 mm glucose. Following treatment, cell homogenates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to detect levels of P-Akt (as a measure of PI3K/Akt signaling), P-ERK (as a measure of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling), P-vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (P-VASP, as a measure of PKA signaling), or P-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (P-ACC, as a measure of AMPK signaling). We found that glucose starvation led to a dramatic increase in AMPK activity and a detectable increase in ERK activation as measured by P-ACC and P-ERK, respectively (Fig. 3). By contrast, PI3K and PKA signaling as measured by P-Akt and P-VASP, respectively, did not change under conditions of glucose starvation. We have also tested activity of the p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), both members of the MAPK family of signaling proteins involved in cell growth homeostasis, and mTORC1 (a major regulator of cell growth and metabolism that is downstream of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway), and we see no activation of these pathways upon glucose starvation (Fig. S2B). We see a similar pattern of AMPK and ERK activation upon acute glucose starvation in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. S2A). Collectively, these data demonstrate that AMPK and ERK are activated in response to glucose starvation and suggest that these kinases may be involved in the observed changes in V-ATPase assembly and activity. Because the V-ATPase was recently shown to be required for activation of AMPK (24Zhang C.-S. Jiang B. Li M. Zhu M. Peng Y. Zhang Y.-L. Wu Y.-Q. Li T.Y. Liang Y. Lu Z. Lian G. Liu Q. Guo H. Yin Z.

However, the homeostatic adjustments that balance changes in energy supply and demand to maintain organismal function under chronic low oxygen conditions remain incompletely understood, making it difficult to distinguish adaptive from maladaptive responses in hypoxia-related pathologies. We integrated metabolomic and proteomic profiling with mitochondrial respirometry and blood gas analyses to comprehensively define the physiological responses of skeletal muscle energy metabolism to 16 days of high-altitude hypoxia (5260 m) in healthy volunteers from the AltitudeOmics project. In contrast to the view that hypoxia down-regulates aerobic metabolism, results show that mitochondria play a central role in muscle hypoxia adaptation by supporting higher resting phosphorylation potential and enhancing the efficiency of long-chain acylcarnitine oxidation. This directs increases in muscle glucose toward pentose phosphate and one-carbon metabolism pathways that support cytosolic redox balance and help mitigate the effects of increased protein and purine nucleotide catabolism in hypoxia. Muscle accumulation of free amino acids favor these adjustments by coordinating cytosolic and mitochondrial pathways to rid the cell of excess nitrogen, but might ultimately limit muscle oxidative capacity in vivo. Collectively, these studies illustrate how an integration of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism is required for physiological hypoxia adaptation in skeletal muscle, and highlight protein catabolism and allosteric regulation as unexpected orchestrators of metabolic remodeling in this context.

Metabolic adaptations to hypoxia underlie phenotypic responses to a diverse range of physiologic and pathogenic stimuli.

We hypothesized that integrating these complimentary approaches would elucidate previously undiscovered physiological shifts in muscle substrate utilization that resolve some of the longstanding controversies in the field (7Horscroft J.A. Murray A.J. Skeletal muscle energy metabolism in environmental hypoxia: climbing towards consensus.Extrem. Physiol. Med. 2014; 3 (25473486): 1910.1186/2046-7648-3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our results reveal a cooperative rearrangement of cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism that argues against a classic shift from aerobic to anaerobic energy supply as the primary aim of physiological hypoxia adaptation in skeletal muscle. Rather, we identify protein and purine nucleotide catabolism as major orchestrators of metabolic remodeling through allosteric and substrate-level regulatory mechanisms, which redirect glucose utilization and favor more efficient fatty acid oxidation in combination with subtle stoichiometric shifts in metabolic enzyme expression. This integrative view of muscle metabolism at high altitude provides a new foundation for understanding physiological responses to hypoxia and catabolic stress. Study participants (7 male, 7 female; 21 α 2 years of age) were a subset of 21 individuals involved in the AltitudeOmics project (26Subudhi A.W. Bourdillon N. Bucher J. Davis C. Elliott J.E.

All were healthy Caucasians born and raised below 1500 m, and had not traveled to altitudes >1000 m for at least 3 months before the study. Selected physiological parameters were collected at their resident altitude near sea level (SL; Eugene, OR, 131 m), immediately upon reaching the laboratory at 5260 m ∼1 month later (A1; Mt. Chacaltaya, Bolivia), and following 16 days of habitual daily activity at the same altitude (A16) (Table 1). Participants were transported to the high-altitude camp by automobile to standardize the hypoxic exposure and avoid the energetic demands of trekking during acclimatization. Body weight loss occurred from A1 to A16 as expected (27Murray A.J. Montgomery H.E. How wasting is saving: weight loss at altitude might result from an evolutionary adaptation.BioEssays. 2014; 36: 721-72910.1002/bies.201400042Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but was limited by encouraging habitual intake of carbohydrate, fat, and protein dietary sources and light daily activity to minimize effects of negative energy balance, exertional stress, and inactivity. All participants exhibited reductions in resting blood oxygen transport (oxyhemoglobin saturation and arterial PO2) at A1 that partially recovered at A16, consistent with the classic hypoxia acclimatization response (28Bender P.R.

Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was typical of healthy, recreationally active individuals at SL, and was depressed at A1 and A16, reflecting well-established limitations of hypoxia on the maximal rate of tissue oxygen utilization. The resting respiratory exchange ratio (RER; VCO2/VO2) also declined and remained lower throughout hypoxia, indicating a persistent shift in resting metabolic substrate utilization.Table 1Physiological responses to high-altitude hypoxiaSLA1A16Body weight (kg)70 α 371 α 268 α 2ap < 0.05 versus sea level.SaO2 (%)98 α 274 α 1ap < 0.05 versus sea level.81 α 1ap < 0.05 versus sea level.,bp < 0.05 versus A1.PaO2 (mm Hg)102 α 235 α 1ap < 0.05 versus sea level.45 α 1ap < 0.05 versus sea level.,bp < 0.05 versus A1.VO2max (ml/kg/min)49 α 132 α 1ap < 0.05 versus sea level.36 α 2ap < 0.05 versus sea level.RER (VCO2/VO2)0.96 α 0.030.84 α 0.02ap < 0.05 versus sea level.0.82 α 0.02ap < 0.05 versus sea level.a p < 0.05 versus sea level.b p < 0.05 versus A1.

Muscle mitochondrial responses to physiological hypoxia are less clear (7Horscroft J.A. Murray A.J. Skeletal muscle energy metabolism in environmental hypoxia: climbing towards consensus.Extrem.

To comprehensively investigate muscle mitochondrial energetics, we performed high-resolution respirometry on permeabilized fiber bundles from vastus lateralis muscle biopsies freshly obtained under resting post-absorptive conditions at SL and A16. Two respirometry protocols including up to five metabolic substrates were employed to generate mass-corrected oxygen flux values representing 16 distinct respiratory states as described in Table S1 (complete data in Fig. S1). The maximal (noncoupled) mitochondrial electron transfer system (ETS) capacity of muscle fibers fueled by a combination of carbohydrate (pyruvate), amino acid (glutamate), and fatty acid (palmitoylcarnitine) oxidation was unchanged from SL to A16 (ETS capacity; Fig. 1A). However, the ETS capacity of human skeletal muscle exceeds the ADP-stimulated “coupled” oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-linked respiratory capacity (29Pesta D. Gnaiger E. High-resolution respirometry: OXPHOS protocols for human cells and permeabilized fibers from small biopsies of human muscle.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 810 (22057559): 25-5810.1007/978-1-61779-382-0_3Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), which tended to increase from SL at A16 under identical substrate conditions (Fig. 1B). This equated to a 38% increase in OXPHOS coupling control at A16 (Fig. 1C), indicating that a greater proportion of mitochondrial respiratory capacity is utilized during ATP synthesis when fueled by convergent substrate oxidation pathways. Collectively, these studies indicate that the mitochondrial respiratory capacity of skeletal muscle is preserved following 16 days of physiological hypoxia, and the existing OXPHOS machinery is more responsive to energy demand (ADP) when abundant mixed substrates are available. Improved mitochondrial coupling control of muscle fibers at A16 is consistent with the conclusions of previous studies of humans acclimatized to high altitude (23Jacobs R.A. Siebenmann C. Hug M. Toigo M. Meinild A.K. Lundby C. Twenty-eight days at 3454-m altitude diminishes respiratory capacity but enhances efficiency in human skeletal muscle mitochondria.FASEB J. 2012; 26: 5192-520010.1096/fj.12-218206Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Horscroft J.A.

However, results of in vitro experiments do not necessarily reflect metabolic substrate handling in vivo. Therefore, we performed nontargeted LC/MS metabolomic analyses of flash-frozen sections of the same muscle biopsies at SL and A16, which revealed significant changes in 119 of 250 identified metabolites (q < 0.05). These included increases in glycolytic intermediates, amino acids, and fatty acids (Fig. 1D), indicating a greater availability of metabolic substrates in hypoxic skeletal muscle under resting conditions in vivo. Although this generally reflects greater muscle metabolic flux in hypoxia, variations within major metabolite classes and pathways suggested shifts in substrate utilization that justified more detailed analysis. To further integrate the findings of respirometry and metabolomic analyses, we next evaluated the expression of 134 intermediary metabolism enzymes identified by tandem-mass tag LC/MS/MS proteomic profiling of the same muscle biopsies at SL and A16 (Fig. 1E). Observed changes were generally minor (<20%) with high variability of signals normalized to total ion (peptide) count. Thirty-eight proteins changed significantly from SL to A16 (q < 0.05), 31 of which decreased, representing primarily mitochondrial, but also glycolytic pathway enzymes (Table S2). The total ion count of all (120) mitochondrial proteins evaluated (per mg of muscle protein) was unchanged at A16 (97 α 3% of SL; p = NS). Interestingly, the seven proteins that significantly increased at A16 included key enzymes in glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, and catalytic subunits of mitochondrial respiratory Complex I (CI). Therefore, hypoxia appears to retain selected components of both cytosolic and mitochondrial muscle metabolism under resting physiological conditions, rather than inducing a global shift from aerobic to anaerobic energy pathways seen in hypoxia-related pathologies (30van den Borst B.

However, analysis of global (per sample peptide) trends in enzyme expression might not capture relative changes within and between metabolic pathways that mediate important changes in substrate handling, particularly in heterogeneous skeletal muscle samples.

Based on its structure, PF4 was assigned to the CXC family of chemokines and has been shown to have numerous effects on myeloid leukocytes. However, the receptor for PF4 remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that PF4 induces leukocyte responses through the integrin Mac-1 (αMβ2, CD11b/CD18). Human neutrophils, monocytes, U937 monocytic and HEK293 cells expressing Mac-1 strongly adhered to immobilized PF4 in a concentration-dependent manner. The cell adhesion was partially blocked by anti-Mac-1 mAb and inhibition was enhanced when anti-Mac-1 antibodies were combined with glycosaminoglycans, suggesting that cell-surface proteoglycans act cooperatively with Mac-1. PF4 also induced Mac-1-dependent migration of human neutrophils and murine WT, but not Mac-1-deficient macrophages. Coating of Escherichia coli bacteria or latex beads with PF4 enhanced their phagocytosis by macrophages by ∼4-fold, and this process was blocked by different Mac-1 antagonists. Furthermore, PF4 potentiated phagocytosis by WT, but not Mac-1-deficient macrophages. As determined by biolayer interferometry, PF4 directly bound the αMI-domain, the major ligand-binding region of Mac-1, and this interaction was governed by a Kd of 1.3 α 0.2 μm. Using the PF4-derived peptide library, synthetic peptides duplicating the αMI-domain recognition sequences and recombinant mutant PF4 fragments, the binding sites for αMI-domain were identified in the PF4 segments Cys12–Ser26 and Ala57–Ser70. These results identify PF4 as a ligand for the integrin Mac-1 and suggest that many immune-modulating effects previously ascribed to PF4 are mediated through its interaction with Mac-1."

Here, we investigated CHCHD10’s function as a regulator of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria and the nucleus. We show that CHCHD10 copurifies with cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and up-regulates COX activity by serving as a scaffolding protein required for MNRR1 phosphorylation, mediated by ARG (ABL proto-oncogene 2, nonreceptor tyrosine kiNAse (ABL2)). The CHCHD10 gene was maximally transcribed in cultured cells at 8% oxygen, unlike MNRR1, which was maximally expressed at 4%, suggesting a fine-tuned oxygen-sensing system that adapts to the varying oxygen concentrations in the human body under physiological conditions.

We found that the solute-induced ion current fluctuation is 10 times higher with penicilloic acid than with ampicillin. Furthermore, we also found that ampicillin can easily permeate through OmpF, at an ampicillin gradient of 10 μm and a conductance of Gamp ≅ 3.8 fS, with a flux rate of roughly 237 molecules/s of ampicillin at Vm = 10 mV. The structurally related benzylpenicillin yields a lower conductance of Gamp ≅ 2 fS, corresponding to a flux rate of ≈120 molecules/s. In contrast, the similar sized penicilloic acid was nearly unable to permeate through OmpF. MD calculations show that, besides their charge difference, the main differences between ampicillin and penicilloic acid are the shape of the molecules, and the strength and direction of the dipole vector.

https://openalex.org/W2793285726,"Lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) is an oncogenic kinase that is involved in different types of cancer (breast, lung, gastric, colorectal) and biological processes including proliferation, invasion, migration, chromatin remodeling as well as innate and acquired endocrine resistance. However, the role of LMTK3 in response to cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been investigated thus far. Using both 2D and 3D tissue culture models, we found that overexpression of LMTK3 decreased the sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to cytotoxic (doxorubicin) treatment. In a mouse model we showed that ectopic overexpression of LMTK3 decreases the efficacy of doxorubicin in reducing tumor growth. Interestingly, breast cancer cells overexpressing LMTK3 delayed the generation of double strand breaks (DSBs) after exposure to doxorubicin, as measured by the formation of γH2AX foci. This effect was at least partly mediated by decreased activity of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) as indicated by its reduced phosphorylation levels. In addition, our RNA-seq analyses showed that doxorubicin differentially regulated the expression of over 700 genes depending on LMTK3 protein expression levels. Furthermore, these genes were found to promote DNA repair, cell viability and tumorigenesis processes / pathways in LMTK3-overexpressing MCF7 cells. In human cancers, immunohistochemistry staining of LMTK3 in pre- and post-chemotherapy breast tumor pairs from four separate clinical cohorts revealed a significant increase of LMTK3 following both doxorubicin and docetaxel based chemotherapy. In aggregate, our findings show for the first time a contribution of LMTK3 in cytotoxic drug resistance in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2789705199,"Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the western world. Although optimal medical care and treatment is widely available, the prognosis of patients with HF is still poor. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important compartments of the innate immunity. Current studies have identified TLRs as critical mediators in cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of TLRs and interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) in different experimental HF models including viral myocarditis, myocardial ischemia, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, we investigated for the first time comprehensive TLR and IRF gene and protein expression under basal conditions in murine and human cardiac tissue. We found that Tlr4, Tlr9 and Irf7 displayed highest gene expression under basal conditions, indicating their significant role in first-line defense in the murine and human heart. Moreover, induction of TLRs and IRFs clearly differs between the various experimental HF models of diverse etiology and the concomitant inflammatory status. In the HF model of acute viral-induced myocarditis, TLR and IRF activation displayed the uppermost gene expression in comparison to the remaining experimental HF models, indicating the highest amount of myocardial inflammation in myocarditis. In detail, Irf7 displayed by far the highest gene expression during acute viral infection. Interestingly, post myocardial infarction TLR and IRF gene expression was almost exclusively increased in the infarct zone after myocardial ischemia (Tlr2, Tlr3, Tlr6, Tlr7, Tlr9, Irf3, Irf7). With one exception, Irf3 showed a decreased gene expression in the remote zone post infarction. Finally, we identified Irf7 as novel cardiovascular stress-inducible factor in the pathologically stressed heart. These findings on TLR and IRF function in the inflamed heart highlight the complexity of inflammatory immune response and raise more interesting questions for future investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2789569275,"The visceral (VIS) and subcutaneous (SQ) fat pads are developmentally distinct white adipose tissue depots and contribute differently to inflammation and insulin resistance associated with obesity. The basic helix–loop–helix transcriptional regulator, transcription factor 21 (TCF21), is a marker gene for white adipose tissues and is abundantly expressed in VIS-derived adipose stem cells (ASCs), but not in SQ-derived ASCs. However, TCF21’s role in regulating fat depot–specific gene expression and function is incompletely understood. Here, using siRNA-mediated Tcf21 knockdowns and lentiviral gene transfer of TCF21 in mouse ASCs, we demonstrate that TCF21 is required for the VIS ASC–specific expression of interleukin 6 (IL6), a key cytokine that contributes to the proinflammatory nature of VIS depots. Concurrently, TCF21 promotes MMP-dependent collagen degradation and type IV collagen deposition through the regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) modifiers, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, MMP13, and tissue inhibitor of MMP1 (TIMP1), as well as collagen type IV α1 chain (COL4A1) in VIS ASCs. We also found that although IL6 mediates the expression of Mmp13 and Timp1 in VIS ASCs, the TCF21-dependent expression of Mmp2 and Col4a1 is IL6-independent. These results suggest that TCF21 contributes to the proinflammatory environment in VIS fat depots and to active ECM remodeling of these depots by regulating IL6 expression and MMP-dependent ECM remodeling in a spatiotemporally coordinated manner.

Elevated VIS ASC expression of MMP8 and MMP13 was associated with the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL6 and CXCL1 (9Tokunaga M. Inoue M. Jiang Y. Barnes 2nd, R.H. Buchner D.A. Chun T.H. Fat depot-specific gene signature and ECM remodeling of Sca1(high) adipose-derived stem cells.Matrix Biol. 2014; 36 (24726953): 28-3810.1016/j.matbio.2014.03.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, the transcriptional regulation underlying VIS ASC–specific expression of inflammatory cytokines and MMP/TIMP family members has not been well established. To define the transcriptional network of VIS ASCs responsible for the co-expression of IL6 and a subset of MMPs and TIMPs, we focused on transcription factor 21 (TCF21), a basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factor abundantly expressed in VIS ASCs but barely in SQ ASCs. A human TCF21 gene variant is associated with larger pericardial fat mass (14Fox C.S. White C.C. Lohman K. Heard-Costa N. Cohen P. Zhang Y. Johnson A.D. Emilsson V. Liu C.-T. Chen Y.D. Taylor K.D.

Baek S.T. Huang G. Eskiocak B. Goetsch S. Sung C.Y. Banfi S. Sauer M.F. Olsen G.S. Duffield J.S. Olson E.N.

Gene targeting of Tcf21 results in perinatal lethality of mice, demonstrating its indispensable role in organ development (16Lu J. Chang P. Richardson J.A. Gan L. Weiler H. Olson E.N. The basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor capsulin controls spleen organogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Even though TCF21 has been recognized as a WAT-specific marker gene (18de Jong J.M. Larsson O. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. A stringent validation of mouse adipose tissue identity markers.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 308 (25898951): E1085-E110510.1152/ajpendo.00023.2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), its potential role in regulating VIS WAT-specific inflammatory gene expression and ECM remodeling has not been fully explored. Here, we identify a novel role for TCF21 in driving the expression of IL6, as well as a subset of MMP/TIMP family members (MMP2, MMP13, and TIMP1) and type IV collagen in IL6-dependent and -independent manners. TCF21-dependent regulation of IL6 expression and ECM remodeling may contribute to the unique characteristics of visceral WAT. Our previous work showed the depot-specific transcriptomes of mouse WAT Sca1high ASCs using whole-genome RNA-seq (9Tokunaga M. Inoue M. Jiang Y. Barnes 2nd, R.H. Buchner D.A. Chun T.H. Fat depot-specific gene signature and ECM remodeling of Sca1(high) adipose-derived stem cells.Matrix Biol. 2014; 36 (24726953): 28-3810.1016/j.matbio.2014.03.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The gene encoding basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor Tcf21 was among the most differentially expressed; its transcript is present at high level in VIS ASCs but nearly undetectable in SQ ASCs (Fig. 1A). TCF21 is an established regulator of epicardial fibroblast EMT and development of kidney, lung, and spleen (16Lu J. Chang P. Richardson J.A. Gan L. Weiler H. Olson E.N. The basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor capsulin controls spleen organogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The basic-helix–loop–helix protein pod1 is critically important for kidney and lung organogenesis.Development. 1999; 126 (10572052): 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, its function in WAT is presently undefined. The mRNA levels of Il6 and Timp1 were also preferentially expressed in VIS ASCs, whereas those of Mmp2 and Mmp14 were similar between ASCs of both depots (Fig. 1A). Notably, Mmp13 transcript level in VIS ASCs was more than double the level observed in SQ ASCs (Fig. 1A). Real-time qPCR confirmed our RNA-seq findings, showing VIS ASC expression of TCF21 180-fold, and expression of IL6 50-fold that seen in SQ ASCs (Fig. 1B). The mRNA analysis of human preadipocytes derived from VIS and SQ WAT revealed a similar pattern (Fig. 1C). In agreement with gene expression, immunocytochemistry of cultured ASCs revealed nuclear TCF21 staining in VIS ASCs but not in SQ ASCs (Fig. 1D). IL6 staining was similarly restricted to VIS ASCs and showed substantial co-expression with TCF21 among VIS WAT-derived stromal cells (Fig. 1E). Indeed, IL6 was detected in 89% of TCF21-positive, but only in 34% of TCF21-negative VIS WAT-derived vascular stromal cells (Fig. 1E, right panel). Within mouse VIS (perigonadal) adipose depot, TCF21 protein was seen exclusively in cells positive for platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, a cell-surface marker of fibroblast-adipocyte progenitors (Fig. 1F) (19Berry R. Rodeheffer M.S. Characterization of the adipocyte cellular lineage in vivo.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15 (23434825): 302-30810.1038/ncb2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 20Sun C. Berry W.L. Olson L.E.

On the contrary, TCF21 was undetectable in SQ (inguinal) depots isolated from the same animals (Fig. 1F). TCF21 and IL6 were expressed in the same cells specifically in VIS fat depot (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these data show that in WAT, TCF21 is restricted to ASCs of VIS depot and mostly co-expressed with IL6 in these cells. Genes encoding specific ECM remodeling factors, MMP13 and TIMP1, were also preferentially expressed in VIS ASCs relative to SQ ASCs. We hypothesized that TCF21 could transcriptionally regulate genes expressed in VIS ASCs, including IL6. To test this, we examined the effect of siRNA-mediated TCF21 knockdown on IL6 transcription and protein expression in isolated mouse VIS ASCs. Two independent siRNA oligonucleotides (designed within Tcf21 coding regions) suppressed mRNA levels by 40 and 75%, respectively (Fig. 2A). Correspondingly, Il6 transcript levels declined to 36 and 46% of baseline (Fig. 2B). We next evaluated the impact of Tcf21 knockdown on levels of IL6 protein in the culture medium. Western blotting revealed progressive accumulation of IL6 protein over a 3-day culture period in control siRNA-treated group, and the time-dependent accumulation of IL6 was comparable with that of type I collagen (Fig. 2C). IL6 protein content was decreased in the media of VIS ASCs treated with Tcf21 siRNAs at each time point, whereas no significant effect was observed for type I collagen (Fig. 2C). IL6 protein was nearly undetectable in the medium of cultured SQ ASCs (Fig. 2C). Together, these data demonstrate that Tcf21 is necessary for IL6 expression specifically in mouse VIS ASCs, and the minimal expression of Tcf21 accounts for the very low IL6 expression in SQ ASCs. Conversely, when we overexpressed human TCF21 in mouse VIS ASCs using lentiviral gene transfer, we observed that Il6 expression increased in parallel with TCF21 expression (Fig. 2D). We identified multiple E-box consensus sequences (CANNTG) in the IL6 promoter region (Fig. 2E). We sought to determine whether TCF21 could regulate IL6 promoter activity. We examined the effect of TCF21 overexpression (Fig. S1) on a reconstituted IL6 promoter activity, using its 5′-UTR (approximately −1.5 kb), in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which express no endogenous TCF21 (data not shown). IL6 promoter activity in CHO cells was increased 10-fold by co-expressed TCF21 (Fig. 2F). Deletion of a putative bHLH domain (amino acids 78–132) from TCF21 (21Ledent V. Vervoort M. The basic helix–loop–helix protein family: comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis.Genome Res. 2001; 11 (11337472): 754-77010.1101/gr.177001Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) significantly attenuated TCF21-dependent IL6 promoter activity (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that TCF21 acts as a transcriptional regulator of IL6 promoter. RNA-seq identified unique expression profiles of ECM remodeling factors (MMPs and TIMPs) in mouse VIS and SQ ASCs (9Tokunaga M. Inoue M. Jiang Y. Barnes 2nd, R.H. Buchner D.A. Chun T.H. Fat depot-specific gene signature and ECM remodeling of Sca1(high) adipose-derived stem cells.Matrix Biol. 2014; 36 (24726953): 28-3810.1016/j.matbio.2014.03.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Among collagenolytic MMPs, Mmp13 was highly expressed in VIS ASCs, whereas transcripts encoding gelatinolytic MMP2 and MMP9 were more abundant in SQ ASCs. Tcf21 knockdown by siRNA in VIS ASCs markedly suppressed MMP13 mRNA (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, expression of the gene encoding MMP14 (MT1-MMP), a major pericellular collagenase equally expressed in VIS and SQ ASCs (Fig. 1A), was unaffected by Tcf21 siRNA (Fig. 3A). Expression of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (Timp1), abundant in VIS ASCs but not in SQ ACSs, was suppressed by Tcf21 knockdown (Fig. 3A). By contrast, Tcf21 siRNA treatment did not change the expression of Timp2 or Timp3, which showed no predominance in VIS ASC over SQ ASC in RNA-seq data (Fig. 3A). VIS ASC–specific expression of Mmp8 was not impacted by Tcf21 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Unexpectedly, Tcf21 was found to be required also for the expression of Mmp2 in VIS ASCs and to a lesser extent in SQ ASCs (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2). Consistent with the effect on Mmp2 expression, Tcf21 siRNA reduced MMP2 protein level as detected by gelatin zymography (Fig. 3B). In cultured VIS ASCs, Tcf21 knockdown specifically reduced the expression of Col4a1 but had no impact on Col1a1 or Col3a1 (Fig. 4A). This suggests a specific role for TCF21 in regulation of basement membrane structure. Type IV collagen deposition by VIS ASCs detected by immunohistochemistry was not much changed with Tcf21 knockdown (Fig. 4B). Nonetheless, whereas type IV collagen fibers appeared robust and well organized in control siRNA-treated samples, they appear diffuse and finer in Tcf21 siRNA-treated samples (Fig. 4B, high magnification). The Tcf21 knockdown also reduced the amount of degraded type I collagen products (Fig. 4C), suggesting that TCF21 mediates both degradation of type I collagen fibers and the deposition of a basement membrane component, type IV collagen. TCF21-dependent degradation of type I collagen was MMP-dependent, as shown by the suppression of the collagen degradation by a MMP inhibitor, GM6001 (Fig. 4D). We next assessed the impact of TCF21 overexpression on ASC collagen deposition. Lentiviral gene transfer of TCF21 resulted in enhanced TCF21 signals in VISC ASCs and novel presence of TCF21 in SQ ASCs (Fig. S3). Elevated TCF21 levels markedly enhanced the deposition of type IV and I collagens in VIS ASCs (Fig. 4E). SQ ASCs, which demonstrate a low staining of type IV collagen at baseline, also showed considerably increased deposition of type IV collagen with TCF21 overexpression (Fig. 4E). The effect of TCF21 was collagen type-selective, and no discernable effect was observed on the level of type VI collagen (Fig. 4E). TCF21-dependent accumulation of type IV collagen was pronounced more in VIS ASCs than in SQ ASCs (Fig. 4E). Not only the deposition of collagens, but also TCF21 overexpression augmented the degradation of type I collagen by VIS ASCs (Fig. 4F). Together, these findings suggest that TCF21 actively engages in type I collagen turnover and type IV collagen deposition by VIS ASCs through the regulation of MMP activities. Given positive regulation of IL6 by TCF21, we sought to determine whether TCF21-dependent ECM remodeling requires IL6 effector function. To test this, we incubated VIS and SQ ASCs with IL6-neutralizing antibody with and without recombinant IL6. We found that mRNA levels of Mmp13 and Timp1 were reduced in the presence of anti-IL6 antibody and that the effect was rescued by the presence of excess recombinant IL6 (Fig. 5A). On the contrary, expression of Col4a1 and Mmp2 were unaffected by either IL6-neutralizing antibody or IL6 protein (Fig. 5A). To determine whether TCF21 regulates type IV collagen deposition and type I collagen degradation through IL6 and its potential effectors, i.e. MMP13 and TIMP1, VIS ASCs transfected with siTcf21 or control siRNA were cultured in the presence and absence of IL6-neutralizing antibody. Despite the inhibitory effects on the expression of MMP13 and TIMP1, the presence of IL6-neutralizing antibody did not change either type IV collagen deposition or type I collagen degradation (Fig. 5B), suggesting that TCF21 promotes collagenolytic ECM remodeling in a IL6-independent manner. In this report, we have demonstrated for the first time that TCF21, a bHLH transcription factor, drives the expression of IL6 concurrently of MMP2 and type IV collagen in VIS ASCs. TCF21 has been known to regulate the EMT of epicardial fibroblast progenitors (15Acharya A. Baek S.T. Huang G. Eskiocak B. Goetsch S. Sung C.Y. Banfi S. Sauer M.F. Olsen G.S. Duffield J.S. Olson E.N.

Visceral WAT expansion involves not only hypertrophy of adipocytes but ASC proliferation and adipogenesis, particularly in male mice (22Wang Q.A. Tao C. Gupta R.K. Scherer P.E.

Our previous work suggests that a cohort of transcription factors along with cytokines and ECM remodeling genes are differentially expressed between VIS and SQ ASCs (9Tokunaga M. Inoue M. Jiang Y.

Fat depot-specific gene signature and ECM remodeling of Sca1(high) adipose-derived stem cells.Matrix Biol. 2014; 36 (24726953): 28-3810.1016/j.matbio.2014.03.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).

Nonetheless, it is unclear whether the pro-adipogenic microenvironment of VIS WAT is conferred by paracrine cytokines, ECM molecules, or physical interaction between stromal cells and other cell types. Our data suggest that TCF21, which is specifically expressed in VIS ASCs, is responsible for the expression of IL6 along with ECM remodeling genes in VIS ASCs. It is likely that the heightened expression of IL6 coupled with type IV collagen deposition and type I collagen degradation contributes to a unique VIS WAT microenvironment permissive for inflammatory adipose tissue expansion in vivo (22Wang Q.A. Tao C. Gupta R.K. Scherer P.E. Tracking adipogenesis during white adipose tissue development, expansion and regeneration.Nat.

IL6 is expressed most abundantly in adipose tissues, followed by the heart, kidney, and spleen (24Starr M.E. Evers B.M. Saito H. Age-associated increase in cytokine production during systemic inflammation: adipose tissue as a major source of IL-6.J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med.

TCF21 plays an indispensable role for the development of these organs (15Acharya A. Baek S.T. Huang G. Eskiocak B. Goetsch S. Sung C.Y. Banfi S. Sauer M.F. Olsen G.S. Duffield J.S. Olson E.N.

Our study shows the role of TCF21 in regulating IL6 expression and ECM remodeling in white adipose tissues; however, it is conceivable that TCF21 may play a similar role in regulating IL6 expression and ECM remodeling in the vital organs, such as the heart and kidney. The potential role for TCF21 in defining pro-inflammatory environment and ECM remodeling may need to be further investigated in these organs. The role of IL6 in obesity has been somewhat controversial. Although visceral WAT-derived IL6 is correlated with the presence of insulin resistance (4Fontana L. Eagon J.C. Trujillo M.E. Scherer P.E.

Previous studies have implicated plasma surface treatment in the enhancement of hydrophilicity of implanted musculoskeletal reconstructive materials. Hydroxyapatite (HA) ceramics, widely used in bone tissue regeneration, have made great advancements to skeletal surgery. In the present study, we investigate the impact of low-pressure plasma on the interconnected porous calcium hydroxyapatite (IP-CHA) both in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma, when used with oxygen, can augment the hydrophilicity of non-porous HA surfaces and the osteoconductivity of the IP-CHA disc via increased water penetration of inner porous structures, as demonstrated through microfocus computed tomography (μCT) assay. In vivo implantation of plasma-treated IP-CHA displayed superior bone ingrowth than untreated IP-CHA. Though plasma-treated IP-CHA did not alter osteoblast cell proliferation, it accelerated osteogenic differentiation of seeded marrow mesenchymal stem cells. In vitro X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that this plasma treatment increases levels of oxygen, rather than nitrogen, on the plasma-treated IP-CHA surface. These findings suggest that plasma treatment, an easy and simple processing, can significantly improve the osteoconductive potential of commonly used artificial bones such as IP-CHA. Further optimization of plasma treatment and longer-term follow-up of in vivo application are required toward its clinical application."

Here, we describe the 2.35-Å-resolution structure of the catalytic core of Siw14, a 5-PP-InsP phosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a member of the protein tyrosine-phosphatase (PTP) superfamily. Conclusions that we derive from structural data are supported by extensive site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analyses, thereby attributing new functional significance to several key residues. We demonstrate the high activity and exquisite specificity of Siw14 for the 5-diphosphate group of PP-InsPs. The three structural elements that demarcate a 9.2-Å-deep substrate-binding pocket each have spatial equivalents in PTPs, but we identify how these are specialized for Siw14 to bind and hydrolyze the intensely negatively charged PP-InsPs. (a) The catalytic P-loop with the CX5R(S/T) PTP motif contains additional, positively charged residues. (b) A loop between the α5 and α6 helices, corresponding to the Q-loop in PTPs, contains a lysine and an arginine that extend into the catalytic pocket due to displacement of the α5 helix orientation through intramolecular crowding caused by three bulky, hydrophobic residues. (c) The general-acid loop in PTPs is replaced in Siw14 with a flexible loop that does not use an aspartate or glutamate as a general acid. We propose that an acidic residue is not required for phosphoanhydride hydrolysis."

It actively acquires the essential nutrient iron from human hemoglobin (Hb) using the iron-regulated surface-determinant (Isd) system. This process is initiated when the closely related bacterial IsdB and IsdH receptors bind to Hb and extract its hemin through a conserved tri-domain unit that contains two NEAr iron Transporter (NEAT) domains that are connected by a helical linker domain. Previously, we demonstrated that the tri-domain unit within IsdH (IsdHN2N3) triggers hemin release by distorting Hb's F-helix. Here, we report that IsdHN2N3 promotes hemin release from both the α- and β-subunits. Using a receptor mutant that only binds to the α-subunit of Hb and a stopped-flow transfer assay, we determined the energetics and micro-rate constants of hemin extraction from tetrameric Hb. We found that at 37 °C, the receptor accelerates hemin release from Hb up to 13,400-fold, with an activation enthalpy of 19.5 α 1.1 kcal/mol. We propose that hemin removal requires the rate-limiting hydrolytic cleavage of the axial HisF8 Nɛ–Fe3+ bond, which, based on molecular dynamics simulations, may be facilitated by receptor-induced bond hydration. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments revealed that two distinct IsdHN2N3·Hb protein·protein interfaces promote hemin release. A high-affinity receptor·Hb(A-helix) interface contributed ∼95% of the total binding standard free energy, enabling much weaker receptor interactions with Hb's F-helix that distort its hemin pocket and cause unfavorable changes in the binding enthalpy.

The receptors share similar primary sequences and contain NEAr iron Transporter (NEAT) domains, binding modules originally named because they were found in bacterial genes that are proximal to putative Fe3+ siderophore transporter genes (32Andrade M.A. Ciccarelli F.D.

Our previously published studies of IsdH have shown that it extracts hemin using a tridomain unit formed by its second (N2) and third (N3) NEAT domains, which are connected by a helical linker domain (IsdHN2N3, residues Ala-326–Asp-660) (Fig. 1a). Studies using native MetHb have shown that IsdHN2N3 rapidly extracts hemin from Hb, ∼500-fold faster than the rate at which hemin spontaneously dissociates from Hb. Recent NMR and crystallography studies of the Hb-free and -bound forms of IsdH have provided insight into how it promotes hemin release from Hb (29Sjodt M. Macdonald R. Spirig T. Chan A.H.

Crystal structures of the Hb·IsdHN2N3 complex reveal that the receptor adopts an extended dumbbell-shaped structure in which the N2 domain engages the A- and E-helices of Hb, whereas the N3 domain is positioned within 12 Å of the hemin molecule that is located on the same globin chain (Fig. 1b). Hemin release may in part be triggered by the helical linker domain, which distorts the F-helix in Hb that houses the iron-coordinating proximal histidine residue (HF8) (Fig. 1c). NMR studies of the apo-receptor uncovered the presence of inter-domain motions between the N2 and linker domains, revealing that the receptor adaptively recognizes Hb. IsdB shares significant primary sequence homology with IsdH and actively acquires hemin from Hb, suggesting that it also employs a semi-flexible tridomain unit to extract Hb's hemin (16Zhu H. Li D.

Although the structural basis of IsdH binding to Hb is now understood, we lack a quantitative understanding of the mechanism of hemin transfer. This is due to the heterogeneous nature of the transfer reaction, which has thus far limited its detailed biophysical characterization. For example, at the concentrations used to monitor hemin release, Hb adopts distinct tetrameric and dimeric quaternary states that have different propensities to release hemin (34Benesch R.E. Kwong S. Coupled reactions in hemoglobin. Heme-globin and dimer-dimer association.J. Biol.

Moreover, IsdH binds to both the α- and β-globin chains within Hb, which also release hemin at different rates (36Bunn H.F. Jandl J.H.

Finally, hemin extraction causes Hb to dissociate into its component globin chains, which irreversibly aggregate and release hemin faster than intact Hb (38Leutzinger Y. Beychok S. Kinetics and mechanism of heme-induced refolding of human α-globin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, previously measured rates of hemin transfer using WT Hb and IsdH report on an amalgamation of distinct extraction processes, hindering a quantitative understanding of the energetics that underlie hemin extraction. To overcome these limitations, we used a stabilized tetrameric form of Hb and a bacterial receptor mutant that only binds to Hb's α-subunit. By using stopped-flow experiments, we show that the tridomain unit accelerates hemin release from the α-subunit by more than 10,000-fold, a rate that is significantly faster than previously reported values that were measured using heterogeneous components. Transfer requires a Gibbs activation energy of 18.1 α 1.1 kcal/mol to be surmounted, whose high enthalpic component suggests that in the transition state the proximal histidine–hemin bond (Nɛ–Fe) bond is hydrolytically cleaved. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest that the receptor's ability to lower the activation energy by ∼6 kcal/mol is due to its ability to induce strain in the bond and to increase the concentration of nearby water molecules that compete with Hb's HisF8 Nɛ atom for the iron atom within hemin. Quantitative measurements of Hb-receptor–binding interactions using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) indicate that two energetically distinct receptor·Hb interfaces form the pretransfer complex. An interface between the receptor's N2 domain and the A-helix of Hb is the primary contributor to overall binding affinity, tethering IsdH to Hb to enable lower affinity interactions that distort Hb's hemin pocket. A model of the hemin extraction process is presented that incorporates the existing structural kinetics and thermodynamic binding data. We developed an assay to quantitatively measure the kinetics of IsdH-mediated hemin removal from the α-globin chain within tetrameric Hb. In the assay, a mutant of IsdHN2N3 that only binds to the α-subunit of Hb is used (α-IsdH, residues Ala-326–Asp-660, with 365FYHYA369 → 365YYHYF369 mutations). α-IsdH contains F365Y and A369F mutations within the α-helix of the Hb-binding N2 domain, which selectively weakens its affinity for the β-subunit in Hb (31Dickson C.F. Jacques D.A. Clubb R.T. Guss J.M. Gell D.A. The structure of haemoglobin bound to the haemoglobin receptor IsdH from Staphylococcus aureus shows disruption of the native α-globin haem pocket.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The assay also employs Hb0.1, a tetramer-stabilized recombinant form of Hb in which the two α-subunits are present within a single polypeptide (the C terminus of one α-subunit is joined via a glycine residue to the N terminus of the second α-subunit (40Looker D. Abbott-Brown D. Cozart P. Durfee S. Hoffman S. Mathews A.J. Miller-Roehrich J. Shoemaker S. Trimble S.

Hb0.1 also contains a V1M mutation that facilitates expression in Escherichia coli but is otherwise structurally and functionally identical to WT Hb. Because Hb0.1 has a significantly reduced propensity to dissociate into αβ Hb dimers, hemin transfer experiments employing it and α-IsdH enable hemin extraction from the α-globin chain within tetrameric Hb to be selectively monitored (35Hargrove M.S. Whitaker T. Olson J.S. Vali R.J. Mathews A.J. Quaternary structure regulates hemin dissociation from human hemoglobin.J. Biol.

As summarized in Table 1, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) sedimentation equilibrium experiments confirm that α-IsdH binds tetrameric Hb0.1 with the appropriate 2:1 stoichiometry via interactions with its α-subunits. In the AUC experiments, to prevent complications caused by hemin transfer, Hb0.1 was maintained in its carbonmonoxy-ligated state, and hemin-binding deficient IsdH proteins were used that contain a Y642A mutation that removes the iron-coordinating tyrosine residue (41Watanabe M. Tanaka Y. Suenaga A. Kuroda M. Yao M. Watanabe N. Arisaka F. Ohta T. Tanaka I. Tsumoto K.

In all AUC experiments, the concentration of Hb0.1 was monitored by measuring its absorbance at 412 nm, the Soret band of the bound heme molecule. As expected, isolated Hb0.1 forms a stable tetramer at concentrations that are used in hemin transfer experiments; at 5 μm (heme units), Hb0.1 has a weighted average molecular mass of 64,212 α 829 Da at 13,000 × g. We next used AUC to determine the Hb0.1·α-IsdHY642A binding stoichiometry when α-IsdHY642A is present at a 15-fold molar excess. These data indicate that ∼1.8 α-IsdHY642A proteins bind to each Hb0.1 tetramer, compatible with it only binding to the α-subunits. Increasing the ratio of α-IsdHY642A to Hb0.1 in the AUC experiments to 30:1 does not increase this stoichiometry, indicating that Hb0.1 is saturated (Fig. 2a, red curve). In contrast, IsdHY642A, which is identical to α-IsdHY642A except that it does not contain mutations in the Hb-contacting α-helix, binds to Hb0.1 with a stoichiometry of ∼3.2 (Fig. 2a, blue curve). This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that IsdHY642A binds to both the α- and β-subunits of Hb (31Dickson"

Here we investigated the non-receptor tyrosine adhesion kinase FES-related (FER), following its identification as a potential mediator of sensitivity to IGF-1R kinase inhibition in a functional siRNA screen. We found that FER and the IGF-1R co-locate in cells and can be co-immunoprecipitated. Ectopic FER expression strongly enhanced IGF-1R expression and phosphorylation on tyrosines 950 and 1131. FER phosphorylated these sites in an IGF-1R kinase-independent manner and also enhanced IGF-1-mediated phosphorylation of SHC, and activation of either AKT or MAPK-signaling pathways in different cells. The IGF-1R, β1 Integrin, FER, and its substrate cortactin were all observed to co-locate in cell adhesion complexes, the disruption of which reduced IGF-1R expression and activity. High FER expression correlates with phosphorylation of SHC in breast cancer cell lines and with a poor prognosis in patient cohorts. FER and SHC phosphorylation and IGF-1R expression could be suppressed with a known anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor (AP26113) that shows high specificity for FER kinase. Overall, we conclude that FER enhances IGF-1R expression, phosphorylation, and signaling to promote cooperative growth and adhesion signaling that may facilitate cancer progression."

FGF/FGFR signaling requires recruiting a scaffold protein called the fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) to initiate downstream signaling. The FRS2 family is composed of two members, FRS2α and FRS2β. Both proteins contain the phosphotyrosine-binding domain and multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites (9Turner N. Grose R.

U.S.A. 2001; 98 (11447289): 8578-858310.1073/pnas.161259898Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The aberrant expression of FRS2α is also observed in some cancers (13Zhang K. Chu K. Wu X. Gao H. Wang J. Yuan Y.C. Loera S. Ho K. Wang Y. Chow W. Un F. Chu P. Yen Y. Amplification of FRS2 and activation of FGFR/FRS2 signaling pathway in high-grade liposarcoma.Cancer Res. 2013; 73 (23393200): 1298-130710.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, targeting FRS2α is considered an important therapeutic approach in the inhibition of FGF/FGFR-mediated tumorigenesis (14Sato T. Gotoh N. The FRS2 family of docking/scaffolding adaptor proteins as therapeutic targets of cancer treatment.Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2009; 13 (19456272): 689-70010.1517/14728220902942330Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Myristoylation of FRS2α is essential for its anchoring to the plasmatic membrane. FRS2α contains the MGXX(S/T) consensus sequence at the N terminus for N-myristoylation modification (10Gotoh N. Regulation of growth factor signaling by FRS2 family docking/scaffold adaptor proteins.Cancer Sci. 2008; 99 (18452557): 1319-132510.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00840.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). N-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) catalyzes the myristoylation modification process by transferring the myristoyl group from myristoyl-CoA to the glycine at the N terminus of a protein (15Thinon E. Serwa R.A. Broncel M. Brannigan J.A. Brassat U. Wright M.H. Heal W.P. Wilkinson A.J. Mann D.J. Tate E.W. Global profiling of co- and post-translationally N-myristoylated proteomes in human cells.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (25255805): 491910.1038/ncomms5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated a therapeutic approach to inhibit FGF/FGFR-mediated oncogenic signaling and proliferation of cancer cells by blocking myristoylation of FRS2α. We demonstrate that genetic knockout of FRS2α expression inhibited FGF/FGFR-mediated signaling. Signaling was rescued by the re-expression of the WT FRS2α, but not FRS2α(G2A), a mutation that prevents FRS2α myristoylation and FGF10-induced tumorigenesis. Additionally, a previously synthesized myristoyl-CoA analog inhibitor (16Bielawska A. Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Mayroo N. Liu X. Bai A. Elojeimy S. Rembiesa B. Pierce J. Norris J.S. Hannun Y.A. Novel analogs of D-e-MAPP and B13. Part 2: signature effects on bioactive sphingolipids.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2008; 16 (17881234): 1032-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), B13, inhibited FRS2α myristoylation, resulting in reduced FGF/FGFR-mediated oncogenic signaling and suppression of cell proliferation and migration of cancer cells by causing cell cycle arrest. The compound suppressed oncogenic signaling mediated by FGFR drug-resistant mutants and inhibited growth of xenograft tumors without observed pathological toxicity to host organs in vivo. Our study provides a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of FGF/FGFR-mediated tumor progression. Upon FGF induction, FRS2α is phosphorylated by FGFRs and further activates associated downstream signaling, such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK (9Turner N. Grose R. Fibroblast growth factor signalling: from development to cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10 (20094046): 116-12910.1038/nrc2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). To confirm the essential role of FRS2α in FGF/FGFR signaling, FRS2α was knocked out using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in mouse fibroblast cells NIH-3T3 (Fig. 1A). Two single colonies, FRS2αΔ-1 and FRS2αΔ-2, were identified and confirmed by PCR analysis (Fig. 1B) and Western blotting (Fig. 1C). Loss of FRS2α indeed impaired FGF2-induced AKT phosphorylation and MAPK signaling in both selected null mutants without alteration of PLCγ1 phosphorylation, which is not directly regulated by FRS2α activity (Fig. 1D). It should be noted that levels of p-ERK were much less inhibited than those of p-AKT due to the loss of FRS2α. It has been reported that the activated PLCγ induced by FGF/FGFR signaling could enhance MAPK signaling through the protein kinase C-Raf-MAPK pathway (17Huang J. Mohammadi M. Rodrigues G.A. Schlessinger J. Reduced activation of RAF-1 and MAP kinase by a fibroblast growth factor receptor mutant deficient in stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (7534287): 5065-507210.1074/jbc.270.10.5065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As a result, although MAPK signaling is inhibited by knockout of FRS2α, activation of PLCγ could maintain MAPK signaling under the induction of FGF2. The N terminus of FRS2α has been reported to be myristoylated (18Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. A lipid-anchored Grb2-binding protein that links FGF-receptor activation to the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway.Cell. 1997; 89 (9182757): 693-70210.1016/S0092-8674(00)80252-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). To examine whether myristoylation of FRS2α is crucial for FGF-induced signaling and its membrane localization, FRS2αΔ knockout cells were transduced with FRS2α(WT) or FRS2α(G2A) mutant by lentiviral infection (Fig. 1E). FRS2α(WT), but not FRS2α(G2A), a mutant unable to be myristoylated, rescued FGF2-induced AKT phosphorylation and MAPK signaling (Fig. 1F). Of note, levels of p-AKT and p-ERK were not able to be restored in the cells expressing FRS2α(WT) (without FGF2 induction) (Fig. 1F, lane 5 versus lane 1). Higher expression levels of FRS2α tended to have a more inhibitory effect on p-ERK levels (Fig. S1). This is probably because the ectopic expression of FRS2α leads to negative feedback mediated by MAPK signaling, as reported previously (19Lax I. Wong A. Lamothe B. Lee A. Frost A. Hawes J. Schlessinger J. The docking protein FRS2α controls a MAP kinase-mediated negative feedback mechanism for signaling by FGF receptors.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10 (12419216): 709-71910.1016/S1097-2765(02)00689-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). FRS2α contains numerous tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation sites (10Gotoh N. Regulation of growth factor signaling by FRS2 family docking/scaffold adaptor proteins.Cancer Sci. 2008; 99 (18452557): 1319-132510.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00840.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We examined whether loss of myristoylation leads to changes in phosphorylation status. Indeed, the levels of FRS2α tyrosine phosphorylation were significantly inhibited in cells expressing FRS2α(G2A) compared with FRS2α(WT) (Fig. 1G). In contrast, levels of FRS2α threonine phosphorylation were largely maintained in cells expressing FRS2α(G2A) (Fig. 1G). Of note, FRS2α(G2A) runs at a lower molecular weight in the gel compared with FRS2α(WT) which is probably due to loss of tyrosine phosphorylation sites. In addition, loss of myristoylation resulted in reduced protein-protein interactions between FRS2α and GRB2 or SHP2 (Fig. 1H). This result suggests that overexpression of FRS2α(G2A) is incapable of restoring FGF2-induced signaling in FRS2αΔ knockout cells (Fig. 1F) due to an interference with signal transduction. We further reasoned that loss of FRS2α myristoylation should inhibit FGF/FGFR-induced tumorigenesis. Prostate primary cells isolated from BL6 mice prostate tissue were transduced with vector control, FRS2α(WT), or FRS2α(G2A) by lentiviral infection (Fig. S2A). The cells were mixed with FGF10-UGSM or GFP-UGSM cells, and the mixture was implanted subrenally in SCID mice (Fig. 2A) (20Cai H. Smith D.A. Memarzadeh S. Lowell C.A. Cooper J.A. Witte O.N. Differential transformation capacity of Src family kinases during the initiation of prostate cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Grafts derived from control vector, FRS2α(WT), or FRS2α(G2A) with GFP-UGSM cells (control group) showed normal prostate tubules with no difference in tissue regeneration (Fig. S2B). As expected, grafts derived from the FGF10-UGSM group (PrEC-control vector or PrEC-FRS2α(WT)) showed adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2B) (20Cai H. Smith D.A. Memarzadeh S. Lowell C.A. Cooper J.A. Witte O.N. Differential transformation capacity of Src family kinases during the initiation of prostate cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Tumorigenic cells showed expression of androgen receptor and proliferation of CK8+ luminal cells without substantial changes in CK5+ basal cells. However, grafts derived from PrEC-FRS2α(G2A) with FGF10-UGSM showed normal tubules. The RFP signal indicated successful transduction of the exogenous genes. Overexpression of FRS2α was confirmed in the regenerated tissues derived from PrEC-FRS2α(WT) or FRS2α(G2A) + GFP-UGSM (Fig. S2B) or FGF10-UGSM (Fig. 2B). Immunohistochemistry analysis of the grafts derived from FRS2α(G2A) + FGF10-UGSM showed CK8+ luminal and CK5+ basal cells as the control groups (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2B). The results indicate that overexpression of FRS2α(G2A) inhibits FGF10-induced tumorigenesis. Protein myristoylation is catalyzed by N-myristoyltransferases (NMT1 and NMT2) (22French K.J. Zhuang Y. Schrecengost R.S. Copper J.E. Xia Z. Smith C.D. Cyclohexyl-octahydro-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-based inhibitors of human N-myristoyltransferase-1.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 309 (14724220): 340-34710.1124/jpet.103.061572Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Based on the NMT1 crystal structure (15Thinon E. Serwa R.A. Broncel M. Brannigan J.A. Brassat U. Wright M.H. Heal W.P. Wilkinson A.J. Mann D.J. Tate E.W. Global profiling of co- and post-translationally N-myristoylated proteomes in human cells.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (25255805): 491910.1038/ncomms5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), a myristoyl-CoA analog, B13, was identified from a panel of previously synthesized small-molecule compounds (23Szulc Z.M. Mayroo N. Bai A. Bielawski J. Liu X. Norris J.S. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Novel analogs of D-e-MAPP and B13. Part 1: synthesis and evaluation as potential anticancer agents.Bioorg Med. Chem. 2008; 16 (17869115): 1015-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An N-terminal truncated mutant of NMT1 was purified to examine the inhibitory effect of B13 (15Thinon E. Serwa R.A. Broncel M. Brannigan J.A. Brassat U. Wright M.H. Heal W.P. Wilkinson A.J. Mann D.J. Tate E.W. Global profiling of co- and post-translationally N-myristoylated proteomes in human cells.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (25255805): 491910.1038/ncomms5919Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Compound B13 showed an inhibition of NMT1 enzymatic activity with IC50 of 79.1 μm (Fig. 3B). Of note, it has been reported that the NMT1 mutant lacking the N terminus shows an approximately 3-fold increase in enzymatic activity compared with the full-length enzyme (25Kumar S. Sharma R.K. N-terminal region of the catalytic domain of human N-myristoyltransferase 1 acts as an inhibitory module.PLoS One. 2015; 10 (26000639): e012766110.1371/journal.pone.0127661PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the obtained IC50 might lead to an underestimation of the inhibitory efficacy of B13 on protein myristoylation in the cell-based assay (Fig. 3C). B13 showed dose-dependent inhibition of FRS2α myristoylation detected by click chemistry (Fig. 3C). For the click chemistry reaction, cells were incubated with myristic acid–azide (as a probe of labeling myristoyl-proteins) as the source of myristate for the myristoylation reaction. Cell lysates underwent a click reaction in which the azide functional group on myristoylated proteins was coupled to an alkyne tagged with biotin, allowing detection with streptavidin (Fig. 3C, lane 2 versus lane 1) (26Kim S. Yang X. Li Q. Wu M. Costyn L. Beharry Z. Bartlett M.G. Cai H. Myristoylation of Src kinase mediates Src-induced and high-fat diet-accelerated prostate tumor progression in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28939770): 18422-1843310.1074/jbc.M117.798827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Myristoylation is essential for the localization of FRS2α. FRS2α was mainly detected in the membrane fraction in FRS2α(WT) cells, but mainly in the cytosol fraction in FRS2α(G2A) cells (Fig. 3D). FRS2α was predominantly expressed in the cell membrane fraction (Fig. 3E), probably because it has multiple acylation sites in the N terminus (2GSCCSCP8). FRS2α contains multiple potential S-palmitoylation sites (cysteines 4, 5, and 7) in addition to a myristoylation site (27Resh M.D. Fatty acylation of proteins: The long and the short of it.Prog. Lipid Res. 2016; 63 (27233110): 120-13110.1016/j.plipres.2016.05.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). FRS2α levels increased about 2-fold in the cytosol fraction of the cells treated with B13 compared with the control (Fig. 3E). Given the total amount of FRS2α in the cell membrane, loss of myristoylation only mildly affects membrane protein levels. However, consistent with the genetic results, B13 suppressed endogenous levels of p-FRS2α at the membrane and inhibited the phosphorylation of FRS2α under FGF2 induction (Fig. 3E). These data suggest that B13 regulates FRS2α activity and thus FGF/FGFR signaling. Similar to the genetic loss of FRS2α in NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 1, D and F), B13-mediated inhibition of FRS2α myristoylation reduced the levels of p-FRS2α, p-AKT, and p-ERK in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A) and to a lesser extent p-PLCγ1 (Figs. 1D and 3G). Additionally, the inhibition required more than 12 h of treatment at a concentration of 15 μm (Fig. 4B). Dysregulation of FGF/FGFR signaling, including mutations resulting in FGFR activation and/or FGFR gene amplification, has been demonstrated to drive proliferation and survival of cancer cells. B13 reduced the levels of p-FRS2α and p-AKT with or without induction by FGF2 in NIH-3T3 cells ectopically expressing FGFR2 but did not affect the level of p-FGFR (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that B13 inhibits FGF-induced signaling by targeting FRS2α and bypasses the activation of FGFRs. Dysregulated FGFR signaling due to overexpression or activation of FGFR1/2 has been reported in a variety of cancer types. Bioinformatics analysis on expression levels of FGFR1/2 in 947 cancer cell lines indicated that FGFR1 expression levels were elevated in numerous cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-134-VI breast cancer cells, and FGFR2 expression levels were elevated in SNU16 and KATO III stomach cancer cells (Fig. S3, A and B). PC-3, 22Rv1, and other prostate cancer cells expressed unaltered levels of FGFR1/2 compared with other cancer cell lines (28Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N. Venkatesan K. Margolin A.A. Kim S. Wilson C.J. Lehár J. Kryukov G.V. Sonkin D. Reddy A. Liu M. Murray L. Berger M.F. Monahan J.E. et al.The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity.Nature. 2012; 483 (22460905): 603-60710.1038/nature11003Crossref PubMed Scopus (4854) Google Scholar) (Fig. S3, A and B). The expression levels of FGFR1/2 were confirmed in a panel of selected cancer cells, including MDA-MB-134-VI, SNU16, KATO III, AGS, HCT116, and prostate cancer cells LNCaP, 22Rv1, PC-3, DU145, and normal prostate cells PNT2 (Fig. S3C). FRS2α expression was also detected in MDA-MB-134-VI, SNU16, KATO III, AGS, and HCT116 cells, which are also recommended by ATCC for anti-FGFR drug discovery analysis (Fig. S3C). We further examined the inhibitory effect of B13 on endogenous FGFR-mediated signaling in some of these cancer cell lines. The levels of p-FRS2α, p-AKT, and/or p-ERK were elevated by FGF2 induction in MDA-MB-134-VI and SNU16 cells, but not KATO III, probably due to high expression of FGFR2 (Fig. S3C). B13 significantly inhibited the levels of pFRS2α, p-AKT, and/or p-ERK under basal levels or exogenously added FGF2 in the examined cancer cells (Fig. 4, D–F), suggesting that the compound inhibits FGFR-mediated oncogenic signaling in a variety of cancer cells. Because B13 inhibits the FRS2α scaffolding function, we further examined whether B13 collaborated with FGFR inhibitors, such as PD173074 or dovitinib (a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor), which target FGFR1/2 activity. Because cancer cells were under FGF2 induction, the inhibitory effect was specifically due to FGFR-induced signaling. Whereas PD173074 or dovitinib alone reduced the levels of p-FRS2α, p-AKT, and p-ERK in cells with endogenous (Fig. S4, A and B) or ectopic expression of WT FGFR2 (Fig. 5, A and B), the combination of B13 with PD173074 (Fig. S4A and Fig. 5A) or dovitinib (Fig. S4B and Fig. 5B) further suppressed phosphorylation. The data suggest collaboration between B13 and FGFR inhibitors in the suppression of FGF/FGFR signaling. Because B13 targets myristoylation of FRS2α and inhibits WT FGFR signaling, we hypothesized that B13 may also inhibit FGFR2DRM-mediated oncogenic signaling. The mutants FGFR2(N549K) and FGFR2(V564I) have been reported to cause drug resistance in human endometrial cancers (29Gatius S. Velasco A. Azueta A. Santacana M. Pallares J. Valls J. Dolcet X. Prat J. Matias-Guiu X. FGFR2 alterations in endometrial carcinoma.Mod. Pathol. 2011; 24 (21725289): 1500-151010.1038/modpathol.2011.110Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Byron S.A. Chen H. Wortmann A. Loch D. Gartside M.G. Dehkhoda F. Blais S.P. Neubert T.A. Mohammadi M. Pollock P.M.

The inhibition of p-AKT and/or p-ERK was compromised in the cells harboring these FGFR2DRM compared with those expressing control vector or FGFR2(WT) under FGF2 induction and treatment with PD173074 or dovitinib (Fig. S4, C and D). Ectopic expression of FGFR2(V564I) or FGFR2(N549K) led to FGF2 independent activation of p-FRS2α, p-AKT, or p-ERK (under no FGF2-induced condition) (Fig. S4E). Additionally, FGFR2(V564I) conferred dovitinib resistance in cell migration assays (Fig. S5). In contrast, B13 reduced the levels of p-AKT and p-ERK in the cells with ectopically expressed FGFR2(N549K) (Fig. 5, C and D) or FGFR2(V564I) mutants (Fig. 5, E and F) compared with PD173074 or dovitinib. These data indicate that B13, albeit at high concentrations, blocks FGFR2DRM-mediated oncogenic signaling. FGF/FGFR oncogenic signaling promotes cancer cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis (6Katoh M. Nakagama H. FGF receptors: cancer biology and therapeutics.Med. Res. Rev. 2014; 34 (23696246): 280-30010.1002/med.21288Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether proliferation of cancer cells via FGF/FGFR-mediated signaling depends on the expression of FRS2α. Indeed, shRNA-FRS2α inhibited the proliferation of AGS and KATO III cancer cells (Fig. S6, A and B), both of which possess elevated FGF/FGFR oncogenic signaling. Next, we examined whether cell proliferation depended on the myristoylation of FRS2α by treating cells with B13. B13 significantly inhibited the proliferation of SNU16, KATO III, and AGS cells (Fig. 6, A–C); however, B13 or genetic knockdown of FRS2α had limited inhibition on HepG2 (liver cancer cells) or 293T cells (Fig. S7, A–D). SNU16 and AGS cancer cell lines were particularly sensitive to B13 treatment with IC50 values of 4.0 and 8.5 μm, respectively. Additionally, B13 also inhibited cell migration of MDA-MB-134-VI (Fig. 6D). We further analyzed the role of B13 on the cell cycle and found that B13 significantly arrested the cell cycle of SNU16 cells at the G2/M phase, KATO III cells at the S phase, and AGS cells at the G1 phase (Fig. 6, E–G). The inhibition of the cell cycle was further confirmed by up-regulation of p21 and/or p27 expression or down-regulation of CDK2, CDK4, and/or CDK6 (Fig. 6H). The cells arresting at different phases of the cell cycle by B13 and the alteration of different master regulator proteins might represent the diversity of cancer cell characteristics. Nevertheless, the myristoyl-CoA analog inhibitor suppressed proliferation of cancer cells by cell cycle arrest. To evaluate the effect of B13 on the growth of xenograft tumors, we first examined which cancer cells might be more dependent on FRS2α expression for tumor growth in vivo. SNU16 (higher expression levels of FGFR2) and PC-3 cells (lower expression level of FGFR2) were chosen (Fig. S3C). These two cell lines expressing shRNA-control or shRNA-FRS2α were subcutaneously injected into SCID mice. The size and weight of SNU16 and PC-3 xenograft tumors expressing shRNA-FRS2α were significantly reduced compared with the control group (Fig. S8, A and B). IHC staining showed that expression levels of Ki-67 and CD34 in the FRS2α knockdown tumors were reduced compared with the control group (Fig. S8, C and D). These data"
https://openalex.org/W2790853527,"Cardiac energy is produced primarily by oxidation of fatty acids and glucose, with the relative contributions of each nutrient being sensitive to changes in substrate availability and energetic demand. A major contributor to cardiac metabolic flexibility is pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which converts glucose-derived pyruvate to acetyl-CoA within the mitochondria. PDH is inhibited by phosphorylation dependent on the competing activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1-4) and phosphatases (PDP1-2). A single high-fat meal increases cardiac PDK4 content and subsequently inhibits PDH activity, reducing pyruvate utilization when abundant fatty acids are available. In this study, we demonstrate that diet-induced increases in PDK4 are reversible and characterize a novel pathway that regulates PDK4 degradation in response to the cardiac metabolic environment. We found that PDK4 degradation is promoted by CoA (CoASH), the levels of which declined in mice fed a high-fat diet and normalized following transition to a control diet. We conclude that CoASH functions as a metabolic sensor linking the rate of PDK4 degradation to fatty acid availability in the heart. However, prolonged high-fat feeding followed by return to a low-fat diet resulted in persistent in vitro sensitivity of PDH to fatty acid-induced inhibition despite reductions in PDK4 content. Moreover, increases in the levels of proteins responsible for β-oxidation and rates of palmitate oxidation by isolated cardiac mitochondria following long-term consumption of high dietary fat persisted after transition to the control diet. We propose that these changes prime PDH for inhibition upon reintroduction of fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2793053315,"Swarm-founding wasps are endemic and common representatives of neotropical fauna and compose an interesting social tribe of vespids, presenting both complex social characteristics and uncommon traits for a eusocial group, such as the absence of castes with distinct morphology. The paper wasp Protonectarina sylveirae (Saussure) presents a broad distribution from Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, occurring widespread in the Atlantic rainforest and arboreal Caatinga, being absent in the Amazon region. Given the peculiar distribution among swarm-founding wasps, an integrative approach to reconstruct the evolutionary history of P. sylveirae in a spatial-temporal framework was performed to investigate: the presence of genetic structure and its relationship with the geography, the evolution of distinct morphologic lineages and the possible historical event(s) in Neotropical region, which could explain the observed phylogeographic pattern. Individuals of P. sylveirae were obtained from populations of 16 areas throughout its distribution for DNA extraction and amplification of mitochondrial genes 12S, 16S and COI. Analysis of genetic diversity, construction of haplotype net, analysis of population structure and dating analysis of divergence time were performed. A morphometric analysis was also performed using 8 measures of the body of the adult (workers) to test if there are morphological distinction among populations. Thirty-five haplotypes were identified, most of them exclusively of a group and a high population structure was found. The possibility of genetic divergence because of isolation by distance was rejected. Morphological analysis pointed to a great uniformity in phenotypes, with only a small degree of differentiation between populations of south and the remaining. Divergence time analysis showed a Middle/Late Miocene origin, a period where an extensive marine ingression occurred in South America. Divergence of haplogroups began from the Plio/Pleistocene boundary and the last glacial maximum most likely modeled the current distribution of species, even though it was not the cause of genetic breaks."
https://openalex.org/W2789912708,"Cardiac energy demands during early embryonic periods are sufficiently met through glycolysis, but as development proceeds, the oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria becomes increasingly vital. Adrenergic hormones are known to stimulate metabolism in adult mammals and are essential for embryonic development, but relatively little is known about their effects on metabolism in the embryonic heart. Here, we show that embryos lacking adrenergic stimulation have ∼10-fold less cardiac ATP compared with littermate controls. Despite this deficit in steady-state ATP, neither the rates of ATP formation nor degradation was affected in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts, suggesting that ATP synthesis and hydrolysis mechanisms were fully operational. We thus hypothesized that adrenergic hormones stimulate metabolism of glucose to provide chemical substrates for oxidation in mitochondria. To test this hypothesis, we employed a metabolomics-based approach using LC/MS. Our results showed glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate concentrations were not significantly altered, but several downstream metabolites in both glycolytic and pentose–phosphate pathways were significantly lower compared with controls. Furthermore, we identified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as key enzymes in those respective metabolic pathways whose activity was significantly (p < 0.05) and substantially (80 and 40%, respectively) lower in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts. Addition of pyruvate and to a lesser extent ribose led to significant recovery of steady-state ATP concentrations. These results demonstrate that without adrenergic stimulation, glucose metabolism in the embryonic heart is severely impaired in multiple pathways, ultimately leading to insufficient metabolic substrate availability for successful transition to aerobic respiration needed for survival. Cardiac energy demands during early embryonic periods are sufficiently met through glycolysis, but as development proceeds, the oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria becomes increasingly vital. Adrenergic hormones are known to stimulate metabolism in adult mammals and are essential for embryonic development, but relatively little is known about their effects on metabolism in the embryonic heart. Here, we show that embryos lacking adrenergic stimulation have ∼10-fold less cardiac ATP compared with littermate controls. Despite this deficit in steady-state ATP, neither the rates of ATP formation nor degradation was affected in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts, suggesting that ATP synthesis and hydrolysis mechanisms were fully operational. We thus hypothesized that adrenergic hormones stimulate metabolism of glucose to provide chemical substrates for oxidation in mitochondria. To test this hypothesis, we employed a metabolomics-based approach using LC/MS. Our results showed glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate concentrations were not significantly altered, but several downstream metabolites in both glycolytic and pentose–phosphate pathways were significantly lower compared with controls. Furthermore, we identified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as key enzymes in those respective metabolic pathways whose activity was significantly (p < 0.05) and substantially (80 and 40%, respectively) lower in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts.

These results demonstrate that without adrenergic stimulation, glucose metabolism in the embryonic heart is severely impaired in multiple pathways, ultimately leading to insufficient metabolic substrate availability for successful transition to aerobic respiration needed for survival. The developing heart experiences a number of physiological and structural changes while transitioning through developmental stages. Metabolic shifts occur during embryonic heart development as cardiac energy demands increase to promote oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP in mitochondria. Early embryonic heart development is characterized by a glycolytic metabolism with carbohydrates as the primary energy source (1Houghton F.D. Thompson J.G. Kennedy C.J. Leese H.J.

Adrenergic hormone-deficient (Dbh−/−) embryos appear to develop and function normally through approximately embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5), but they begin to show cardiac distress between E10.5 and E12 (8Thomas S.A.

These adrenergic hormone-deficient (Dbh−/−) embryos undergo steady deterioration that ultimately ends in death within 24 h of initial symptoms. To gain insight into transcriptional changes between Dbh+/+ and Dbh−/−, a genome-wide expression screen showed that the largest set of differentially expressed genes are involved in metabolism (11Osuala K.

Oxygen consumption rates (OCR), an indicator of mitochondrial respiration, are established in E10.5 hearts; however, Dbh−/− hearts lag behind by ∼24 h later compared with age-matched littermate controls. These results established that NE and EPI influence embryonic heart energy metabolism; however, the mechanism(s) and metabolic targets regulated by adrenergic hormones remain unknown. Aerobic metabolism in mitochondria becomes increasingly important as the heart transitions from embryonic to fetal stages. Several studies using genetic mutations to disrupt aerobic respiration and/or mitochondrial structure/function have resulted in embryonic lethality due to heart failure (5Baker C.N. Ebert S.N.

Similarly, lack of adrenergic hormones leads to delayed transition to aerobic metabolism in mitochondria and is associated with embryonic lethality due to apparent heart failure. We thus hypothesized that adrenergic hormones facilitate the embryonic shift in metabolism from anaerobic glycolysis toward aerobic oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. This study focuses primarily on carbohydrate metabolism because lipid metabolism is not fully established until late fetal and neonatal stages (17Warshaw J.B. Terry M.L.

We tested our hypothesis using metabolomics analysis and measurements of key enzymatic reaction rates to evaluate metabolic changes in response to adrenergic deficiency in embryonic mouse hearts. In addition, we were able to show that metabolic blockade could be overcome, in part, by addition of downstream metabolites, leading to significant recovery of steady-state ATP in adrenergic hormone-deficient embryonic hearts. To determine whether cardiac energy levels were impaired in adrenergic hormone-deficient embryonic hearts, we first isolated E11.5 mouse hearts to measure steady-state ATP concentrations. Our results show a dramatic and significant 10-fold decrease (p < 0.01) in steady-state ATP concentrations in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts compared with adrenergic hormone-competent littermate controls (Fig. 1A). To determine whether adrenergic deficiency slows ATP production or increases ATP utilization/degradation as a potential cause of energy depletion, we measured rates of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis in adrenergic hormone-competent and -deficient embryonic hearts (Fig. 1, B–E). Embryonic heart lysates were incubated with pyruvate and malate prior to measurements to provide substrates for ATP synthesis. We observed no significant difference in ATP synthesis rates in adrenergic hormone-competent and -deficient hearts, suggesting that ATP synthesis rates were not impaired when the hearts were provided with necessary substrates and conditions. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in ATP hydrolysis rates in adrenergic hormone-competent and -deficient hearts, suggesting that the observed depletion of steady-state ATP concentrations may not necessarily be the result of increased rates of ATP hydrolysis. These data suggest ATP synthesis and hydrolysis rates were not impaired in adrenergic hormone-deficient embryonic hearts when supplied with sufficient substrates. To test whether metabolic substrates were limited in adrenergic hormone-deficient embryonic hearts, we utilized LC/MS to generate metabolomic profiles. The results are shown in the Fig. 2 heat map depicting relative concentrations of 47 key metabolites involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism. Other metabolites in these pathways, such as acetyl-CoA, were also evaluated but are not included here because we did not obtain reliable measurements for them due to limiting concentrations in both adrenergic hormone-competent control and adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts at this embryonic stage of development (E11.5). Initial analysis of the heat map data clearly reveals that many but not all of the measured metabolites were substantially decreased in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts relative to littermate controls (Fig. 2). Remarkably, adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts show significant decreases in several metabolites from pentose–phosphate pathway (PPP), glycolysis, and the TCA cycle, suggesting that glucose metabolism was severely compromised (Fig. 2). Despite this, adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts had comparable glucose 6-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate concentrations compared with adrenergic hormone-competent controls, indicating that there was sufficient starting substrate (glucose). Nevertheless, there were ∼10-fold decreases in downstream glycolytic metabolites such as 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (p < 0.05) and phosphoenolpyruvate, indicating the “pay-off” phase of glycolysis was likely impaired. In contrast, lactate concentrations did not differ between adrenergic hormone-deficient and -competent hearts suggesting that some glycolytic activity remains or that lactate levels may be stabilized from embryonic/maternal circulation. Another pathway that was clearly abrogated in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts was the PPP as evidenced by the 5-fold decreases in critically important intermediate metabolites, including ribose 5-phosphate (p < 0.05) and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) as well as 2-fold decreases in sedoheptulose 7-phosphate. Consistent with these results, we also found major decreases in cardiac concentrations of many nucleotides, which rely in large part on the PPP for crucial substrates for their biosynthesis. Furthermore, adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts had significantly lower concentrations of several tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycles and related intermediates, including citrate/isocitrate, aconitate, malate, glutamate, and aspartate, that likely contributed to impaired mitochondrial metabolism (Fig. 2). In addition, adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts had 2-fold lower pantothenate concentrations (not significant) compared with adrenergic hormone-competent controls suggesting that CoA biosynthesis, an essential precursor for acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA, may also be compromised (20Robishaw J.D. Neely J.R. Pantothenate kinase and control of CoA synthesis in heart.Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246 (6326596): H532-H541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that entry and phosphorylation of glucose are functional; however, further utilization to produce downstream metabolic intermediates for glycolysis/glucose oxidation and PPP may be compromised in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts. In addition, several metabolites involved in oxidation/reduction were significantly decreased in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts (Fig. 2). Notably, adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts had a significant 10-fold decrease in GSH (p < 0.05), 1.5-fold decrease in GSH disulfide (p < 0.05), and 2-fold decrease in taurine (p < 0.05) suggesting that these hearts may be experiencing some oxidative stress due to limited antioxidants (21Hill M.F. Singal P.K. Right and left myocardial antioxidant responses during heart failure subsequent to myocardial infarction.Circulation. 1997; 96 (9337218): 2414-242010.1161/01.CIR.96.7.2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 22Jong C.J.

In addition, NAD+ and NADH concentrations were significantly decreased (5-fold, p < 0.05 and 500-fold, p < 0.05, respectively) in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts. NADP+ and NADPH concentrations were also significantly decreased (10-fold, p < 0.05 and greater than 30-fold, respectively) in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts. These data thus suggest that there is increased oxidative and decreased reducing capacity in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts, indicating that metabolic pathways with redox enzymes, such as dehydrogenases, may have limited activities due to limitations in essential NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH cofactors (24Ying W. NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH in cellular functions and cell death: regulation and biological consequences.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10 (18020963): 179-20610.1089/ars.2007.1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Based on these metabolomic data, the redox state of the embryonic heart appeared to be substantially less reduced in the absence of adrenergic stimulation. To quantify this, we calculated the ratios of NAD+/NADH, NADP+/NADPH, and GSSG/GSH from the LC/MS data. Remarkably, all three ratios were clearly elevated in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts compared with competent controls (Fig. 3). It may be important to also note that in each of these examples, the oxidized forms (i.e. NAD+, NADP+, and GSSG) were also decreased in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts compared with controls (Fig. 2), and as seen from the ratiometric displays in Fig. 3, the reduced forms were decreased even further, resulting in a shift to a more oxidized state that is less favorable for energy production. These results indicate that an adrenergic hormone-deficient state leads to an overall shift toward increased oxidized and corresponding decreased reduced forms of critical enzymatic co-factors necessary for metabolic oxidation–reduction reactions. Consistent with these findings, we found that the ratios of ATP/ADP, ADP/AMP, and ATP/AMP were all decreased in adrenergic hormone-deficient E11.5 hearts relative to competent controls (Fig. 4, A–C, respectively). Furthermore, the overall “Energy Charge” or “EC” (EC = ([ATP] + 0.5[ADP])/([ATP] + [ADP] + [AMP])) (25Atkinson D.E. The energy charge of the adenylate pool as a regulatory parameter.

In contrast, the EC of adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts was significantly lower (0.66 α 0.091, p < 0.05; Fig. 4D). It is important to note that the redox and energy ratios in Figure 3, Figure 4 are not based on absolute values, but instead they are relative comparisons calculated from the metabolite pools measured by LC/MS. These results nevertheless indicate that adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts had significantly diminished energy status by E11.5 compared with adrenergic hormone-competent controls. Significant decreases in ATP/AMP and EC in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts suggested potential involvement of AMPK (27Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G.

We measured protein expression of the catalytic subunit, α-AMPK, and its phosphorylated form, pAMPK (Thr-172) in adrenergic hormone-deficient embryonic trunks containing the heart to assess AMPK activity. Adrenergic hormone-deficient embryos had significantly decreased α-AMPK protein concentrations compared with adrenergic hormone-competent controls. Interestingly, pAMPK protein concentrations were not significantly affected in adrenergic hormone-deficient embryos (Fig. 5, A and B). pAMPK normalized to total α-AMPK also indicated that adrenergic hormone-deficient embryos have slightly more activated AMPK compared with adrenergic hormone-competent embryos (Fig. 5C, not significant). These data suggest that AMPK activation is intact in adrenergic hormone-deficient embryos; however, this signaling is not sufficient for survival, possibly due to lower overall α-AMPK protein. Using the metabolomics data, we examined relative amounts of reactants (substrates) and products for known metabolic reactions to identify other potential targets of adrenergic stimulation. Adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts had comparable glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate concentrations but decreased 1,3-diphosphoglycerate concentrations compared with adrenergic hormone-competent controls suggesting impairment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Fig. 6A, see yellow highlights). To determine whether the lack of adrenergic stimulation affected GAPDH activity, we measured GAPDH rate kinetics. Our results showed that adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts had significantly decreased GAPDH activity (80% reduction, p < 0.05) compared with adrenergic hormone-competent controls (Fig. 6B). GAPDH protein concentrations were similar in adrenergic hormone-deficient and -competent embryos, suggesting adrenergic control of GAPDH likely occurs through post-translational mechanisms (Fig. 6, C and D). These results identify glycolysis and GAPDH as a metabolic pathway and checkpoint, respectively, impaired by adrenergic deficiency. Adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts also had significantly lower concentrations of ribose -phosphate and PRPP but comparable levels of glucose 6-phosphate in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts suggesting that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), a key rate-limiting enzymatic reaction in the PPP, may also be impaired (Fig. 7A, see yellow highlights). G-6-PDH activity was significantly lower (40% reduction, p < 0.05) in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts (Fig. 7B);however, G-6-PDH protein concentrations did not differ compared with adrenergic hormone-competent controls (Fig. 7, C and D). Consequently, this result suggests G-6-PDH protein concentrations are not limiting, but rather that G-6-PDH activity may be lower due to lack of post-translational regulation in the absence of adrenergic hormone stimulation. Many nucleotides, including GTP, UTP, CTP, and dATP, were also significantly decreased in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts suggesting that impaired G-6-PDH activity may also impact nucleotide biosynthesis. Thus, G-6-PDH was another major metabolic checkpoint affected by adrenergic deficiency. Significant decreases in GAPDH and G-6-PDH activity but similar protein concentrations in adrenergic hormone-deficient embryos compared with adrenergic hormone-competent controls suggested that adrenergic hormones regulate GAPDH and G-6-PDH activity via post-translational mechanisms. To identify post-translational changes in adrenergic hormone-deficient embryos, we immunoprecipitated phosphoserine and acetyl-lysine proteins, respectively, and phosphorylated/acetylated GAPDH and G-6-PDH were detected using Western blotting (Fig. 8). When comparing the total amounts of GAPDH, phospho-GAPDH, and acetylated GAPDH for adrenergic hormone-deficient and -competent controls, no significant differences were observed (Fig. 8A). The same was true for G-6-PDH when similar analysis was performed (Fig. 8B). In contrast, the ratio of pGAPDH relative to total GAPDH protein was found to be significantly decreased in adrenergic hormone-deficient embryos compared with adrenergic hormone-competent controls, although there was no change in the ratio of acetylated GAPDH to total GAPDH protein in these groups (Fig. 8C). There was a similar lack of significant change in the ratio of acetylated G-6-PDH to total G-6-PDH, although a slight tendency toward increased acetylated G-6-PDH was apparent in the adrenergic hormone-deficient group (Fig. 8D). Moreover, there was a significant increase in the ratio of phosphorylated G-6-PDH to total G-6-PDH protein in the adrenergic hormone-deficient group relative to adrenergic hormone-competent controls (p < 0.01; Fig. 8D). These results show that lack of adrenergic stimulation alters the phosphorylation status of GAPDH and G-6-PDH during embryonic development, thereby providing a potential mechanistic explanation for how adrenergic hormones may regulate the activity of these enzymes during embryonic development. TCA cycle intermediates, citrate/isocitrate, aconitate, and malate, were significantly decreased in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts implicating impaired mitochondrial metabolism (Fig. 9A). We measured pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity to determine whether entry into the TCA cycle was impaired in adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts. PDH activity did not differ in adrenergic hormone-deficient and -competent hearts (Fig. 9B). Adrenergic hormone-deficient hearts appeared to have slightly increased PDH activity (not significant) compared wi"

https://openalex.org/W2789761201,"We have previously performed a Genome Wide Association and linkage study that indicated a new disease triggering mechanism involving amino acid metabolism and nutrient sensing signaling pathways.The aim of this study was to investigate if plasma amino acid levels differed among children with celiac disease compared with disease controls.Fasting plasma samples from 141 children with celiac disease and 129 non-celiac disease controls, were analyzed for amino acid levels by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS). A general linear model using age and experimental effects as covariates was used to compare amino acid levels between children with a diagnosis of celiac disease and controls.Seven out of twenty-three analyzed amino acids were elevated in children with celiac disease compared with controls (tryptophan, taurine, glutamic acid, proline, ornithine, alanine and methionine). The significance of the individual amino acids do not survive multiple correction, however, multivariate analyses of the amino acid profile showed significantly altered amino acid levels in children with celiac disease overall and after correction for age, sex and experimental effects (p = 8.4 × 10-8).These findings support the idea that amino acids could influence systemic inflammation and play a possible role in disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2790327338,"Several oxime-containing small molecules have useful properties, including antimicrobial, insecticidal, anticancer, and immunosuppressive activities. Phosphonocystoximate and its hydroxylated congener, hydroxyphosphonocystoximate, are recently discovered oxime-containing natural products produced by Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-481 and Streptomyces regensis NRRL WC-3744, respectively. The biosynthetic pathways for these two compounds are proposed to diverge at an early step in which 2-aminoethylphosphonate (2AEPn) is converted to (S)-1-hydroxy-2-aminoethylphosphonate ((S)-1H2AEPn) in S. regensis but not in Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-481). Subsequent installation of the oxime moiety into either 2AEPn or (S)-1H2AEPn is predicted to be catalyzed by PcxL or HpxL from Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-481 and S. regensis NRRL WC-3744, respectively, whose sequence and predicted structural characteristics suggest they are unusual N-oxidases. Here, we show that recombinant PcxL and HpxL catalyze the FAD- and NADPH-dependent oxidation of 2AEPn and 1H2AEPn, producing a mixture of the respective aldoximes and nitrosylated phosphonic acid products. Measurements of catalytic efficiency indicated that PcxL has almost an equal preference for 2AEPn and (R)-1H2AEPn. 2AEPn was turned over at a 10-fold higher rate than (R)-1H2AEPn under saturating conditions, resulting in a similar but slightly lower kcat/Km. We observed that (S)-1H2AEPn is a relatively poor substrate for PcxL but is clearly the preferred substrate for HpxL, consistent with the proposed biosynthetic pathway in S. regensis. HpxL also used both 2AEPn and (R)-1H2AEPn, with the latter inhibiting HpxL at high concentrations. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that PcxL and HpxL are members of a new class of oxime-forming N-oxidases that are broadly dispersed among bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2791912018,"Medulloblastoma (MB), the tumor of the cerebellum, is the most frequent brain cancer in childhood and a major cause of pediatric mortality. Based on gene profiling, four MB subgroups have been identified, i.e., Wnt or Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) types, and subgroup 3 or 4. The Shh-type MB has been shown to arise from the cerebellar precursors of granule neurons (GCPs), where a hyperactivation of the Shh pathway leads to their neoplastic transformation. We have previously shown that the gene Tis21 (PC3/Btg2) inhibits the proliferation and promotes the differentiation and migration of GCPs. Moreover, the overexpression or the deletion of Tis21 in Patched1 heterozygous mice, a model of spontaneous Shh-type MB, highly reduces or increases, respectively, the frequency of MB. Here we tested whether Tis21 can inhibit MB allografts. Athymic nude mice were subcutaneously grafted with MB cells explanted from Patched1 heterozygous mice. MB allografts were then injected with adeno-associated viruses either carrying Tis21 (AAV-Tis21) or empty (AAV-CBA). We observed that the treatment with AAV-Tis21 significantly inhibited the growth of tumor nodules, as judged by their volume, and reduced the number of proliferating tumor cells (labeled with Ki67 or BrdU), relative to AAV-CBA-treated control mice. In parallel, AAV-Tis21 increased significantly tumor cells labeled with early and late neural differentiation markers. Overall the results suggest that Tis21-gene therapy slows down MB tumor growth through inhibition of proliferation and enhancement of neural differentiation. These results validate Tis21 as a relevant target for MB therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2793141086,"For Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), a test of cure (TOC) within 3-5 weeks is not recommended. International guidelines differ in advising a Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) TOC. Retesting CT and NG positives within 3-12 months is recommended in international guidelines. We assessed TOC and retesting practices including extragenital testing in general practitioner (GP) practices located in different socioeconomic status (SES) areas to inform and optimize local test practices.Laboratory data of 48 Dutch GP practices between January 2011 and July 2016 were used. Based on a patient's first positive CT or NG test, the proportion of TOC (<3 months) and retests (3-12 months) were calculated. Patient- and GP-related factors were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analyses.For CT (n = 622), 20% had a TOC and 24% had a retest at the GP practice. GP practices in low SES areas were more likely to perform a CT TOC (OR:1.8;95%CI:1.1-3.1). Younger patients (<25 years) were more likely to have a CT TOC (OR:1.6;95%CI:1.0-2.4). For CT (n = 622), 2.4% had a TOC and 6.1% had a retest at another STI care provider. For NG (n = 73), 25% had a TOC and 15% had a retest at the GP practice. For NG (n = 73), 2.7% had a TOC and 12.3% had a retest at another STI care provider. In only 0.3% of the consultations patients were tested on extragenital sites.Almost 20% of the patients returned for a CT TOC, especially at GP practices in low SES areas. For NG, 1 out of 4 patients returned for a TOC. Retesting rates were low for both CT (24%) and NG (15%), (re)infections including extragenital infections may be missed. Efforts are required to focus TOC and increase retesting practices of GPs in order to improve CT/NG control."
https://openalex.org/W2790496830,"Artificial high-CO2 atmosphere (AHCA, 95% CO2 and 1% O2) has been widely applied as a postharvest de-astringency treatment for persimmon fruit. AHCA increases expression of transcription factors, including ethylene response factors (DkERF), that target de-astringency genes. Here, the promoter of DkERF9, a previously characterized AHCA-inducible and de-astringency regulator, was utilized to screen a cDNA library by yeast one hybrid assay. A novel NAC transcription factor, named DkNAC7, was identified. Dual-luciferase assay indicated that DkNAC7 could not only trans-activate the promoter of DkERF9, but also activated the previously identified deastringency-related gene DkPDC2. Real-time PCR analysis showed that DkNAC7 was up-regulated by AHCA treatment, in concert with the removal of astringency from persimmon fruit and subcellular localization showed DkNAC7 was located in the nucleus. Thus, these results indicate that DkNAC7 is a putative transcriptional activator involved in regulating persimmon fruit deastringency by trans-activition on both DkERF9 and DkPDC2, which encodes pyruvate decarboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W2790566860,"Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the most prevalent congenital infection acquired worldwide, with higher incidence in developing countries and among HIV-exposed children. Less is known regarding vertical transmission of parvovirus B19 (B19V) and enterovirus (EV). We aimed to assess the prevalence of CMV, B19V and EV vertical transmission and compare results of screening of congenital CMV obtained from two different specimens in a semirural Mozambican maternity.A cross sectional study was conducted among pregnant mothers attending Manhiça District Hospital upon delivery. Information on maternal risk factors was ascertained. Dried umbilical cord (DUC) samples were collected in filter paper for CMV, B19V and EV detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) to test for CMV by RT-PCR. Maternal blood samples and placental biopsy samples were also obtained to investigate CMV maternal serology, HIV status and immunopathology.From September 2014 to January 2015, 118 mothers/newborn pairs were recruited. Prevalence of maternal HIV infection was 31.4% (37/118). CMV RT-PCR was positive in 3/115 (2.6%) of DUC samples and in 3/96 (6.3%) of NPA samples obtained from neonates. The concordance of the RT-PCR assay through DUC with their correspondent NPA sample was moderate (Kappa = 0.42 and p<0.001. No differences on cCMV prevalence were found among HIV-exposed and unexposed. All (100%) mothers were seropositive for CMV IgG. RT-PCR of EV and B19V in DUC were both negative in all screened cases. No histological specific findings were found in placental tissues. No risk factors associated to vertical transmission of these viral infections were found.This study indicates the significant occurrence of vertical transmission of CMV in southern Mozambique. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the true burden, clinical relevance and consequences of congenital infections with such pathogens in resource-constrained settings."
https://openalex.org/W2792672508,"Cophylogenetic studies aim at testing specific hypotheses to understand the nature of coevolving associations between sets of organisms, such as host and parasites. Monogeneans and their hosts provide and interesting platform for these studies due to their high host specificity. In this context, the objective of the present study was to establish whether the relationship between Anacanthorus spp. with their hosts from the upper Paraná River and its tributaries can be explained by means of cospeciation processes. Nine fish species and 14 monogenean species, most of them host specific, were studied. Partial DNA sequences of the genes RAG1, 16S and COI of the fish hosts and of the genes ITS2, COI and 5.8S of the parasite species were used for phylogenetic reconstruction. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of the host and parasite species were built and used for analyses of topological congruence with PACo and ParaFit. The program Jane was used to estimate the nature of cospeciation events. The comparison of the two phylogenies revealed high topological congruence between them. Both PACo and ParaFit supported the hypothesis of global cospeciation. Results from Jane pointed to duplications as the most frequent coevolutionary event, followed by cospeciation, whereas duplications followed by host-switching were the least common event in Anacanthorus spp. studied. Host-sharing (spreading) was also identified but only between congeneric host species."
https://openalex.org/W2793169434,"Understanding the relationships between Coffea arabica L. and the native tree community of secondary forests regrowing after the abandonment of coffee plantations is important because, as a non-native species in the Neotropics, coffee can outcompete native species, reducing diversity and forests ecosystem services. We aimed to answer three questions: 1) Does coffee regeneration in secondary forests differ between shaded and unshaded abandoned plantations?; 2) How is coffee basal area related to structural attributes, species diversity and composition of the native community?; and 3) Do the relationships between coffee and native community differ between tree and sapling components? We sampled the tree and sapling components in a seasonal tropical dry forest that were previously used as shaded and unshaded coffee plantations. Coffee was the most important species in the sapling component of shaded systems, but was almost absent in unshaded ones. Coffee basal area was negatively related with the native density and absolute species richness of the sapling component; and was negatively related with tree density, and positively related with the percentage of pioneer individuals of the native tree component. Our results indicate that coffee persists in secondary forest communities even after more than 70 years of shaded-coffee plantations were abandoned, potentially reducing density and diversity of native species. Despite limitations, which hinder more general conclusions on coffee invasiveness in Brazilian secondary tropical forests, our results indicate that coffee is a strong competitor in the studied secondary forests and provide important insights for future research on this topic."
https://openalex.org/W2789433966,"Ethanol (ET) is a substance that modulates the Central Nervous System (CNS). Frequently, ET intake occurs combined with energy drinks, which contain taurine (TA), an important amino acid found in the body (i.e brain and muscles). Although TA administration has been used in the improvement of physical performance, the impact of TA, ET and exercise remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the acute effect of 6g of Taurine (TA), 0.6 mL∙kg-1 of Ethanol (ET), and Taurine combined with Ethanol (TA+ET) ingestion on the electrocortical activity before and after a moderate intensity exercise in 9 subjects, 5 women (counterbalanced experimental design). In each of the 4 treatments (Placebo-PL, TA, ET and TA+ET), electroencephalography (EEG) tests were conducted in order to analyze changes in absolute beta power (ABP) in the frontal lobe in 3 moments: baseline (before ingestion), peak (before exercise) and post-exercise. In the PL treatment, the frontal areas showed decrease in ABP after exercise. However, in the ET+TA treatment, ABP values were greater after exercise, except for Fp1. The ET treatment had no effect on the Superior Frontal Gyrus area (F3, Fz and F4) and ABP decreased after exercise in Fp1 and Fp2. In the TA treatment, ABP increased after exercise, while it decreased at the peak moment in most of the frontal regions, except for Fp1, F3 and Fz. We concluded that after a moderate intensity exercise, a decrease in cortical activity occurs in placebo treatment. Moreover, we found a inhibitory effect of TA on cortical activity before exercise and a increased in cortical activity after exercise. A small ET dose is not enough to alter ABP in all regions of the frontal cortex and, in combination with TA, it showed an increase in the frontal cortex activity at the post-exercise moment."
https://openalex.org/W2794348748,"Eusociality, one of the most complex forms of social organization, is thought to have evolved in several animal clades in response to competition for resources and reproductive opportunities. Several species of snapping shrimp in the genus Synalpheus, the only marine organisms known to exhibit eusociality, form colonies characterized by high reproductive skew, and aggressive territoriality coupled with cooperative defense. In eusocial Synalpheus colonies, individual reproduction is limited to female ‘queens’, whose fecundity dictates colony growth. Given that individual reproduction and defense are both energetically costly, individual and colony fitness likely depend on the optimal allocation of resources by these reproducing individuals towards these potentially competing demands. Synalpheus species, however, display varying degrees of eusociality, suggesting that reproducing females have adopted different strategies for allocation among reproduction and defense. Here, we use structural equation modeling to characterize the relationships between the allometry of queen reproductive capacity and defensive weaponry, and colony size in six eusocial Synalpheus species, estimating trade-offs between reproduction and defense. We document strong trade-offs between mass of the fighting claw (defense) and egg number (reproduction) in queens from weakly eusocial species, while the trade-off is reduced or absent in those from strongly eusocial species. These results suggest that in less cooperative species, intra-colony conflict selects for queen retention of weapons that have significant costs to fecundity, while reproducing females from highly eusocial species, i.e., those with a single queen, have been able to reduce the cost of weapons as a result of protection by other colony members."
https://openalex.org/W2792979028,"Locomotion of machines and robots operating in rough terrain is strongly influenced by the mechanics of the ground-machine interactions. A rolling wheel in terrain with obstacles is subject to collisional energy losses, which is governed by mechanics comparable to hopping or walking locomotion. Here we investigate the energetic cost associated with overcoming an obstacle for rolling and hopping locomotion, using a simple mechanics model. The model considers collision-based interactions with the ground and the obstacle, without frictional losses, and we quantify, analyse, and compare the sources of energetic costs for three locomotion strategies. Our results show that the energetic advantages of the locomotion strategies are uniquely defined given the moment of inertia and the Froude number associated with the system. We find that hopping outperforms rolling at larger Froude numbers and vice versa. The analysis is further extended for a comparative study with animals. By applying size and inertial properties through an allometric scaling law of hopping and trotting animals to our models, we found that the conditions at which hopping becomes energetically advantageous to rolling roughly corresponds to animals' preferred gait transition speeds. The energetic collision losses as predicted by the model are largely verified experimentally."
