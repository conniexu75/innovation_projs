https://openalex.org/W1986908904,"The exploration of microbial communities by sequencing 16S rRNA genes has expanded with low-cost, high-throughput sequencing instruments. Illumina-based 16S rRNA gene sequencing has recently gained popularity over 454 pyrosequencing due to its lower costs, higher accuracy and greater throughput. Although recent reports suggest that Illumina and 454 pyrosequencing provide similar beta diversity measures, it remains to be demonstrated that pre-existing 454 pyrosequencing workflows can transfer directly from 454 to Illumina MiSeq sequencing by simply changing the sequencing adapters of the primers. In this study, we modified 454 pyrosequencing primers targeting the V4-V5 hyper-variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene to be compatible with Illumina sequencers. Microbial communities from cows, humans, leeches, mice, sewage, and termites and a mock community were analyzed by 454 and MiSeq sequencing of the V4-V5 region and MiSeq sequencing of the V4 region. Our analysis revealed that reference-based OTU clustering alone introduced biases compared to de novo clustering, preventing certain taxa from being observed in some samples. Based on this we devised and recommend an analysis pipeline that includes read merging, contaminant filtering, and reference-based clustering followed by de novo OTU clustering, which produces diversity measures consistent with de novo OTU clustering analysis. Low levels of dataset contamination with Illumina sequencing were discovered that could affect analyses that require highly sensitive approaches. While moving to Illumina-based sequencing platforms promises to provide deeper insights into the breadth and function of microbial diversity, our results show that care must be taken to ensure that sequencing and processing artifacts do not obscure true microbial diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2046746548,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a common and debilitating condition that lacks an effective therapy. To address this problem, we used a systems-based discovery strategy to search for a small molecule whose mRNA expression signature negatively correlates to mRNA expression signatures of human skeletal muscle atrophy. This strategy identified a natural small molecule from tomato plants, tomatidine. Using cultured skeletal myotubes from both humans and mice, we found that tomatidine stimulated mTORC1 signaling and anabolism, leading to accumulation of protein and mitochondria, and ultimately, cell growth. Furthermore, in mice, tomatidine increased skeletal muscle mTORC1 signaling, reduced skeletal muscle atrophy, enhanced recovery from skeletal muscle atrophy, stimulated skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and increased strength and exercise capacity. Collectively, these results identify tomatidine as a novel small molecule inhibitor of muscle atrophy. Tomatidine may have utility as a therapeutic agent or lead compound for skeletal muscle atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2062825488,"Community structure is one of the most commonly observed features of Online Social Networks (OSNs) in reality. The knowledge of this feature is of great advantage: it not only provides helpful insights into developing more efficient social-aware solutions but also promises a wide range of applications enabled by social and mobile networking, such as routing strategies in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and worm containment in OSNs. Unfortunately, understanding this structure is very challenging, especially in dynamic social networks where social interactions are evolving rapidly. Our work focuses on the following questions: How can we efficiently identify communities in dynamic social networks? How can we adaptively update the network community structure based on its history instead of recomputing from scratch? To this end, we present Quick Community Adaptation (QCA), an adaptive modularity-based framework for not only discovering but also tracing the evolution of network communities in dynamic OSNs. QCA is very fast and efficient in the sense that it adaptively updates and discovers the new community structure based on its history together with the network changes only. This flexible approach makes QCA an ideal framework applicable for analyzing large-scale dynamic social networks due to its lightweight computing-resource requirement. To illustrate the effectiveness of our framework, we extensively test QCA on both synthesized and real-world social networks including Enron, arXiv e-print citation, and Facebook networks. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of QCA in real applications: (1) A social-aware message forwarding strategy in MANETs, and (2) worm propagation containment in OSNs. Competitive results in comparison with other methods reveal that social-based techniques employing QCA as a community detection core outperform current available methods."
https://openalex.org/W1986501752,"It is generally accepted that intestinal sensory vagal fibers are primary afferent, responding nonsynaptically to luminal stimuli. The gut also contains intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs) that respond to luminal stimuli. A psychoactive Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1) that affects brain function excites both vagal fibers and IPANs. We wondered whether, contrary to its primary afferent designation, the sensory vagus response to JB-1 might depend on IPAN to vagal fiber synaptic transmission. We recorded ex vivo single- and multiunit afferent action potentials from mesenteric nerves supplying mouse jejunal segments. Intramural synaptic blockade with Ca(2+) channel blockers reduced constitutive or JB-1-evoked vagal sensory discharge. Firing of 60% of spontaneously active units was reduced by synaptic blockade. Synaptic or nicotinic receptor blockade reduced firing in 60% of vagal sensory units that were stimulated by luminal JB-1. In control experiments, increasing or decreasing IPAN excitability, respectively increased or decreased nerve firing that was abolished by synaptic blockade or vagotomy. We conclude that >50% of vagal afferents function as interneurons for stimulation by JB-1, receiving input from an intramural functional ""sensory synapse."" This was supported by myenteric plexus nicotinic receptor immunohistochemistry. These data offer a novel therapeutic target to modify pathological gut-brain axis activity.-Perez-Burgos, A., Mao, Y.-K., Bienenstock, J., Kunze, W. A.

https://openalex.org/W2085982331,"MicroRNA (miRNA) maturation is regulated by interaction of particular miRNA precursors with specific RNA-binding proteins. Following their biogenesis, mature miRNAs are incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where they interact with mRNAs to negatively regulate protein production. However, little is known about how mature miRNAs are regulated at the level of their activity. To address this, we screened for proteins differentially bound to the mature form of the miR-1 or miR-133 miRNA families. These muscle-enriched, co-transcribed miRNA pairs cooperate to suppress smooth muscle gene expression in the heart. However, they also have opposing roles, with the miR-1 family, composed of miR-1 and miR-206, promoting myogenic differentiation, whereas miR-133 maintains the progenitor state. Here, we describe a physical interaction between TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein that forms aggregates in the neuromuscular disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the miR-1, but not miR-133, family. Deficiency of the TDP-43 Drosophila ortholog enhanced dmiR-1 activity in vivo. In mammalian cells, TDP-43 limited the activity of both miR-1 and miR-206, but not the miR-133 family, by disrupting their RISC association. Consistent with TDP-43 dampening miR-1/206 activity, protein levels of the miR-1/206 targets, IGF-1 and HDAC4, were elevated in TDP-43 transgenic mouse muscle. This occurred without corresponding Igf-1 or Hdac4 mRNA increases and despite higher miR-1 and miR-206 expression. Our findings reveal that TDP-43 negatively regulates the activity of the miR-1 family of miRNAs by limiting their bioavailability for RISC loading and suggest a processing-independent mechanism for differential regulation of miRNA activity.

https://openalex.org/W2144760388,"The relation between men and women suffering pulmonary tuberculosis is 7/3 in favor to males. Sex hormones could be a significant factor for this difference, considering that testosterone impairs macrophage activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines production, while estrogens are proinflammatory mediator’s inducer. The aim of this work was to compare the evolution of tuberculosis in male and female mice using a model of progressive disease. BALB/c mice, male and female were randomized into two groups: castrated or sham-operated, and infected by the intratracheal route with a high dose of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv. Mice were euthanized at different time points and in their lungs were determined bacilli loads, inflammation, cytokines expression, survival and testosterone levels in serum. Non-castrated male mice showed significant higher mortality and bacilli burdens during late disease than female and castrated male animals. Compared to males, females and castrated males exhibited significant higher inflammation in all lung compartments, earlier formation of granulomas and pneumonia, while between castrated and non-castrated females there were not significant differences. Females and castrated males expressed significant higher TNF-α, IFN γ, IL12, iNOS and IL17 than non-castrated males during the first month of infection. Serum Testosterone of males showed higher concentration during late infection. Orchidectomy at day 60 post-infection produced a significant decrease of bacilli burdens in coexistence with higher expression of TNFα, IL-12 and IFNγ. Thus, male mice are more susceptible to tuberculosis than females and this was prevented by castration suggesting that testosterone could be a tuberculosis susceptibility factor."
https://openalex.org/W2001764117,"α-Synuclein (ASN) plays an important role in pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Novel and most interesting data showed elevated tauopathy in PD and suggested relationship between ASN and Tau protein. However, the mechanism of ASN-evoked Tau protein modification is not fully elucidated. In this study we investigated the role of extracellular ASN in Tau hyperphosphorylation in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and the involvement of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) in ASN-dependent Tau modification. Our results indicated that exogenously added ASN increases Tau phosphorylation at Ser396. Accordingly, the GSK-3β inhibitor (SB-216763) prevented ASN-evoked Tau hyperphosphorylation, but the CDK5 inhibitor had no effect. Moreover, western blot analysis showed that ASN affected GSK-3β via increasing of protein level and activation of this enzyme. GSK-3β activity evaluated by its phosphorylation status assay showed that ASN significantly increased the phosphorylation of this enzyme at Tyr216 with parallel decrease in phosphorylation at Ser9, indicative of stimulation of GSK-3β activity. Moreover, the effect of ASN on microtubule (MT) destabilization and cell death with simultaneous the involvement of GSK-3β in these processes were analyzed. ASN treatment increased the amount of free tubulin and concomitantly reduced the amount of polymerized tubulin and SB-216763 suppressed these ASN-induced changes in tubulin, indicating that GSK-3β is involved in ASN-evoked MT destabilization. ASN-induced apoptotic processes lead to decrease in PC12 cells viability and SB-216763 protected those cells against ASN-evoked cytotoxicity. Concluding, extracellular ASN is involved in GSK-3β-dependent Tau hyperphosphorylation, which leads to microtubule destabilization. GSK-3β inhibition may be an effective strategy for protecting against ASN-induced cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2071621928,"This study aims to establish a human gut microbiota (HGM) transplanted gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model of human rotavirus (HRV) infection and diarrhea, and to verify the dose-effects of probiotics on HRV vaccine-induced immune responses. Our previous studies using the Gn pig model found that probiotics dose-dependently regulated both T cell and B cell immune responses induced by rotavirus vaccines. We generated the HGM transplanted neonatal Gn pigs through daily feeding of neonatal human fecal suspension to germ-free pigs for 3 days starting at 12 hours after birth. We found that attenuated HRV (AttHRV) vaccination conferred similar overall protection against rotavirus diarrhea and virus shedding in Gn pigs and HGM transplanted Gn pigs. HGM promoted the development of the neonatal immune system, as evidenced by the significantly enhanced IFN-γ producing T cell responses and reduction of regulatory T cells and their cytokine production in the AttHRV-vaccinated pigs. The higher dose Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) feeding (14 doses, up to 109 colony-forming-unit [CFU]/dose) effectively increased the LGG counts in the HGM Gn pig intestinal contents and significantly enhanced HRV-specific IFN-γ producing T cell responses to the AttHRV vaccine. Lower dose LGG (9 doses, up to 106 CFU/dose) was ineffective. Neither doses of LGG significantly improved the protection rate, HRV-specific IgA and IgG antibody titers in serum, or IgA antibody titers in intestinal contents compared to the AttHRV vaccine alone, suggesting that an even higher dose of LGG is needed to overcome the influence of the microbiota to achieve the immunostimulatory effect in the HGM pigs. This study demonstrated that HGM Gn pig is an applicable animal model for studying immune responses to rotavirus vaccines and can be used for studying interventions (i.e., probiotics and prebiotics) that may enhance the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of vaccines through improving the gut microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2124273972,"Communication between the plasma membrane and mitochondria is essential for initiating the Ca(2+) and metabolic signals required for secretion in β cells. Although voltage-dependent Na(+) channels are abundantly expressed in β cells and activated by glucose, their role in communicating with mitochondria is unresolved. Here, we combined fluorescent Na(+), Ca(2+), and ATP imaging, electrophysiological analysis with tetrodotoxin (TTX)-dependent block of the Na(+) channel, and molecular manipulation of mitochondrial Ca(2+) transporters to study the communication between Na(+) channels and mitochondria. We show that TTX inhibits glucose-dependent depolarization and blocks cytosolic Na(+) and Ca(2+) responses and their propagation into mitochondria. TTX-sensitive mitochondrial Ca(2+) influx was largely blocked by knockdown of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU) expression. Knockdown of the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCLX) and Na(+) dose response analysis demonstrated that NCLX mediates the mitochondrial Na(+) influx and is tuned to sense the TTX-sensitive cytosolic Na(+) responses. Finally, TTX blocked glucose-dependent mitochondrial Ca(2+) rise, mitochondrial metabolic activity, and ATP production. Our results show that communication of the Na(+) channels with mitochondria shape both global Ca(2+) and metabolism signals linked to insulin secretion in β cells.- Nita, I.

https://openalex.org/W2077957701,"Subpopulations of cancer stem cells (CSCs) or cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) have been identified from most tumors, including pancreatic cancer (PC), and the existence of these cells is clinically relevant. Emerging evidence suggests that CSLCs participate in cell growth/proliferation, migration/invasion, metastasis, and chemo-radiotherapy resistance, ultimately contributing to poor clinical outcome. However, the pathogenesis and biological significance of CSLCs in PC has not been well characterized. In the present study, we found that isolated triple-marker-positive (CD44(+)/CD133(+)/EpCAM(+)) cells of human PC MiaPaCa-2 and L3.6pl cells behave as CSLCs. These CSLCs exhibit aggressive behavior, such as increased cell growth, migration, clonogenicity, and self-renewal capacity. The mRNA expression profiling analysis showed that CSLCs (CD44(+)/CD133(+)/EpCAM(+)) exhibit differential expression of more than 1,600 mRNAs, including FoxQ1, compared with the triple-marker-negative (CD44(-)/CD133(-)/EpCAM(-)) cells. The knockdown of FoxQ1 by its siRNA in CSLCs resulted in the inhibition of aggressive behavior, consistent with the inhibition of EpCAM and Snail expression. Mouse xenograft tumor studies showed that CSLCs have a 100-fold higher potential for tumor formation and rapid tumor growth, consistent with overexpression of CSC-associated markers/mediators, including FoxQ1, compared with its parental MiaPaCa-2 cells. The inhibition of FoxQ1 attenuated tumor formation and growth, and expression of CSC markers in the xenograft tumor derived from CSLCs of MiaPaCa-2 cells. These data clearly suggest the role of differentially expressed genes in the regulation of CSLC characteristics, further suggesting that targeting some of these genes could be important for the development of novel therapies for achieving better treatment outcome of PC."

Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels influence DC maturation and function. Intracellular heme, a product of catabolism of heme-containing metalloproteins, is a key inducer of ROS. Intracellular heme levels are regulated by heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which catalyzes the degradation of heme. Heme oxygenase-1 has been implicated in regulating DC maturation; however, its role in other DC functions is unclear. Furthermore, the signaling pathways modulated by HO-1 in DCs are unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that inhibition of HO-1 activity in murine bone marrow-derived immature DCs (iDCs) resulted in DCs with raised intracellular ROS levels, a mature phenotype, impaired phagocytic and endocytic function, and increased capacity to stimulate antigen-specific CD8 T cells. Interestingly, our results reveal that the increased ROS levels following HO-1 inhibition did not underlie the changes in phenotype and functions observed in these iDCs. Importantly, we show that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) pathway is involved in the mediation of the phenotypic and functional changes arising from HO-1 inhibition. Furthermore, up-regulation of HO-1 activity rendered iDCs refractory to lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of p38 MAPK-CREB/ATF1 pathway and DC maturation. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment of iDC with the HO-1 substrate, heme, recapitulates the effects that result from HO-1 inhibition. Based on these results, we conclude that HO-1 regulates DC maturation and function by modulating the p38 MAPK-CREB/ATF1 signaling axis.

Some interfaces of dendritic cell biology.APMIS. 2003; 111: 675-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Immature DCs (iDCs) are efficient at capturing extracellular antigens through several endocytic and phagocytic mechanisms (2Sallusto F. Cella M. Danieli C. Lanzavecchia A.

However, iDCs are poorly immunogenic as they express low levels of MHC class II molecules and co-stimulatory receptors including CD86 and CD40 at the cell surface. Dendritic cell maturation is triggered through engagement of pattern recognition receptors such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, e.g. bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Maturation is associated with morphological, phenotypic, and functional changes including up-regulation of cell surface MHC II, co-stimulatory molecules, loss of phagocytic capacity, and enhanced antigen-presenting capabilities, which are required for inducing competent T cell activation (4Chow A.

MAP kinases in the immune response.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar).

However, it is unclear whether HO-1 utilizes the p38 MAPK pathway to mediate regulation of DC maturation. Furthermore, it is not known whether the primary effect of HO-1 in regulating DC maturation is by preventing elevation of intracellular ROS levels. Finally, it is unknown whether the HO-1 substrate, heme, is directly involved in regulating DC maturation and function through activation of the p38 MAPK-CREB/ATF1 pathway. In this study, we show that inhibition of HO-1 activity in mouse bone marrow-derived iDCs results in a mature phenotype associated with an impaired phagocytic and endocytic capacity and an enhanced ability to stimulate antigen-specific T cell proliferation. We also demonstrate that although HO-1 inhibition was accompanied by elevated ROS, the increased ROS was not required for inducing DC maturation. Importantly, we show that the DC maturation and functional changes brought about by HO-1 inhibition are mediated through the p38 MAPK-CREB/ATF1 pathway. Finally, we provide evidence for the induction of p38 MAPK-CREB/ATF1 activation and DC maturation by the HO-1 substrate, heme.

Mice were maintained at the Biomedical Services Unit, University of Liverpool. Protocols described herein were undertaken in accordance with criteria outlined in the license granted under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (PPL 40/3379). Mouse bone marrow-derived iDCs were generated according to published protocol (18Lutz M.B. Kukutsch N. Ogilvie A.L. Rössner S. Koch F. Romani N. Schuler G.

DCs were stained with fluorescent αCD11cTC (Invitrogen) and αCD86FITC or αMHC IIPE (BD Biosciences) antibodies for 30 min on ice, washed, acquired on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and analyzed using Cyflogic software (version 1.2.1 CyFlo Ltd.). Apoptotic thymocytes were generated from mouse thymi treated with 1 μm dexamethasone for 18 h. Apoptotic thymocytes were labeled with the intracellular fluorescent dye, CFSE, and co-cultured with plate-adherent DCs for 2 h at 37 or 4 °C. Cells were stained with αCD11cTC prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Jurkat T cells were fluorescently labeled with CFSE, and necrosis was induced by snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Necrotic cells were co-cultured with DCs as above and analyzed by flow cytometry. DCs were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml DextranFITC (40,000 Mr) for different time points at 37 °C. Cells were stained for surface expression of CD11c as described above and analyzed by flow cytometry. Untreated or treated iDCs were stained using the fluorescent ROS indicator, dihydroethidium, according to Ref. 19Burnaugh L. Sabeur K. Ball B.A. Generation of superoxide anion by equine spermatozoa as detected by dihydroethidium.Theriogenology. 2007; 67: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and analyzed by flow cytometry. F5 CD8 T cell proliferation was quantified as described previously (20Johnson K.G. LeRoy F.G. Borysiewicz L.K. Matthews R.J. TCR signaling thresholds regulating T cell development and activation are dependent upon SHP-1.J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3802-3813PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, iDCs were pulsed with a concentration range of antigenic peptide (NP68), washed, and co-cultured with F5 CD8 T cells for 72 h. [3H]Thymidine was added for the last 16 h. Cells were harvested onto glass fiber filter mats and read on a scintillation counter (MicroBeta TriLux; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). DCs were lysed, and 5 μg of lysate protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad; Hertfordshire, UK), blocked, and probed for proteins of interest using the appropriate primary antibodies (phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-CREB (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies)) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) and visualized using the ECL system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Raw data obtained were analyzed using unpaired t test, one-way ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney U test. p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. To investigate the role of HO-1 in DC maturation and function, we treated iDCs with the inhibitor of HO-1 activity, SnPP-IX. Inhibition of HO-1 by SnPP-IX in iDCs resulted in increased levels of MHC II and CD86 cell surface expression in comparison with untreated DCs (Fig. 1A, panel i, MHC II 58.2 ± 3.7% versus 18.5 ± 0.8%, p < 0.05; Fig. 1A, panel ii, CD86 64.3 ± 4.5% versus 12.0 ± 1.6%, p < 0.05). Furthermore, MHC II and CD86 levels on SnPP-IX-treated iDCs were comparable with LPS-treated iDCs (MHC II 61.9 ± 4.1% and CD86 67.4 ± 3.2%). Following maturation, DCs have reduced phagocytic and endocytic capabilities (21Rescigno M. Granucci F. Citterio S. Foti M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Coordinated events during bacteria-induced DC maturation.Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 200-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22Banchereau J. Briere F. Caux C.

As HO-1 inhibition resulted in DC maturation, we examined the antigen acquisition capacity of SnPP-IX-treated iDCs. Our results revealed that SnPP-IX-treated iDCs had a reduced capacity to phagocytose both necrotic cells (Fig. 1B, panel i, 4.9 ± 0.7 versus 3.4 ± 0.6-fold increase over baseline, p < 0.05) and apoptotic cells (Fig. 1B, panel ii, 6.9 ± 1.7 versus 4.0 ± 0.5-fold increase over baseline, p < 0.05) when compared with their untreated control. Results also demonstrated that SnPP-IX-treated iDCs had a diminished capacity to endocytose dextran in comparison with their untreated controls (Fig. 1C, 46.0 ± 1.0% versus 75.0 ± 2.6% at 15 min, 65.7 ± 1.5% versus 84.0 ± 2.0% at 30 min, and 70.7 ± 2.1% versus 88.7 ± 1.2% at 60 min, p < 0.05). Low levels of co-stimulatory molecule expression in iDCs render them unable to stimulate a fully competent antigen-specific CD8 T cell response (23Bachmann M.F. Speiser D.E. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Absence of co-stimulation and not the intensity of TCR signaling is critical for the induction of T cell unresponsiveness in vivo.Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2156-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, up-regulation of these surface molecules in mature DCs enhances their ability to induce T cell activation (24Lanzavecchia A. Sallusto F. Regulation of T cell immunity by dendritic cells.Cell. 2001; 106: 263-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). As SnPP-IX-treated iDCs exhibit a mature phenotype, we expected that this would be associated with an enhanced capacity to induce DC-mediated antigen-specific CD8 T cell activation. To test this, we utilized a TCR transgenic mouse model, F5, wherein the CD8 T cells exclusively express the F5 T cell receptor (F5 TCR) that specifically recognizes the MHC-I (H2-Db)-restricted antigenic peptide, NP68, when presented by DCs (25Mamalaki C. Norton T. Tanaka Y. Townsend A.R. Chandler P. Simpson E. Kioussis D. Thymic depletion and peripheral activation of class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted T cells by soluble peptide in T-cell receptor transgenic mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 11342-11346Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Functional consequences of altered DC co-stimulatory receptor expression were assessed by the ability of NP68-bearing DCs to stimulate antigen-specific F5 CD8 T cell proliferation. We observed that SnPP-IX-treated DCs elicited enhanced DC-mediated antigen-specific F5 CD8 T cell proliferation in relation to the untreated control at all NP68 concentrations as shown in Fig. 1D (2.5-fold at 1 and 10 nm to 1.4-fold at 100 nm, p < 0.05). Taken together, these findings indicate that inhibition of HO-1 activity affects DC phenotypic maturation, antigen acquisition ability, and antigen-specific CD8 T cell stimulatory capacity. Dendritic cell maturation and function are influenced by intracellular ROS levels (26Kantengwa S. Jornot L. Devenoges C. Nicod L.P. Superoxide anions induce the maturation of human dendritic cells.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To test whether HO-1 activity is required for regulation of ROS levels in DCs, we treated iDCs with SnPP-IX and measured the ROS levels using the fluorescent redox-sensitive probe, dihydroethidium. Dihydroethidium reports on superoxide levels, and superoxide is a key ROS that has been shown to induce the maturation of DCs (26Kantengwa S. Jornot L. Devenoges C. Nicod L.P. Superoxide anions induce the maturation of human dendritic cells.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We found that HO-1 inhibition resulted in a significant increase in intracellular ROS levels in iDCs as shown in Fig. 2 (46.6 ± 8.7% versus 14.0 ± 0.7%, p < 0.05), an increase similar to that observed in the LPS-treated iDCs (47.6 ± 14.2%). Intracellular ROS can be lowered by ROS scavengers such as vitamins C and E (16Al-Huseini L.M. Aw Yeang H.X. Sethu S. Alhumeed N. Hamdam J.M. Tingle Y. Djouhri L. Kitteringham N. Park B.K. Goldring C.E. Sathish J.G. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NF-E2) p45-related factor-2 (Nrf2) modulates dendritic cell immune function through regulation of p38 MAPK-cAMP-responsive element binding protein/activating transcription factor 1 signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 22281-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and here we observed that treatment with vitamins C and E resulted in significant reduction in ROS levels induced by SnPP-IX treatment in iDCs (Fig. 2, 18.8 ± 9.4% versus 46.6 ± 8.7%, p < 0.05). Similar effects were also observed in LPS- and vitamin-treated iDCs (Fig. 2). These findings implicate HO-1 activity in preventing elevation of intracellular ROS levels in iDCs. To test whether DC maturation induced by HO-1 inhibition was a result of increased intracellular ROS levels, we treated HO-1-inhibited iDCs with vitamins C and E and examined MHC II and CD86 expression. Our results revealed that there were no significant differences between SnPP-IX treatment alone or in combination with vitamins C and E in iDC expression of MHC II (Fig. 3A, panel i, 57.2 ± 9.0% versus 51.8 ± 5.6%, p > 0.05) and CD86 (Fig. 3A, panel ii, 61.6 ± 9.1% versus 54.2 ± 4.9%, p > 0.05). In addition, no significant differences in the expression of MHC II and CD86 was observed in iDCs treated either with LPS alone or with LPS and vitamins C and E (Fig. 3A, panel i, 64.2 ± 9.0% versus 49.9 ± 9.1%, p > 0.05 and Fig. 3A, panel ii, 64.4 ± 6.0% versus 58.3 ± 3.6%, p > 0.05, respectively). Similarly, there were no differences observed in iDC-mediated antigen-specific F5 CD8 T cell proliferation upon SnPP-IX treatment alone or in combination with vitamins C and E (Fig. 3B). These observations suggest that the altered iDC phenotype and function induced by HO-1 inhibition are not a result of elevated ROS in these iDCs. Activation of the p38 MAPK-CREB/ATF1 signaling pathway has been shown to be involved in DC maturation (27Arrighi J.F. Rebsamen M. Rousset F. Kindler V. Hauser C. A critical role for p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in the maturation of human blood-derived dendritic cells induced by lipopolysaccharide, TNF-α, and contact sensitizers.J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3837-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway is accompanied by an increase in the serine phosphorylation status of p38 MAPK (28Shanware N.P. Zhan L. Hutchinson J.A. Kim S.H. Williams L.M. Tibbetts R.S. Conserved and distinct modes of CREB/ATF transcription factor regulation by PP2A/B56γ and genotoxic stress.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e12173Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29Ardeshna K.M. Pizzey A.R. Devereux S. Khwaja A. The PI3 kinase, p38 SAP kinase, and NF-κB signal transduction pathways are involved in the survival and maturation of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.Blood. 2000; 96: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether p38 MAPK is involved in the HO-1-mediated regulation of DC function, we first examined the phosphorylation status of p38 MAPK upon SnPP-IX treatment. As demonstrated in Fig. 4A, panel i, HO-1 inhibition resulted in a marked increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and this was independent of ROS status, as we found that the increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation following HO-1 inhibition remained unaffected when iDCs were co-treated with vitamins and SnPP-IX (Fig. 4A, panel i). We then examined the phosphorylation status of proteins that are downstream of p38 MAPK, i.e. CREB/ATF-1 (Fig. 4A, panel ii). We observed a marked induction in phospho-CREB/ATF-1in iDCs treated with SnPP-IX, and no difference was noted in this phosphorylation status when the cells were treated with vitamins along with SnPP-IX. A similar pattern was observed with LPS stimulation. We then assessed the requirement of the p38 MAPK pathway for the induction of DC maturation elicited by HO-1 inhibition using a pharmacological inhibitor of p38 MAPK (SB203580) and examined its effects on SnPP-IX-treated iDC phenotype and function. As shown in Fig. 4B, inhibition of p38 MAPK activity prevented the increase in co-stimulatory molecule expression induced by SnPP-IX treatment of iDCs (MHC II 43.5 ± 1.0 versus 15.9 ± 0.6%, p < 0.05, panel i; CD86 40.4 ± 0.9% versus 14.8 ± 2.3%, p < 0.05, panel ii). Furthermore, p38 MAPK inhibition also prevented the enhanced antigen-specific F5 CD8 T cell proliferation mediated by SnPP-IX-treated iDCs (Fig. 4C, reduction of 2.5-fold at 1 nm NP68, p < 0.05, 2-fold at 10 nm NP68, p < 0.05, and 1.4-fold at 100 nm, p < 0.05, which are comparable with iDCs). To test whether inhibition of p38 MAPK activity in SnPP-IX-treated DCs, which resulted in reduced DC maturation phenotype, is manifested through altered CREB/ATF1 signaling, DCs were treated with SnPP-IX and SB203580. Western immunoblotting revealed that SnPP-IX treatment resulted in increased CREB/ATF1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, the enhanced CREB/ATF1 phosphorylation was markedly reduced by p38 MAPK inhibition. Collectively, these results suggest that HO-1 regulates DC phenotype and function through modulation of the p38 MAPK-CREB/ATF1 signaling axis. To test whether the effects of HO-1 inhibition in DCs can be reversed by antioxidants other than vitamins, we used NAC as an additional ROS scavenger. NAC has been shown to be a potent ROS scavenger in DCs (30Sheng K.C. Pietersz G.A. Tang C.K. Ramsland P.A. Apostolopoulos V. Reactive oxygen species level defines two functionally distinctive stages of inflammatory dendritic cell development from mouse bone marrow.J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 2863-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that can elevate or replenish intracellular glutathione levels (31Zafarullah M. Li W.Q. Sylvester J. Ahmad M. Molecular mechanisms of N-acetylcysteine actions.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). We observed that, as with vitamins C and E, NAC was effective in lowering the increased intracellular ROS levels induced by SnPP-IX in iDCs (Fig. 5A, SnPP-IX versus SnPP-IX + NAC 46.6 ± 8.7% versus 20.2 ± 9.8%, p < 0.05). To further confirm the effects that ROS reduction by NAC have on DC maturation, we treated iDCs with NAC alone and in combination with SnPP-IX. Our results showed that there were no significant differences between the expression of MHC II and CD86 in SnPP-IX-treated iDCs or SnPP-IX- and NAC-treated iDCs (Fig. 5B, panel i, 57.2 ± 9.0% versus 54.7 ± 5.8%, p > 0.05 and Fig. 5B, panel ii, 61.6 ± 9.1% versus 56.7 ± 4.7%, p > 0.05 respectively). We next examined whether NAC affects the SnPP-IX-mediated activation of p38 MAPK-CREB/ATF1 pathway in DCs. Results showed that NAC does not affect the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and CREB/ATF1 induced by SnPP-IX (Fig. 5C). NAC had similar effects on LPS-induced changes in DC phenotype and signaling. These results further support the proposition that the effects of HO-1 inhibition on DCs are not dependent on ROS. To further test the involvement of HO-1 in the regulation of DC phenotype and function through p38 MAPK-CREB/ATF1, we investigated the effect of HO-1 up-regulation on LPS-triggered DC maturation and CREB/ATF1 phosphorylation. CoPP can be used to up-regulate the expression of HO-1 (32Rosa A.O. Egea J. Lorrio S. Rojo A.I. Cuadrado A. López M.G. Nrf2-mediated haeme oxygenase-1 up-regulation induced by cobalt protoporphyrin has antinociceptive effects against inflammatory pain in the formalin test in mice.Pain. 2008; 137: 332-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that both basal and LPS-induced up-regulation of MHC II molecules expression was significantly reduced (Fig. 6A, panel i) when iDCs were treated with CoPP (at concentrations of 10 and 20 μm). HO-1 induction also causes significant reduction in LPS-induced up-regulation of CD86 (Fig. 6A, panel ii). Furthermore, CoPP treatment resulted in a significant reduction in LPS-treated DC-mediated antigen-specific F5 CD8 T cell proliferation (Fig. 6B.) To evaluate the influence of CoPP treatment on LPS-induced phosphorylation of CREB and ATF1, iDCs were treated with CoPP and stimulated with LPS. Cobalt protoporphyrin treatment markedly reduced CREB/ATF1 phosphorylation in LPS-treated DCs as shown in Fig. 6C. These results strengthen the evidence for the regulation of DC function by HO-1. Inhibition of HO-1 is thought to result in intracellular accumulation of the HO-1 substrate, heme (33Wagener F.A. Volk H.D. Willis D. Abraham N.G. Soares M.P. Adema G.J. Figdor C.G. Different faces of the heme-heme oxygenase system in inflammation.Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). When heme (as hemin, the oxidized form of heme), is added to innate immune cells, it can accumulate within the cells (34Dang T.N. Robinson S.R. Dringen R. Bishop G.M.

Effects of PBDEs on adipogenesis were studied in the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell model in the presence and absence of a known adipogenic agent, dexamethasone (DEX). A PBDE mixture designed to mimic body burden of North Americans was tested, in addition to the technical mixture DE-71 and the individual congener BDE-47. The mixture, DE-71, and BDE-47 all induced adipocyte differentiation as assessed by markers for terminal differentiation [fatty acid binding protein 4 (aP2) and perilipin] and lipid accumulation. Characterization of the differentiation process in response to PBDEs indicated that adipogenesis induced by a minimally effective dose of DEX was enhanced by these PBDEs. Moreover, C/EBPα, PPARγ, and LXRα were induced late in the differentiation process. Taken together, these data indicate that adipocyte differentiation is induced by PBDEs; they act in the absence of glucocorticoid and enhance glucocorticoid-mediated adipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2052100008,"We studied the effects of future climate change scenarios on plankton communities of a Norwegian fjord using a mesocosm approach. After the spring bloom, natural plankton were enclosed and treated in duplicates with inorganic nutrients elevated to pre-bloom conditions (N, P, Si; eutrophication), lowering of 0.4 pH units (acidification), and rising 3°C temperature (warming). All nutrient-amended treatments resulted in phytoplankton blooms dominated by chain-forming diatoms, and reached 13–16 μg chlorophyll (chl) a l−1. In the control mesocosms, chl a remained below 1 μg l−1. Acidification and warming had contrasting effects on the phenology and bloom-dynamics of autotrophic and heterotrophic microplankton. Bacillariophyceae, prymnesiophyceae, cryptophyta, and Protoperidinium spp. peaked earlier at higher temperature and lower pH. Chlorophyta showed lower peak abundances with acidification, but higher peak abundances with increased temperature. The peak magnitude of autotrophic dinophyceae and ciliates was, on the other hand, lowered with combined warming and acidification. Over time, the plankton communities shifted from autotrophic phytoplankton blooms to a more heterotrophic system in all mesocosms, especially in the control unaltered mesocosms. The development of mass balance and proportion of heterotrophic/autotrophic biomass predict a shift towards a more autotrophic community and less-efficient food web transfer when temperature, nutrients and acidification are combined in a future climate-change scenario. We suggest that this result may be related to a lower food quality for microzooplankton under acidification and warming scenarios and to an increase of catabolic processes compared to anabolic ones at higher temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1980436356,"S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is a negative regulator of most methyltransferases and the precursor for the cardiovascular risk factor homocysteine. We have previously identified a link between the homocysteine-induced suppression of the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx-1) and endothelial dysfunction. Here we demonstrate a specific mechanism by which hypomethylation, promoted by the accumulation of the homocysteine precursor SAH, suppresses GPx-1 expression and leads to inflammatory activation of endothelial cells. The expression of GPx-1 and a subset of other selenoproteins is dependent on the methylation of the tRNA(Sec) to the Um34 form. The formation of methylated tRNA(Sec) facilitates translational incorporation of selenocysteine at a UGA codon. Our findings demonstrate that SAH accumulation in endothelial cells suppresses the expression of GPx-1 to promote oxidative stress. Hypomethylation stress, caused by SAH accumulation, inhibits the formation of the methylated isoform of the tRNA(Sec) and reduces GPx-1 expression. In contrast, under these conditions, the expression and activity of thioredoxin reductase 1, another selenoprotein, is increased. Furthermore, SAH-induced oxidative stress creates a proinflammatory activation of endothelial cells characterized by up-regulation of adhesion molecules and an augmented capacity to bind leukocytes. Taken together, these data suggest that SAH accumulation in endothelial cells can induce tRNA(Sec) hypomethylation, which alters the expression of selenoproteins such as GPx-1 to contribute to a proatherogenic endothelial phenotype."

Several post-translational modifications have been reported to modulate Prx activity. One of these, overoxidation of the peroxidatic cysteine to the sulfinic derivative, inactivates the enzyme and has been proposed as a mechanism of H2O2 accumulation in redox signaling (the floodgate hypothesis). Nitration of Prx has been reported in vitro as well as in vivo; in particular, nitrated Prx2 was identified in brains of Alzheimer disease patients. In this work we characterize Prx2 tyrosine nitration, a post-translational modification on a noncatalytic residue that increases its peroxidase activity and its resistance to overoxidation. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that treatment of disulfide-oxidized Prx2 with excess peroxynitrite renders mainly mononitrated and dinitrated species. Tyrosine 193 of the YF motif at the C terminus, associated with the susceptibility toward overoxidation of eukaryotic Prx, was identified as nitrated and is most likely responsible for the protection of the peroxidatic cysteine against oxidative inactivation.

KO mice have increased liver mRNA for several genes related to gluconeogenesis. Isotopic label semiquantitative peptidomic analysis suggests an increase in specific intracellular peptides in gastrocnemius and epididymal adipose tissue, which likely is involved with the increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in the KO mice. These results suggest the exciting new possibility that Nln is a key enzyme for energy metabolism and could be a novel therapeutic target to improve glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2084295812,"Glycosylation plays a critical role in the biogenesis and function of membrane proteins. Transient receptor potential channel TRPP2 is a nonselective cation channel that is mutated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. TRPP2 has been shown to be heavily N-glycosylated, but the glycosylation sites and the biological role of N-linked glycosylation have not been investigated. Here we show, using a combination of mass spectrometry and biochemical approaches, that native TRPP2 is glycosylated at five asparagines in the first extracellular loop. Glycosylation is required for the efficient biogenesis of TRPP2 because mutations of the glycosylated asparagines result in strongly decreased protein expression of the ion channel. Wild-type and N-glycosylation-deficient TRPP2 is degraded in lysosomes, as shown by increased TRPP2 protein levels upon chemical inhibition of lysosomal degradation. In addition, using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that glucosidase II (GII) mediates glycan trimming of TRPP2. The non-catalytic β subunit of glucosidase II (GIIβ) is encoded by PRKCSH, one of the genes causing autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD). The impaired GIIβ-dependent glucose trimming of TRPP2 glycosylation in ADPLD may explain the decreased TRPP2 protein expression in Prkcsh(-/-) mice and the genetic interaction observed between TRPP2 and PRKCSH in ADPLD. These results highlight the biological importance of N-linked glycosylation and GII-mediated glycan trimming in the control of biogenesis and stability of TRPP2."

The increase in fatality in Scarb1(I179N) mice was associated with an exacerbated inflammatory cytokine production. Further study demonstrated that hepatic SR-BI exerts its protection against sepsis through its role in promoting LPS clearance without affecting the inflammatory response in macrophages, the glucocorticoid production in adrenal glands, the leukocyte recruitment to peritoneum or the bacterial clearance in liver. Our findings reveal hepatic SR-BI as a critical protective factor in sepsis and point out that promoting hepatic SR-BI-mediated LPS clearance may provide a therapeutic approach for sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2163807313,"Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) are a heterogeneous population of cells that differ in size and morphology. BM-MSCs become committed to the osteogenic lineage as senescence approaches and lose multipotency. Nevertheless, little is known about the effects of cell-cell interaction between different populations on stemness loss and lineage commitment. The current study aimed to identify mechanisms by which cell-cell interactions between heterogeneous BM-MSCs affect stemness and lineage commitment of multipotent subpopulation. The lineage commitment of primitive multipotent cells was strongly induced in the presence of cytokines secreted by senescent-like cells in a cell culture insert system. Senescent-like cells secreted higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) than primitive multipotent cells in a human cytokine array. IL-6 induced the lineage commitment and stemness loss in multipotent cells by decreasing Sox2 expression. Furthermore, we confirmed that IL-6 decreased the transcriptional activity of Sox2 through up-regulation of Runx2 and Dlx5. We suggest a mechanism by which IL-6 modulates the expression of Sox2, resulting in decreased multipotency and causing primitive multipotent cells to undergo osteogenic lineage commitment. This is the first study to identify mechanisms in which the cell-cell interactions between the different populations play important roles in the stemness loss and lineage commitment of multipotent populations.-Yoon, D.

The turnover rate of PTEAr for the common organophosphorous insecticide malathion is lower than expected based on its physical properties; principally the pka of its leaving group. In this study, we rationalise the turnover rate of PTEAr for malathion using computational docking of the substrate into a high resolution crystal structure of the enzyme, suggesting that malathion is too large for the PTEAr binding pocket. Protein engineering through combinatorial active site saturation testing (CASTing) was then used to increase the rate of malathion turnover. Variants from a CASTing library in which Ser308 and Tyr309 were mutated yielded variants with increased activity towards malathion. The most active PTEAr variant carried Ser308Leu and Tyr309Ala substitutions, which resulted in a ca. 5000-fold increase in kcat/KM for malathion. X-ray crystal structures for the PTEAr Ser308Leu\Tyr309Ala variant demonstrate that the access to the binding pocket was enhanced by the replacement of the bulky Tyr309 residue with the smaller alanine residue."
https://openalex.org/W2150529988,"Background In Europe, a continuous programme (SPREAD) has been in place for ten years to study transmission of drug resistant HIV. We analysed time trends of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in relation to the risk behaviour reported. Methods HIV-1 patients newly diagnosed in 27 countries from 2002 through 2007 were included. Inclusion was representative for risk group and geographical distribution in the participating countries in Europe. Trends over time were calculated by logistic regression. Results From the 4317 patients included, the majority was men-having-sex-with-men -MSM (2084, 48%), followed by heterosexuals (1501, 35%) and injection drug users (IDU) (355, 8%). MSM were more often from Western Europe origin, infected with subtype B virus, and recently infected (<1 year) (p<0.001). The prevalence of TDRM was highest in MSM (prevalence of 11.1%), followed by heterosexuals (6.6%) and IDU (5.1%, p<0.001). TDRM was predominantly ascribed to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) with a prevalence of 6.6% in MSM, 3.3% in heterosexuals and 2.0% in IDU (p = 0.001). A significant increase in resistance to non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and a decrease in resistance to protease inhibitors was observed in MSM (p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively), but not in heterosexual patients (p = 0.68 and p = 0.14, respectively). Conclusions MSM showed to have significantly higher TDRM prevalence compared to heterosexuals and IDU. The increasing NNRTI resistance in MSM is likely to negatively influence the therapy response of first-line therapy, as most include NNRTI drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2170737578,"Excess hepatic fat accumulation leads to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a serious threat to health for which no effective treatment is available. However, the mechanism responsible for fatty acid uptake by hepatocytes remains unclear. Using the human hepatocyte-derived tumor cell line HepG2, we found that fatty acid influx is mediated by a heterotetrameric plasma membrane protein complex consisting of plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein, caveolin-1, CD36, and calcium-independent membrane phospholipase A2 (iPLA2β). Blocking iPLA2β with the bile acid-phospholipid conjugate ursodeoxycholate-lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE) caused the dissociation of the complex, thereby inhibiting fatty acid influx (IC50 47 μM), and suppressed the synthesis of all subunits through a reduction in lysophosphatidylcholine from 8.0 to 3.5 μmol/mg of protein and corresponding depletion of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase. These findings were substantiated by an observed 56.5% decrease in fatty acid influx in isolated hepatocytes derived from iPLA2β-knockout mice. Moreover, steatosis and inflammation were abrogated by UDCA-LPE treatment in a cellular model of NASH. Thus, iPLA2β acts as an upstream checkpoint for mechanisms that regulate fatty acid uptake, and its inhibition by UDCA-LPE qualifies this nontoxic compound as a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NASH.-Stremmel, W., Staffer, S., Wannhoff, A., Pathil, A., Chamulitrat, W.

https://openalex.org/W2149650927,"Mortalin/GRP75, the mitochondrial heat shock protein 70, plays a role in cell protection from complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). As shown here, interference with mortalin synthesis enhances sensitivity of K562 erythroleukemia cells to CDC, whereas overexpression of mortalin leads to their resistance to CDC. Quantification of the binding of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex to cells during complement activation shows an inverse correlation between C5b-9 deposition and the level of mortalin in the cell. Following transfection, mortalin-enhanced GFP (EGFP) is located primarily in mitochondria, whereas mortalinΔ51-EGFP lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence is distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Overexpressed cytosolic mortalinΔ51-EGFP has a reduced protective capacity against CDC relative to mitochondrial mortalin-EGFP. Mortalin was previously shown by us to bind to components of the C5b-9 complex. Two functional domains of mortalin, the N-terminal ATPase domain and the C-terminal substrate-binding domain, were purified after expression in bacteria. Similar to intact mortalin, the ATPase domain, but not the substrate-binding domain, was found to bind to complement proteins C8 and C9 and to inhibit zinc-induced polymerization of C9. Binding of mortalin to complement C9 and C8 occurs through an ionic interaction that is nucleotide-sensitive. We suggest that to express its full protective effect from CDC, mortalin must first reach the mitochondria. In addition, mortalin can potentially target the C8 and C9 complement components through its ATPase domain and inhibit C5b-9 assembly and stability."
https://openalex.org/W2009144746,"In this study, we detected Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis infection in equids living in endemic regions of cutaneous leishmaniasis. To determine the role of these animals in the Leishmania cycle, we used two approaches: serological and molecular methods. Antibodies to the parasite were assayed using the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Blood samples were collected and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the positive products were sequenced. The results showed that 11.0% (25/227) of the equids were seropositive for Leishmania sp, and 16.3% (37/227) were PCR positive. Antibodies were detected in 20 horses, 3 donkeys, and 2 mules, and the parasite DNA was detected in 30 horses, 5 donkeys, and 2 mules. Sequencing the amplified DNA revealed 100% similarity with sequences for Viannia complex, corroborating the results of PCR for L. braziliensis. Our results show that equids are infected with L. braziliensis, which could be food sources for phlebotomines in the peridomiciliary environment and consequently play a role in the cutaneous leishmaniasis cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2015272591,"Membrane-bound serine proteases play important roles in different biological processes. Their regulation by endogenous inhibitors is poorly understood. A Y163C mutation in the SPINT2 gene encoding the serine protease inhibitor Hepatocyte Growth Factor Inhibitor HAI-2 is associated with a congenital sodium diarrhea. The functional consequences of this mutation on HAI-2 activity and its physiological targets are unknown. We established a cellular assay in Xenopus laevis oocytes to study functional interactions between HAI-2 and candidate membrane-bound serine proteases expressed in the gastro-intestinal tract. We found that the wild-type form of HAI-2 is a potent inhibitor of nine gastro-intestinal serine proteases. The Y163C mutation in the second Kunitz domain of HAI-2 resulted in a complete loss of inhibitory activity on two intestinal proteases, prostasin and tmprss13. The effect of the mutation of the homologous Y68C in the first Kunitz domain of HAI-2 is consistent with a differential contribution of the two Kunitz domains of HAI-2 in the inhibition of serine proteases. By contrast to the Tyr to Cys, the Tyr to Ser substitution did not change the inhibitory potency of HAI-2, indicating that the thiol-group of the cysteine rather than the Tyr deletion is responsible for the HAI-2 loss of function. Our functional assay allowed us to identify membrane-bound serine proteases as cellular target for inhibition by HAI-2 wild type and mutants, and to better define the role of the Tyr in the second Kunitz domain in the inhibitory activity of HAI-2."
https://openalex.org/W2099616000,"NF-κB is an important transcription factor in the immune system, and aberrant NF-κB activity contributes to malignant diseases and autoimmunity. In T cells, NF-κB is activated upon TCR stimulation, and signal transduction to NF-κB activation is triggered by a cascade of phosphorylation events. However, fine-tuning and termination of TCR signaling are only partially understood. Phosphatases oppose the role of kinases by removing phosphate moieties. The catalytic activity of the protein phosphatase PP2A has been implicated in the regulation of NF-κB. PP2A acts in trimeric complexes in which the catalytic subunit is promiscuous and the regulatory subunit confers substrate specificity. To understand and eventually target NF-κB-specific PP2A functions it is essential to define the regulatory PP2A subunit involved. So far, the regulatory PP2A subunit that mediates NF-κB suppression in T cells remained undefined. By performing a siRNA screen in Jurkat T cells harboring a NF-κB-responsive luciferase reporter, we identified the PP2A regulatory subunit B56γ as negative regulator of NF-κB in TCR signaling. B56γ was strongly up-regulated upon primary human T cell activation, and B56γ silencing induced increased IκB kinase (IKK) and IκBα phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation. B56γ silencing enhanced NF-κB activity, resulting in increased NF-κB target gene expression including the T cell cytokine IL-2. In addition, T cell proliferation was increased upon B56γ silencing. These data help to understand the physiology of PP2A function in T cells and the pathophysiology of diseases involving PP2A and NF-κB."

Both cell-free and cell-associated CSF and PB fractions were analyzed, to distinguish latent from lytic EBV infection. EBV DNA was detected in 5.5% and 18.2% of cell-free and cell-associated CSF fractions of patients with RRMS as compared to 7.8% and 7.8% of controls; plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) positivity rates were 7.3% and 47.3% versus 5.8% and 31.4%, respectively. No significant difference in median EBV viral loads of positive samples was found between RRMS and control patients in all tested samples. Absence of statistically significant differences in EBV positivity rates between RRMS and control patients, despite the use of highly sensitive standardized methods, points to the lack of association between EBV and MS disease activity."
https://openalex.org/W2091786946,"Monocyte/macrophage accumulation plays a critical role during progression of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis. Our previous studies demonstrated that retrovirally mediated expression of the versican V3 splice variant (V3) by arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) decreases monocyte adhesion in vitro and macrophage accumulation in a model of lipid-induced neointimal formation in vivo. We now demonstrate that V3-expressing ASMCs resist monocyte adhesion by altering the composition of the microenvironment surrounding the cells by affecting multiple signaling pathways. Reduction of monocyte adhesion to V3-expressing ASMCs is due to the generation of an extracellular matrix enriched in elastic fibers and depleted in hyaluronan, and reduction of the proinflammatory cell surface vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). Blocking these changes reverses the protective effect of V3 on monocyte adhesion. The enhanced elastogenesis induced by V3 expression is mediated by TGFβ signaling, whereas the reduction in hyaluronan cable formation induced by V3 expression is mediated by the blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor and NFκB activation pathways. In addition, expression of V3 by ASMCs induced a marked decrease in NFκB-responsive proinflammatory cell surface molecules that mediate monocyte adhesion, such as VCAM1. Overall, these results indicate that V3 expression by ASMCs creates a microenvironment resistant to monocyte adhesion via differentially regulating multiple signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2134519679,"Background Nigeria is faced with a high burden of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Treatment outcomes among MDR-TB patients registered across the globe have been poor, partly due to high loss-to-follow-up. To address this challenge, MDR-TB patients in Nigeria are hospitalized during the intensive-phase(IP) of treatment (first 6–8 months) and are provided with a package of care including standardized MDR-TB treatment regimen, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (CPT) for HIV-infected patients, nutritional and psychosocial support. In this study, we report the end-IP treatment outcomes among them. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed the patient records of all bacteriologically-confirmed MDR-TB patients admitted for treatment between July 2010 and October 2012. Results Of 162 patients, 105(65%) were male, median age was 34 years and 28(17%) were HIV-infected; all 28 received ART and CPT. Overall, 138(85%) were alive and culture negative at the end of IP, 24(15%) died and there was no loss-to-follow-up. Mortality was related to low CD4-counts at baseline among HIV-positive patients. The median increase in body mass index among those documented to be underweight was 2.6 kg/m2 (p<0.01) and CD4-counts improved by a median of 52 cells/microL among the HIV-infected patients (p<0.01). Conclusions End-IP treatment outcomes were exceptional compared to previously published data from international cohorts, thus confirming the usefulness of a hospitalized model of care. However, less than five percent of all estimated 3600 MDR-TB patients in Nigeria were initiated on treatment during the study period. Given the expected scale-up of MDR-TB care, the hospitalized model is challenging to sustain and the national TB programme is contemplating to move to ambulatory care. Hence, we recommend using both ambulatory and hospitalized approaches, with the latter being reserved for selected high-risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2028600960,"Compounds that efficiently inhibit the ribonuclease (RNase) H activity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) have yet to be developed. Here, we demonstrate that GSK5750, a 1-hydroxy-pyridopyrimidinone analog, binds to the enzyme with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) of ~400 nM. Inhibition of HIV-1 RNase H is specific, as DNA synthesis is not affected. Moreover, GSK5750 does not inhibit the activity of Escherichia coli RNase H. Order-of-addition experiments show that GSK5750 binds to the free enzyme in an Mg(2+)-dependent fashion. However, as reported for other active site inhibitors, binding of GSK5750 to a preformed enzyme-substrate complex is severely compromised. The bound nucleic acid prevents access to the RNase H active site, which represents a possible biochemical hurdle in the development of potent RNase H inhibitors. Previous studies suggested that formation of a complex with the prototypic RNase H inhibitor β-thujaplicinol is slow, and, once formed, it dissociates rapidly. This unfavorable kinetic behavior can limit the potency of RNase H active site inhibitors. Although the association kinetics of GSK5750 remains slow, our data show that this compound forms a long lasting complex with HIV-1 RT. We conclude that slow dissociation of the inhibitor and HIV-1 RT improves RNase H active site inhibitors and may circumvent the obstacle posed by the inability of these compounds to bind to a preformed enzyme-substrate complex."
https://openalex.org/W2066489317,"Using CLIMEX and the Taguchi Method, a process-based niche model was developed to estimate potential distributions of Phoenix dactylifera L. (date palm), an economically important crop in many counties. Development of the model was based on both its native and invasive distribution and validation was carried out in terms of its extensive distribution in Iran. To identify model parameters having greatest influence on distribution of date palm, a sensitivity analysis was carried out. Changes in suitability were established by mapping of regions where the estimated distribution changed with parameter alterations. This facilitated the assessment of certain areas in Iran where parameter modifications impacted the most, particularly in relation to suitable and highly suitable locations. Parameter sensitivities were also evaluated by the calculation of area changes within the suitable and highly suitable categories. The low temperature limit (DV2), high temperature limit (DV3), upper optimal temperature (SM2) and high soil moisture limit (SM3) had the greatest impact on sensitivity, while other parameters showed relatively less sensitivity or were insensitive to change. For an accurate fit in species distribution models, highly sensitive parameters require more extensive research and data collection methods. Results of this study demonstrate a more cost effective method for developing date palm distribution models, an integral element in species management, and may prove useful for streamlining requirements for data collection in potential distribution modeling for other species as well."
https://openalex.org/W2003171360,"Background Lost, delayed or incorrect laboratory results are associated with delays in initiating treatment. Delays in treatment for Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) can worsen patient outcomes and increase transmission. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a laboratory information system in reducing delays and the time for MDR-TB patients to culture convert (stop transmitting). Methods Setting: 78 primary Health Centers (HCs) in Lima, Peru. Participants lived within the catchment area of participating HCs and had at least one MDR-TB risk factor. The study design was a cluster randomized controlled trial with baseline data. The intervention was the e-Chasqui web-based laboratory information system. Main outcome measures were: times to communicate a result; to start or change a patient's treatment; and for that patient to culture convert. Results 1671 patients were enrolled. Intervention HCs took significantly less time to receive drug susceptibility test (DST) (median 11 vs. 17 days, Hazard Ratio 0.67 [0.62–0.72]) and culture (5 vs. 8 days, 0.68 [0.65–0.72]) results. The time to treatment was not significantly different, but patients in intervention HCs took 16 days (20%) less time to culture convert (p = 0.047). Conclusions The eChasqui system reduced the time to communicate results between laboratories and HCs and time to culture conversion. It is now used in over 259 HCs covering 4.1 million people. This is the first randomized controlled trial of a laboratory information system in a developing country for any disease and the only study worldwide to show clinical impact of such a system.

https://openalex.org/W1993697639,"Tetrandrine (TET) is a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid that is isolated from the Stephania Tetrandra. It is known to possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. We have shown that TET can effectively suppress the production of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory mediators, including cyclooxygenases (COXs), in macrophages. However, whether TET has an antinociceptive effect on LPS-induced hyperalgesia is unknown. In the present study, we investigated the potential antinociceptive effects of TET and the mechanisms by which it elicits its effects on LPS-induced hyperalgesia. LPS effectively evoked hyperalgesia and induced the production of PGE2 in the sera, brain tissues, and cultured astroglia. TET pretreatment attenuated all of these effects. LPS also activated inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase β (IKKβ) and its downstream components in the IκB/nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway, including COX-2; the increase in expression levels of these components was significantly abolished by TET. Furthermore, in primary astroglia, knockdown of IKKβ, but not IKKα, reversed the effects of TET on the LPS-induced increase in IκB phosphorylation, P65 phosphorylation, and COX-2. Our results suggest that TET can effectively exert antinociceptive effects on LPS-induced hyperalgesia in mice by inhibiting IKKβ phosphorylation, which leads to the reduction in the production of important pain mediators, such as PGE2 and COX-2, via the IKKβ/IκB/NF-κB pathway."

Genome segment 2 (Seg-2) encodes outer capsid protein VP2, the most variable of the AHSV proteins. VP2 is also a primary target for AHSV specific neutralising antibodies, and consequently determines the identity of the nine AHSV serotypes. In contrast VP1 (the viral polymerase) and VP3 (the sub-core shell protein), encoded by Seg-1 and Seg-3 respectively, are highly conserved, representing virus species/orbivirus-serogroup-specific antigens. We report development and evaluation of real-time RT-PCR assays targeting AHSV Seg-1 or Seg-3, that can detect any AHSV type (virus species/serogroup-specific assays), as well as type-specific assays targeting Seg-2 of the nine AHSV serotypes. These assays were evaluated using isolates of different AHSV serotypes and other closely related orbiviruses, from the 'Orbivirus Reference Collection' (ORC) at The Pirbright Institute. The assays were shown to be AHSV virus-species-specific, or type-specific (as designed) and can be used for rapid, sensitive and reliable detection and identification (typing) of AHSV RNA in infected blood, tissue samples, homogenised Culicoides, or tissue culture supernatant.

https://openalex.org/W4211046604,"Sublethal carbon monoxide (CO) exposure is frequently associated with myocardial arrhythmias, and our recent studies have demonstrated that these may be attributable to modulation of cardiac Na(+) channels, causing an increase in the late current and an inhibition of the peak current. Using a recombinant expression system, we demonstrate that CO inhibits peak human Nav1.5 current amplitude without activation of the late Na(+) current observed in native tissue. Inhibition was associated with a hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state inactivation properties of the channels and was unaffected by modification of channel gating induced by anemone toxin (rATX-II). Systematic pharmacological assessment indicated that no recognized CO-sensitive intracellular signaling pathways appeared to mediate CO inhibition of Nav1.5. Inhibition was, however, markedly suppressed by inhibition of NO formation, but NO donors did not mimic or occlude channel inhibition by CO, indicating that NO alone did not account for the actions of CO. Exposure of cells to DTT immediately before CO exposure also dramatically reduced the magnitude of current inhibition. Similarly, l-cysteine and N-ethylmaleimide significantly attenuated the inhibition caused by CO. In the presence of DTT and the NO inhibitor N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride, the ability of CO to inhibit Nav1.5 was almost fully prevented. Our data indicate that inhibition of peak Na(+) current (which can lead to Brugada syndrome-like arrhythmias) occurs via a mechanism distinct from induction of the late current, requires NO formation, and is dependent on channel redox state."

The accuracy of this estimation varies according to the method used. The aim of this study was to assess the agreement between the parasite density values obtained with the assumed value of 8,000 cells/μL and the automated WBC count. Moreover, the same comparative analysis was carried out for other assumed values of WBCs. The study was carried out in Brazil with 403 malaria patients who were infected in different endemic areas of the Brazilian Amazon. The use of a fixed WBC count of 8,000 cells/μL to quantify parasite density in malaria patients led to overestimated parasitemia and resulted in low reliability when compared to the automated WBC count. Assumed values ranging between 5,000 and 6,000 cells/μL, and 5,500 cells/μL in particular, showed higher reliability and more similar values of parasite density when compared between the 2 methods. The findings show that assumed WBC count of 5,500 cells/μL could lead to a more accurate estimation of parasite density for malaria patients in this endemic region."
https://openalex.org/W2052270261,"In response to amino acid starvation, GCN2 phosphorylation of eIF2 leads to repression of general translation and initiation of gene reprogramming that facilitates adaptation to nutrient stress. GCN2 is a multidomain protein with key regulatory domains that directly monitor uncharged tRNAs which accumulate during nutrient limitation, leading to activation of this eIF2 kinase and translational control. A critical feature of regulation of this stress response kinase is its C-terminal domain (CTD). Here, we present high resolution crystal structures of murine and yeast CTDs, which guide a functional analysis of the mammalian GCN2. Despite low sequence identity, both yeast and mammalian CTDs share a core subunit structure and an unusual interdigitated dimeric form, albeit with significant differences. Disruption of the dimeric form of murine CTD led to loss of translational control by GCN2, suggesting that dimerization is critical for function as is true for yeast GCN2. However, although both CTDs bind single- and double-stranded RNA, murine GCN2 does not appear to stably associate with the ribosome, whereas yeast GCN2 does. This finding suggests that there are key regulatory differences between yeast and mammalian CTDs, which is consistent with structural differences."
https://openalex.org/W1992559587,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis (AP) for many years but experimental evidence is still limited. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2)-deficient mice are an accepted model of age-related oxidative stress. Here, we have analysed how UCP2 deficiency affects the severity of experimental AP in young and older mice (3 and 12 months old, respectively) triggered by up to 7 injections of the secretagogue cerulein (50 μg/kg body weight) at hourly intervals. Disease severity was assessed at time points from 3 hours to 7 days based on pancreatic histopathology, serum levels of alpha-amylase, intrapancreatic trypsin activation and levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in lung and pancreatic tissue. Furthermore, in vitro studies with pancreatic acini were performed. At an age of 3 months, UCP2-/- mice and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were virtually indistinguishable with respect to disease severity. In contrast, 12 months old UCP2-/- mice developed a more severe pancreatic damage than WT mice at late time points after the induction of AP (24 h and 7 days, respectively), suggesting retarded regeneration. Furthermore, a higher peak level of alpha-amylase activity and gradually increased MPO levels in pancreatic and lung tissue were observed in UCP2-/- mice. Interestingly, intrapancreatic trypsin activities (in vivo studies) and intraacinar trypsin and elastase activation in response to cerulein treatment (in vitro studies) were not enhanced but even diminished in the knockout strain. Finally, UCP2-/- mice displayed a diminished ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione in serum but no increased ROS levels in pancreatic acini. Together, our data indicate an aggravating effect of UCP2 deficiency on the severity of experimental AP in older but not in young mice. We suggest that increased severity of AP in 12 months old UCP2-/- is caused by an imbalanced inflammatory response but is unrelated to acinar cell functions."

It is mainly caused by mutations of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. Currently, the methods of whole genome sequencing or whole exome sequencing for screening mutations in familial hypercholesterolemia are not applicable in China due to high cost. We performed targeted exome sequencing of 167 genes implicated in the homozygous phenotype of a proband pedigree to identify candidate mutations, validated them in the family of the proband, studied the functions of the mutant protein, and followed up serum lipid levels after treatment. We discovered that exon 9 c.1268 T>C and exon 8 c.1129 T>G compound heterozygous mutations in the LDLR gene in the proband derived from the mother and father, respectively, in which the mutation of c.1129 T>G has not been reported previously. The mutant LDL-R protein had 57% and 52% binding and internalization functions, respectively, compared with that of the wild type. After 6 months of therapy, the LDL-C level of the proband decreased by more than 50% and the LDL-C of the other family members with heterozygous mutation also reduced to normal. Targeted exome sequencing is an effective method for screening mutation genes in familial hypercholesterolemia. The exon 8 and 9 mutations of the LDLR gene were pedigree mutations. The functions of the mutant LDL-R protein were decreased significantly compared with that of the wild type. Simvastatin plus ezetimibe was proven safe and effective in this preschool-age child."

In our study, SPI-fed rat serum inhibited the osteoblastic cell senescence pathway. This effect was accompanied by stimulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and significant restoration of replicative senescent bone marrow mesenchymal ST2 cells (passaged 30 times). These effects were reproduced in bone from 5-wk-old intact and 10-wk-old ovariectomized female rats fed SPI diets. Caveolin-1 and p53 expression was decreased in bone in SPI-fed, but not in 17β-estradiol (E2)-treated rats. In cell culture studies, membranous caveolin-1 and nuclear p53 expression was greater in replicative senescent ST2 cell cultures than in earlier passaged cells. SPI-fed rat serum significantly down-regulated both caveolin-1 and p53 in senescent and nonsenescent cells. Replicative senescent ST2 cells exhibited a strong association among caveolin-1, p53, and mouse double minute 2 homologue (mdm2), which was inhibited by SPI-fed rat serum. Overexpression of caveolin-1 in ST2 cells resulted in increased expression of p53 and p21, whereas, knockdown of caveolin-1 using shRNA led to increases in mdm2 and eliminated SPI-fed rat serum's effects on p53 and p21 expression. In contrast, manipulation of caveolin-1 expression did not affect the actions of E2 or isoflavones on p53 expression in either ST2 or OB6 cells. These results suggest that caveolin-1 is a mediator of nonestrogenic SPI effects on bone cells.-Zhang, J., Lazarenko, O. P., Blackburn, M. L., Badger, T. M., Ronis, M. J. J., Chen, J.-R.

https://openalex.org/W2036032714,"Models of character evolution often assume a single mode of evolutionary change, such as continuous, or discrete. Here I provide an example in which a character exhibits both types of change. Hummingbirds in the genus Selasphorus produce sound with fluttering tail-feathers during courtship. The ancestral character state within Selasphorus is production of sound with an inner tail-feather, R2, in which the sound usually evolves gradually. Calliope and Allen's Hummingbirds have evolved autapomorphic acoustic mechanisms that involve feather-feather interactions. I develop a source-filter model of these interactions. The 'source' comprises feather(s) that are both necessary and sufficient for sound production, and are aerodynamically coupled to neighboring feathers, which act as filters. Filters are unnecessary or insufficient for sound production, but may evolve to become sources. Allen's Hummingbird has evolved to produce sound with two sources, one with feather R3, another frequency-modulated sound with R4, and their interaction frequencies. Allen's R2 retains the ancestral character state, a ∼1 kHz ""ghost"" fundamental frequency masked by R3, which is revealed when R3 is experimentally removed. In the ancestor to Allen's Hummingbird, the dominant frequency has 'hopped' to the second harmonic without passing through intermediate frequencies. This demonstrates that although the fundamental frequency of a communication sound may usually evolve gradually, occasional jumps from one character state to another can occur in a discrete fashion. Accordingly, mapping acoustic characters on a phylogeny may produce misleading results if the physical mechanism of production is not known."

Here, we prospectively identify subpopulations of primary MCL cells with different biologic and immunophenotypic features. Using a simple culture system, we demonstrate that a subset of primary MCL cells co-cultured with either primary human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) or murine MS-5 cells form in cobblestone-areas consisting of cells with a primitive immunophenotype (CD19−CD133+) containing the chromosomal translocation t (11;14)(q13;q32) characteristic of MCL. Limiting dilution serial transplantation experiments utilizing immunodeficient mice revealed that primary MCL engraftment was only observed when either unsorted or CD19−CD133+ cells were utilized. No engraftment was seen using the CD19+CD133− subpopulation. Our results establish that primary CD19−CD133+ MCL cells are a functionally distinct subpopulation of primary MCL cells enriched for MCL-initiating activity in immunodeficient mice. This rare subpopulation of MCL-initiating cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MCL."
https://openalex.org/W1985032382,"Positioning of the mitotic spindle is crucial for proper cell division. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two mechanisms contribute to spindle positioning. In the Kar9 pathway, astral microtubules emanating from the daughter-bound spindle pole body interact via the linker protein Kar9 with the myosin Myo2, which moves the microtubule along the actin cables towards the neck. In the dynein pathway, astral microtubules off-load dynein onto the cortical anchor protein Num1, which is followed by dynein pulling on the spindle. Yet, the mechanism by which microtubules target cortical anchor sites is unknown. Here we quantify the pivoting motion of astral microtubules around the spindle pole bodies, which occurs during spindle translocation towards the neck and through the neck. We show that this pivoting is largely driven by the Kar9 pathway. The microtubules emanating from the daughter-bound spindle pole body pivot faster than those at the mother-bound spindle pole body. The Kar9 pathway reduces the time needed for an astral microtubule inside the daughter cell to start pulling on the spindle. Thus, we propose a new role for microtubule pivoting: By pivoting around the spindle pole body, microtubules explore the space laterally, which helps them search for cortical anchor sites in the context of spindle positioning in budding yeast."

We have found that ~10 to 15% of total KRas, a protein that is frequently mutated in cancer, is present on endosomes, independent of its activation state. The dynamics of GFP-KRas wild-type (WT) and constitutively active or inactive mutants on endosomes were analyzed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy. The measurements revealed an extraordinarily fast recovery of KRas WT [half-time (HT), ~1.3 s] compared to HRas, Rab5, and EGFR, with the active KRasG12V mutant being significantly faster and more mobile (HT, ~1 s, and ~82% of exchangeable fraction) than the inactive KRasS17N (HT, ~1.6 s, and ~60% of exchangeable fraction). KRas rapidly switches from the cytoplasm to the endosomal membranes by an electrostatic interaction between its polybasic region and the endosomal acidic phospholipids, mainly phosphatidylserine.—Gelabert-Baldrich, M., Soriano-Castell, D., Calvo, M., Lu, A., Viña-Vilaseca, A., Rentero, C., Pol, A., Grinstein, S.

However, the precise regulatory mechanism of the Rab12-mediated membrane trafficking pathway remained to be determined because a physiological Rab12-GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) had yet to be identified. In this study we performed functional analyses of Dennd3, which has recently been shown to possess a GEF activity toward Rab12 in vitro. The results showed that knockdown of Dennd3 in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells caused an increase in the amount of PAT4 protein, the same as Rab12 knockdown did, and knockdown of Dennd3 and overexpression of Dennd3 were found to result in an increase and a decrease, respectively, in the intracellular amino acid concentration. Dennd3 overexpression was also found to reduce mTORC1 activity and promoted autophagy in a Rab12-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, however, Dennd3 knockdown had no effect on mTORC1 activity or autophagy despite increasing the intracellular amino acid concentration. Further study showed that Dennd3 knockdown reduced Akt activity, and the reduction in Akt activity is likely to have canceled out amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation through PAT4.

Rab proteins are a subfamily of small GTPases that function as regulators of membrane traffic in all eukaryotes (1Fukuda M. Regulation of secretory vesicle traffic by Rab small GTPases.Cell. Mol.

Thus far, ∼60 different members of the Rab family have been identified in mammals, and each member is thought to regulate a specific type of membrane traffic. By cycling between two nucleotide-bound states, a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state, Rabs function as molecular switches.

We previously reported finding that Rab12 regulates the trafficking of amino acid transporter PAT4 (proton/amino acid transporter 4)-containing vesicles from recycling endosomes to lysosomes, where PAT4 is degraded (6Matsui T. Fukuda M. Rab12 regulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through controlling the degradation of amino-acid transporter PAT4.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We also found that Rab12 modulates the intracellular amino acid concentration, mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) activity, and autophagy, a conserved catabolic mechanism in all eukaryotes, through controlling PAT4 degradation (6Matsui T. Fukuda M. Rab12 regulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through controlling the degradation of amino-acid transporter PAT4.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, almost nothing was known in regard to the Rab12-specific GEF. Yoshimura et al. (7Yoshimura S. Gerondopoulos A. Linford A. Rigden D.J. Barr F.A. Family-wide characterization of the DENN domain Rab GDP-GTP exchange factors.J.

However, it remained unclear whether Dennd3 actually functions as a Rab12-GEF in vivo. In the present study we investigated the effect of Dennd3 knockdown and overexpression on PAT4 degradation, mTORC1 activity, and autophagy in MEF cells to elucidate the physiological function of Dennd3 in the regulation of Rab12. The results showed that Dennd3 actually regulates PAT4 degradation and that overexpression of Dennd3 modulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through Rab12 activation. Unlike Rab12, however, Dennd3 was found to also regulate Akt signaling. Possible mechanisms of the Dennd3-mediated regulation of mTORC1 activity and Akt activity are discussed on the basis of our findings. Anti-Rab12 rabbit polyclonal antibody and anti-LC3 rabbit polyclonal antibody were prepared as described previously (8Matsui T. Itoh T. Fukuda M.

Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody was from Invitrogen. A protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 2 were purchased from Roche Applied Science and Sigma, respectively. Bafilomycin A1 was obtained from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). cDNAs encoding an open reading frame of mouse Rab12 and Dennd3 were prepared as described previously (8Matsui T. Itoh T. Fukuda M.

The cDNAs obtained were subcloned into the pMRX-IRES-puro-T7 vector. The pMRX-IRES-puro-T7 vector is a variant of the pMRX-IRES-puro vector (donated by Shoji Yamaoka, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan) (11Saitoh T. Nakayama M. Nakano H. Yagita H.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared from 13.5-day mouse embryos were transformed with pEF321-T, an SV40 large T antigen expression vector. The resulting immortalized MEF cell line (simply referred to as MEF cells throughout this paper) was a generous gift of Noboru Mizushima (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). MEF cells were maintained at 37 °C in DMEM (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics under 5% CO2. Starved conditions were achieved by washing the cells once with HBSS (Sigma) and transferring them to HBSS for 1 h. Plat-E cells were donated by Toshio Kitamura (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Plat-E cell culture and retrovirus infection were performed essentially as described previously (13Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Plat-E: an efficient and stable system for transient packaging of retroviruses.Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs and siRNAs by using Lipofectamine 2000 and RNAiMAX (Invitrogen), respectively, each according to the manufacturer's instructions. The siRNA against mouse Rab12 and stealth RNAiTM RNA against Dennd3 have been described previously (8Matsui T. Itoh T. Fukuda M. Small GTPase Rab12 regulates constitutive degradation of transferrin receptor.Traffic. 2011; 12: 1432-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). MEF cells were cultured for 72 h after transfection with siRNAs or stealth RNAs. MEF cells were grown on 3.5-cm dishes. Before harvesting them, the cells were starved for 1 h with HBSS and then restimulated for 15 min with culture medium. The cells were then rinsed 3 times with ice-cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and lysed with the lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitor mixture). After normalization of the protein concentration of each sample, the lysates were analyzed by using an l-Amino Acid Quantitation Kit (BioVision, Milpitas, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions to determine their intracellular l-amino acid concentration. Immunostaining was performed essentially as described previously (14Itoh T. Fukuda M. Identification of EPI64 as a GTPase-activating protein specific for Rab27A.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31823-31831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In brief, cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with specific antibodies. The stained cells were examined for fluorescence with a confocal fluorescence microscope (Fluoview 1000-D; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) through an objective lens (100× magnification, NA 1.45; Olympus) and with Fluoview software (Version 2.1c; Olympus). For quantitative analysis, images of the cells were captured at random with the confocal microscope, and the number of fluorescent dots (i.e. LC3 dots) was counted with ImageJ software (Version 1.42q; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. The cells were then lysed in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, the phosphatase inhibitor mixture 2, and the protease inhibitor mixture, and total cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were then blocked with 1% skim milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with the primary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were detected by using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. The intensity of the immunoreactive bands was quantified with ImageJ software. The blots shown in this study are representative of three independent experiments. Lysates from COS7 cells that had been transfected with pEF-T7-RILP-L1 (15Fukuda M. Kanno E. Ishibashi K. Itoh T.

The beads were washed 3 times with washing buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitor mixture) and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the lysates from Dennd3 knockdown MEF cells or control MEF cells. The beads were then washed 3 times with the washing buffer, and the proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the antibodies indicated. Total RNA was prepared from MEFs by using TRI reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and reverse transcription was performed by using a ReverTra Ace-kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following pairs of primers were used for Gapdh: forward primer, 5′-ATGGTGA AGGTCGGAGTCAA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCCATGTAGACCATGAGGTC-3′; for Dennd3: forward primer, 5′-AAGGCCATGGCGCTGTTG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-TGCAGGATCCAGGCGCCC-3′. cDNAs were amplified by PCR with Ex Taq (Clontech-Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) and by performing 20 cycles (for Gapdh) or 25 cycles (for Dennd3) of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 55 °C for 0.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. MEF cells stably expressing T7-Dennd3 were treated with 0.8 mm Leu, 0.1 mm Pro, 0.08 mm Trp, or 0.1 mm Ala in the culture medium for 30 min, after which cell lysates were immediately prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. The statistical analyses were performed by using Student's unpaired t test, and p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.005). To determine whether Dennd3 acts as an upstream activator of Rab12 in vivo, we first examined the effect of Dennd3 knockdown on PAT4 degradation because Rab12 knockdown has been shown to increase the amount of PAT4 protein in MEF cells (6Matsui T. Fukuda M. Rab12 regulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through controlling the degradation of amino-acid transporter PAT4.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The results of an immunoblot analysis of MEF cells stably expressing HA-PAT4 showed that knockdown of endogenous Dennd3 in the cells with two independent specific stealth RNAs (Fig. 1, A and B) resulted in a significant increase in the amount of PAT4 protein (Fig. 1, C and D). Moreover, the effect of Dennd3 knockdown on the amount of PAT4 protein was completely canceled out by simultaneous overexpression of a constitutive active mutant of Rab12 (Rab12-QL), i.e. by forced activation of Rab12 (Fig. 1, E and F), suggesting that Dennd3 knockdown in MEF cells causes inactivation of Rab12, which in turn leads to inhibition of PAT4 degradation. To biochemically determine whether Rab12 is actually inactivated in Dennd3 knockdown cells, we performed active Rab12 pulldown assays by using beads coupled with RILP-L1, an active Rab12-binding protein (15Fukuda M. Kanno E. Ishibashi K. Itoh T. Large scale screening for novel Rab effectors reveals unexpected broad Rab binding specificity.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The results showed that Dennd3 knockdown significantly decreased the amount of the active form of Rab12 in the Dennd3 knockdown cells (Fig. 2, A and B). These results indicated that Dennd3 regulates PAT4 degradation in MEF cells by functioning as an upstream activator of Rab12.FIGURE 2Effect of Dennd3 knockdown on the level of active Rab12.

Fukuda M. Rab12 regulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through controlling the degradation of amino-acid transporter PAT4.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As expected, the intracellular l-amino acid concentration was significantly higher in the Dennd3 knockdown cells than in the control cells (Fig. 3), consistent with the increased amount of PAT4 protein (Fig. 1D). Thus, Dennd3 is likely to modulate the intracellular amino acid concentration through controlling the degradation of PAT4, the same as Rab12 does. Induction of autophagy is known to be regulated by intracellular nutrients, including by amino acids and growth factors (16Zoncu R. Efeyan A. Sabatini D.M. mTOR: from growth signal integration to cancer, diabetes, and ageing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar, 17Cornu M. Albert V. Hall M.N. mTOR in aging, metabolism, and cancer.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2013; 23: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and since we had recently shown that the efficiency of autophagy induction was reduced in Rab12 knockdown MEF cells because of the increased amount of intracellular l-amino acids entering through PAT4 (6Matsui T. Fukuda M. Rab12 regulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through controlling the degradation of amino-acid transporter PAT4.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we next investigated the impact of Dennd3 knockdown on autophagy by means of three independent approaches (Fig. 4) (see Ref. 18Klionsky D.J. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy.Autophagy. 2012; 8: 445-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar for details). Unexpectedly, however, the results showed that Dennd3 knockdown had no effect at all on the autophagic flux or the degradation of p62 protein, a specific substrate of autophagy (Fig. 4, A and B), and there was only a small reduction in the number of dots that were positive for LC3, an autophagosome marker (to ∼70–80% of the number in the control cells (Fig. 4, C and D). These results were in sharp contrast to our previous findings of a clear decrease in the number of LC3 dots, delayed autophagic flux, and increased amount of p62 protein in Rab12 knockdown cells in comparison with the control cells (i.e. typical autophagy inhibition phenotypes) (6Matsui T. Fukuda M. Rab12 regulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through controlling the degradation of amino-acid transporter PAT4.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because in contrast to Rab12 knockdown Dennd3 knockdown had little effect on autophagy, unlike in MEF cells (Fig. 4), we hypothesized that Dennd3 has an additional function other than Rab12 activation during induction of autophagy. The results of the above experiments indicated that even though Dennd3 knockdown results in an increase in the intracellular amino acid concentration (Fig. 3), it had hardly any effect on autophagy (Fig. 4). To resolve this discrepancy, we examined mTORC1 activity in Dennd3 knockdown cells because mTORC1 negatively regulates autophagy in response to amino acids, growth factors, and/or cellular energy (16Zoncu R.

Interestingly, Dennd3 knockdown had no effect at all on the phosphorylation level of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), a specific substrate of mTORC1 (Fig. 5A, second panel, and B). To our surprise, however, it clearly decreased the phosphorylation level of Akt (Fig. 5A, fourth panel, and B) even though we had found earlier that Rab12 knockdown increases mTORC1 activity without affecting Akt activity (6Matsui T. Fukuda M. Rab12 regulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through controlling the degradation of amino-acid transporter PAT4.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that the amount of EGFR protein, which is known to activate Akt, in the Dennd3 knockdown cells was reduced to approximately half the amount of EGFR protein in the control cells (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that Dennd3 knockdown reduces Akt activity through down-regulation of the EGFR-Akt pathway. These findings led us to hypothesize that Dennd3 knockdown not only up-regulates mTORC1 activity through the increased intracellular amino acid concentration (i.e. the amino acid-mTORC1 pathway) (Fig. 3) but also down-regulates the Akt-mTORC1 pathway and that its effects on the two pathways cancel each other out, thereby resulting in no apparent change in mTORC1 activity (Fig. 5, A and B). Because according to this hypothesis, forced activation of Akt in Dennd3 knockdown cells should result in stronger activation of mTORC1 than in control cells, we tested it by stimulating Dennd3 knockdown cells with insulin or EGF, either of which forcibly activates the Akt-mTORC1 pathway (Fig. 5, C and D). The results showed that insulin stimulation or EGF stimulation restored Akt activity (i.e. phosphorylation of Akt) in Dennd3 knockdown cells to the same level as in the control cells (Fig. 5C, middle panel, and D, fourth panel, lanes 4–6) and increased mTORC1 activity (i.e. the phosphorylation level of S6K) (Fig. 5, C and D, top panels, lanes 4–6), thereby supporting our hypothesis. Intriguingly, when the cells were cultured in DMEM without FBS (Fig. 5C, top panel, and D, second panel, lanes 1–3), Dennd3 knockdown also resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation level of S6K, suggesting that Dennd3 is capable of modulating mTORC1 activity independent of Akt activity. These results indicated that Dennd3 not only regulates mTORC1 activity as a Rab12-GEF but also regulates Akt activity in a Rab12-independent manner. Finally, we examined the effect of overexpression of Dennd3 on mTORC1 activity and autophagy. To do so, we generated MEF cells stably expressing T7-Dennd3 (Fig. 6B, top panel). When we measured the intracellular l-amino acid concentration, we found that, in contrast to the Dennd3 knockdown cells, the Dennd3-overexpressing cells contained a reduced intracellular l-amino acid concentration (Figs. 3 and 6A) and that overexpression of Dennd3 had reduced mTORC1 activity (Fig. 6, B, third panel, and C), the same as overexpression of Rab12-QL had (6Matsui T. Fukuda M. Rab12 regulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through controlling the degradation of amino-acid transporter PAT4.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because the effect of Dennd3 overexpression on mTORC1 activity was canceled out by exposure of the Dennd3-overexpressing cells to proline (Fig. 6, D and E), which has been reported to be a high affinity substrate of PAT4 in Xenopus oocytes (25Pillai S.M. Meredith D. SLC36A4 (hPAT4) is a high affinity amino acid transporter when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2455-2460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the PAT4 degradation that results from overexpression of Dennd3 is likely to contribute to the reduced mTORC1 activity. Moreover, it should be noted that overexpression of Dennd3 had no effect on Akt activity (Fig. 6B, fifth panel, and C) even though Dennd3 knockdown reduced it (Fig. 5A, fourth panel), and Dennd3 overexpression increased the amount of EGFR protein (Fig. 6B, seventh panel, and C). This unexpected finding may have been due to Akt activity in the MEF cells having become saturated under our culture conditions irrespective of Dennd3 overexpression. In addition, the amount of TfR protein, another Rab12-cargo (8Matsui T. Itoh T. Fukuda M. Small GTPase Rab12 regulates constitutive degradation of transferrin receptor.Traffic. 2011; 12: 1432-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), was lower in the Dennd3-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6B, second panel) and higher in the Dennd3 knockdown cells (Fig. 5A, top panel), respectively, thereby strongly supporting our hypothesis that Dennd3 functions as a physiological Rab12-GEF in MEF cells. Moreover, overexpression of Dennd3 resulted in an increase in the number of LC3-dots (Fig. 6, F and G) and amount of LC3-II protein, a lipidated form of LC3 specifically associated with autophagosomes (18Klionsky D.J. et al.Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy.Autophagy. 2012; 8: 445-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar), under nutrient-rich conditions alone (Fig. 6H, middle panel, lanes 1 and 4). To further determine whether or not the effects of overexpression of Dennd3 on mTORC1 activity and TfR degradation are dependent on Rab12, we knocked down endogenous Rab12 with a specific siRNA in control cells and Dennd3-overexpressing cells and analyzed their lysates by immunoblotting. The results showed that the reduction in mTORC1 activity and amount of TfR protein by Dennd3 overexpression was completely canceled out by simultaneous Rab12 knockdown (Fig. 7A, third and fourth panels, lanes 2 and 4, and B). Moreover, the increase in number of LC3-dots in Dennd3-overexpressing cells under nutrient-rich conditions was also canceled out by Rab12 knockdown (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these results indicated that Dennd3 functions as an upstream activator of Rab12 in MEF cells. We previously reported finding that Rab12 modulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through regulation of the membrane trafficking pathway from recycling endosomes to lysosomes, where PAT4 is degraded (6Matsui T. Fukuda M. Rab12 regulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through controlling the degradation of amino-acid transporter PAT4.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the physiological function of Dennd3, a putative Rab12-GEF (7Yoshimura S. Gerondopoulos A. Linford A. Rigden D.J. Barr F.A. Family-wide characterization of the DENN domain Rab GDP-GTP exchange factors.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), in MEF cells, and we obtained findings that indicated Dennd3 actually functions as an upstream regulator of Rab12. First, we found that Dennd3 knockdown resulted in an increase in the amount of PAT4 protein, the same as Rab12 knockdown did (6Matsui T. Fukuda M. Rab12 regulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through controlling the degradation of amino-acid transporter PAT4.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and that this effect was canceled out by simultaneous expression of the constitutive active Rab12-QL mutant (Fig. 1). Second, we found that knockdown of Dennd3 resulted in an increase in the intracellular l-amino acid concentration, the same as Rab12 knockdown increased it (6Matsui T. Fukuda M. Rab12 regulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through controlling the degradation of amino-acid transporter PAT4.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and that overexpression of Dennd3 decreased the intracellular l-amino acid concentration (Figs. 3 and 6A). Third, we found that overexpression of Dennd3 reduced mTORC1 activity and promoted autophagy in a Rab12-dependent manner under nutrient-rich conditions alone (Figs. 6, B, C, and F, and 7). In contrast to Rab12 knockdown (6Matsui T. Fukuda M. Rab12 regulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through controlling the degradation of amino-acid transporter PAT4.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), however, Dennd3 knockdown had hardly any effect on autophagy or mTORC1 activity despite increasing the intracellular amino acid concentration (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, Dennd3 is not simply a Rab12-GEF but is likely to have an additional function in the regulation of mTORC1 activity and autophagy that is Rab12-independent. We found that Dennd3 is actually involved in the regulation of the amount of EGFR protein, which activates the Akt-mTORC1 pathway (Fig. 5, C and D), and that Dennd3 knockdown was followed by a reduction in Akt activity, which in turn resulted in the decreased mTORC1 activity (Fig. 5A). The results of our study raise several intriguing questions. First, what is the mechanism by which Dennd3 regulates the activation of Rab12? One possibility is posttranslational modification of Dennd3, because the function of some Rab regulators (GEFs and GAPs) is known to be regulated by phosphorylation or ubiquitination (26Kim S.G. Hoffman G.R. Poulogiannis G. Buel G.R. Jang Y.J. Lee K.W. Kim B.Y. Erikson R.L. Cantley L.C. Choo A.Y. Blenis J.

For example, insulin-elicited active Akt phosphorylates TBC1D4/AS160 and suppresses its GAP activity toward Rab10, thereby leading to an increase in the GTP-bound form of Rab10, which ultimately promotes trafficking of Glut4 (glucose transporter 4)-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane (29Sano H. Eguez L. Teruel M.N. Fukuda M. Chuang T.D. Chavez J.A. Lienhard G.E. McGraw T.E.

Because Dennd3 and Rab12 modulate the intracellular amino acid concentration by controlling PAT4 degradation (Figs. 3 and 6A), presumably a protein involved in the amino acid sensing mechanism modifies the Dennd3 GEF function that activates Rab12, thereby leading to a decrease in the PAT4 protein level and the intracellular amino acid concentration to the basal level. Extensive research will be necessary to determine whether treatment of MEF cells with an excess of amino acids, specifically, proline, which has been found to be a high affinity substrate of PAT4 (25Pillai S.M. Meredith D. SLC36A4 (hPAT4) is a high affinity amino acid transporter when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2455-2460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), will alter posttranslational modification of Dennd3 and Rab12-GEF activity. Despite our unexpected discovery that Dennd3 is involved in the Akt-mTORC1 pathway (Fig. 5A), Akt itself does not appear to be a modifier of Dennd3, because our results showed that Dennd3 knockdown resulted in an increase in mTORC1 activity under both Akt-inactive and -hyperactive conditions (Fig. 5, C and D). The second intriguing question is how Dennd3 affects Akt activity. We can think of two possible mechanisms. One possible mechanism is the negative feedback mechanism on Akt signaling by mTORC1 and S6K. Several groups have recently reported that mTORC1 and S6K mediate phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), which is a negative regulator of insulin/IGF-1 signaling, and growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (Grb10), which is a negative regulator of growth factor signaling, and that these effects suppress the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mTORC2, an upstream activator of Akt (30Harrington L.S.

Phosphoproteomic analysis identifies Grb10 as an mTORC1 substrate that negatively regulates insulin signaling.Science. 2011; 332: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). More recently, S6K has been shown to phosphorylate Sin1, a component of mTORC2, which causes it to dissociate from mTORC2 and suppress mTORC2 activity independent of IRS1 and Grb10 (34Liu P. Gan W. Inuzuka H. Lazorchak A.S. Gao D. Arojo O. Liu D. Wan L. Zhai B. Yu Y. Yuan M. Kim B.M. Shaik S. Menon S. Gygi S.P. Lee T.H. Asara J.M. Manning B.D. Blenis J. Su B. Wei W. Sin1 phosphorylation impairs mTORC2 complex integrity and inhibits downstream Akt signalling to suppress tumorigenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 1340-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The results of these studies suggest that Dennd3 knockdown initially may increase mTORC1 activity and S6K activity through the increased intracellular amino acid concentration, but that negative regulation of Akt signaling is subsequently induced during cell culture of Dennd3 knockdown cells. However, there is evidence that no such feedback mechanism may actually exist, because Rab12 knockdown also resulted in increases in the intracellular amino acid concentration and mTORC1 activity independent of Akt activity in Rab12-knockdown cells (6Matsui T. Fukuda M. Rab12 regulates mTORC1 activity and autophagy through controlling the degradation of amino-acid transporter PAT4.EMBO Rep. 2013; 14: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although negative feedback regulation of Akt by insulin or growth factor stimulation has already been demonstrated, it is unknown whether amino acids also induce such a negative feedback mechanism. The second possible mechanism is that Dennd3 has at least two functions, i.e. as a Rab12-GEF and as a positive regulator of Akt signaling. Because Dennd3 contains a DENN domain in its N-terminal region and a WD40 repeat in its C-terminal region (7Yoshimura S. Gerondopoulos A. Linford A. Rigden D.J. Barr F.A. Family-wide characterization of the DENN domain Rab GDP-GTP exchange factors.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 35Marat A.L. Dokainish H. McPherson P.S. DENN domain proteins: regulators of Rab GTPases.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 13791-13800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and WD40 repeats often function as a protein-protein interaction site, Dennd3 may bind certain proteins involved in the regulation of Akt signaling. We favored this latter possibility because we found that knockdown and overexpression of Dennd3 reduced and increased, respectively, the amount of EGFR protein (Figs. 5, A and B, and 6, B and C) that is known to activate Akt. Thus, it is highly possible that Dennd3 modulates Akt activity through EGFR degradation or translation independent of Rab12 activation. Why does a single protein have two independent roles in mTORC1 regulation? The results of our Dennd3 knockdown experiments showed that Dennd3 acts as both a negative regulator of amino acid-mTORC1 signaling and a positive regulator of growth factor-Akt signaling. Interestingly, Naito et al. (36Naito T. Kuma A. Mizushima N. Differential contribution of insulin and amino acids to the mTORC1-autophagy pathway in the liver and muscle.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 21074-21081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have recently reported that the mTORC1-autophagy pathway is differentially regulated by insulin and amino acids in a tissue-dependent manner, because they found that insulin treatment increased mTORC1 activity to a greater extent in skeletal muscles than in liver, whereas amino acid treatment increased mTORC1 activity to a greater extent in liver than in skeletal muscles. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that the level of Dennd3 expression is differentially regulated in the two tissues, e.g. Dennd3 expression in liver may be weaker than in skeletal muscles, thereby resulting in greater amino acid sensitivity in liver because of a higher concentration of an increased amount of PAT4 protein, whereas Akt activity is suppressed. An investigation of the precise tissue distribution of Dennd3 will be necessary to answer this question. In summary, we have demonstrated that Dennd3 functions as a Rab12-GEF in MEF cells. We also unexpectedly discovered that Dennd3 not only regulates Rab12-dependent PAT4 degradation but also modulates Akt signaling in MEF cells. Further studies on the function of Dennd3 may provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of amino acid- and/or growth factor-mediated mTORC1 signaling. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2014534991,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by advanced osteolytic lesions resulting from the activation of osteoclasts (OCs) and inhibition of osteoblasts (OBs). OBs are derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the bone marrow (BM), however the pool and function of BMMSCs in MM patients (MM-BMMSCs) are reduced by myeloma cells (MCs) and cytokines secreted from MCs and related anti-MM treatment. Such reduction in MM-BMMSCs currently cannot be restored by any means. Recently, genetic aberrations of MM-BMMSCs have been noted, which further impaired their differentiation toward OBs. We hypothesize that the MSCs derived from adipose tissue (ADMSCs) can be used as alternative MSC sources to enhance the pool and function of OBs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the osteogenesis ability of paired ADMSCs and BMMSCs in MM patients who had completed intensive therapy. Fifteen MM patients who had received bortezomib-based induction and autologous transplantation were enrolled. At the third month after the transplant, the paired ADMSCs and BMMSCs were obtained and cultured. Compared with the BMMSCs, the ADMSCs exhibited a significantly higher expansion capacity (100% vs 13%, respectively; P = .001) and shorter doubling time (28 hours vs 115 hours, respectively; P = .019). After inducing osteogenic differentiation, although the ALP activity did not differ between the ADMSCs and BMMSCs (0.78 U/µg vs 0.74±0.14 U/µg, respectively; P = .834), the ADMSCs still exhibited higher calcium mineralization, which was determined using Alizarin red S (1029 nmole vs 341 nmole, respectively; P = .001) and von Kossa staining (2.6 E+05 µm2 vs 5 E+04 µm2, respectively; P = .042), than the BMMSCs did. Our results suggested that ADMSCs are a feasible MSC source for enhancing the pool and function of OBs in MM patients who have received intensive therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2150384963,"Cys loop receptors (CLRs) are commonly known as ligand-gated channels that transiently open upon binding of neurotransmitters to modify the membrane potential. However, a class of cation-selective bacterial homologues of CLRs have been found to open upon a sudden pH drop, suggesting further ligands and more functions of the homologues in prokaryotes. Here we report an anion-selective CLR from the hydrothermal vent annelid worm Alvinella pompejana that opens at low pH. A. pompejana expressed sequence tag databases were explored by us, and two full-length CLR sequences were identified, synthesized, cloned, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and studied by two-electrode voltage clamp. One channel, named Alv-a1-pHCl, yielded functional receptors and opened upon a sudden pH drop but not by other known agonists. Sequence comparison showed that both CLR proteins share conserved characteristics with eukaryotic CLRs, such as an N-terminal helix, a cysteine loop motif, and an intracellular loop intermediate in length between the long loops of other eukaryotic CLRs and those of prokaryotic CLRs. Both full-length Alv-a1-pHCl and a truncated form, termed tAlv-a1-pHCl, lacking 37 amino-terminal residues that precede the N-terminal helix, formed functional channels in oocytes. After pH activation, tAlv-a1-pHCl showed desensitization and was not modulated by ivermectin. In contrast, pH-activated, full-length Alv-a1-pHCl showed a marked rebound current and was modulated significantly by ivermectin. A thermostability assay indicated that purified tAlv-a1-pHCl expressed in Sf9 cells denatured at a higher temperature than the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo californica."
