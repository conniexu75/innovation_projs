https://openalex.org/W3011500848,"Cleavage of the gasdermin proteins to produce pore-forming amino-terminal fragments causes inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis)1. Gasdermin E (GSDME, also known as DFNA5)—mutated in familial ageing-related hearing loss2—can be cleaved by caspase 3, thereby converting noninflammatory apoptosis to pyroptosis in GSDME-expressing cells3–5. GSDME expression is suppressed in many cancers, and reduced GSDME levels are associated with decreased survival as a result of breast cancer2,6, suggesting that GSDME might be a tumour suppressor. Here we show that 20 of 22 tested cancer-associated GSDME mutations reduce GSDME function. In mice, knocking out Gsdme in GSDME-expressing tumours enhances, whereas ectopic expression in Gsdme-repressed tumours inhibits, tumour growth. This tumour suppression is mediated by killer cytotoxic lymphocytes: it is abrogated in perforin-deficient mice or mice depleted of killer lymphocytes. GSDME expression enhances the phagocytosis of tumour cells by tumour-associated macrophages, as well as the number and functions of tumour-infiltrating natural-killer and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Killer-cell granzyme B also activates caspase-independent pyroptosis in target cells by directly cleaving GSDME at the same site as caspase 3. Uncleavable or pore-defective GSDME proteins are not tumour suppressive. Thus, tumour GSDME acts as a tumour suppressor by activating pyroptosis, enhancing anti-tumour immunity. The gasdermin E protein is shown to act as a tumour suppressor: it is cleaved by caspase 3 and granzyme B and leads to pyroptosis of cancer cells, provoking an immune response to the tumour."
https://openalex.org/W3012485477,"Bioorthogonal chemistry capable of operating in live animals is needed to investigate biological processes such as cell death and immunity. Recent studies have identified a gasdermin family of pore-forming proteins that executes inflammasome-dependent and -independent pyroptosis1–5. Pyroptosis is proinflammatory, but its effect on antitumour immunity is unknown. Here we establish a bioorthogonal chemical system, in which a cancer-imaging probe phenylalanine trifluoroborate (Phe-BF3) that can enter cells desilylates and ‘cleaves’ a designed linker that contains a silyl ether. This system enabled the controlled release of a drug from an antibody–drug conjugate in mice. When combined with nanoparticle-mediated delivery, desilylation catalysed by Phe-BF3 could release a client protein—including an active gasdermin—from a nanoparticle conjugate, selectively into tumour cells in mice. We applied this bioorthogonal system to gasdermin, which revealed that pyroptosis of less than 15% of tumour cells was sufficient to clear the entire 4T1 mammary tumour graft. The tumour regression was absent in immune-deficient mice or upon T cell depletion, and was correlated with augmented antitumour immune responses. The injection of a reduced, ineffective dose of nanoparticle-conjugated gasdermin along with Phe-BF3 sensitized 4T1 tumours to anti-PD1 therapy. Our bioorthogonal system based on Phe-BF3 desilylation is therefore a powerful tool for chemical biology; our application of this system suggests that pyroptosis-induced inflammation triggers robust antitumour immunity and can synergize with checkpoint blockade. In mouse models of cancer, a biorthogonal chemical system based on desilylation catalysed by phenylalanine trifluoroborate enables the controlled release of gasdermin to induce pyroptosis selectively in tumour cells"

Here we present a quantitative atlas of the transcriptomes, proteomes and phosphoproteomes of 30 tissues of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our analysis provides initial answers to how many genes exist as proteins (more than 18,000), where they are expressed, in which approximate quantities (a dynamic range of more than six orders of magnitude) and to what extent they are phosphorylated (over 43,000 sites). We present examples of how the data may be used, such as to discover proteins that are translated from short open-reading frames, to uncover sequence motifs that are involved in the regulation of protein production, and to identify tissue-specific protein complexes or phosphorylation-mediated signalling events. Interactive access to this resource for the plant community is provided by the ProteomicsDB and ATHENA databases, which include powerful bioinformatics tools to explore and characterize Arabidopsis proteins, their modifications and interactions."

However, it remains unclear whether there is functional heterogeneity within individual memory engrams, i.e., if separate neuronal subpopulations encode distinct aspects of the memory and drive memory expression differently. Here, we show that contextual fear memory engrams in the mouse dentate gyrus contain functionally distinct neuronal ensembles, genetically defined by the Fos- or Npas4-dependent transcriptional pathways. The Fos-dependent ensemble promotes memory generalization and receives enhanced excitatory synaptic inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex, which we find itself also mediates generalization. The Npas4-dependent ensemble promotes memory discrimination and receives enhanced inhibitory drive from local cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons, the activity of which is required for discrimination.

Engrams of individual memories are the long-lasting biological changes that take place in the brain to encode specific experiences (Josselyn et al., 2015Josselyn S.A. Köhler S. Frankland P.W.

However, a fundamental question remains: whether neurons within a single memory engram are functionally homogeneous, as generally assumed, or heterogeneous, as hypothesized to allow different aspects of a memory to be individually represented and regulated (Ghandour et al., 2019Ghandour K.

The latter would favor flexible memory expression in an ever-changing environment (Eichenbaum, 2004Eichenbaum H.

Nevertheless, causal evidence for functional heterogeneity within a single engram is still lacking. It is also unknown whether functionally distinct neuronal ensembles can be distinguished within an engram at the molecular and cellular levels and whether they engage different synaptic and circuit mechanisms to modulate memory-guided adaptive behaviors. Genetically encoded activity reporters based on immediate early genes (IEGs), such as Fos and Arc (Barth, 2007Barth A.L.

Okuno H. Bito H. A new era for functional labeling of neurons: activity-dependent promoters have come of age.Front. Neural Circuits. 2014; 8: 37Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), commonly considered proxies of neuronal activity (Guzowski et al., 2005Guzowski J.F. Timlin J.A. Roysam B. McNaughton B.L.

Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), have been used to identify neuronal ensembles in engrams. Until now, most studies have focused on ensembles defined by a single activity-dependent pathway (Barth et al., 2004Barth A.L. Gerkin R.C. Dean K.L.

Localization of a stable neural correlate of associative memory.Science. 2007; 317: 1230-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). However, activity-dependent pathways are known to be highly diverse: they respond differently to external stimuli and mediate distinct cellular and synaptic processes (Yap and Greenberg, 2018Yap E.-L. Greenberg M.E. Activity-regulated transcription: bridging the gap between neural activity and behavior.Neuron. 2018; 100: 330-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The relationship between ensembles defined by different pathways has not been investigated. It is conceivable that different activity-dependent pathways may define functionally distinct ensembles within engrams, providing the means to genetically dissect them. Here, we directly examine the functionalities of neuronal ensembles defined by two different activity-dependent pathways downstream of the IEGs Fos and Npas4, both of which are highly induced by learning but likely trigger distinct synaptic changes in activated neurons (Flavell and Greenberg, 2008Flavell S.W.

Neurosci. 2008; 31: 563-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, Sun and Lin, 2016Sun X. Lin Y. Npas4: linking neuronal activity to memory.Trends Neurosci. 2016; 39: 264-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The widely used activity marker Fos mediates long-term potentiation of excitatory synapses (Fleischmann et al., 2003Fleischmann A. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Strekalova T. Zacher C. Layer L.E. Kvello A. Reschke M. Spanagel R. Sprengel R. et al.Impaired long-term memory and NR2A-type NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in mice lacking c-Fos in the CNS.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9116-9122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Npas4, a neuron-specific IEG that is selectively activated by neuronal activity, differs from Fos in that it preferentially recruits inhibitory synapses, or sometimes diminishes excitatory synapses, onto excitatory neurons (Lin et al., 2008Lin Y. Bloodgood B.L. Hauser J.L. Lapan A.D. Koon A.C. Kim T.K. Hu L.S. Malik A.N. Greenberg M.E. Activity-dependent regulation of inhibitory synapse development by Npas4.Nature. 2008; 455: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, Weng et al., 2018Weng F.-J. Garcia R.I. Lutzu S.

These different synaptic functions of Fos and Npas4 strongly suggest that the ensembles they define may be functionally distinct. To investigate the functionalities of the Fos- and Npas4-dependent ensembles, we focus on the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and the roles of these ensembles in memory discrimination and generalization, opposed processes that must be balanced appropriately to differentiate between different stimuli (Frankland et al., 1998Frankland P.W. Cestari V. Filipkowski R.K. McDonald R.J. Silva A.J. The dorsal hippocampus is essential for context discrimination but not for contextual conditioning.Behav.

Memory for context becomes less specific with time.Learn. Mem. 2007; 14: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The discrimination-generalization balance is critical to adaptive learning and avoiding maladaptive conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Mahan and Ressler, 2012Mahan A.L.

Fear conditioning, synaptic plasticity and the amygdala: implications for posttraumatic stress disorder.Trends Neurosci. 2012; 35: 24-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and panic disorder (Kheirbek et al., 2012Kheirbek M.A. Klemenhagen K.C. Sahay A. Hen R. Neurogenesis and generalization: a new approach to stratify and treat anxiety disorders.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The DG has traditionally been believed to mediate memory discrimination (Leutgeb et al., 2007Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Pattern separation in the dentate gyrus and CA3 of the hippocampus.Science. 2007; 315: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar, McHugh et al., 2007McHugh T.J. Jones M.W. Quinn J.J.

Rolls E.T. Computational analysis of the role of the hippocampus in memory.Hippocampus. 1994; 4: 374-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar), but recent studies suggest that this region can also promote memory generalization (Hainmueller and Bartos, 2018Hainmueller T.

McBain C.J. et al.Young dentate granule cells mediate pattern separation, whereas old granule cells facilitate pattern completion.Cell. 2012; 149: 188-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the involvement of neuronal ensembles in the DG in these processes. Here, we show that the Fos- and Npas4-dependent neuronal ensembles within the DG contextual fear memory engram regulate memory generalization and discrimination, respectively, by engaging distinct synaptic and circuit mechanisms. To identify Fos- and Npas4-dependent ensembles within the engram, we used our Robust Activity Marking (RAM) reporter system (Sørensen et al., 2016Sørensen A.T. Cooper Y.A. Baratta M.V. Weng F.-J. Zhang Y. Ramamoorthi K. Fropf R. LaVerriere E. Xue J. Young A. et al.A robust activity marking system for exploring active neuronal ensembles.eLife. 2016; 5: e13918Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) to create Fos-dependent RAM (F-RAM) and Npas4-dependent RAM (N-RAM) reporters. FOS and NPAS4 are transcription factors and exert their functions via their downstream transcriptional targets, so we designed reporters that reflect these transcriptional outputs. The promoters in F-RAM and N-RAM (PF-RAM and PN-RAM) consist of the consensus DNA binding sequences for FOS and NPAS4 (Figure S1A). Both promoters drive the expression of reporter genes under the temporal control of a modified doxycycline (Dox)-dependent Tet-off system developed for the RAM system (Figure 1A).Figure 1The F-RAM and N-RAM Reporters Selectively Capture Fos- and Npas4-Dependent Neuronal EnsemblesShow full caption(A) Design of the F-RAM and N-RAM reporters.(B) Characterization of PF-RAM and PN-RAM.

Both PF-RAM and PN-RAM were robustly activated by membrane depolarization in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons (Figure 1B; numerical data and statistical information for all figures are included in Table S1), suggesting that they are regulated by neuronal activity. PF-RAM was activated by various extracellular stimuli known to activate Fos, and PN-RAM was selectively activated by neuronal activity, recapitulating this unique property of Npas4 (Lin et al., 2008Lin Y. Bloodgood B.L. Hauser J.L. Lapan A.D. Koon A.C. Kim T.K. Hu L.S. Malik A.N. Greenberg M.E. Activity-dependent regulation of inhibitory synapse development by Npas4.Nature. 2008; 455: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Fos, but not Npas4, drives PF-RAM activity, whereas overexpression of Npas4, but not Fos, activates PN-RAM (Figure 1B), indicating that activation of PF-RAM and PN-RAM is selective. Both the F-RAM and N-RAM reporters showed low background activation and were robustly induced by neuronal activity in a Dox-dependent manner (Figure S1D). We used adeno-associated virus (AAV) AAV-F-RAM-mKate2 or AAV-N-RAM-mKate2 to label active neuronal ensembles in vivo in mouse dorsal DG following contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Labeled cells were mostly located in the granule cell layer (Figure 1C), suggesting that they are mostly dentate granule cells (DGCs). Both reporters showed low activation in the home cage (HC) condition, were robustly activated by kainic-acid-induced seizures, and were mostly inhibited in the presence of Dox. Consistent with previous reports (Deng et al., 2013Deng W. Mayford M. Gage F.H.

Neurosci. 2015; 35: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), on average, 1%–2% of the DGCs were labeled after CFC (Figure 1C). Both reporters also labeled small populations of cells, mostly mossy cells, in the dentate hilus regions. The number of labeled hilar cells was similar in the HC and CFC conditions, suggesting that contextual fear learning did not significantly activate these reporters in the hilus (Figures S1E–S1I). We next verified that activation of F-RAM and N-RAM in vivo specifically required Fos and Npas4, respectively. In Fos and Npas4 conditional knockout mice (Fosflx/flx and Npas4flx/flx), we deleted the Fos and Npas4 gene, respectively, in the DG using AAVs expressing the DNA recombinase Cre (Figures S1J and S1K). Seizure-induced F-RAM activity was largely abolished in the absence of Fos, but not after removal of Npas4 (Figure 1D). The remaining activity of F-RAM may be due to the recruitment of other FOS/JUN family members, such as c-JUN and FOSB, which may also bind and activate PF-RAM (Hess et al., 2004Hess J. Angel P. Schorpp-Kistner M. AP-1 subunits: quarrel and harmony among siblings.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5965-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Npas4 deletion, but not Fos deletion, eliminated N-RAM activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the F-RAM and N-RAM reporters specifically label the Fos- and Npas4-dependent active neuronal ensembles, respectively. To determine whether the neuronal ensembles identified by F-RAM and N-RAM are distinct populations within the DG engram, we first examined the synaptic properties of DGCs in each ensemble. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were carried out on F-RAM+ or N-RAM+ cells 24 h after CFC (Figure 2A), measuring spontaneous miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and mIPSCs). Compared to their unlabeled (F-RAM− or N-RAM−) neighbors, F-RAM+ neurons received stronger excitatory inputs, specifically higher mEPSC frequencies (Figure 2B), whereas N-RAM+ neurons received stronger inhibitory inputs, specifically increased mIPSC frequencies (Figure 2C). mIPSCs of F-RAM+ neurons and mEPSCs of N-RAM+ neurons were indistinguishable from those of their unlabeled neighbors. F-RAM+ and N-RAM+ neurons were rarely seen in the inner granule cell layer and did not show the high intrinsic excitability typical of adult newborn DGCs (Kuhn et al., 1996Kuhn H.G.

https://openalex.org/W3012382619,"The theory of grain boundary (the interface between crystallites, GB) structure has a long history1 and the concept of GBs undergoing phase transformations was proposed 50 years ago2,3. The underlying assumption was that multiple stable and metastable states exist for different GB orientations4-6. The terminology 'complexion' was recently proposed to distinguish between interfacial states that differ in any equilibrium thermodynamic property7. Different types of complexion and transitions between complexions have been characterized, mostly in binary or multicomponent systems8-19. Simulations have provided insight into the phase behaviour of interfaces and shown that GB transitions can occur in many material systems20-24. However, the direct experimental observation and transformation kinetics of GBs in an elemental metal have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate atomic-scale GB phase coexistence and transformations at symmetric and asymmetric [Formula: see text] tilt GBs in elemental copper. Atomic-resolution imaging reveals the coexistence of two different structures at Σ19b GBs (where Σ19 is the density of coincident sites and b is a GB variant), in agreement with evolutionary GB structure search and clustering analysis21,25,26. We also use finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations to explore the coexistence and transformation kinetics of these GB phases. Our results demonstrate how GB phases can be kinetically trapped, enabling atomic-scale room-temperature observations. Our work paves the way for atomic-scale in situ studies of metallic GB phase transformations, which were previously detected only indirectly9,15,27-29, through their influence on abnormal grain growth, non-Arrhenius-type diffusion or liquid metal embrittlement."
https://openalex.org/W3010823740,"The chromatin-remodelling complex SWI/SNF is highly conserved and has critical roles in various cellular processes, including transcription and DNA-damage repair1,2. It hydrolyses ATP to remodel chromatin structure by sliding and evicting histone octamers3-8, creating DNA regions that become accessible to other essential factors. However, our mechanistic understanding of the remodelling activity is hindered by the lack of a high-resolution structure of complexes from this family. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SWI/SNF bound to a nucleosome, at near-atomic resolution. In the structure, the actin-related protein (Arp) module is sandwiched between the ATPase and the rest of the complex, with the Snf2 helicase-SANT associated (HSA) domain connecting all modules. The body contains an assembly scaffold composed of conserved subunits Snf12 (also known as SMARCD or BAF60), Snf5 (also known as SMARCB1, BAF47 or INI1) and an asymmetric dimer of Swi3 (also known as SMARCC, BAF155 or BAF170). Another conserved subunit, Swi1 (also known as ARID1 or BAF250), resides in the core of SWI/SNF, acting as a molecular hub. We also observed interactions between Snf5 and the histones at the acidic patch, which could serve as an anchor during active DNA translocation. Our structure enables us to map and rationalize a subset of cancer-related mutations in the human SWI/SNF complex and to propose a model for how SWI/SNF recognizes and remodels the +1 nucleosome to generate nucleosome-depleted regions during gene activation9."

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the essential SWI/SNF complex RSC3 contains 16 subunits, including the ATP-dependent DNA translocase Sth14,5. RSC removes nucleosomes from promoter regions6,7 and positions the specialized +1 and -1 nucleosomes that flank NDRs8,9. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of RSC in complex with a nucleosome substrate. The structure reveals that RSC forms five protein modules and suggests key features of the remodelling mechanism. The body module serves as a scaffold for the four flexible modules that we call DNA-interacting, ATPase, arm and actin-related protein (ARP) modules. The DNA-interacting module binds extra-nucleosomal DNA and is involved in the recognition of promoter DNA elements8,10,11 that influence RSC functionality12. The ATPase and arm modules sandwich the nucleosome disc with the Snf2 ATP-coupling (SnAC) domain and the finger helix, respectively. The translocase motor of the ATPase module engages with the edge of the nucleosome at superhelical location +2. The mobile ARP module may modulate translocase-nucleosome interactions to regulate RSC activity5. The RSC-nucleosome structure provides a basis for understanding NDR formation and the structure and function of human SWI/SNF complexes that are frequently mutated in cancer13."

https://openalex.org/W3012476046,"When individuals learn from observing the behavior of others, they deploy at least two distinct strategies. Choice imitation involves repeating other agents' previous actions, whereas emulation proceeds from inferring their goals and intentions. Despite the prevalence of observational learning in humans and other social animals, a fundamental question remains unaddressed: how does the brain decide which strategy to use in a given situation? In two fMRI studies (the second a pre-registered replication of the first), we identify a neuro-computational mechanism underlying arbitration between choice imitation and goal emulation. Computational modeling, combined with a behavioral task that dissociated the two strategies, revealed that control over behavior was adaptively and dynamically weighted toward the most reliable strategy. Emulation reliability, the model's arbitration signal, was represented in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, and rostral cingulate cortex. Our replicated findings illuminate the computations by which the brain decides to imitate or emulate others."

As with any ecological survey, false negatives can arise during sampling and, if unaccounted for, lead to biased results and potentially misdiagnosed environmental assessments. We developed a multi-scale, multi-species occupancy model for the analysis of community biodiversity data resulting from eDNA metabarcoding; this model accounts for imperfect detection and additional sources of environmental and experimental variation. We present methods for model assessment and model comparison and demonstrate how these tools improve the inferential power of eDNA metabarcoding data using a case study in a coastal, marine environment. Using occupancy models to account for factors often overlooked in the analysis of eDNA metabarcoding data will dramatically improve ecological inference, sampling design, and methodologies, empowering practitioners with an approach to wield the high-resolution biodiversity data of next-generation sequencing platforms."

This study aimed to screen for sarcopenia and fall risk in a sample of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and to investigate demographic and clinical factors associated.This is a cross-sectional study. We evaluated 218 PD patients at the Movement Disorders Clinic in Fortaleza, Brazil, and collected clinical data including experiencing falls in the six months prior to their medical visit. Probable sarcopenia diagnosis was confirmed by using a sarcopenia screening tool (SARC-F questionnaire) and the presence of low muscle strength.One hundred and twenty-one patients (55.5%) were screened positive for sarcopenia using the SARC-F and 103 (47.4%) met the criteria for probable sarcopenia. Disease duration, modified Hoehn and Yahr stage, Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale score, levodopa equivalent dose, probable sarcopenia and positive SARC-F screening were all associated with experiencing falls. Disease duration, lower quality of life and female gender were independently associated with sarcopenia. Experiencing falls was significantly more frequent among patients screened positive in the SARC-F compared to those screened negative.Sarcopenia and PD share common pathways and may affect each other's prognosis and patients' quality of life. Since sarcopenia is associated with lower quality of life and increased risk of falls, active case finding, diagnosis and proper management of sarcopenia in PD patients is essential."
https://openalex.org/W3012502072,"Mutations in retinaldehyde-binding protein 1 (RLBP1), encoding the visual cycle protein cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP), cause an autosomal recessive form of retinal degeneration. By binding to 11-cis-retinoid, CRALBP augments the isomerase activity of retinoid isomerohydrolase RPE65 (RPE65) and facilitates 11-cis-retinol oxidation to 11-cis-retinal. CRALBP also maintains the 11-cis configuration and protects against unwanted retinaldehyde activity. Studying a sibling pair that is compound heterozygous for mutations in RLBP1/CRALBP, here we expand the phenotype of affected individuals, elucidate a previously unreported phenotype in RLBP1/CRALBP carriers, and demonstrate consistencies between the affected individuals and Rlbp1/Cralbp−/− mice. In the RLBP1/CRALBP-affected individuals, nonrecordable rod-specific electroretinogram traces were recovered after prolonged dark adaptation. In ultrawide-field fundus images, we observed radially arranged puncta typical of RLBP1/CRALBP-associated disease. Spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) revealed hyperreflective aberrations within photoreceptor-associated bands. In short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence (SW-AF) images, speckled hyperautofluorescence and mottling indicated macular involvement. In both the affected individuals and their asymptomatic carrier parents, reduced SW-AF intensities, measured as quantitative fundus autofluorescence (qAF), indicated chronic impairment in 11-cis-retinal availability and provided information on mutation severity. Hypertransmission of the SD-OCT signal into the choroid together with decreased near-infrared autofluorescence (NIR-AF) provided evidence for retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE) involvement. In Rlbp1/Cralbp−/− mice, reduced 11-cis-retinal levels, qAF and NIR-AF intensities, and photoreceptor loss were consistent with the clinical presentation of the affected siblings. These findings indicate that RLBP1 mutations are associated with progressive disease involving RPE atrophy and photoreceptor cell degeneration. In asymptomatic carriers, qAF disclosed previously undetected visual cycle deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3011433679,"Considering the complex nature of salinity tolerance mechanisms, the use of isogenic lines or mutants possessing the same genetic background albeit different tolerance to salinity is a suitable method for reduction of analytical complexity to study these mechanisms. In the present study, whole transcriptome analysis was evaluated using RNA-seq method between a salt-tolerant mutant line “M4-73-30” and its wild-type “Zarjou” cultivar at seedling stage after six hours of exposure to salt stress (300 mM NaCl). Transcriptome sequencing yielded 20 million reads for each genotype. A total number of 7116 transcripts with differential expression were identified, 1586 and 1479 of which were obtained with significantly increased expression in the mutant and the wild-type, respectively. In addition, the families of WRKY, ERF, AP2/EREBP, NAC, CTR/DRE, AP2/ERF, MAD, MIKC, HSF, and bZIP were identified as the important transcription factors with specific expression in the mutant genotype. The RNA-seq results were confirmed at several time points using qRT-PCR for some important salt-responsive genes. In general, the results revealed that the mutant accumulated higher levels of sodium ion in the root and decreased its transfer to the shoot. Also, the mutant increased the amount of potassium ion leading to the maintenance a high ratio [K+]/[Na+] in the shoot compared to its wild-type via fast stomata closure and consequently transpiration reduction under the salt stress. Moreover, a reduction in photosynthesis and respiration was observed in the mutant, resulting in utilization of the stored energy and the carbon for maintaining the plant tissues, which is considered as a mechanism of salt tolerance in plants. Up-regulation of catalase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase genes has resulted in higher accumulation of H2O2 in the wild-type compared to the mutant. Therefore, the wild-type initiated rapid ROS signals which led to less oxidative scavenging in comparison with the mutant. The mutant increased expression in the ion transporters and the channels related to the salinity to maintain the ion homeostasis. In overall, the results demonstrated that the mutant responded better to the salt stress under both osmotic and ionic stress phases and lower damage was observed in the mutant compared to its wild-type under the salt stress."
https://openalex.org/W3011418920,"The human pathogenic bacterium Clostridioides difficile produces two exotoxins TcdA and TcdB, which inactivate Rho GTPases thereby causing C. difficile-associated diseases (CDAD) including life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis. Hypervirulent strains produce additionally the binary actin ADP-ribosylating toxin CDT. These strains are hallmarked by more severe forms of CDAD and increased frequency and severity. Once in the cytosol, the toxins act as enzymes resulting in the typical clinical symptoms. Therefore, targeting and inactivation of the released toxins are of peculiar interest. Prompted by earlier findings that human α-defensin-1 neutralizes TcdB, we investigated the effects of the defensin on all three C. difficile toxins. Inhibition of TcdA, TcdB, and CDT was demonstrated by analyzing toxin-induced changes in cell morphology, substrate modification, and decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance. Application of α-defensin-1 protected cells and human intestinal organoids from the cytotoxic effects of TcdA, TcdB, CDT, and their combination which is attributed to a direct interaction between the toxins and α-defensin-1. In mice, the application of α-defensin-1 reduced the TcdA-induced damage of intestinal loops in vivo. In conclusion, human α-defensin-1 is a specific and potent inhibitor of the C. difficile toxins and a promising agent to develop novel therapeutic options against C. difficile infections."

Seventy-one women self-identified as nulliparous and meeting criteria for infertility. Participants were randomized to the internet-based version of the Mind/Body Program for Fertility or wait-list control group and asked to complete pre-, mid- and post-assessments. Primary outcomes include retention rates, number of modules completed, and satisfaction with intervention. Secondary exploratory outcomes sought to provide preliminary data on the impact of the program on distress (anxiety and depression) and self-reported pregnancy rates relative to a quasi-control group.The retention, adherence, and satisfaction rates were comparable to those reported in other internet-based RCTs. Although time between pre- and post-assessment differed between groups, using intent-to-treat analyses, women in the intervention group (relative to the wait-list group) had significant reduction in distress (anxiety, p = .003; depression, p = .007; stress, p = .041 fertility-social, p = .018; fertility-sexual, p = .006), estimated as medium-to-large effect sizes (ds = 0.45 to 0.86). The odds of becoming pregnant was 4.47 times higher for the intervention group participants as compared to the wait-list group, OR 95% CI [1.56, 12.85], p = .005 and occurred earlier.

https://openalex.org/W3010988898,"DNA damage accumulates in aged postmitotic retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, a phenomenon associated with the development of age-related macular degeneration. In this study, we have experimentally induced DNA damage by ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation in interleukin-1α (IL-1α)-primed ARPE-19 cells and examined inflammasome-mediated signaling. To reveal the mechanisms of inflammasome activation, cells were additionally exposed to high levels of extracellular potassium chloride, n-acetyl-cysteine, or mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoTEMPO, prior to UVB irradiation. Levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18) and IL-1β mRNAs were detected with qRT-PCR and secreted amounts of IL-1β, IL-18, and caspase-1 were measured with ELISA. The role of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat pyrin containing protein 3 (NLRP3) in UVB-induced inflammasome activation was verified by using the NLRP3-specific siRNA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured immediately after UVB exposure using the cell-permeant 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) indicator, the levels of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers were assayed by cell-based ELISA, and the extracellular levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) determined using a commercial bioluminescence assay. We found that pro-IL-18 was constitutively expressed by ARPE-19 cells, whereas the expression of pro-IL-1β was inducible by IL-1α priming. UVB induced the release of mature IL-18 and IL-1β but NLRP3 contributed only to the secretion of IL-1β. At the mechanistic level, the release of IL-1β was regulated by K+ efflux, whereas the secretion of IL-18 was dependent on ROS production. As well as K+ efflux, the cells released ATP following UVB exposure. Collectively, our data suggest that UVB clearly stimulates the secretion of mature IL-18 as a result of ROS induction, and this response is associated with DNA damage. Moreover, in human RPE cells, K+ efflux mediates the UVB-activated NLRP3 inflammasome signaling, leading to the processing of IL-1β."

Characterization of Ae. albopictus development under natural conditions is crucial for monitoring vector population expansion, dengue virus transmission, and disease outbreak preparedness.This study employed mosquito traits as a proxy to understanding life-table traits in mosquitoes using a semi-field study. Ae. albopictus larval and adult life-table experiments were conducted using microcosms under semi-field conditions in Guangzhou. Stage-specific development times and survivorship rates were determined and compared under semi-field conditions in different seasons from early summer (June) to winter (January), to determine the lower temperature limit for larval development and adult survivorship and reproductivity.The average egg- hatching rate was 60.1%, with the highest recorded in October (77.1%; mid-autumn). The larval development time was on average 13.2 days (range, 8.5-24.1 days), with the shortest time observed in September(8.7 days; early autumn) and longest in November (22.8 days). The pupation rates of Ae. albopictus larvae were on average 88.9% (range, 81.6-93.4%); they were stable from June to September but decreased from October to November. The adult emergence rates were on average 82.5% (range, 76.8-87.9%) and decreased from July to November. The median survival time of Ae. albopictus adults was on average 7.4 (range, 4.5-9.8), with the shortest time recorded in September. The average lifetime egg mass under semi-field conditions was 37.84 eggs/female. The larvae could develop into adults at temperatures as low as 12.3°C, and the adults could survive for 30.0 days at 16.3°C and still produce eggs. Overall, correlation analysis found that mean temperature and relative humidity were variables significantly affecting larval development and adult survivorship.Ae. albopictus larvae could develop and emerge and the adults could survive and produce eggs in early winter in Guangzhou. The major impact of changes in ambient temperature, relative humidity, and light intensity was on the egg hatching rates, adult survival time, and egg mass production, rather than on pupation or adult emergence rates."

The purpose of this study was to assess the levels of serum IGF-2 and its binding proteins IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-7 in schizophrenia patients and the associations of these proteins with schizophrenia psychopathology and cognitive deficits. Methods Thirty-two schizophrenia patients and 30 healthy controls were recruited. The PANSS and a neurocognitive test battery were used to assess schizophrenic symptomatology and cognition, respectively. Serum IGF-2, IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-7 levels were determined using ELISA. Results The schizophrenia patients had a much lower content of serum IGF-2, IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-7 than controls. For the patients, IGF-2 levels were negatively correlated with the PANSS negative scores and positively associated with working memory, attention, and executive function. The correlations between IGF-2 and the PANSS negative scores, working memory or executive function were still significant after controlling for age, sex, education level, BMI, illness history and age of onset. No significant associations of IGFBP-3 or IGFBP-7 with the PANSS scores and cognitive function were observed in the patients. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that serum IGF-2 was significantly correlated with negative and cognitive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, suggesting that altered IGF-2 signaling may be implicated in the psychopathology and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia."

Both phenotypic analysis and gas chromatography analysis indicated the synthesis and accumulation of biopolymers in S. meliloti and P. putida strains. Expression in S. meliloti resulted in the production of PLA homopolymer up to 3.2% dried cell weight (DCW). The quaterpolymer P (3HB-co-LA-co-3HHx-co-3HO) was produced by expression in P. putida. The P. putida phaC mutant strain produced this type of polymer the most efficiently with polymer content of 42% DCW when cultured in defined media with the addition of sodium octanoate. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of the production of a range of different biopolymers using the same plasmid-based system in different backgrounds.

https://openalex.org/W3010771336,"Obesity is a major health concern in many domesticated equids animals since it is related to metabolic abnormalities such as insulin dysregulation, hyperlipidaemia or laminitis. Ponies especially are known as ""easy keepers"" and are often affected by obesity and its related metabolic disorders. Research in the last decade indicated that the intestinal microbiota may play an important role in the development of obesity, at least in humans. Therefore, the objective of our study was to characterize changes in the faecal microbiota during a two-year weight gain programme which compared ponies and warmblood horses. For this purpose, 10 Shetland ponies and ten warmblood horses were fed a ration which provided 200% of their maintenance energy requirement over two years. Feed intake, body weight, body condition and cresty neck score were recorded weekly. At three standardized time points faecal samples were collected to characterize the faecal microbiota and its fermentation products such as short chain fatty acids and lactate. Next generation sequencing was used for the analysis of the faecal microbiota. During body weight gain the richness of the faecal microbiota decreased in ponies. Besides changes in the phylum Firmicutes in ponies that were already described in human studies, we found a decrease of the phylum Fibrobacteres in horses and an increase of the phylum Actinobacteria. We were also able to show that the phylum Fibrobacteres is more common in the microbiota of horses than in the microbiota of ponies. Therefore, the fibrolytic phylum Fibrobacteres seems to be an interesting phylum in the equine microbiota that should receive more attention in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3011145363,"Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) hexosylceramides and lactosylceramides are elevated in lupus mice and human patients with nephritis. Whereas other renal diseases characterized by increased GSL levels are thought to be a result of upregulated GSL synthesis, our results suggest elevated hexosylceramides and lactosylceramides in lupus nephritis is a result of increased catabolism of ganglioside GM3 due to significantly increased neuraminidase (NEU) activity. Thus, we hypothesized GM3 would be decreased in lupus nephritis kidneys and blocking NEU activity would reduce GSLs and improve disease in lupus mice. Female MRL/lpr lupus mice were treated with water or the NEU inhibitor oseltamivir phosphate at the onset of proteinuria to block GSL catabolism. Age-matched (non-nephritic) female MRL/MpJ lupus mice served as controls. Renal GM3 levels were significantly higher in the nephritic MRL/lpr water-treated mice compared to non-nephritic MRL/MpJ mice, despite significantly increased renal NEU activity. Blocking GSL catabolism increased, rather than decreased, renal and urine GSL levels and disease was not significantly impacted. A pilot study treating MRL/lpr females with GlcCer synthase inhibitor Genz-667161 to block GSL synthesis resulted in a strong significant negative correlation between Genz-667161 dose and renal GSL hexosylceramide and GM3 levels. Splenomegaly was negatively correlated and serum IgG levels were marginally correlated with increasing Genz-667161 dose. These results suggest accumulation of renal GM3 may be due to dysregulation of one or more of the GSL ganglioside pathways and inhibiting GSL synthesis, but not catabolism, may be a therapeutic approach for treating lupus nephritis."
https://openalex.org/W3011531336,"Background A novel indicator, ‘percentage of women of reproductive age who are sexually active and who have their demands for FP satisfied with modern contraceptive methods (mDFPS)’, was developed in 2012 to accelerate the reduction of unmet needs of family planning (FP). In Jordan, unmet needs for modern contraception remain high. To address this situation, this study measured the mDFPS and identified its associated factors in rural Jordan. Methods This cross-sectional study included married women of reproductive age (15–49 years) from ten villages in Irbid Governorate, Jordan, where advanced health facilities are difficult to reach. A two-stage stratified sampling with random sampling at the household stage was used for this field survey which was conducted between September and October 2016. Univariate analysis was used to assess the differences between mDFPS and unmet mDFPS groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the correlates of mDFPS. Results Of 1019 participants, 762 were identified as needing modern contraception. mDFPS coverage accounted for 54.7%. The most significant factors associated with mDFPS were the husband’s agreement on FP (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 15.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.26–45.25), knowledge of modern contraceptives (AOR: 8.76, 95% CI: 5.72–13.40), and lack of awareness of the high risk of conception in the postpartum period (AOR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.41–3.47). Duration of current residence, receipt of FP counselling at health centres and number of living children were also correlated. In addition, 95.3% of local women were aware of the presence of health centres that were mostly located in a 10-minute walking distance. Conclusion To increase mDFPS, this study suggested that accelerating male involvement in FP decision-making is necessary through community-based health education. Furthermore, expanding FP services in village health centres and improving the quality of FP counselling in public health facilities are required to correct misconceptions about modern methods among rural women."
https://openalex.org/W3011481003,"The transcription factor nuclear factor interleukin-3-regulated protein (NFIL3, also called E4BP4) is crucial for commitment of natural killer (NK) cells from common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs). However, the identity of the factor that can regulate NFIL3 directly during the NK-cell development is not known. Here, we reveal that pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1) can upregulate the NFIL3 expression directly. We used conditional knockout mice in which PBX1 in hematopoietic cells was specifically absent. The number of NK-committed progenitor pre-NKP cells and rNKP cells was reduced significantly in the absence of PBX1, which was consistent with NFIL3 deficiency. Also, the NFIL3 expression in NK cells was decreased if PBX1 was absent. We demonstrated that PBX1 was bound directly to the promoter of Nfil3 and facilitated transcription. Upon knockout of the binding site of PBX1 in the Nfil3 promoter, mice showed fewer NK-precursor cells and NK cells, just like that observed in Nfil3 knockout mice. Furthermore, asparagine N286 in the homeodomain of PBX1 controlled the binding of PBX1 to the Nfil3 promoter. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the transcription factor PBX1 promotes the early development of NK cells by upregulating the Nfil3 expression directly."
https://openalex.org/W3012220809,"The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is an allosteric enzyme critical for cellular events downstream of growth factor receptors. Mutations in the SHP2 gene have been linked to many different types of human diseases, including developmental disorders, leukemia, and solid tumors. Unlike most SHP2-activating mutations, the T507K substitution in SHP2 is unique in that it exhibits oncogenic Ras-like transforming activity. However, the biochemical basis of how the SHP2/T507K variant elicits transformation remains unclear. By combining kinetic and biophysical methods, X-ray crystallography, and molecular modeling, as well as using cell biology approaches, here we uncovered that the T507K substitution alters both SHP2 substrate specificity and its allosteric regulatory mechanism. We found that although SHP2/T507K exists in the closed, autoinhibited conformation similar to the WT enzyme, the interactions between its N-SH2 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase domains are weakened such that SHP2/T507K possesses a higher affinity for the scaffolding protein Grb2-associated binding protein 1 (Gab1). We also discovered that the T507K substitution alters the structure of the SHP2 active site, resulting in a change in SHP2 substrate preference for Sprouty1, a known negative regulator of Ras signaling and a potential tumor suppressor. Our results suggest that SHP2/T507K's shift in substrate specificity coupled with its preferential association of SHP2/T507K with Gab1 enable the mutant SHP2 to more efficiently dephosphorylate Sprouty1 at pTyr-53. This dephosphorylation hyperactivates Ras signaling, which is likely responsible for SHP2/T507K's Ras-like transforming activity."
https://openalex.org/W3012508721,"The flag leaf is the main organ of photosynthesis during grain-filling period of wheat, and flag leaf-related traits affect plant morphology and yield potential. In this study, two BC3F6 introgression line (IL) populations derived from the common recipient parent Lumai 14 with Jing 411 and Shaanhan 8675, respectively, were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for flag leaf length (FLL), flag leaf width (FLW), flag leaf area (FLA) and chlorophyll content (CC) at flowering stage and 15 and 20 days after anthesis (DAA) in 2016–2017 (E1) and 2017–2018 (E2) two environments. A total of 14 and 15 QTLs for flag leaf-related traits were detected in Lumai 14 / Jing 411 and Lumai 14 / Shaanhan 8675 populations, respectively. Among them, Both QFLW-6A and QFLA-6A were detected in Lumai 14 / Jing 411 population under E2 and in Lumai 14 / Shaanhan 8675 population under E1 and E2 environments, respectively. QCCS2-3A from Lumai 14 / Jing 411 population and QCCS3-1A, QFLL-4A and QFLL-6A from Lumai 14 / Shaanhan 8675 population were repeatedly identified under two tested environments. Moreover, eight QTL clusters controlling flag leaf-related traits were identified, which provided a genetic basis for significant correlations in phenotype among these traits. On the other hand, positive alleles of QFLW-6A for FLW detected in two populations were derived from their donors. Eighteen lines and 44 lines carried this QTL were found in Lumai 14 / Jing 411 and Lumai 14 / Shaanhan 8675 populations, respectively. The means of FLW in these lines were wider than that of the recipient parent, Lumai 14, in two environments, suggesting that QFLW-6A played an important role for increasing FLW. The IL 124 in Lumai 14 / Jing 411 population and the IL 59 and IL 127 in Lumai 14 / Shaanhan 8675 population had five, five and four donor chromosomal segments which carried no other QTL controlling FLW than QFLW-6A, respectively. And the FLWs of these lines were significantly greater than that of Lumai 14 under two environments. So these lines and their donor parent can be regarded as potential near-isogenic lines. Further, a synteny analysis found QFLW-6A was near the 574,283,851–574,283,613 bp fragment on chromosome 6A and 10 genes were in the range of 500 kb upstream and downstream of the fragment. These results provide the basis for identification of candidate gene and map-based cloning and functional verification of the QTL."
https://openalex.org/W3010751070,"Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) is an acidic, extracellular matrix protein essential for biomineralization of calcium phosphate, in bone and dentin. It is proteolytically processed into two fragments, 44K and 56K. Recently, the presence of DMP1 was noticed in inner ear, specifically in otoconia, which are calcium carbonate biominerals involved in sensing of balance. In this study, the solution structure and biomineralization activity of otoconial 44K and 56K fragments toward calcium carbonate were investigated. The results of analytical ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism, and gel filtration indicated that DMP1 fragments are disordered in solution. Notably, 56K formed oligomers in the presence of calcium ions. It was also observed that both fragments influenced the crystal growth by in vitro biomineralization assay and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, they sequester the calcium ions during the calcite formation. Calcium carbonate crystals precipitated in vitro changed their size and shape in the presence of DMP1 fragments. Oligomerization propensity of 56K may significantly enhance this function. Our study indicates that intrinsically disordered DMP1 has a previously unknown regulatory function for biomineralization of otoconia."
https://openalex.org/W3012117670,"Promoters are specified segments of DNA that lead to the initiation of transcription of a specific gene. The designing of a gene cassette for plant transformation is significantly dependent upon the specificity of a promoter. Constitutive Cauliflower mosaic virus promoter, CaMV35S, due to its developmental role, is the most commonly used promoter in plant transformation. While Gossypium hirsutum (Gh) being fiber-specific promoter (GhSCFP) specifically activates transcription in seed coat and fiber associated genes. The Expansin genes are renowned for their versatile roles in plant growth. The overexpression of Expansin genes has been reported to enhance fiber length and fineness. Thus, in this study, a local Cotton variety was transformed with Expansin (CpEXPA1) gene, in the form of two separate cassettes, each with a different promoter, named as 35SEXPA1 and FSEXPA1 expressed under CaMV35S and GhSCFP promoters respectively. Integration and Spatiotemporal relative expression of the transgene were studied in an advanced generation. GhSCFP bearing transgene expression was significantly higher in Cotton fiber than other plant parts. While transgene with CaMV35S promoter was found to be continually expressing in all tissues but the expression was lower in fiber than that expressed under GhSCFP. The temporal expression profile was quite interesting with a gradual increasing pattern of both constructs from 1DPA (days post anthesis) to 18DPA and decreased expression from 24 to 30 DPA. Besides the relative expression of promoters, fiber cellulose quantification and fluorescence intensity were also observed. The study significantly compared the two most commonly used promoters and it is deduced from the results that the GhSCFP promoter could be used more efficiently in fiber when compared with CaMV35S which being constitutive in nature preferred for expression in all parts of the plant."
https://openalex.org/W3012538080,"Background This study examined the psychometric properties of the Malay version of the decisional balance (DB-M) for exercise (i.e. perceived benefits and perceived barriers) using a cross-sectional design. Also, this study assessed the measurement and structural invariance of the DB-M across gender. Methods The study sample consisted of 750 students (female: 51.7%, male: 48.3%), with a mean age of 20.2 years (SD = 1.2). Decision balance (DB) scale was assessed with the 10-item DB-M. Standard forward-backward translation was performed to translate the English version of the DB into Malay version (DB-M). Results The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results based on the hypothesised measurement model of two factors and ten items demonstrated adequate factor structure after the addition of some correlated item residuals (comparative fit index (CFI) = .979, Tucker and Lewis index (TLI) = .969, standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) = .037, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .047). The construct reliability and average variance extracted values were .850 and .839, and .542 and .538, for perceived benefits and perceived barriers, respectively. Meanwhile, the Cronbach’s alpha was .857 and .859, and the intraclass correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability was .979 and .960 for perceived benefits and perceived barriers respectively. The findings provided evidence for measurement invariance of DB-M for the male and female samples. The final CFA model fit the data well for both male sample (CFI = .975, TLI = .964, SRMR = .040, RMSEA = .052) and female sample (CFI = .965, TLI = .949, SRMR = .044, RMSEA = .058). Conclusions The translated version of the DB-M was valid and reliable for assessing the level of perceived benefits and perceived barriers in exercise among university students in Malaysia."
https://openalex.org/W3010821911,"The present work is the first study of Mediterranean scallop (Pecten jacobaeus) biochemical properties, antioxidant defenses, and free radical scavengers during the yearly seasons in the Northern Adriatic, off Istria. Scallop nutrient reserves (glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol) in four tissues under examination were positively correlated and were predominant in digestive gland and gonad. The muscle energy maxima were in correlation with the maximum fall gonosomatic index (GSI), when diatoms and coccolithophorids thrive. The decrease of GSI in summer might be related to the spawning or resorption of gametes. Summer also revealed elevated levels of glucose in gonad and digestive gland, while muscle glucose and cholesterol significantly varied in spring vs. winter samples. In relation to the diatom seasonal abundance, carotenoids, namely astaxanthin peaks were found in digestive gland, which, being stimulators of calcium transport over cell membranes, could have contributed to the high digestive gland levels of calcium in winter. In winter, total antioxidative status (TAS) of scallop tissues was 3-fold higher than in other seasons, particularly in digestive gland, having a significant correlation with magnesium, a regulatory tool in oxidative processes. The winter maxima of TAS and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances TBARS in relation to summer maxima of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in digestive glands indicate to a decrease in antioxidant defense during cold months, and are related to the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products (such as malondialdehyde) in digestive gland of scallops. Although the increased susceptibility to oxidative stress could be attributed to winter temperature, other factors such as the gonad maturation, availability of food supply, and salinity might counteract that effect. The seawater alterations of salinity, temperature and water quality are in relation to the river Po influx, which is very likely to influence the physiological and biochemical responses of scallops in the Northern Adriatic."
https://openalex.org/W3012242834,"A connected component in a graph is a set of nodes linked to each other by paths. The problem of finding connected components has been applied to diverse graph analysis tasks such as graph partitioning, graph compression, and pattern recognition. Several distributed algorithms have been proposed to find connected components in enormous graphs. Ironically, the distributed algorithms do not scale enough due to unnecessary data IO & processing, massive intermediate data, numerous rounds of computations, and load balancing issues. In this paper, we propose a fast and scalable distributed algorithm PACC (Partition-Aware Connected Components) for connected component computation based on three key techniques: two-step processing of partitioning & computation, edge filtering, and sketching. PACC considerably shrinks the size of intermediate data, the size of input graph, and the number of rounds without suffering from load balancing issues. PACC performs 2.9 to 10.7 times faster on real-world graphs compared to the state-of-the-art MapReduce and Spark algorithms."

Among other voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, Cav3 channels are uniquely sensitive to oxidation and zinc. Using recombinant protein expression in HEK293 cells, patch clamp electrophysiology, site-directed mutagenesis, and homology modeling, we report here that modulation of Cav3.2 by redox agents and zinc is mediated by a unique extracellular module containing a high-affinity metal-binding site formed by the extracellular IS1–IS2 and IS3–IS4 loops of domain I and a cluster of extracellular cysteines in the IS1–IS2 loop. Patch clamp recording of recombinant Cav3.2 currents revealed that two cysteine-modifying agents, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) and N-ethylmaleimide, as well as a reactive oxygen species–producing neuropeptide, substance P (SP), inhibit Cav3.2 current to similar degrees and that this inhibition is reversed by a reducing agent and a zinc chelator. Pre-application of MTSES prevented further SP-mediated current inhibition. Substitution of the zinc-binding residue His191 in Cav3.2 reduced the channel's sensitivity to MTSES, and introduction of the corresponding histidine into Cav3.1 sensitized it to MTSES. Removal of extracellular cysteines from the IS1–IS2 loop of Cav3.2 reduced its sensitivity to MTSES and SP. We hypothesize that oxidative modification of IS1–IS2 loop cysteines induces allosteric changes in the zinc-binding site of Cav3.2 so that it becomes sensitive to ambient zinc.

Cav3 channels contain a number of extra- and intracellular cysteines that can be oxidized or reduced, depending on the local redox environment, which, in turn, could affect the conformation of the zinc-binding site.

In the former cell type, SP inhibits T-type Ca2+ current via oxidative modification of Cav3.2 (11Huang D. Huang S. Gao H. Liu Y. Qi J. Chen P. Wang C. Scragg J.L. Vakurov A. Peers C. Du X. Zhang H.

A mechanism of inhibition was proposed to be via enhancement of Zn2+ sensitivity of Cav3.2, whereby the oxidized channel is inhibited by nanomolar free Zn2+ present in the extracellular milieu (11Huang D. Huang S. Gao H. Liu Y. Qi J. Chen P. Wang C. Scragg J.L. Vakurov A. Peers C. Du X. Zhang H. Gamper N. Redox-dependent modulation of T-type Ca2+ channels in sensory neurons contributes to acute anti-nociceptive effect of substance P.Antioxid.

However, it is presently unknown how oxidation of Cav3.2 is translated into higher sensitivity to Zn2+. Cav3 channels have multiple extra- and intracellular cysteines accessible to redox modulation (Fig. 1A). To test whether cysteine modification is necessary for oxidative modulation of Cav3.2, we performed patch clamp experiments testing the effects of the cell-impermeable cysteine-modifying reagent sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSES; 2 mm) and the cell-permeable cysteine-modifying reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; 200 μm), on the recombinant Cav3.2 overexpressed in HEK293 cells together with the SP receptor NK1 (Fig. 1, B–J). MTSES (Fig. 1, B and C) and NEM (Fig. 1, D and E) inhibited the Cav3.2 current to similar levels, and inhibition was also similar in amplitude to that produced by the NK1-specific agonist [Sar9]-substance P (S9SP; 1 μm; Fig. 1, F–H). MTSES, NEM, and SP inhibited peak Cav3.2 current amplitude by 40.1% ± 3.5% (n = 9, p < 0.001), 36.1% ± 5.4% (n = 7, p < 0.001), and 40.1% ± 12.3% (n = 6, p < 0.05), respectively. The reducing agent DTT (1 mm), applied in the presence of MTSES, NEM, or SP (Fig. 1E), recovered most of the inhibitory action of the agents, although, in the case of NEM, recovery was incomplete (Fig. 1, F–H). Interestingly, when S9SP was applied after MTSES, it produced no further inhibition, suggestive of a common mechanism of action for both agents (Fig. 1, I and J). MTSES, NEM, or S9SP did not significantly affect the activation or inactivation kinetics of recombinant Cav3.2 (Table S1). It has been shown previously that Cav3.2 with the H191Q mutation in the high-affinity zinc-binding site displayed much lower sensitivity to SP (11Huang D. Huang S. Gao H. Liu Y. Qi J. Chen P. Wang C. Scragg J.L. Vakurov A. Peers C. Du X. Zhang H. Gamper N. Redox-dependent modulation of T-type Ca2+ channels in sensory neurons contributes to acute anti-nociceptive effect of substance P.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2016; 25 (27306612): 233-25110.1089/ars.2015.6560Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To examine whether His191 is important for the effect of MTSES, we tested its effect on the Cav3.2 (H191Q) mutant overexpressed in HEK293 cells together with NK1 receptors (Fig. 2, A and D). MTSES had only a modest inhibitory effect on Cav3.2 (H191Q) (23.1% ± 5.6%, n = 6, p < 0.01); inhibition was significantly reduced compared with WT Cav3.2 (Fig. 2D, p < 0.05). Moreover, MTSES-induced inhibition of Cav3.2 (H191Q) was no longer recoverable with DTT (Fig. 2, A and D). Cav3.1 subunit has glutamine instead of histidine in the position equivalent to 191 in Cav3.2 (position 172 in Cav3.1) and, hence, is much less sensitive to zinc (11Huang D. Huang S. Gao H. Liu Y.

Thus, we tested the effect of MTSES on WT Cav3.1 and the Cav3.1 (Q172H) mutant. MTSES produced only very modest inhibition of 9.3% ± 2.8% in WT Cav3.1 (n = 5, p < 0.05; Fig. 2, B and E). Strikingly, the MTSES effect on Cav3.1 (Q172H) currents was much stronger (inhibition of 36.9% ± 2.8%, n = 6, p < 0.001; Fig. 2, C and E). MTSES inhibition of Cav3.1 (Q172H) was comparable with that of WT Cav3.2 (cf. Figs. 2, C and E, and 1, B and C). The results further reinforce the hypothesis that oxidative modulation of Cav3 channels depends on the high-affinity zinc-binding site. To further probe the requirement of zinc for the effect of extracellular cysteine modification on Cav3 channel activity, we applied the zinc chelator N,N,N′, N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethy1) ethylenediamine (TPEN, 10 μm) before or after MTSES. The experiments presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that TPEN could totally recover the inhibition induced by MTSES on WT Cav3.2; thus, 2 mm MTSES inhibited the peak Cav3.2 current to 61.2% ± 8.7% of baseline, and TPEN applied in the presence of MTSES recovered the amplitude to 102.4% ± 5.5% of the baseline (n = 6; Fig. 3, A and C). Consistent with previous results, MTSES inhibition of the Cav3.2 (H191Q) mutant was much smaller (inhibition to 83.4% ± 1.7% of baseline, n = 8; Fig. 3, B and C), and this small inhibition was also recovered by TPEN (Fig. 3, B and C). Application of TPEN on its own (Fig. 3, D–F) did not significantly affect the amplitude of WT Cav3.2 or the H191Q mutant (some run-up of the current amplitude was observed in some recordings, but the effect did not reach significance). Importantly, in the presen"
https://openalex.org/W3012516097,"Hydroxysteroid (17β) dehydrogenase type 3 (HSD17B3) deficiency causes a disorder of sex development in humans, where affected males are born with female-appearing external genitalia, but are virilized during puberty. The hormonal disturbances observed in the Hsd17b3 knockout mice (HSD17B3KO), generated in the present study, mimic those found in patients with HSD17B3 mutations. Identical to affected humans, serum T in the adult HSD17B3KO mice was within the normal range, while a striking increase was detected in serum A-dione concentration. This resulted in a marked reduction of the serum T/A-dione ratio, a diagnostic hallmark for the patients with HSD17B3 deficiency. However, unlike humans, male HSD17B3KO mice were born with normally virilized phenotype, but presenting with delayed puberty. In contrast to the current belief, data from HSD17B3KO mice show that the circulating T largely originates from the testes, indicating a strong compensatory mechanism in the absence of HSD17B3. The lack of testicular malignancies in HSD17B3KO mice supports the view that testis tumors in human patients are due to associated cryptorchidism. The HSD17B3KO mice presented also with impaired Leydig cell maturation and signs of undermasculinization in adulthood. The identical hormonal disturbances between HSD17B3 deficient knockout mice and human patients make the current mouse model valuable for understanding the mechanism of the patient phenotypes, as well as endocrinopathies and compensatory steroidogenic mechanisms in HSD17B3 deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3010829649,"The ex situ population of fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus) has become increasingly important for the conservation of this species. Unfortunately, captivity-induced stress is a concern and potential factor for lack of breeding success in this small felid, resulting in an unsustainable population. The objectives of this study were to: 1) validate an enzyme immunoassay for monitoring of fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations in the fishing cat; 2) identify potential exogenous stressors in the captive environment; 3) pinpoint management techniques that may lower FGM concentrations; and 4) determine if FGM concentrations are related to breeding success. Through a successful adrenocorticotrophic hormone challenge and additional laboratory methods, a cortisol enzyme immunoassay was validated as an effective tool for detecting FGM in this species. Between 2010 and 2013, longitudinal FGM monitoring was conducted in 26 fishing cats in the North American Species Survival Plan®. Exogenous stressors that elevated FGM concentrations included: chemical immobilizations; permanent transfers between facilities; construction; facility events; and fights/aggression among breeding pairs. Management factors that lowered FGM concentrations included: increased animal-keeper interaction through formal training; and providing indoor, off-exhibit, holding areas. In addition, social housing of individuals (either established breeding pairs or same sex pairs) decreased FGM concentrations. Individuals with breeding success (defined as observed copulations during the study period) also had lower FGM concentrations than unsuccessful individuals. Findings indicate that management factors play a role in lowering glucocorticoid (stress) levels in fishing cats, which may ultimately affect breeding success in the ex situ population."
https://openalex.org/W3011723848,"Objective Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with adverse outcomes in the general population, but its impact on patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the association between AF and risks of all-cause mortality and stroke in Chinese adults with CKD. Methods We enrolled adults aged 45 years or older with CKD (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and/or proteinuria identified using the urine dipstick method) from the Kailuan study between 2008 and 2014. AF was identified by 12-lead electrocardiography or hospital discharge diagnostic codes. Mortality data were collected from the provincial vital statistics, and physician-diagnosed ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke was confirmed in the biennial interview. Results Among the 21587 CKD adults, 216 patients were identified with AF, the median follow-up duration was 5.21 years (5.69 ± 1.96 years); During follow-up, there were 70 cases of death, and 16 cases of ischemic stroke and 6 cases of hemorrhagic stroke in the participants with AF in comparison with 2572 cases of death and 656 cases of ischemic stroke and 184 cases of hemorrhagic stroke among the participants without AF. After adjustment for potential confounders, AF was associated with an 86% increase in the rate of death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33–2.59, P<0.001), a 104% (HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.09–3.83, P = 0.026) and 325% (HR, 4.25; 95% CI, 1.74–10.36, P = 0.001) increase in the rate of ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. These associations were still consistent and strong after propensity score-matched analysis. Conclusion Our study shows that AF is independently associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in Chinese CKD adults. Future studies are required to elucidate the physiological mechanisms underlying this association."
https://openalex.org/W3011173130,"Several pathological conditions predict the use of glucocorticoids for the management of the inflammatory response; however, chronic or high dose glucocorticoid treatment is associated with hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance and can be considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the vascular responsiveness and inflammatory profile of mesenteric arteries of rats treated with high doses of glucocorticoids. Wistar rats were divided into a control (CO) group and a dexamethasone (DEX) group, that received dexamethasone for 7 days (2mg/kg/day, i.p.). Blood samples were used to assess the lipid profile and insulin tolerance. Vascular reactivity to Phenylephrine (Phe) and insulin, and O2•-production were evaluated. The intracellular insulin signaling pathway PI3K/AKT/eNOS and MAPK/ET-1 were investigated. Regarding the vascular inflammatory profile, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-18 were assessed. Dexamethasone-treated rats had decreased insulin tolerance test and endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced by insulin. eNOS inhibition caused vasoconstriction in the DEX group, which was abolished by the ET-A antagonist. Insulin-mediated relaxation in the DEX group was restored in the presence of the O2.- scavenger TIRON. Nevertheless, in the DEX group there was an increase in Phe-induced vasoconstriction. In addition, the intracellular insulin signaling pathway PI3K/AKT/eNOS was impaired, decreasing NO bioavailability. Regarding superoxide anion generation, there was an increase in the DEX group, and all measured proinflammatory cytokines were also augmented in the DEX group. In addition, the DEX-group presented an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and total cholesterol (TC) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) levels. In summary, treatment with high doses of dexamethasone promoted changes in insulin-induced vasodilation, through the reduction of NO bioavailability and an increase in vasoconstriction via ET-1 associated with generation of O2•- and proinflammatory cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W3011324104,"In this study, two parasites on the fins of Homatula variegata were recorded from March to September 2016. A dissection mirror was used to examine the distribution and quantity of the ectoparasitic Gyrodactylus sp. and Paragyrodactylus variegatus on the host Homatula variegata in different seasons. The present study explored possible explanations for the site specificity of gyrodactylid parasites in 442 Homatula variegata infected with 4307 Gyrodactylus sp. (species identification is incomplete, only characterized to the genus level) and 1712 Paragyrodactylus variegatus. These two gyrodactylid parasites were collected from fish fins, and the fish were harvested in China's Qinling Mountains.The results indicated that the highest number of Gyrodactylus sp., which was numerically the dominant species, appeared on the fish fins in April, while the highest number of Paragyrodactylus variegatus was found on the fish fins in March. The two parasite species appeared to be partitioned spatially, with Gyrodactylus sp. occurring more frequently on pectoral and pelvic fins, and P. variegatus occurring more frequently on caudal fins. However, Gyrodactylus sp. appeared to occur on fish of all lengths, while P. variegatus tended to occur more abundantly on shorter fish rather than on longer fish. At lower Gyrodactylus sp. infection levels (<100), the pelvic and pectoral fins were the main locations of attachment, followed by the dorsal fin. For infections of more than 100 parasites, more samples of Gyrodactylus sp. were located on the pectoral fin. For a low number of Paragyrodactylus variegatus infections (<100), the pelvic and pectoral fins were the preferred locations of attachment, followed by the caudal fin. Between April and September, there were many monogenean parasites on fish fins, and the fish size was within the range of 5–10 cm. However, when a fish was longer than 10 cm long, the number of parasites on its fins greatly decreased."
https://openalex.org/W3011413573,"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) was the standard of care for patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prior to the PACIFIC trial, however, patients also received single modality therapy. This study identified predictors of therapy and differences in overall survival (OS).This retrospective study included stage III NSCLC patients aged ≥65 years, with ≥1 claim for systemic therapy (ST) or radiotherapy (RT) within 90 days of diagnosis, identified in SEER-Medicare data (2009-2014). Patients who had overlapping claims for chemotherapy and RT ≤90 days from start of therapy were classified as having received cCRT. Patients who received sequential CRT or surgical resection of tumor were excluded. Predictors of cCRT were analyzed using logistic regression. OS was compared between therapies using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.Of 3,799 patients identified, 21.7% received ST; 26.3% received RT; and 52.0% received cCRT. cCRT patients tended to be younger (p <0.001), White (p = 0.002), and have a good predicted performance status (p<0.001). Patients who saw all three specialist types (medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and surgeon) had increased odds of receiving cCRT (p<0.001). ST and RT patients had higher mortality risk versus cCRT patients (hazard ratio [95% CI]: ST: 1.38 [1.26-1.51]; RT: 1.75 [1.61, 1.91]); p<0.001).Several factors contributed to treatment selection, including patient age and health status, and whether the patient received multidisciplinary care. Given the survival benefit of receiving cCRT over single-modality therapy, physicians should discuss treatment within a multidisciplinary team, and be encouraged to pursue cCRT for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3011577531,"Reproducibility of results is essential for a well-designed and conducted experiment. Several reasons may originate failure in reproducing data, such as selective reporting, low statistical power, or poor analysis. In this study, we used PEG6000 samples from different distributors and tested their capability inducing spheroid formation upon surface coating. MALDI-MS, NMR, FTIR, and Triple SEC analysis of the different PEG60000s showed nearly identical physicochemical properties different, with only minor differences in mass and hydrodynamic radius, and AFM analysis showed no significant differences in the surface coatings obtained with the available PEG6000s. Despite these similarities, just one showed a highly reproducible formation of spheroids with different cell lines, such as HT-29, HeLa, Caco2, and PANC-1. Using the peculiar PEG6000 sample and a reference PEG6000 chosen amongst the others as control, we tested the effect of the cell/PEG interaction by incubating cells in the PEG solution prior to cell plating. These experiments indicate that the spheroid formation is due to direct interaction of the polymer with the cells rather than by interaction of cells with the coated surfaces. The experiments point out that for biological entities, such as cells or tissues, even very small differences in impurities or minimal variations in the starting product can have a very strong impact on the reproducibility of data."
https://openalex.org/W3012074516,"The aim of this study was to analyse and quantify the acute effects of competition on several performance factors in under-19 male soccer players. To this end, 198 national league players (17.56 ± 0.78 years) performed various tests to measure jump capacity, kicking velocity and sprint times immediately pre-match (T1), at half-time (T2) and post-match (T3). Tests included kicking the ball to measure ball velocity (KICK), sprinting for 40 meters, timing the first 30 meters (30mACCEL), the last 10 meters (10mACCEL) and the total distance (40mACCEL), and performing countermovement jumps (CMJ). For subsequent analysis, the sample was divided into 5 playing positions: goalkeepers (n = 24), defenders (n = 51), midfielders (n = 36), wingers (n = 54) and forwards (n = 33). For all positions, we found a significant decline in performance (p<0.05) for kicking velocity (2.91% - 6.51%) and sprinting (0.44%-5.85%). For the CMJ, all positions except defenders presented a significant decline in performance that ranged from 1.5% to 4.56%. These findings highlight the need to individualise fitness training, taking into account the match needs and demands of the different playing positions in order to minimise the effects of match fatigue and accelerate post-match recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3011175774,"We analyzed protein expression data for Lupus patients, which have been obtained from publicly available databases. A combination of systems biology and statistical thermodynamics approaches was used to extract topological properties of the associated protein-protein interaction networks for each of the 291 patients whose samples were used to provide the molecular data. We have concluded that among the many proteins that appear to play critical roles in this pathology, most of them are either ribosomal proteins, ubiquitination pathway proteins or heat shock proteins. We propose some of the proteins identified in this study to be considered for drug targeting."
https://openalex.org/W3011786526,"Although swimming is recognized as a symmetrical sport, equivalence between each body side cannot be insured. Swimmers with physical and motor impairment may present asymmetries that are even more pronounced. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the symmetry of temporal coordination in the front crawl stroke phases and their dimensional characteristics among swimmers of different levels of skill and disabled swimmers. Forty-one swimmers (28 men and 13 women, 18,8 ± 3,3 years, divided 21 of them into groups of high and low level of skill and 20 in disabled swimmers group) performed a 50m maximum of front-crawl test while they were recorded by six synchronized cameras (four underwater and two above water) for analysis of the stroke phases, stroke dimensions (anteroposterior, mediolateral and vertical amplitude), index of coordination and hand speed. The symmetry index was calculated by the difference between the right and the left strokes. Comparisons were made using the Kruskal-Wallis test and multivariate comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney test, with p <0.05. Asymmetry was noted in anteroposterior and mediolateral amplitudes of the stroke, index of coordination, duration of the recovery phase, each of the underwater phases and in the hand speed during the downseep phase, regardless of the level of skill or impairment. The disabled swimmers also showed asymmetry in the vertical amplitude of the stroke as well as in the insweep and upsweep speed. The reasons for these asymmetries may be the preference for unilateral breathing, force imbalance between pairs of homologous muscles and motor control deficit. The training with stereotypic movements may explain the similarity of asymmetries among the different groups of swimmers."
https://openalex.org/W3010983127,"This single-institution cross-sectional study aimed to grasp the prevalence and features of neurocognitive dysfunction in HIV-infected hemophilia patients in Japan. We conducted neuropsychological tests and medical examinations in 56 HIV-infected hemophilia patients who received outpatient treatment at the AIDS Clinical Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine. A total of 388 HIV-infected non-hemophilia patients who received outpatient treatment at the same institution were included as a control group. To investigate sites responsible for neurocognitive dysfunction in HIV-infected hemophilia patients using brain FDG-PET/CT scans, the accumulation of FDG in each brain region was compared. Approximately 50% of HIV-infected hemophilia patients had neurocognitive dysfunction. The prevalence of asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment was high (34%). Neurocognitive dysfunction was associated with educational level in HIV-infected hemophilia patients. In the symptomatic group, hemophilic arthropathy and history of cerebrovascular disorders were associated with neurocognitive dysfunction. Left temporal lobe function was reduced in the symptomatic group."
https://openalex.org/W3010705198,"Background Whiplash-associated disorders have been the subject of much attention in the scientific literature and remain a major public health problem. Objective Measure the impact of a validated information booklet on the fear-avoidance beliefs of emergency physicians and their approach to management regarding the treatment of whiplash-associated disorders. Methods A prospective cluster randomized controlled study conducted with a sample of emergency medicine physicians. Fear-avoidance beliefs were measured using The Whiplash Belief Questionnaire (WBQ) and Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ). We assessed the approach to management based on the prescription of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments based on the advice given to patients. The validated information booklet was the French version of The Whiplash Book. A set of questionnaires was sent to participants pre- and post-intervention. The experimental intervention was the provision of The Whiplash Book. The control arm did not receive any training or information. Results Mean fears and beliefs scores on inclusion were high: WBQ = 19.09 (± 4.06); physical activity FABQ = 11.45 (± 4.73); work FABQ = 13.85 (± 6.70). Improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs scores being greater in the intervention group was further confirmed by the variation in WBQ (-20 [-32; -6] vs. -6 [-16; 9]; p = 0.06), physical activity FABQ (-70 [-86; -50] vs. -15 [-40; 11]; p < 0.001), and work FABQ (-40 [-71; 0] vs. 0 [-31; 50]; p = 0.02). The emergency physicians' initial approach to management was not consistent with current guidelines. Reading the French version of The Whiplash Book could contribute to changing their approach to management in several areas on intra-group analysis. Conclusion The French version of The Whiplash Book positively influenced fear-avoidance beliefs among emergency physicians."
