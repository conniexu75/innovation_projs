https://openalex.org/W2999681746,"Single-cell analyses have revealed extensive heterogeneity between and within human tumours1–4, but complex single-cell phenotypes and their spatial context are not at present reflected in the histological stratification that is the foundation of many clinical decisions. Here we use imaging mass cytometry5 to simultaneously quantify 35 biomarkers, resulting in 720 high-dimensional pathology images of tumour tissue from 352 patients with breast cancer, with long-term survival data available for 281 patients. Spatially resolved, single-cell analysis identified the phenotypes of tumour and stromal single cells, their organization and their heterogeneity, and enabled the cellular architecture of breast cancer tissue to be characterized on the basis of cellular composition and tissue organization. Our analysis reveals multicellular features of the tumour microenvironment and novel subgroups of breast cancer that are associated with distinct clinical outcomes. Thus, spatially resolved, single-cell analysis can characterize intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity in a disease-relevant manner, with the potential to inform patient-specific diagnosis. A single-cell, spatially resolved analysis of breast cancer demonstrates the heterogeneity of tumour and stroma tissue and provides a more-detailed method of patient classification than the current histology-based system."

Here we report a striking buildup of lipid droplets in microglia with aging in mouse and human brains. These cells, which we call 'lipid-droplet-accumulating microglia' (LDAM), are defective in phagocytosis, produce high levels of reactive oxygen species and secrete proinflammatory cytokines. RNA-sequencing analysis of LDAM revealed a transcriptional profile driven by innate inflammation that is distinct from previously reported microglial states. An unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 screen identified genetic modifiers of lipid droplet formation; surprisingly, variants of several of these genes, including progranulin (GRN), are causes of autosomal-dominant forms of human neurodegenerative diseases. We therefore propose that LDAM contribute to age-related and genetic forms of neurodegeneration."

We characterize optic nerve photographs of 67,040 UK Biobank participants and use a multitrait genetic model to identify risk loci for glaucoma. A glaucoma polygenic risk score (PRS) enables effective risk stratification in unselected glaucoma cases and modifies penetrance of the MYOC variant encoding p.Gln368Ter, the most common glaucoma-associated myocilin variant. In the unselected glaucoma population, individuals in the top PRS decile reach an absolute risk for glaucoma 10 years earlier than the bottom decile and are at 15-fold increased risk of developing advanced glaucoma (top 10% versus remaining 90%, odds ratio = 4.20). The PRS predicts glaucoma progression in prospectively monitored, early manifest glaucoma cases (P = 0.004) and surgical intervention in advanced disease (P = 3.6 × 10-6). This glaucoma PRS will facilitate the development of a personalized approach for earlier treatment of high-risk individuals, with less intensive monitoring and treatment being possible for lower-risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2998859344,"Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells are an
 effective treatment for B-cell lymphoma, but often cause neurologic toxicity. We
 treated 20 patients with B-cell lymphoma on a phase I, first-in-human clinical trial
 of T cells expressing the new anti-CD19 CAR Hu19-CD828Z (
 NCT02659943
 ). The primary objective was to assess safety and feasibility of
 Hu19-CD828Z T-cell therapy. Secondary objectives included assessments of blood
 levels of CAR T cells, anti-lymphoma activity, second infusions and immunogenicity.
 All objectives were met. Fifty-five percent of patients who received Hu19-CD828Z T
 cells obtained complete remission. Hu19-CD828Z T cells had clinical anti-lymphoma
 activity similar to that of T cells expressing FMC63-28Z, an anti-CD19 CAR tested
 previously by our group, which contains murine binding domains and is used in
 axicabtagene ciloleucel. However, severe neurologic toxicity occurred in only 5% of
 patients who received Hu19-CD828Z T cells, whereas 50% of patients who received
 FMC63-28Z T cells experienced this degree of toxicity (P = 0.0017). T cells expressing Hu19-CD828Z released lower levels of
 cytokines than T cells expressing FMC63-28Z. Lower levels of cytokines were detected
 in blood from patients who received Hu19-CD828Z T cells than in blood from those who
 received FMC63-28Z T cells, which could explain the lower level of neurologic
 toxicity associated with Hu19-CD828Z. Levels of cytokines released by CAR-expressing
 T cells particularly depended on the hinge and transmembrane domains included in the
 CAR design. In a first-in-human, phase I trial in patients with B-cell lymphoma,
 CD19 CAR T cells with fully human binding domains exhibit lower neurologic toxicity,
 but similar clinical activity, to previously tested CD19 CAR T cells with murine
 binding domains."

https://openalex.org/W2998852785,"Increased production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) can ameliorate the severity of sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia1. BCL11A represses the genes encoding HbF and regulates human hemoglobin switching through variation in its expression during development2-7. However, the mechanisms underlying the developmental expression of BCL11A remain mysterious. Here we show that BCL11A is regulated at the level of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation during human hematopoietic development. Despite decreased BCL11A protein synthesis earlier in development, BCL11A mRNA continues to be associated with ribosomes. Through unbiased genomic and proteomic analyses, we demonstrate that the RNA-binding protein LIN28B, which is developmentally expressed in a pattern reciprocal to that of BCL11A, directly interacts with ribosomes and BCL11A mRNA. Furthermore, we show that BCL11A mRNA translation is suppressed by LIN28B through direct interactions, independently of its role in regulating let-7 microRNAs, and that BCL11A is the major target of LIN28B-mediated HbF induction. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism underlying human hemoglobin switching that illuminates new therapeutic opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W3000075214,"Understanding how oncogenic mutations rewire regulatory-protein networks is important for rationalizing the mechanisms of oncogenesis and for individualizing anticancer treatments. We report a chemical phosphoproteomics method to elucidate the topology of kinase-signaling networks in mammalian cells. We identified >6,000 protein phosphorylation sites that can be used to infer >1,500 kinase-kinase interactions and devised algorithms that can reconstruct kinase network topologies from these phosphoproteomics data. Application of our methods to primary acute myeloid leukemia and breast cancer tumors quantified the relationship between kinase expression and activity, and enabled the identification of hitherto unknown kinase network topologies associated with drug-resistant phenotypes or specific genetic mutations. Using orthogonal methods we validated that PIK3CA wild-type cells adopt MAPK-dependent circuitries in breast cancer cells and that the kinase TTK is important in acute myeloid leukemia. Our phosphoproteomic signatures of network circuitry can identify kinase topologies associated with both phenotypes and genotypes of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W3000124408,"Neuronal computations underlying higher brain functions depend on synaptic interactions among specific neurons. A mechanistic understanding of such computations requires wiring diagrams of neuronal networks. In this study, we examined how the olfactory bulb (OB) performs ‘whitening’, a fundamental computation that decorrelates activity patterns and supports their classification by memory networks. We measured odor-evoked activity in the OB of a zebrafish larva and subsequently reconstructed the complete wiring diagram by volumetric electron microscopy. The resulting functional connectome revealed an over-representation of multisynaptic connectivity motifs that mediate reciprocal inhibition between neurons with similar tuning. This connectivity suppressed redundant responses and was necessary and sufficient to reproduce whitening in simulations. Whitening of odor representations is therefore mediated by higher-order structure in the wiring diagram that is adapted to natural input patterns. The authors measure evoked activity and perform dense reconstruction of the olfactory bulb wiring diagram in a zebrafish larva, uncovering a mechanism for whitening, a computation that decorrelates activity for pattern classification by memory networks."
https://openalex.org/W3002188137,"Reperfusion of the ischemic intestine often leads to drive distant organ injury, especially injuries associated with hepatocellular dysfunction. The precise molecular mechanisms and effective multiple organ protection strategies remain to be developed. In the current study, significant remote liver dysfunction was found after 6 hours of reperfusion according to increased histopathological scores, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, as well as enhanced bacterial translocation in a rat intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury model. Moreover, receptor-interacting protein kinase 1/3 (RIP1/3) and phosphorylated-MLKL expressions in tissue were greatly elevated, indicating that necroptosis occurred and resulted in acute remote liver function impairment. Inhibiting the necroptotic pathway attenuated HMGB1 cytoplasm translocation and tissue damage. Meanwhile, macrophage-depletion study demonstrated that Kupffer cells (KCs) are responsible for liver damage. Blocking HMGB1 partially restored the liver function via suppressed hepatocyte necroptosis, tissue inflammation, hepatic KCs, and circulating macrophages M1 polarization. What’s more, HMGB1 neutralization further protects against intestinal I/R-associated liver damage in microbiota-depleted rats. Therefore, intestinal I/R is likely associated with acute liver damage due to hepatocyte necroptosis, and which could be ameliorated by Nec-1 administration and HMGB1 inhibition with the neutralizing antibody and inhibitor. Necroptosis inhibition and HMGB1 neutralization/inhibition, may emerge as effective pharmacological therapies to minimize intestinal I/R-induced acute remote organ dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W3000091990,"Reward-evoked dopamine transients are well established as prediction errors. However, the central tenet of temporal difference accounts—that similar transients evoked by reward-predictive cues also function as errors—remains untested. In the present communication we addressed this by showing that optogenetically shunting dopamine activity at the start of a reward-predicting cue prevents second-order conditioning without affecting blocking. These results indicate that cue-evoked transients function as temporal-difference prediction errors rather than reward predictions. Maes et al. use second-order conditioning, blocking and optogenetic inhibition to show that cue-evoked dopamine transients function as temporal-difference prediction errors rather than reward predictions."
https://openalex.org/W3101983566,"Dualities are mathematical mappings that reveal unexpected links between apparently unrelated systems or quantities in virtually every branch of physics. Systems that are mapped onto themselves by a duality transformation are called self-dual and they often exhibit remarkable properties, as exemplified by an Ising magnet at the critical point. In this Letter, we unveil the role of dualities in mechanics by considering a family of so-called twisted Kagome lattices. These are reconfigurable structures that can change shape thanks to a collapse mechanism easily illustrated using LEGO. Surprisingly, pairs of distinct configurations along the mechanism exhibit the same spectrum of vibrational modes. We show that this puzzling property arises from the existence of a duality transformation between pairs of configurations on either side of a mechanical critical point. This critical point corresponds to a self-dual structure whose vibrational spectrum is two-fold degenerate over the entire Brillouin zone. The two-fold degeneracy originates from a general version of Kramers theorem that applies to classical waves in addition to quantum systems with fermionic time-reversal invariance. We show that the vibrational modes of the self-dual mechanical systems exhibit non-Abelian geometric phases that affect the semi-classical propagation of wave packets. Our results apply to linear systems beyond mechanics and illustrate how dualities can be harnessed to design metamaterials with anomalous symmetries and non-commuting responses."
https://openalex.org/W3001267181,"Biomedical research training has undergone considerable change over the past several years. At its core, the goal of graduate and postdoctoral training is to provide individuals with the skills and knowledge to become outstanding scientists and expand knowledge through the scientific method. Historically, graduate school training has focused on preparation for academic positions. Increasingly, however, a shift toward preparation for a wider range of career options has emerged. This is largely because most biomedical PhD graduates do not become Principal Investigators in academic laboratories. Here we describe an National Institutes of Health Common Fund program with the major goal of culture change for biomedical research training and training that prepares individuals for a broader expanse of careers in the biomedical research enterprise. These “Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training” (BEST) awards, issued in 2012 and 2013, provided support to institutions to develop innovative approaches to achieving these goals, as a complement to traditional training. Awardees were tasked with catalyzing change at their institutions and sharing best practices across the training community. Awardees were required to participate in a cross-site evaluation that assessed the impact of BEST activities on three main areas: (a) trainee confidence and knowledge to make career decisions, (b) influence of this added activity on time in training, and (c) ability of the institutions to sustain activities deemed to be beneficial. Here we present the fundamental approach to the BEST program and early evaluative data."
https://openalex.org/W3001520065,"A long-standing mystery shrouds the mechanism by which catalytically repressed receptor tyrosine kinase domains accomplish transphosphorylation of activation loop (A-loop) tyrosines. Here we show that this reaction proceeds via an asymmetric complex that is thermodynamically disadvantaged because of an electrostatic repulsion between enzyme and substrate kinases. Under physiological conditions, the energetic gain resulting from ligand-induced dimerization of extracellular domains overcomes this opposing clash, stabilizing the A-loop-transphosphorylating dimer. A unique pathogenic fibroblast growth factor receptor gain-of-function mutation promotes formation of the complex responsible for phosphorylation of A-loop tyrosines by eliminating this repulsive force. We show that asymmetric complex formation induces a more phosphorylatable A-loop conformation in the substrate kinase, which in turn promotes the active state of the enzyme kinase. This explains how quantitative differences in the stability of ligand-induced extracellular dimerization promotes formation of the intracellular A-loop-transphosphorylating asymmetric complex to varying extents, thereby modulating intracellular kinase activity and signaling intensity. X-ray crystallography, solution NMR and biochemical and cell-based analyses reveal a model where catalytically repressed receptor tyrosine kinases accomplish activation loop (A-loop) tyrosine transphosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W3002320125,"Quorum sensing is a bacterial communication process whereby bacteria produce, release, and detect extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers to coordinate collective behaviors. In the pathogen Vibrio cholerae, the quorum-sensing autoinducer 3,5-dimethyl-pyrazin-2-ol (DPO) binds the receptor and transcription factor VqmA. The DPO-VqmA complex activates transcription of vqmR, encoding the VqmR small RNA, which represses genes required for biofilm formation and virulence factor production. Here, we show that VqmA is soluble and properly folded and activates basal-level transcription of its target vqmR in the absence of DPO. VqmA transcriptional activity is increased in response to increasing concentrations of DPO, allowing VqmA to drive the V. cholerae quorum-sensing transition at high cell densities. We solved the DPO-VqmA crystal structure to 2.0 Å resolution and compared it with existing structures to understand the conformational changes VqmA undergoes upon DNA binding. Analysis of DPO analogs showed that a hydroxyl or carbonyl group at the 2'-position is critical for binding to VqmA. The proposed DPO precursor, a linear molecule, N-alanyl-aminoacetone (Ala-AA), also bound and activated VqmA. Results from site-directed mutagenesis and competitive ligand-binding analyses revealed that DPO and Ala-AA occupy the same binding site. In summary, our structure-function analysis identifies key features required for VqmA activation and DNA binding and establishes that, whereas VqmA binds two different ligands, VqmA does not require a bound ligand for folding or basal transcriptional activity. However, bound ligand is required for maximal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2999911279,"Allosteric modulators of ion channels typically alter the transitions rates between conformational states without changing the properties of the open pore. Here we describe a new class of positive allosteric modulators of N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) that mediate a calcium-permeable component of glutamatergic synaptic transmission and play essential roles in learning, memory and cognition, as well as neurological disease. EU1622-14 increases agonist potency and channel-open probability, slows receptor deactivation and decreases both single-channel conductance and calcium permeability. The unique functional selectivity of this chemical probe reveals a mechanism for enhancing NMDAR function while limiting excess calcium influx, and shows that allosteric modulators can act as biased modulators of ion-channel permeation."
https://openalex.org/W3002162346,"Introduction Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are global public health problems. In its severe form it may cause hospital admission, morbidity and mortality. Early reporting of suspected ADRs to regulatory authorities is known to be appropriate measure toinsure health and safety of public form such adverse drug reaction of drugs. In Addis Ababa, there is limited information on ADR reporting practices among medical doctors. Hence, this study aimed to assess ADR reporting practices and associated factors among doctors in government hospitals in Addis Ababa. Methods An institution based cross-sectional mixed-methods study design was used. Data werecollected from 407 doctors using self-administered questionnaire and five key informants using semi-structured questionnaire from October 01 to December 31, 2017. Binary logistic regression and thematic analysis methods for quantitative and qualitative data analysis were used respectively. Results Only 94(27.4%) of doctors had ever reported ADRs to national pharmacovigilance center. The study showed that sex (AOR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.76–7.03), level ofeducation (AOR = 5.01, 95% CI: 2.23–11.28), work experience (AOR = 4.59, 95% CI: 1.21–17.40), existence of ADR reporting form (AOR = 3.96, 95% CI: 1.07–14.61) and reporting to respective marketing authorization holders (AOR = 21.41, 95% CI: 5.89–77.88) were significantly associated with ADR reporting practices. Poor awareness and training on risk of under-reporting, feeling that reporting is minor, absence of appropriate reporting tools, delay and/or absence of feedback on reported ADRs, overly burdened doctors, negligence, fear of legal liabilityand communication gap were cited by key informants as barriers for reporting practice. Conclusions Adverse drug reaction reporting practice among doctors wasfound to be low. Sex, level of education, work experience, existence of reporting form and reporting to marketing authorization holderswere significantly associated with ADR reporting practice. In addition, there are gaps in availabilities of guidelines, reporting systems and structure, pre-service and in-service training, and awareness of doctors on impact of reporting. Hence, improving access to ADR reporting form, decentralize safety monitoring system, and conducting awareness training on ADR reporting are essential to improve the ADR reporting practice."
https://openalex.org/W3000812022,"In developing follicles, the granulosa cells (GCs) live in a hypoxic environment due to the devoid of blood supply. Upon hypoxic conditions, several types of mammalian cells have been reported to undergo apoptosis. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is known as the primary survival factor for antral follicles by preventing GCs apoptosis. Mitophagy is a type of organelle-specific autophagy that removes damaged or stressed mitochondria to maintain cellular health. This study provides the first evidence suggesting that FSH-mediated mitophagy protected porcine GCs from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Our data showed that the GCs apoptosis caused by mitochondrial pathway upon hypoxia stress was markedly attenuated after FSH treatment, which was correlated with enhanced activation of mitophagy. Interestingly, FSH also stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis as suggested by increased expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A and nuclear respiratory factor 1 during hypoxia exposure. Notably, the protein level of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) was significantly increased in hypoxic GCs following FSH treatment, accompanied by elevated mitophagic activity and dampened apoptotic signaling. Blocking HIF-1α inhibited mitophagy and restored hypoxia-induced apoptosis despite FSH treatment. Importantly, FSH promoted the expression of serine/threonine kinase PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and the E3 ligase Parkin during hypoxia stress through a HIF-1α dependent manner. This induced the mitophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria, hence inhibiting apoptosis by reducing cytochrome c releasing. The inhibition of HIF-1α and/or PINK1 using inhibitor or RNAi further confirmed the role of the FSH-HIF-1α-PINK1-Parkin-mitophagy axis in suppressing GC apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. These findings highlight a novel function of FSH in preserving GCs viability against hypoxic damage by activating HIF-1α-PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy."
https://openalex.org/W3000899691,"TYK2 belongs to the JAK protein tyrosine kinase family and mediates signaling of numerous antiviral and immunoregulatory cytokines (type I and type III IFNs, IL-10, IL-12, IL-22, IL-23) in immune and non-immune cells. After many years of genetic association studies, TYK2 is recognized as a susceptibility gene for some inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (AID). Seven TYK2 variants have been associated with AIDs in Europeans, and establishing their causality remains challenging. Previous work showed that a protective variant (P1104A) is hypomorphic and also a risk allele for mycobacterial infection. Here, we have studied two AID-associated common TYK2 variants: rs12720270 located in intron 7 and rs2304256, a non-synonymous variant in exon 8 that causes a valine to phenylalanine substitution (c.1084 G > T, Val362Phe). We found that this amino acid substitution does not alter TYK2 expression, catalytic activity or ability to relay signaling in EBV-B cell lines or in reconstituted TYK2-null cells. Based on in silico predictions that these variants may impact splicing of exon 8, we: i) analyzed TYK2 transcripts in genotyped EBV-B cells and in CRISPR/Cas9-edited cells, ii) measured splicing using minigene assays, and iii) performed eQTL (expression quantitative trait locus) analysis of TYK2 transcripts in primary monocytes and whole blood cells. Our results reveal that the two variants promote the inclusion of exon 8, which, we demonstrate, is essential for TYK2 binding to cognate receptors. In addition and in line with GTEx (Genetic Tissue Expression) data, our eQTL results show that rs2304256 mildly enhances TYK2 expression in whole blood. In all, these findings suggest that these TYK2 variants are not neutral but instead have a potential impact in AID."

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are novel noncoding RNAs that play a crucial role in plant responses to abiotic stress. However, how LP stress mediates the biogenesis of circRNAs in soybean remains unclear. Here, to explore the response mechanisms of circRNAs to LP stress, the roots of two representative soybean genotypes with different P-use efficiency, Bogao (a LP-sensitive genotype) and Nannong 94156 (a LP-tolerant genotype), were used for the construction of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries and circRNA identification. In total, 371 novel circRNA candidates, including 120 significantly differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs, were identified across different P levels and genotypes. More DE circRNAs were significantly regulated by LP stress in Bogao than in NN94156, suggesting that the tolerant genotype was less affected by LP stress than the sensitive genotype was; in other words, NN94156 may have a better ability to maintain P homeostasis under LP stress. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between the expression patterns of P stress-induced circRNAs and their circRNA-host genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these circRNA-host genes and microRNA (miRNA)-targeted genes indicated that these DE circRNAs were involved mainly in defense responses, ADP binding, nucleoside binding, organic substance catabolic processes, oxidoreductase activity, and signal transduction. Together, our results revealed that LP stress can significantly alter the genome-wide profiles of circRNAs and indicated that the regulation of circRNAs was both genotype and environment specific in response to LP stress. LP-induced circRNAs might provide a rich resource for LP-responsive circRNA candidates for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3001144863,"Sepsis is a leading cause of death worldwide and recent studies have shown white adipose tissue (WAT) to be an important regulator in septic conditions. In the present study, the role of the inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its structural homolog D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT/MIF-2) were investigated in WAT in a murine endotoxemia model. Both MIF and MIF-2 levels were increased in the peritoneal fluid of LPS-challenged wild-type mice, yet, in visceral WAT, the proteins were differentially regulated, with elevated MIF but downregulated MIF-2 expression in adipocytes. Mif gene deletion polarized adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype while Mif-2 gene knockout drove ATMs toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype and Mif-deficiency was found to increase fibroblast viability. Additionally, we observed the same differential regulation of these two MIF family proteins in human adipose tissue in septic vs healthy patients. Taken together, these data suggest an inverse relationship between adipocyte MIF and MIF-2 expression during systemic inflammation, with the downregulation of MIF-2 in fat tissue potentially increasing pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization to further drive adipose inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3001342088,"Colorectal cancer remains a deadly cancer due to metastatic disease. To understand the molecular mechanisms of metastasis in colon cancer, we investigated whether the copper chaperone antioxidant-1 (Atox1) protein plays a role in this process. Recent findings indicate that Atox1 protein has transcription factor activities and plays a vital role in cell proliferation in cancer cells. However, the role of Atox1 in metastasis has not been examined.Atox1 expression was determined by immunofluorescence in a tissue microarray generated from a spectrum of CRC patients. Subcellular fractionation of colon cancer cell lines SW480 and SW620 cells was used to examine the cellular location of Atox1 in the face of activin A, a cytokine that stimulates colon cancer metastasis. Atox1 expression was genetically manipulated and cellular migration measured through trans-well assay and proliferation measured by colony formation assays.Here we demonstrate that in patients with metastatic colon cancer, there is a significant increase in the expression of nuclear Atox1. Interestingly, the metastatic CRC cell line SW620 has increased nuclear localization of Atox1 compared to its related non-metastatic cell line SW480. Further, inhibition of endogenous Atox1 by siRNA in SW620 decreased colony formation and reactive oxygen species generation via decreased expression of Atox1 targets cyclin D1 and NADPH oxidase subunit p47 phox, respectively. Additionally, overexpression of nuclear-targeted but not copper binding domain-mutated Atox1 in SW480 cells increased colony formation and cell migration that was further augmented by activin A stimulation, a known enhancer of colon cancer metastasis.Our findings suggest that nuclear Atox1 might be a new therapeutic target as well as a new biomarker for metastatic colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3002858922,"Continuous fixed-bed column studies were carried out, utilizing acorn shell from Quercus crassipes Humb. & Bonpl. (QCS), in order to remove total chromium and Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. Effects of various fixed-bed column parameters such as influent solution pH, influent flow rate, QCS bed height, and influent Cr(VI) concentration were investigated. Results from the fixed-bed column experiments demonstrate that total chromium biosorption and Cr(VI) removal by QCS depend strongly on the pH of influent solution. The highest capacities for Cr(VI) removal and total chromium biosorption are about 181.56 and 110.35 mg g-1 and are achieved at influent solution pH of 1.0 and 2.0, respectively. Besides this, total chromium biosorption capacities increased from 104.25 to 116.14 mg g-1, 109.07 to 117.44 mg g-1, and 85.02 to 129.87 mg g-1, as bed height, inlet flow rate, and influent Cr(VI) concentration increased from 1.7 to 6.5 cm, 0.25 to 1 mL min-1, and 50 to 400 mg L-1, respectively. The dose-response model defines the entire breakthrough curve for total chromium biosorption onto QCS, under all experimental conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and biosorption kinetic studies revealed that QCS is able to remove toxic Cr(VI) from acidic liquid solution by means of a complex mechanism that involves the binding of Cr(VI) oxyanions to positively charged groups present at the QCS surface, after which the Cr(VI) species are reduced to Cr(III) by adjacent electron donor groups, and the generated Cr(III) ions then become partially bound to the QCS biomass and partially released into the liquid phase. Results show that QCS can be employed as an easily accessible, abundant, eco-friendly, and inexpensive biosorbent for the removal of total chromium and Cr(VI) from Cr(VI) solutions, in continuous operation."
https://openalex.org/W3000750025,"The discovery of the IDH1 R132H (IDH1 mut) mutation in low-grade glioma and the associated change in function of the IDH1 enzyme has increased the interest in glioma metabolism. In an earlier study, we found that changes in expression of genes involved in the aerobic glycolysis and the TCA cycle are associated with IDH1 mut. Here, we apply proteomics to FFPE samples of diffuse gliomas with or without IDH1 mutations, to map changes in protein levels associated with this mutation. We observed significant changes in the enzyme abundance associated with aerobic glycolysis, glutamate metabolism, and the TCA cycle in IDH1 mut gliomas. Specifically, the enzymes involved in the metabolism of glutamate, lactate, and enzymes involved in the conversion of α-ketoglutarate were increased in IDH1 mut gliomas. In addition, the bicarbonate transporter (SLC4A4) was increased in IDH1 mut gliomas, supporting the idea that a mechanism preventing intracellular acidification is active. We also found that enzymes that convert proline, valine, leucine, and isoleucine into glutamate were increased in IDH1 mut glioma. We conclude that in IDH1 mut glioma metabolism is rewired (increased input of lactate and glutamate) to preserve TCA-cycle activity in IDH1 mut gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W3001298707,"Background We aimed to explore clinicians’ communication, including the discussion of diagnosis, cause, prognosis and care planning, in routine post-diagnostic testing consultations with patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Methods Thematic content analysis was used to analyze audiotaped consultations in which 10 clinicians (eight neurologists and two geriatricians) from 7 memory clinics, disclosed diagnostic information to 13 MCI patients and their care partners. We assessed clinician-patient communication regarding diagnostic label, cause, prognosis and care planning to identify core findings. Results Core findings were: clinicians 1) differed in how they informed about the MCI label; 2) tentatively addressed cause of symptoms; 3) (implicitly) steered against further biomarker testing; 4) rarely informed about the patient’s risk of developing dementia; 5) often informed about the expected course of symptoms emphasizing potential symptom stabilization and/or improvement, and; 6) did not engage in a conversation on long-term (care) planning. Discussion Clinicians’ information provision about the underlying cause, prognosis and implications for long-term (care) planning in MCI could be more specific. Since most patients and care partners have a strong need to understand the patient’s symptoms, and for information on the prognosis and implications for the future, clinicians’ current approach may not match with those needs."
https://openalex.org/W3002411178,"Animal cells express heparan sulfate proteoglycans that perform many important cellular functions by way of heparan sulfate–protein interactions. The identification of membrane heparan sulfate–binding proteins is challenging because of their low abundance and the need for extensive enrichment. Here, we report a proteomics workflow for the identification and characterization of membrane-anchored and extracellular proteins that bind heparan sulfate. The technique is based on limited proteolysis of live cells in the absence of denaturation and fixation, heparin-affinity chromatography, and high-resolution LC-MS/MS, and we designate it LPHAMS. Application of LPHAMS to U937 monocytic and primary murine and human endothelial cells identified 55 plasma membrane, extracellular matrix, and soluble secreted proteins, including many previously unidentified heparin-binding proteins. The method also facilitated the mapping of the heparin-binding domains, making it possible to predict the location of the heparin-binding site. To validate the discovery feature of LPHAMS, we characterized one of the newly-discovered heparin-binding proteins, C-type lectin 14a (CLEC14A), a member of the C-type lectin family that modulates angiogenesis. We found that the C-type lectin domain of CLEC14A binds one-to-one to heparin with nanomolar affinity, and using molecular modeling and mutagenesis, we mapped its heparin-binding site. CLEC14A physically interacted with other glycosaminoglycans, including endothelial heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate E, but not with neutral or sialylated oligosaccharides. The LPHAMS technique should be applicable to other cells and glycans and provides a way to expand the repertoire of glycan-binding proteins for further study. Animal cells express heparan sulfate proteoglycans that perform many important cellular functions by way of heparan sulfate–protein interactions. The identification of membrane heparan sulfate–binding proteins is challenging because of their low abundance and the need for extensive enrichment. Here, we report a proteomics workflow for the identification and characterization of membrane-anchored and extracellular proteins that bind heparan sulfate. The technique is based on limited proteolysis of live cells in the absence of denaturation and fixation, heparin-affinity chromatography, and high-resolution LC-MS/MS, and we designate it LPHAMS. Application of LPHAMS to U937 monocytic and primary murine and human endothelial cells identified 55 plasma membrane, extracellular matrix, and soluble secreted proteins, including many previously unidentified heparin-binding proteins. The method also facilitated the mapping of the heparin-binding domains, making it possible to predict the location of the heparin-binding site. To validate the discovery feature of LPHAMS, we characterized one of the newly-discovered heparin-binding proteins, C-type lectin 14a (CLEC14A), a member of the C-type lectin family that modulates angiogenesis. We found that the C-type lectin domain of CLEC14A binds one-to-one to heparin with nanomolar affinity, and using molecular modeling and mutagenesis, we mapped its heparin-binding site. CLEC14A physically interacted with other glycosaminoglycans, including endothelial heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate E, but not with neutral or sialylated oligosaccharides. The LPHAMS technique should be applicable to other cells and glycans and provides a way to expand the repertoire of glycan-binding proteins for further study.

HSPGs perform many functions in cells mediated to a large extent by the capacity of the heparan sulfate (HS) chains to interact with other proteins. HSPGs can tether and present cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and morphogens (1Xu D. Esko J.D. Demystifying heparan sulfate–protein interactions.Annu. Rev.

They can also act as a template to lower the concentration of growth factors required for signaling and to increase the duration of signaling. Binding of HS to proteases and protease inhibitors can lead to allosteric activation or inhibition of enzyme activity, for example in the activation of antithrombin and inhibition of Factors II and X in the coagulation cascade (2Björk I.

HS also can induce oligomerization of soluble and membrane proteins (3Xu D. Young J.H. Krahn J.M. Song D. Corbett K.D. Chazin W.J. Pedersen L.C. Esko J.D.

The size of the endothelial “HS-interactome,” i.e. the repertoire of heparan sulfate-binding proteins (HSBPs) on the surface and surrounding extracellular matrix of endothelial cells, is unknown in part due to technical challenges in working with membrane proteins and protein complexes. Previous attempts to elucidate the interactome using live cells and tissue extracts often enriched intracellular proteins, such as DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, which bind ligands that have charge characteristics similar to heparan sulfate. To circumvent these problems, preparative steps involving purification of plasma membranes have been applied to cells and tissues (10Ori A. Wilkinson M.C. Fernig D.G. A systems biology approach for the investigation of the heparin/heparan sulfate interactome.J. Biol.

Cell-surface biotinylation strategies coupled with streptavidin enrichment prior to affinity chromatography also have proven useful in studies of cultured cells (10Ori A. Wilkinson M.C. Fernig D.G.

Often, the proteins identified were nuclear or cytoplasmic components. Heparan sulfate–binding membrane proteins were difficult to identify because of their low abundance and the need for detergents or prior enrichment techniques. In this report, we describe a new simple proteomics strategy to identify plasma membrane and extracellular HSBPs that also permits the simultaneous determination of the binding domains that interact with heparin/heparan sulfate. The workflow combines Limited Proteolysis in the absence of denaturation, Heparin-Affinity chromatography, and high-resolution LC-MS/MS proteomics (LPHAMS). Application of LPHAMS to endothelial cells led to the identification of known HSBPs, including membrane receptors, secreted proteins, and extracellular matrix proteins, along with a set of previously unknown HSBPs. As a validation of LPHAMS, we characterized the heparin-binding properties of CLEC14A, a previously undocumented membrane HSBP involved in angiogenesis. This report lays the groundwork for screening and identifying not only HSBPs and their binding site, but other classes of glycan-binding proteins. Limited proteolysis is a powerful tool to map conformational features of proteins. By using suboptimal conditions for proteolysis (limiting enzyme, reduced temperature, and omission of reducing agents and denaturants), limited cleavage occurs at exposed hinges or loops resulting in the liberation of intact protein domains (13Hubbard S.J. The structural aspects of limited proteolysis of native proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382 (9540791): 191-20610.1016/S0167-4838(97)00175-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 14Fontana A. de Laureto P.P. Spolaore B. Frare E. Picotti P. Zambonin M.

When applied to cells, limited proteolysis can be used to isolate and purify ectodomains of cell-surface transmembrane proteins, their subdomains, and subdomains of extracellular matrix and associated secreted proteins (15Olaya-Abril A. Jiménez-Munguía I. Gómez-Gascón L. Rodríguez-Ortega M.J. Surfomics: shaving live organisms for a fast proteomic identification of surface proteins.J. Proteomics. 2014; 97 (23624344): 164-17610.1016/j.jprot.2013.03.035Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that analysis of these liberated domains by chromatography on heparin-affinity resin would identify potential HSBPs and enrich for HS-binding domains, potentially indicating sites of contact between the protein and the ligand (Fig. 1A). To establish the feasibility of the approach, we treated confluent monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with varying concentrations of proteinase K and chymotrypsin (see under “Experimental procedures”). The extent of proteolysis was monitored by SDS-PAGE and silver staining of released proteolytic fragments. Conditions were empirically adjusted to shift the pattern of bands on the gel from the pattern obtained for samples treated with buffer, but not to the extent that all of the material migrated as low molecular weight peptides. To enrich for HSBPs, we subjected the samples to heparin-affinity chromatography. Heparin is structurally related to HS, although it is more highly sulfated, enriched in iduronic acid, and more highly-negatively charged. Its commercial availability makes it an inexpensive surrogate for HS. Samples obtained after proteolytic digestion or mock digestions with PBS were bound to heparin-Sepharose, and weakly-bound proteins were washed out with low ionic strength buffer (0.3 m NaCl in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2)). Strongly-bound proteins were eluted with buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The eluted material was then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. As described above, the overall method was designated LPHAMS. To assess the feasibility and dynamic range of LPHAMS, HUVEC were first treated with proteinase K or chymotrypsin for 10 min at room temperature (see under “Experimental procedures”). Proteolytic fragments were collected and analyzed by the LPHAMS workflow. Proteomic characterization of the material displaying high affinity to heparin yielded numerous candidate HSBPs at 1% false discovery rate (FDR). All identified proteins were filtered based on the presence of at least two MS/MS counts for each identified peptide. Protein identifications were also filtered based on the presence of signal peptides (membrane and secreted proteins) and subcellular localization deduced via database searches and manual curation of the literature. Using these criteria, a total of 32 cell-surface or extracellular proteins were confidently identified in five independent experiments using proteinase K or chymotrypsin (Table S1). They included known HSBPs, such as thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) (16Dixit V.M. Grant G.A. Santoro S.A. Frazier W.A.

Previously unknown HSBPs were also detected, including C-type lectin domain family 14 member A (CLEC14A), tyrosine receptor phosphatase β (PTPRβ), lysyl oxidase–like protein 2 (LOXL2), transmembrane protein 132 (TMEM132A), growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), adhesion G-protein–coupled receptor L2 (ADGRL2), and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 3DL2 (KIR3DLR2). We performed MS analysis at each step in the purification scheme and aligned identified peptides from known heparin-binding proteins to their respective protein sequence. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a 349-amino acid protein composed of four domains: an insulin-like growth factor–binding protein; a von Willebrand factor type C domain (VWFC); a thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSP1); and a cystine-knot domain (CTCK) (Fig. 1B) (21Ball D.K. Rachfal A.W. Kemper S.A. Brigstock D.R. The heparin-binding 10-kDa fragment of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) containing module 4 alone stimulates cell adhesion.J. Endocrinol. 2003; 176 (12553878): R1-R710.1677/joe.0.176r001Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Peptides identified in the input and flow-through fractions originated from the VWFC domain, whereas peptides identified in the high-salt eluate were aligned to the heparin-binding CTCK domain (Fig. 1B). In the case of HHIP, peptides from the high-salt eluate aligned to the frizzled-like domain and two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with the observation that heparin binding occurs in the N-terminal frizzled-like domain (19Holtz A.M. Griffiths S.C. Davis S.J. Bishop B. Siebold C. Allen B.L. Secreted HHIP1 interacts with heparan sulfate and regulates Hedgehog ligand localization and function.J.

For THBS1, identified peptides from the input and flow-through aligned outside of the heparin-binding domain whereas peptides identified in the 0.3 m wash and high-salt eluate localized to the heparin-binding N-terminal thrombospondin domain (Fig. 1D) (17Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Wang J.H. Lawler J. The structures of the thrombospondin-1 N-terminal domain and its complex with a synthetic pentameric heparin.Structure. 2006; 14 (16407063): 33-4210.1016/j.str.2005.09.017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Tan K.

These findings show that the partial proteolysis released subdomains of accessible proteins and that fractionation of the released material by heparin-affinity chromatography enriched for subdomains that map to the heparin-binding site. To examine the dynamic range of LPHAMS, we plotted the protein counts as a function of their normalized label-free intensities (Fig. 1, E and F). Interestingly, known HSBPs such as THBS1, HHIP, and CTGF displayed high intensities, whereas other low-abundant HSBPs, such as SDF1 and ADAMTS4, occurred at lower intensities. Many of the newly-identified, putative HSBPs also occurred at low intensities as well, which may explain why previous methods failed to detect them. Compared with chymotrypsin treatment, proteinase K treatment of HUVEC resulted in higher protein recovery based on protein intensities and consequently in more protein identifications (Fig. 1 F). We next applied LPHAMS to mouse lung microvascular endothelial cells (MLEC), mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells, and U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells, which yielded 9, 12, and 20 HSBPs, respectively (Table 1 and Table S1). Of these proteins, unique HSBPs such as interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL1R1), transmembrane channel-like protein 5 (TMC5), and amyloid precursor like protein 2 (APLP2) were identified. Several proteins were shared between cell lines, whereas others were unique as might be expected given the diversity of protein expression across cell types (Table 1). In total, 55 HSBPs were identified, including 30 HSBPs not previously known to bind to heparin. About half of the proteins identified by LPHAMS were secreted soluble proteins or extracellular matrix proteins. Presumably, many of the soluble proteins were present in the extracellular matrix or bound to the cell surface, given that the cells were only gently rinsed with PBS prior to limited proteolysis. Twelve type I, one type II, two polytopic, and one glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane proteins were identified in this way (Table 1). Thus, LPHAMS has the capacity to identify a broad range of membrane-associated and extracellular proteins, and the technique can be applied to different cell types.Table 1Heparin-binding proteins identified by LPHAMSIDSymbolaProteins with a predicted Cardin-Weintraub sequence are shown.Protein nameLocationCellular sourceHeparin bindingQ80WJ7MTDHaProteins with a predicted Cardin-Weintraub sequence are shown.,bData contain a predicted turn-based motif.Protein LYRIC (metadherin)Type II transmembraneMLEC?P13504IL1R1AInterleukin-1 receptor type 1Type I transmembraneBMEC?Q86T13CLEC14AC-type lectin domain family 14 member AType I transmembraneHUVEC?P43630KIR3DL2Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 3DL2Type I transmembraneHUVEC?P23467–3PTPRBReceptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase βType I transmembraneHUVEC?Q24JP5TMEM132ATransmembrane protein 132AType I transmembraneHUVEC?P17948FLT1aProteins with a predicted Cardin-Weintraub sequence are shown.Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1Type I transmembraneHUVEC/BMECYes (20Park M.

https://openalex.org/W3000973352,"Fragility fractures are related to the loss of bone integrity and deteriorated morphology of osteocytes. Our previous studies have reported that low-magnitude high-frequency vibration (LMHFV) promoted osteoporotic fracture healing. As osteocytes are known for mechanosensing and initiating bone repair, we hypothesized that LMHFV could enhance osteoporotic fracture healing through enhancing morphological changes in the osteocyte lacuna-canalicular network (LCN) and mineralization. A metaphyseal fracture model was established in female Sprague-Dawley rats to investigate changes in osteocytes and healing outcomes from early to late phase post-fracture. Our results showed that the LCN exhibited an exuberant outgrowth of canaliculi in the osteoporotic fractured bone at day 14 after LMHFV. LMHFV upregulated the E11, dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), but downregulated sclerostin (Sost) in osteocytes. Moreover, LMHFV promoted mineralization with significant enhancements of Ca/P ratio, mineral apposition rate (MAR), mineralizing surface (MS/BS), and bone mineral density (BMD) in the osteoporotic group. Consistently, better healing was confirmed by microarchitecture and mechanical properties, whereas the enhancement in osteoporotic group was comparable or even greater than the normal group. This is the first report to reveal the enhancement effect of LMHFV on the osteocytes' morphology and functions in osteoporotic fracture healing."
https://openalex.org/W3001325600,"There is currently no effective treatment for promoting regeneration of injured nerves in patients who have sustained injury to the central nervous system such as spinal cord injury. Chondroitinase ABC is an enzyme, which promotes neurite outgrowth and regeneration. It has shown considerable promise as a therapy for these conditions. The aim of the study is to determine if targeting chondroitinase ABC expression to the neuronal axon can further enhance its ability to promote axon outgrowth. Long-distance axon regeneration has not yet been achieved, and would be a significant step in attaining functional recovery following spinal cord injury.To investigate this, neuronal cultures were transfected with constructs encoding axon-targeted chondroitinase, non-targeted chondroitinase or GFP, and the effects on neuron outgrowth and sprouting determined on substrates either permissive or inhibitory to neuron regeneration. The mechanisms underlying the observed effects were also explored. Targeting chondroitinase to the neuronal axon markedly enhances its ability to promote neurite outgrowth. The increase in neurite length is associated with an upregulation of β-integrin staining at the axonal cell surface. Staining for phosphofocal adhesion kinase, is also increased, indicating that the β-integrins are in an activated state. Expression of chondroitinase within the neurons also resulted in a decrease in expression of PTEN and RhoA, molecules which present a block to neurite outgrowth, thus identifying two of the pathways by which ChABC promotes neurite outgrowth.The novel finding that targeting ChABC to the axon significantly enhances its ability to promote neurite extension, suggests that this may be an effective way of promoting long-distance axon regeneration following spinal cord injury. It could also potentially improve its efficacy in the treatment of other pathologies, where it has been shown to promote recovery, such as myocardial infarction, stroke and Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W3002310966,"Minimizing the number of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) can reduce patient burden. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate whether physical therapists (PTs) can estimate psychological PROM scores in patients with low back pain (LBP) through physical therapy evaluation. The secondary aims were; 1) to investigate whether the clinical experiences of PTs influence correlations between PT estimates and psychological PROM scores, and 2) to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of PT estimates for the psychological features detected by the PROMs. We recruited hospitalized patients owing to LBP, who underwent evaluation by PTs on the initial day of hospitalization. Patients completed PROMs, including the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale immediately before the initial physical therapy session. PTs rated the magnitude of patient kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS; 0 = not detected at all, 10 = very highly detected) through physical therapy evaluation immediately after the initial session. The PTs were blinded to the PROM results. We categorized PTs into two subgroups (PTs with ≥4 years and those with <4 years of clinical experience). Data from 78 patients (mean [SD] age = 60.5 [16.3] years) and 21 PTs were analyzed. A statistically significant but weak correlation (P = .04, Spearman’s ρ = .24) was detected only in the total PCS scores and PT NRS scores in a dataset of all patients and PTs. Further, there were no statistically significant differences in correlations (all P >.05) between the two subgroups of PTs in all measures. Low sensitivity and high specificity of PT estimates for psychological features through physical therapy evaluation were identified in all PROMs when PT NRS scores were categorized into the binary score by 5 (negative: <5; positive: ≥5)."
https://openalex.org/W3002633544,"Yellow laccases lack the typical blue type 1 Cu absorption band around 600 nm; however, multi-copper oxidases with laccase properties have been reported. We provide the first evidence that the yellow laccase isolated from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is obtained from a blue form by covalent, but nevertheless reversible modification with a phenolic product. After separating the phenolics from the extracellular medium, a typical blue laccase is obtained. With ABTS as model substrate for this blue enzyme, a non-natural purple adduct is formed with a spectrum nearly identical to that of the 1:1 adduct of an ABTS radical and Tyr. This modification significantly increases the stability and substrate affinity of the enzyme, not by acting primarily as bound mediator, but by structural changes that also alters the type 1 Cu site. The HPLC-MS analyses of the ABTS adduct trypsin digests revealed a distinct tyrosine within a unique loop as site involved in the modification of the blue laccase form. Thus, S. sclerotiorum yellow laccase seems to be an intrinsically blue multi-copper oxidase that boosts its activity and stability with a radical-forming aromatic substrate. This particular case could, at least in part, explain the enigma of the yellow laccases."
https://openalex.org/W3002553878,"We aimed to analyze regional disparities of health care resources in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) county hospitals and their time trends, and to assess the changes of regional disparities before and after 2009 health care reforms.We used hospital-based, longitudinal data from all TCM county hospitals in China between 2004 and 2016. To measure the key development features of TCM county hospitals, data were collected on government hospital investment, hospital numbers (the average number of TCM hospitals per county), hospital scale (the number of medical staff and hospital beds) and doctors' workload (the daily visits and inpatient stays per doctor). We used segmented linear regression to test the time trend for outcome variables. We set a breakpoint at 2011, dividing the pre-reform (2004-2011) and post-reform (2012-2016) periods.After the 2009 health reforms, TCM hospitals continued to display large disparities in the number, scale, and doctors' workload across the three regions. In the pre-reform period, yearly government subsidies for TCM hospitals in western area were roughly RMB0.6 million (US$89 thousand) more than those in central and eastern region, which increased under the 2009 reforms to roughly RMB2 million (US$298 thousand) more per yer in post-reform period. These increased subsidies saw an increase in the number of TCM hospitals in the western area, partly addressing regional disparities. But there was no improvement in the regional disparities in terms of scale (number of beds) and the doctors' workload (daily outpatient visits and inpatients per doctor) increased or remained unchanged between the western and other regions.Although TCM hospital number, scale, and doctors' workload increased over the past 13 years, substantial regional disparities remained. The 2009 health reforms did not significantly change the regional disparities in health care resources, especially between the eastern and western regions."
https://openalex.org/W3001058587,"Background Health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) is used as a measure of treatment outcomes, in addition to seizure control. Hence, the study was aimed to assess HRQOL and its determinants among adult patients with epilepsy (PWE). Method A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 20 to June 27/2019, through patient interviews and patient’s chart review (medication and clinical information). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. The psychometric property was done using Cronbach’s alpha test value of >0.7 as accepted internal consistency and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sample size adequacy value of ≥0.5 as acceptable construct validity, for Afaan Oromo version questionnaire. Multivariate linear logistic regression analysis was done to find predictors for the HRQOL score. Results Of 121 PWE included in the study, 24.4% had overall poor HRQOL with the overall mean ±SD score of 56.42±10.96. The predictors for low overall HRQOL score were: presence of co-morbidity (B = -5.620, SE = 1.531, p<0.0001, 95% C.I = -8.656 to -2.584), uncontrolled seizure for at least 2 years (B = -4.239, SE = 1.296, p = 0.001, 95% C.I = -6.809 to -1.670), divorced (B = -8.423, SE = 2.241, p<0.0001, 95%C.I = -12.867 to -3.978) relative to married, and no education (B = -8.715, SE = -8.15, SE = 2.604, p = 0.001, 95%C.I = -9.648 to -1.316) relative to who had level of education above tertiary. In addition, uncontrolled seizure (irrespective of time since seizure-free) (B = -10.083, SE = 2.104, p<0.0001, 95%C.I = -14.256 to -5.910), being widowed (B = -9.300, SE = 3.594, p = 0.011, 95%C.I = -16.429–2.170) relative to married and being illiterate/no education (B = -13.004, SE = 3.910, p = 0.001, 95%C.I = -20.760 to -5.248) relative to educational level of tertiary and above were found to be the strongest negative predictors of HRQOL of physical health. Moreover, uncontrolled seizure (irrespective of time since seizure-free) (B = -12.668, SE = 2.019, p<0.0001, 95%C.I = -16.671 to -8.664) and being divorced (B = -10.153, SE = 3.228, p = 0.002, 95%C.I = -16.556 to -3.751) compared to married were strong predictors for low HRQOL score of psychological health. Absence of Poly-pharmacy (B = 9.050, SE = 3.027, P = 0.003, 95%C.I = 3.047 to 15.054), being single (B = -9.551, SE = 2.095, p<0.0001, 95%C.I = -14.419 to -4.683), and divorced (B = -11.022, SE = 3.351, P = 0.001, 95%C.I = -17.668 to -4.376) relative to married were found to be strong predictors for HRQOL score of social health. Moreover, low HRQOL score of environmental health was predicted by rural residence (B = -5.795, SE = 2.101, p = 0.007, 95%C.I = -9.962 to -1.628), co-morbidity (B+ -4.230, SE = 2.125, p = 0.049, 95%C.I = -8.444 to -0.015) & uncontrolled seizure irrespective of time since seizure-free (B = -6.907, SE = 1.945, p = 0.001, 95%C.I = -10.765 to -3.049) and uncontrolled seizure of at least 2 years (B = -4.520, SE = 1.798, p = 0.014, 95%C.I = -8.088 to -0.953). Conclusions The majority of the study participants had a good overall HRQOL. In general, a low level of HRQOL score was significantly associated with the marital status of single/widowed/divorced, low level of education, low level of monthly income, co-morbidity, uncontrolled seizure, and poly-pharmacy; irrespective of HRQOL domains. Therefore, it is required to improve HRQOL, by avoiding modifiable factors for PWE to achieve the optimum HRQOL."

https://openalex.org/W3001583526,"Aim Occupational exposure to styrene has been shown to be associated with an increased probability of developing hearing loss. However, the sites of lesions in the auditory system in humans remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible adverse effects of styrene exposure on the cochlea of human subjects. Design The hearing function of 98 styrene-exposed male workers from the glass fibre-reinforced plastics industry (mean concentration of 55 mg/m3) was evaluated bilaterally using pure-tone audiometry (1000–16000 Hz), distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), and auditory brainstem response (ABR). The results were compared to a group of 111 male workers exposed to noise (above 85 dBA) and 70 male white-collar workers exposed to neither noise nor solvents. Age and noise exposure levels were accounted for as confounding variables in all statistical models. Results Styrene exposure was significantly associated with poorer pure-tone thresholds (1–8 kHz), lower DPOAE amplitudes (5–6 kHz), and shorter wave V latencies in both ears compared to control-group subjects. Similar results were found among noise-exposed subjects. A further analysis with wave V latency showed that styrene-exposed subjects showed significantly shorter latencies than expected according to normative data. These results suggest that occupational exposure to styrene at moderate concentrations is associated with cochlear dysfunction, at least at high frequencies. DPOAEs may be considered a valuable diagnostic tool in hearing conservation programs in workers exposed to styrene."
https://openalex.org/W3000841892,"Accumulating evidence shows that acute resistance exercises and long-term resistance training positively influence cognitive functions, but the underlying mechanisms have been rarely investigated. One explanatory approach assumes that the execution of resistance exercises requires higher cognitive processes which, in turn, lead to an 'indirect' training of higher cognitive functions. However, current knowledge on the engagement of higher cognitive functions during the execution of resistance exercises is relatively sparse. Hence, the purpose of this study was to examine to what extent cognitive resources are needed to perform a resistance exercise in the form of barbell back squatting.Twenty-four young adults performed a cognitive task (serial subtraction of 7's) during standing and during barbell back squatting on a Smith machine. The total number and the number of correct responses were analyzed and taken as indicators of the cognitive load imposed by the experimental condition (squatting) and the control condition (standing). Additionally, participants' perceived exertion, mean heart rate, and the number of squats they were able to perform were assessed.While accuracy scores were found not to be significantly different between conditions, the numbers of total and of correct responses were significantly lower during squatting than during standing. Additionally, during squatting a higher number of total answers was given in the fifth set compared to the first set. We attribute this phenomenon to a learning effect. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant correlation between cognitive measures and perceived exertion.Results suggest that perceived exertion cannot explain the higher dual-task costs observed during squatting. They rather reflect that more cognitive resources are needed to perform low-load barbell back squats than during standing. However, further research is necessary to confirm and generalize these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3002603467,"Muscle atrophy is associated with many diseases including genetic disorders, sarcopenia, or cachexia syndromes. Myostatin (Mstn), a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) member, plays a key role in skeletal muscle homeostasis as a powerful negative regulator. Over the last decade, about 15 clinical trials aimed at inhibiting the Mstn pathway, failed to produce conclusive results. In this context, we investigated whether growth and differentiation factor-associated serum protein-1 (GASP-1) or GASP-2, two natural inhibitors of Mstn, might represent a potential therapeutic. As we previously reported, mice overexpressing Gasp-1 (Tg(Gasp-1)) present an increase of muscle mass but develop metabolic disorders with aging. Here, we showed that overexpression of Gasp-2 increases the muscular mass without metabolic defects. We also found that Tg(Gasp-2) mice displayed, like Mstn–/– mice, a switch from slow- to fast-twitch myofibers whereas Tg(Gasp-1) mice exhibit a reverse switch. Our studies supported the fact that GASP-2 has less affinity than GASP-1 for Mstn, leading to a constitutive Mstn upregulation only in Tg(Gasp-1) mice, responsible for the observed phenotypic differences. Altogether, our findings highlighted a gene expression regulatory network of TGF-β members and their inhibitors in muscle."

Here we present a pilot case study in which we assess the cumulative impact of multiple consecutive vmPFC-tDCS sessions on the processing of visual emotional stimuli in an event-related MEG recording design. The results point to stable modulation of increased positivity biases (pleasant > unpleasant stimulus signal strength) after excitatory vmPFC stimulation and a reversed pattern (pleasant < unpleasant) after inhibitory stimulation across five consecutive tDCS sessions. Moreover, cumulative effects of these emotional bias modulations were observable for several source-localized spatio-temporal clusters, suggesting an increase in modulatory efficiency by repeated tDCS sessions. This pilot study provides evidence for improvements in the effectiveness and utility of a novel tDCS paradigm in the context of emotional processing."
https://openalex.org/W3002379872,"β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) agonists are the most common clinical bronchodilators for asthma. Obesity influences asthma severity and may impair response to β-AR agonists. Previous studies show that in obese mice, hyperinsulinemia plays a crucial role in β-AR desensitization in the heart. We therefore investigated whether insulin promotes β-AR desensitization in airway smooth muscle (ASM) and compromises airway relaxation responsiveness to β-AR agonists. We found that human ASM cells and mouse airway tissues exposed to insulin exhibit impaired β2AR-induced cAMP accumulation and airway relaxation. This impaired relaxation is associated with insulin-induced phosphorylation and expression of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) through transactivation of a G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2)-dependent β2AR-Gi-ERK1/2 cascade. Both acute and chronic pharmacological inhibition of PDE4 effectively reversed impaired β2AR-mediated ASM relaxation in an obesity mouse model induced by a high fat diet. Collectively, these findings reveal that cross talk between insulin and β2AR signaling promotes ASM β2AR desensitization in obesity through upregulation of PDE4D phosphorylation and expression. Our results identify a novel pathway of asthma pathogenesis in patients with obesity/metabolic syndrome, in which the GRK2-mediated signaling can be a potential therapeutic modality to prevent or treat β2AR desensitization in ASM. Moreover, PDE4 inhibitors may be used as efficacious therapeutic agents for asthma in obese and diabetic subjects."
https://openalex.org/W3002622855,"To address the problems of high overflow rate of pipe network inspection well and low drainage efficiency, a rainwater control optimization design approach based on a self-organizing feature map neural network model (SOFM) was proposed in this paper. These problems are caused by low precision parameter design in various rainwater control measures such as the diameter of the rainwater pipe network and the green roof area ratio. This system is to be combined with the newly built rainwater pipe control optimization design project of China International Airport in Daxing District of Beijing, China. Through the optimization adjustment of the pipe network parameters such as the diameter of the rainwater pipe network, the slope of the pipeline, and the green infrastructure (GI) parameters such as the sinking green area and the green roof area, reasonable control of airport rainfall and the construction of sustainable drainage systems can be achieved. This research indicates that compared with the result of the drainage design under the initial value of the parameter, the green roof model and the conceptual model of the mesoscale sustainable drainage system, in the case of a hundred-year torrential rainstorm, the overflow rate of pipe network inspection wells has reduced by 36% to 67.5%, the efficiency of drainage has increased by 26.3% to 61.7%, which achieves the requirements for reasonable control of airport rainwater and building a sponge airport and a sustainable drainage system."

Breeding of late blight resistant cultivars is one of the most effective strategies to overcome this disruptive disease. However, P. infestans is able to break down host resistance and acquire resistance to various fungicides, possibly because of the existence of high genetic variability among P. infestans isolates via sexual and asexual reproduction. Therefore, to manage this disease, it is important to understand the genetic divergence of P. infestans isolates. In this study, we analyzed the genomes of P. infestans isolates collected from Egypt and Japan using various molecular approaches including the mating type assay and genotyping simple sequence repeats, mitochondria DNA, and effector genes. We also analyzed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms using double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and whole genome resequencing (WGRS). The isolates were classified adequately using high-resolution genome-wide approaches. Moreover, these analyses revealed new clusters of P. infestans isolates in the Egyptian population. Monitoring the genetic divergence of P. infestans isolates as well as breeding of resistant cultivars would facilitate the elimination of the late blight disease."
https://openalex.org/W3002684190,"The fitness and virulence of parasites is often determined by how many resources they can wrangle out of their hosts. Host defenses that help to keep resources from the parasites will then reduce virulence and parasite fitness. Here, we study whether host brood care and brood size regulation can protect host fitness and harm a parasite. We use the biparental brood-caring burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides and its phoretic Poecilochirus carabi mites as a model. Since paternal brood care does not seem to benefit the offspring in a clean laboratory setting, the male presence has been suggested to strengthen the defense against parasites. We manipulated male presence and found no effect on the fitness of the parasitic mites or the beetle offspring. We further manipulated beetle brood size and found larger broods to reduce parasite fitness. The specific pattern we observed suggests that beetle larvae are strong competitors and consume the carrion resource before all parasites develop. They thus starve the parasites. These results shed new light on the observation that the parasites appear to reduce host brood size early on-potentially to avert later competition their offspring might have to face."
https://openalex.org/W3002725621,"Genetic and pharmacological functional studies have provided evidence that the lack of Neuropeptide Y-Y1  receptor (Y1 R) signaling pathway induces a high bone mass phenotype in mice. However, clinical observations have shown that drug or genetic mediated improvement of bone mass might be associated to alterations to bone extracellular matrix (ECM) properties, leading to bone fragility. Hence, in this study we propose to characterize the physical, chemical and biomechanical properties of mature bone ECM of germline NPY-Y1 R knockout (Y1 R-/- ) mice, and compare to their wild-type (WT) littermates. Our results demonstrated that the high bone mass phenotype observed in Y1 R-/- mice involves alterations in Y1 R-/-  bone ECM ultrastructure, as a result of accelerated deposition of organic and mineral fractions. In addition, Y1 R-/- bone ECM displays enhanced matrix maturation characterized by greater number of mature/highly packed collagen fibers without pathological accumulation of immature/mature collagen crosslinks nor compromise of mineral crystallinity. These unique features of Y1 R-/-  bone ECM improved the biochemical properties of Y1 R-/-  bones, reflected by mechanically robust bones with diminished propensity to fracture, contributing to greater bone strength. These findings support the future usage of drugs targeting Y1 R signaling as a promising therapeutic strategy to treat bone loss-related pathologies."

Whereas the signalling activities of the core Wnt/ß-catenin pathway components are understood in great detail, far less is known about the precise role and regulation of the many different modulators of Wnt/ß-catenin signalling that have been identified to date. Here we describe TMEM98, a putative transmembrane protein of unknown function, as an interaction partner and regulator of the GSK3-binding protein FRAT2. We show that TMEM98 reduces FRAT2 protein levels and, accordingly, inhibits the FRAT2-mediated induction of ß-catenin/TCF signalling. We also characterize the intracellular trafficking of TMEM98 in more detail and show that it is recycled between the plasma membrane and the Golgi. Together, our findings not only reveal a new layer of regulation for Wnt/ß-catenin signalling, but also a new biological activity for TMEM98."
https://openalex.org/W3002671630,"Heterochromatin protein (HP) 1γ, a component of heterochromatin in eukaryotes, is involved in H3K9 methylation. Although HP1γ is expressed strongly in neural tissues and neural stem cells, its functions are unclear. To elucidate the roles of HP1γ, we analyzed HP1γ -deficient (HP1γ KO) mouse embryonic neurospheres and determined that HP1γ KO neurospheres tended to differentiate after quaternary culture. Several genes normally expressed in neuronal cells were upregulated in HP1γ KO undifferentiated neurospheres, but not in the wild type (WT). Compared to that in the control neurospheres, the occupancy of H3K27me3 was lower around the transcription start sites (TSSs) of these genes in HP1γ KO neurospheres, while H3K9me2/3, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac amounts remained unchanged. Moreover, amounts of the H3K27me2/3 demethylases, UTX, and JMJD3, were increased around the TSSs of these genes. Treatment with GSK-J4, an inhibitor of H3K27 demethylases, decreased the expression of genes upregulated in HP1γ KO neurospheres, along with an increase of H3K27me3 amounts. Therefore, in murine neurospheres, HP1γ protected the promoter sites of differentiated cell-specific genes against H3K27 demethylases to repress the expression of these genes. A better understanding of central cellular processes such as histone methylation will help elucidate critical events such as cell-specific gene expression, epigenetics, and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3001267717,"Gene expression is an intrinsically stochastic process. Fluctuations in transcription and translation lead to cell-to-cell variations in mRNA and protein levels affecting cellular function and cell fate. Here, using fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, we quantify noise dynamics in an artificial operon in Escherichia coli, which is based on the native operon of ColicinE2, a toxin. In the natural system, toxin expression is controlled by a complex regulatory network; upon induction of the bacterial SOS response, ColicinE2 is produced (cea gene) and released (cel gene) by cell lysis. Using this ColicinE2-based operon, we demonstrate that upon induction of the SOS response noise of cells expressing the operon is significantly lower for the (mainly) transcriptionally regulated gene cea compared to the additionally post-transcriptionally regulated gene cel. Likewise, we find that mutations affecting the transcriptional regulation by the repressor LexA do not significantly alter the population noise, whereas specific mutations to post-transcriptionally regulating units, strongly influence noise levels of both genes. Furthermore, our data indicate that global factors, such as the plasmid copy number of the operon encoding plasmid, affect gene expression noise of the entire operon. Taken together, our results provide insights on how noise in a native toxin-producing operon is controlled and underline the importance of post-transcriptional regulation for noise control in this system."

However, one-third do not benefit and adjunctive therapies are urgently needed. Xenon enhances neuroprotection with TH when administered at 50% concentration within 5hours of hypoxia in experimental studies. Delayed initiation (~10 hours of age) of 30% xenon for 24 hours during TH did not improve early adverse biomarkers in a clinical trial of Xenon+TH vs TH. After hypoxia-ischemia, excitotoxic injury via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor overactivation lasts days. Since xenon partially inhibits this receptor, we hypothesised that giving 50% xenon throughout the entire 72h TH and rewarming periods would enhance neuroprotection. Xenon costs $30/litre, so a closed-circuit breathing system is desirable with automated fresh gas delivery. Methods Seven mechanically ventilated newborn pigs were randomized to receive 50% inhaled xenon for 72h during hypothermia (rectal-temperature 35°C) and subsequent rewarming following a global hypoxic-ischemic insult (XeHT, N = 4) or under normothermia for 72h (rectal-temperature 38.5°C) following sham insult (XeNT, N = 3). An automated fresh gas delivery system injected oxygen/air/xenon boluses into a closed-circuit based on measured gas concentrations. Results and discussion Median (IQR) xenon consumption was 0.31 L/h (0.18, 0.50) and 0.34L/h (0.32, 0.49) for hypothermic and normothermic groups respectively, 0.34L/h (0.25, 0.53) overall. 92% of 9626 xenon and 69% of 9635 oxygen measurements were within 20% variation from targets. For xenon concentration, the median absolute performance errors for the XeHT and XeNT groups were 6.14% and 3.84% respectively and 4.31% overall. For oxygen these values were 13.42%, 15.05% and 12.4% respectively. There were no adverse pulmonary pathophysiology findings. Clinical problems over the total period included three related to sensors, seven breathing system leaks, ten partial and one complete tracheal tube occlusion episodes. Conclusion The automated controller functioned as intended maintaining an inhaled xenon concentration close to the 50% target for 72-78h at a xenon cost of $11.1/h."

Giving computers the ability to assess human sensory and perceptual experience of aesthetics is a well-recognized need for the intelligent design industry and multimedia intelligence study. In this work, we constructed a novel database for the aesthetic evaluation of design, using 2,918 images collected from the archives of two major design awards, and we also present a method of aesthetic evaluation that uses machine learning algorithms. Reviewers’ ratings of the design works are set as the ground-truth annotations for the dataset. Furthermore, multiple image features are extracted and fused. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. Primary screening using aesthetic computing can be an intelligent assistant for various design evaluations and can reduce misjudgment in art and design review due to visual aesthetic fatigue after a long period of viewing. The study of computational aesthetic evaluation can provide positive effect on the efficiency of design review, and it is of great significance to aesthetic recognition exploration and applications development."
