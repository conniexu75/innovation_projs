https://openalex.org/W3105945853,"Entanglement is considered to be one of the most profound features of quantum mechanics1,2. An entangled state of a system consisting of two subsystems cannot be described as a product of the quantum states of the two subsystems3,4,5,6. In this sense, the entangled system is considered inseparable and non-local. It is generally believed that entanglement is usually manifest in systems consisting of a small number of microscopic particles. Here we demonstrate experimentally the entanglement of two macroscopic objects, each consisting of a caesium gas sample containing about 1012 atoms. Entanglement is generated via interaction of the samples with a pulse of light, which performs a non-local Bell measurement on the collective spins of the samples7. The entangled spin-state can be maintained for 0.5 milliseconds. Besides being of fundamental interest, we expect the robust and long-lived entanglement of material objects demonstrated here to be useful in quantum information processing, including teleportation8,9,10 of quantum states of matter and quantum memory."

https://openalex.org/W2010752097,"The 14-3-3 proteins are a family of highly conserved eukaryotic regulatory molecules that play important roles in many biological processes including cell cycle control and regulation of cell death. They are able to carry out these effects through binding and modulating the activity of a host of signaling proteins. The ability of 14-3-3 to inhibit Bad and other proapoptotic proteins argues that 14-3-3 can support cell survival. To examine this issue in a global sense, a specific inhibitor of 14-3-3/ligand interactions, difopein, was used. Difopein expression led to induction of apoptosis. Studies using various components of survival and death signaling pathways were consistent with a vital role for 14-3-3/ligand interactions in signal transduction from upstream pro-survival kinases to the core apoptotic machinery. Because these kinases often become activated during oncogenesis, the effect of difopein on cell death induced by antineoplastic drugs was examined. It was found that difopein enhances the ability of cisplatin to kill cells. These data support the model that 14-3-3, through binding to Bad and other ligands, is critical for cell survival signaling. Inhibition of 14-3-3 may represent a useful therapeutic target for treatment of cancer and other diseases involving inappropriate cell survival."

Because the underlying mechanisms that initiate this response are still incompletely defined, this study was aimed to identify novel factors. Liver genes that were up-regulated 6 h after 70% hepatectomy (PHx) in the rat were selected by cDNA subtractive hybridization. Besides known genes associated with cell proliferation, several novel genes were isolated. The novel gene that was most up-regulated was further studied. Its mRNA showed a liver-specific expression and encoded a protein comprising 367 amino acids. The mouse and human cDNA analogues were also isolated and appeared to be highly homologous. The human gene analogue was located at an apolipoprotein gene cluster on chromosome 11q23. The protein encoded by this gene had appreciable homology with apolipoproteins A-I and A-IV. Maximal expression of the gene in the rat liver and its gene product in rat plasma was observed 6 h after PHx. The protein was present in plasma fractions containing high density lipoprotein particles. Therefore, we have identified a novel apolipoprotein, designated apolipoprotein A-V, that is associated with an early phase of liver regeneration.

Webber E.M. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, New York1994: 1059-1084Google Scholar, 2Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2919) Google Scholar). This process of liver regeneration has been studied extensively in a rat model of 70% partial hepatectomy (PHx),1 a model first described by Higgins et al. (3Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). After PHx, the remaining differentiated liver cells re-enter the cell cycle by undergoing a transition from the quiescent G0 phase to the G1 phase at 1–4 h after PHx (priming phase). DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes starts at 12–16 h after PHx and increases to a peak around 22–24 h. Within 7 days of PHx, the rat liver has regained its original mass. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the regenerative response, research has focused on the molecular changes during the G0/G1 transition. Over 70 immediate-early genes have been identified, the expression of which is up-regulated during the priming phase (4Mohn K.L. Laz T.M. Melby A.E. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21914-21921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mohn K.L. Laz T.M. Hsu J.C. Melby A.E. Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These genes include for example the proto-oncogenes c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc. In addition, studies in knockout mice have revealed an essential role for the cytokines TNF and IL-6 in the initiation of liver cell proliferation. In both TNF receptor type-1 and IL-6 knockout mice, liver regeneration was impaired after PHx, whereas IL-6 injected at the time of the operation restored proliferative capacity (6Yamada Y. Kirillova I. Peschon J.J. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 7Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Also a rapid induction of DNA binding by the transcription factors NFκB and STAT3 was demonstrated during the immediate-early response to PHx (8FitzGerald M.J. Webber E.M. Donovan J.R. Fausto N. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 417-427PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cressman D.E. Diamond R.H. Taub R. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1443-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the factors mentioned alone are not sufficient to induce liver regeneration. In inducible nitric-oxide synthase knockout mice after PHx, liver regeneration was impaired, but IL-6 and TNF levels and STAT3 binding were not altered (10Rai R.M. Lee F.Y. Rosen A. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Koteish A. Liew F.Y. Zaragoza C. Lowenstein C. Diehl A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13829-13834Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, NFκB, STAT3, and IL-6 were induced to a similar extent in the ligated and nonligated liver lobes after portal branch ligation whereas only the nonligated lobes underwent compensatory regeneration (11Starkel P. Horsmans Y. Sempoux C. De Saeger C. Wary J. Lause P. Maiter D. Lambotte L. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Besides, based on the application of a technique of temporary partial hepatectomy, the proliferative response did not appear to be determined during the priming phase, but later during mid to late G1 (12Lambotte L. Saliez A. Triest S. Tagliaferri E.M. Barker A.P. Baranski A.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G905-G912PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that, although the immediate-early response after PHx is necessary for liver regeneration, a further later response is also required. Factors in the delayed response during G1might be triggers that are essential for the regeneration process. Some genes that contribute to the delayed response have already been identified, such as p53, c-ras, and various cyclins (13Thompson N.L. Mead J.E. Braun L. Goyette M. Shank P.R. Fausto N. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3111-3117PubMed Google Scholar, 14Goyette M. Petropoulos C.J. Shank P.R. Fausto N. Science. 1983; 219: 510-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 15Lu X.P. Koch K.S. Lew D.J. Dulic V. Pines J. Reed S.I. Hunter T. Leffert H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2841-2844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify additional liver-specific factors present during the delayed response, we characterized gene expression profiles in rat liver at 6 h after PHx. To identify and isolate up-regulated genes, a cDNA subtraction technique was applied to mRNA from rats after PHx and sham surgery. This paper describes the isolation and characterization of a novel gene that undergoes appreciable up-regulation after PHx on both mRNA and protein level, and encodes for a novel apolipoprotein, designated apolipoprotein A-V. Rats were subjected to 70% PHx as previously described (3Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). Briefly, male Wistar rats (200–225 g) were anesthetized and subjected to midventral laparotomy. Subsequently, the left lateral and the median liver lobes were removed. In sham-operated animals, the liver was exposed and manipulated before closing the abdomen. Animals were sacrificed at various times after PHx or sham surgery. At sacrifice heparin plasma was collected, and the remaining regenerating liver was harvested. For determination of the tissue specificity of gene expression, various tissues were isolated from a female Wistar rat (175 g). Tissues and plasma were stored at −80 °C. Tissue specimens of the regenerating liver were also fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and imbedded in paraffin as previously described (16Moorman A.F. De Boer P.A. Vermeulen J.L. Lamers W.H. Histochem. J. 1993; 25: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines for animal care and experimentation of the University of Amsterdam. Total RNA was isolated from tissue using the TRIzol reagent kit (Life Technologies). Liver poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total liver RNA using oligo(dT)-cellulose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) affinity chromatography as previously described (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manuel. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To obtain highly purified poly(A)+ RNA populations, the oligo(dT)-cellulose step was performed twice. The PCR-select cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH) was used to selectively amplify genes that were differentially expressed during liver regeneration. The liver mRNA population 6 h after PHx was compared with that 6 h after sham operation. The cDNA subtractive hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Resulting cDNA fragments were amplified and ligated into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The fragments were characterized by nucleotide sequencing. For gene identification, the sequences were compared with those reported in the data bases maintained at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD) using the BLAST search program. For the Northern analysis of mRNA expression in rat tissues, total RNA (20 μg) or poly(A)+RNA (0.8 μg) was electrophoresed in a 0.22 mformaldehyde-1% agarose gel and transferred and fixed to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Northern analysis ofRAP3 mRNA expression in human tissues was performed using the human 12-lane Multi Tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany). 25 ng of cDNA was labeled with 32P according to the random primed labeling method (18Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar) and used as a hybridization probe. Hybridization was carried out according to standard techniques (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manuel. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The amount of hybridization was analyzed and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Constancy of mRNA loading was monitored by methylene blue staining of the blots (19Wilkinson M. Doskow J. Lindsey S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 679Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or by hybridization with a rat heavy chain ferritin cDNA. The transcription of the heavy chain of ferritin is not affected by partial hepatectomy or laparotomy (20Wu C.G. Groenink M. Bosma A. Reitsma P.H. Van Deventer S.J. Chamuleau R.A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization was performed on serial paraffin sections of regenerating rat liver after PHx using the method described by Moorman et al. (16Moorman A.F. De Boer P.A. Vermeulen J.L. Lamers W.H. Histochem. J. 1993; 25: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Single-stranded antisense RNA probes, labeled with [35S]CTP, were made by in vitro RNA transcription, as described by Van Kempen et al. (21Van Kempen M.J. Vermeulen J.L. Moorman A.F. Gros D. Paul D.L. Lamers W.H. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 886-900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using the pBluescript SK(±) vector containing the inserts of interest as template. The RAP3 insert of the pET-15b expression construct (see “Protein Expression and Raising of Antibodies”) was cloned into the pBluescript vector using the XbaI andXhoI sites. Full-length cDNA of rat and human RAP3 were obtained by library screening according to standard hybridization techniques (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manuel. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A rat liver cDNA library was constructed from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from rat liver 6 h after 70% hepatectomy using the Great Lengths cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The adaptor-ligated full-length cDNA inserts were cloned into the pCI vector at the EcoRI restriction site and transformed into DH10B cells (Life Technologies, Inc., Breda, The Netherlands). A human liver cDNA library, transformed into DH12S cells, was purchased from Life Technologies. To detect rat and human RAP3 cDNAs, probes of the ratRAP3 cDNA fragment and the full-length ratRAP3 cDNA were used, respectively. Full-length cDNA of mouse RAP3 was purchased as an IMAGE Consortium cDNA clone (22Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), known in the GenBankTM data base of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) under accession number AA987093. All the obtained full-length RAP3 cDNAs were sequenced bi-directionally. Both 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions were carried out for rat RAP3 using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). The starting material was poly(A)+ RNA isolated from rat liver 6 h after PHx. Adaptor-ligated cDNA was created according to the manufacturer's protocol. The 5′-RACE PCR was carried out with the adaptor-ligated cDNA and a combination of the adaptor primer and the internal reverse primer 5′-CAGGCTCTCTCAAGGGTCCC-3′ or 5′-CTGTGGCTAGGCGGGGGTGG-3′. The 3′-RACE PCR reaction was carried out using a combination of the adaptor primer and the internal forward primer 5′-GTGGTCCTGCTGGGGGATCA-3′ or 5′-AGTACCTTCATCCGTGTCAG-3′. The resulting 5′- and 3′-RACE fragments were ligated into the pCR II vector, and the sequences of the 5′- and 3′-cDNA ends ofRAP3 were determined by nucleotide sequencing. The nucleotide and amino acid residue sequences of RAP3 were analyzed using various software applications. Homology data base searches were carried out using the BLAST program (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71457) Google Scholar). Using GCG DNA software (Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI), the nucleotide sequences were translated into the corresponding amino acid sequences. The helical wheel function of the GCG DNA software was applied to examine the amphipathic nature of α-helical peptide segments (Wisconsin Package Version 10.0, GCG). To predict protein secondary structure, the Predator software tool at the server of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (Heidelberg, Germany) was used. The ExPASy molecular biology server from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics was used to calculate the theoretical molecular mass of the RAP3 protein (24Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Predictions of signal sequences and transmembrane segments were generated using PSORT II software (25Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). The PROSITE data base was searched for known motifs in the RAP3 amino acid sequence (26Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Multiple alignments were assessed using ClustalW software (27Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar). The insert encoding the rat RAP3 protein was amplified from the adaptor-ligated cDNA used in the RACE experiment. PCR reactions were carried out with the forward primer 5′-CGGAATTCATATGAGGAAGAGCTTCTGGGAGT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CGGAATTCATATGTTAACCTGAGTGACCCTCA-3′. The resulting insert fragment was cloned into the pET-15b expression vector (Novagen) in the sense orientation at the NdeI site, thereby introducing an additional His tag sequence at the N-terminal part of the protein. Recombinant RAP3 protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) and purified under denaturing conditions using HisBind affinity chromatography. Expression and purification were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). The buffer of the purified protein was replaced by PBS/6 m urea using a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the solution was diluted to a protein concentration of about 200 μg/ml. Polyclonal antibodies against the purified recombinant RAP3 protein were raised in New Zealand White rabbits following subcutaneous injection of 200 μg of antigen combined with Freund's complete adjuvant and subsequent booster injections of antigen. For protein identification, the His tag was removed using thrombin (Novagen). Subsequently, the N-terminal part of the protein was sequenced by the Protein Research Facility of the E.C. Slater Institute in Amsterdam under the supervision of Dr. T. Muijsers. Western blotting was carried out for the immunodetection of RAP3 protein. Samples, containing 0.8 μl of rat plasma or 0.2 ng of the purified recombinant RAP3 protein, were electrophoresed in a 10% gel for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane using Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer containing 20% methanol. The blots were incubated overnight in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 3% Protifar (Nutricia, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands). The blots were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.2% Protifar. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with rabbit serum containing polyclonal antibodies against RAP3 diluted in wash buffer. The blots were washed and incubated for 1 h with a second antibody (goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin labeled with horseradish peroxidase (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted in wash buffer). The blots were washed and incubated for 5 min with Lumi-Light Western blotting substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RAP3 was visualized and quantified by chemiluminescence measurement using a Lumi Imager and LumiAnalyst software (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Mouse plasma fractions isolated by standard fast-protein liquid chromatography techniques and analyzed for their cholesterol contents were generously provided by Prof. Dr. F. Kuijpers (Department of Pediatrics, Academic Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands). Their preparation and analysis have been described elsewhere (28Voshol P.J. Havinga R. Wolters H. Ottenhoff R. Princen H.M. Oude Elferink R.P. Groen A.K. Kuipers F. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1024-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The plasma had been obtained from five wild type mice with FVB background (29Groen A.K. Van Wijland M.J. Frederiks W.M. Smit J.J. Schinkel A.H. Oude Elferink R.P. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1997-2006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The protein and cholesterol profiles of rat plasma were determined as described previously (30Levels J.H.M. Abraham P.R. Van den Ende A. Van Deventer S.J.H. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2821-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). 60 μl of plasma, diluted 1:1 with Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/Tween elution buffer, was analyzed using a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and TBS containing 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20, pH 7.4, as eluent. To identify genes that are up-regulated in the rat liver 6 h after PHx, a cDNA subtractive hybridization was performed. The liver mRNA population 6 h after PHx was compared with that at 6 h after sham operation. By using sham liver mRNA rather than normal liver mRNA, the two isolated mRNA populations were comparable with respect to acute phase mRNAs induced by surgery. 12 genes, isolated by the subtraction, were at least 1.5-fold up-regulated in rat liver 6 h after PHx relative to corresponding rat liver from sham-operated controls (Table I). Most of these genes have been reported to be associated with liver regeneration or with cell proliferation in general (Table I). Among the up-regulated genes there were three unknown genes, which were designated regeneration-associated proteins (RAP) 1, 2, and 3. The identity of the most up-regulated novel gene RAP3 and its relation to liver regeneration were studied in more detail.Table IGenes up-regulated 6 h after 70% partial hepatectomyKnown genesConnection with proliferationUp-regulationFibronectinLiver regeneration1.8An intracisternal-A ParticleLiver regeneration1.8Elementγ-ActinLiver regeneration7Ribophorin ILiver regeneration5.5, 1.7 and 2.3α2-MacroglobulinHepatocyte proliferation in vitro5.4Ribosomal protein S5Cell cycle3.7 and 1.9Ribosomal protein L13Breast cancer2Amyloid AAcute phase10.4Chaperonin-containing TCP-1 gamma subunitProtein folding1.5Novel genes RAP1Unknown1.5 RAP2Unknown1.6 RAP3Unknown3.3The genes were identified using the BLAST program. cDNA fragments of the genes were used as probes for Northern blots of poly(A)+RNA from rat livers that were harvested 6 h after PHx or sham operation. The specific hybridization was adjusted for variability in RNA loading as determined by hybridization with a rat heavy chain ferritin cDNA. The up-regulation was the ratio of mRNA level of each gene after PHx to that after sham operation. Open table in a new tab The genes were identified using the BLAST program. cDNA fragments of the genes were used as probes for Northern blots of poly(A)+RNA from rat livers that were harvested 6 h after PHx or sham operation. The specific hybridization was adjusted for variability in RNA loading as determined by hybridization with a rat heavy chain ferritin cDNA. The up-regulation was the ratio of mRNA level of each gene after PHx to that after sham operation. To examine the relation of RAP3 to liver regeneration, its gene expression in rat liver was studied after PHx. The mRNA expression pattern of RAP3 at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 h after laparotomy and PHx is shown in Fig.1 a. Two RAP3mRNA bands appeared on Northern blot. RAP3 expression was not altered by sham operation. However, its expression was increased from 3 to 12 h after PHx with a peak at 6 h.In situ hybridization showed the same pattern of gene expression and showed that RAP3 was expressed in hepatocytes. 3 h after PHx, expression of RAP3 mRNA was increased in the periportal but not in the pericentral areas of the hepatic acinus. This zonation of expression was less apparent at the peak of gene expression 6 h after PHx, when the expression was also increased pericentrally (data not shown). RAP3 mRNA levels were also determined in normal rat tissues. RAP3mRNA was detected in the liver but not in any of the other tissues examined (Fig. 1 b). The identity of RAP3 was studied further using its full-length cDNA, which was obtained by screening a rat liver cDNA library. The complete nucleotide sequence was obtained by bi-directional sequencing (Fig. 2). The start and end of the full-length cDNA were confirmed by both 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions. Two cDNAs of RAP3 were detected: one having 1282 bp and the other 1834 bp. They were identical, except the latter contained 552 additional base pairs at the 3′-end. Data base searching revealed that the RAP3 sequence was about 90% homologous with murine EST clones of the mouse liver and fetus (Washington University–Howard Hughes Medical Institute Mouse EST project). The larger mouse cDNA of RAP3 was isolated by sequencing the EST clone with GenBankTMaccession number AA987093. Its cDNA of 1814 bp had 90% homology with its rat analogue. No appreciable similarity of murineRAP3 to known genes was found, although it was about 80% homologous with parts of the human chromosome 11q23 (GenBankTM accession number AC007707). To find the cDNA of this human analogue of RAP3, a human liver cDNA library was screened. The human RAP3 cDNA had characteristics similar to those of the murine cDNAs. Its two transcripts were somewhat larger, specifically 1324 and 1896 bp. They were 77 and 76% homologous with their rat analogues. Like in the rat, the expression of RAP3 mRNA was restricted to the liver as shown on a more extensive human tissue blot (Fig. 1 c). The human cDNA was identical to parts of the human chromosome 11q23. This locus is also the site of an apolipoprotein gene cluster, which contains the genes for apolipoproteins A-I, A-IV, and C-III (Fig.3). Fig. 3 also depicts the exon/intron organization of the human RAP3 gene. This gene consists of three exons having 58, 111, and 1679 bp, respectively. The third exon of the smaller construct consists of 1137 bp. The two introns were 112 and 517 bp in length. All of the mentioned RAP3 nucleotide sequences have been submitted to the DJB/EMBL/GenBankTM data bases under GenBankTM accession numbers AF202887 (larger rat cDNA),AF202888 (smaller rat cDNA), AF327059 (mouse cDNA), AF202889(larger human cDNA), and AF202890 (smaller human cDNA). The characteristics of the proteins encoded by the murine and human RAP3 genes were studied to elucidate the identity of RAP3. The nucleotide sequences were translated into the corresponding amino acid sequences, and, by analyzing the six reading frames, the largest and most likely proteins were chosen as RAP3 proteins. The amino acid sequence of rat RAP3 is shown in Fig. 2. The two cDNAs of the rat RAP3 gene both encoded the same protein. The same holds true for the humanRAP3 cDNAs. The predicted rat and mouse RAP3 proteins, having 367 and 368 amino acids, respectively, were somewhat larger than their human analogue, which comprised 363 amino acids. The RAP3 protein analogues were 73% homologous (Fig.4 a). Comparison with other amino acid sequences showed that RAP3 was a hitherto unknown protein. RAP3 protein had an appreciable homology (20–28%) with apoA-IV and apoA-I of various species. The comparison of human RAP3 protein and human apoA-IV is illustrated in Fig. 4 b. The apoA-IV protein is characterized by 13 tandem repetitions of 22-amino acid segments that have the propensity to form amphipathic α-helices. Most of these repeats are punctuated by proline residues (31Boguski M.S. Elshourbagy N. Taylor J.M. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of the RAP3 protein was predicted to have an overall α-helical content of about 60%. When analyzing the sequence segments of human RAP3 that correlate with the tandem repeats of human apoA-IV, a few segments can be recognized that tend to form amphipathic alpha helices (data not shown). RAP3 protein was predicted to have a cleavable signal peptide, comprising the first 20 amino acid residues of the protein sequence (Fig. 2). No other transmembrane segments were identified, because no other hydrophobic segments were present in the protein. If RAP3 protein has a cleavable signal peptide, the calculated molecular masses of the precursor and mature RAP3 proteins would be 41 and 39 kDa, respectively. No characteristic functional patterns were found, apart from some common phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, no glycosylation or lipid modification sites were present in the RAP3 proteins. Because of the presence of a cleavable signal peptide and, thus, a possible secretion of RAP3 protein into blood, the presence of the protein in rat plasma was investigated using polyclonal antibodies that were raised against recombinant RAP3. The RAP3 antiserum recognized this antigen on Western blot, whereas pre-immune serum gave no RAP3 signal (data not shown). The RAP3 antiserum was now used to identify RAP3 in plasma of normal rats and rats at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 after PHx or sham operation (Fig. 5). RAP3 was present in normal rat plasma, and its concentration was increased 3 and 6 h after PHx. At 12 h after PHx, the concentration was still elevated in one rat but almost normal in another rat. At 18 h after PHx the plasma RAP3 level had decreased to a subnormal level. The plasma RAP3 concentration in sham-operated rats remained constant. When related to the amount of recombinant protein on blot, the concentration of RAP3 in normal rat plasma was estimated to be about 1 μg/ml. This concentration was increased five times at 3 and 6 h after PHx. Because the RAP3 amino acid sequence has homology with apolipoproteins, the presence of RAP3 protein in plasma apolipoprotein particles was sought. Using the rat RAP3 antiserum, the distribution of RAP3 in mouse plasma fractions, which had been isolated by gel-filtration chromatography, was determined. The cholesterol profile of the fractions and the Western blot results of the fractions positive for RAP3 are shown in Fig. 6. RAP3 was found in plasma fractions containing the larger HDL particles but not in the fractions containing the LDL or VLDL particles. To investigate whether the enhanced levels of RAP3 protein after PHx merely reflected an up-regulation of HDL, protein and cholesterol profiles of nor"

NifU and IscU have been proposed to serve as template or scaffold proteins in the initial Fe/S cluster assembly events, but the mechanism of sulfur transfer from NifS or IscS to NifU or IscU has not been elucidated. We have employed [35S]cysteine radiotracer studies to monitor sulfur transfer between IscS and IscU from Escherichia coli and have used direct binding measurements to investigate interactions between the proteins. IscS catalyzed transfer of 35S from [35S]cysteine to IscU in the absence of additional thiol reagents, suggesting that transfer can occur directly and without involvement of an intermediate carrier. Surface plasmon resonance studies and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements further revealed that IscU binds to IscS with high affinity (Kd ∼2 μm) in support of a direct transfer mechanism. Transfer was inhibited by treatment of IscU with iodoacetamide, and 35S was released by reducing reagents, suggesting that transfer of persulfide sulfur occurs to cysteinyl groups of IscU. A deletion mutant of IscS lacking C-terminal residues 376–413 (IscSΔ376–413) displayed cysteine desulfurase activity similar to the full-length protein but exhibited lower binding affinity for IscU, decreased ability to transfer 35S to IscU, and reduced activity in assays of Fe/S cluster assembly on IscU. The findings with IscSΔ376–413 provide additional support for a mechanism of sulfur transfer involving a direct interaction between IscS and IscU and suggest that the C-terminal region of IscS may be important for binding IscU.

NifS, which functions in metallocluster formation of the nitrogenase system of Azotobacter vinelandii, was the first enzyme discovered to catalyze desulfuration of cysteine (1Zheng L. White R.H.

The reaction catalyzed was found to yield alanine and either sulfane (S0) or, in the presence of a reducing agent, sulfide (S2−). Subsequent studies showed that NifS, cysteine, and iron could be used in vitro to reconstitute Fe/S clusters of several different Fe/S proteins, including the nitrogenase apo-Fe protein (2Zheng L.

Similar in vitro studies have shown that IscS, a homolog of NifS found in nondiazotrophic as well as nitrogen-fixing organisms, is also effective in Fe/S cluster formation. IscS from E. coli could be used to reconstitute the Fe/S cluster of dihydroxyacid dehydratase (7Flint D.H. J. Biol.

The molecular mechanism by which sulfur is transferred from NifS or IscS to apo-Fe/S proteins is not known. Studies on NifS have provided evidence for formation of a persulfide intermediate on a cysteine residue presumed to be located near the active site (15Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), but whether this sulfur is donated directly to acceptor proteins, is transferred via an intermediate carrier, or is released as HS− is not known. Recently, the crystal structure of a NifS-like protein from the thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima was determined (16Kaiser J.T. Clausen T. Bourenkow G.P. Bartunik H.-D. Steinbacher S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The peptide region containing the cysteine residue presumed to be involved in sulfur transfer was disordered and could not be resolved in the crystal structure, and it was suggested that this may reflect the requirement for this segment to be flexible in order to both accept sulfur at the active site and transfer it to acceptor proteins (16Kaiser J.T. Clausen T. Bourenkow G.P. Bartunik H.-D. Steinbacher S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It has not been determined, however, whether sulfur transfer involves direct interactions between NifS or IscS and acceptor proteins. In thein vitro studies in which sulfur transfer from NifS or IscS to various acceptors has been reported, reaction mixtures contained levels of reducing agent (1–5 mm dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol) sufficient to release persulfide-bound sulfur from NifS or IscS as free sulfide. Thus, the activities observed may reflect the ability of NifS/IscS to provide reactive HS− in solution rather than a direct interaction between NifS or IscS and the acceptor proteins under investigation. In studies involving transfer from NifS to NifU (6Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and from IscS to IscU (8Agar J.N. Zheng L. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2136-2137Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar), a weak interaction between NifS/IscS and NifU/IscU was indicated by size exclusion chromatography, but the nature of the interaction and its role in sulfur transfer were not investigated. NifU and IscU proteins have been proposed to function as template/scaffold proteins for assembly of intermediate Fe/S clusters prior to delivery to apo-Fe/S proteins (6Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N.

The mechanism of sulfur transfer between NifS/IscS and NifU/IscU, however, has not been studied in detail. We present evidence herein that sulfur transfer between E. coli IscS and IscU is direct, involves high affinity complex formation, and involves cysteine residues of IscU. Evidence is also presented that complex formation is mediated in part by a region of IscS not required for cysteine desulfurase activity and that this region is required for efficient Fe/S cluster formation. These findings provide support for a cellular mechanism of sulfur transfer that involves a direct interaction between IscS and IscU. E. coli DH5αF′IQ cells were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Enzymes for DNA manipulation were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, New England Biolabs, Inc., or U.S. Biochemical Corp. Synthetic nucleotides were obtained from Genosys.35S-Labeled l-cysteine was obtained fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Bacterial growth medium components were from Difco, and other reagents were from Sigma. Recombinant IscU and Hsc20 were prepared as described previously (17Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 19Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For expression of recombinant IscS, the coding region of iscSwas amplified from genomic DNA isolated from E. coli K-12 strain by polymerase chain reaction with Taq DNA polymerase and primers designed to introduce a NcoI restriction site at Met-1 and a PstI site following the termination codon. Introduction of the NcoI site resulted in a change of residue 2 from lysine to glutamic acid; this recombinant form is referred to as “wild-type” IscS throughout. 1A preliminary crystal structure of E. coli IscS reveals that residue 2 is located at the protein surface and appears unlikely to make significant contributions to the IscS structure or stability (J. Cupp-Vickery, H. Urbina and L. Vickery, unpublished observations). The IscS polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NcoI andPstI and ligated into pTrc99a (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to yield pTrcIscS. DH5αF′IQ cells transformed with pTrcIscS were grown in Terrific Broth at 37 °C, induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-d-thiogalactoside at A600∼0.5, and grown for 16 h to allow expression. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, frozen, thawed, and lysed by French press in TED buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT).2The soluble supernatant fluid after centrifugation at 35,000 ×g was used for purification, and all subsequent steps were carried out in TED buffer at 4 °C. IscS protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Anion exchange chromatography was carried out using DE52 (Whatman) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–250 mmNaCl. IscS fractions were loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose column (Whatman), washed with 150 mm TED, and eluted using a linear gradient of 150–250 mm sodium chloride. Final purification was achieved on a phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20% ammonium sulfate and elution with a decreasing linear gradient of 20 to 5% ammonium sulfate. Fractions appearing homogeneous by gel electrophoresis were combined, treated with 150 μmpyridoxal phosphate to restore cofactor lost during purification, dialyzed to remove ammonium sulfate and unbound pyridoxal phosphate, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and stored at −70 °C. This method yielded ∼50 mg of IscS/liter at >90% purity (Fig. 1 A) and a specific activity of 156 mol of sulfide/min/mg. To prepare the C-terminal IscS truncation mutant IscSΔ376–413, a stop codon was substituted for Ser-376 of pTrcIscS using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate pTrcΔIscS. IscSΔ376–413 was expressed in aniscS − strain PK4331 (31Schwartz C.J. Djaman O. Imlay J.A. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and prepared using the same methods as used for full-length IscS. As with the full-length protein, purified IscSΔ376–413 behaved as a dimer, and no differences in stability of the mutant were apparent during incubations used to determine enzyme activity or Fe/S cluster assembly assays. DTT was removed from samples of IscU and IscS by extensive dialysis immediately before all sulfur transfer assays. Samples subjected to multiple cycles of concentration and buffer exchange using a Centricon YM-10 centrifuge filter unit to further remove low molecular weight solutes gave similar results consistent with complete removal of reducing reagent by dialysis. Sulfur transfer reactions were carried out at 23 °C for 30 s and contained 1 μm IscS, 20 μm IscU (or other acceptor protein), and HKM buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) in a final volume of 35 μl. Reactions were initiated by the addition of35S-labeled l-cysteine (0.19 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to a final concentration of 15 μm and were terminated by centrifugation at 2000 × g through a size exclusion column (Microspin G-50 column; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The spin column eluant was mixed with SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer to give final concentrations of 1% glycerol, 5 mmTris, pH 8.0, and 0.001% bromphenol blue. Samples were immediately analyzed by gel electrophoresis using a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) but in the absence of added reducing agent.35S was visualized by exposure on a phosphor screen and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and relative intensities were calculated using ImageQuant software supplied with the instrument. Reactions were found to be essentially complete even at 0 °C within the time required for reagent separation on spin columns, and it was not possible to obtain rapid kinetic measurements. Cysteine residues of IscS were alkylated in 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 7, usingN-ethylmaleimide (21Riordan J.F. Valle B.L Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 545-547Google Scholar), and cysteine residues of IscU were carboxymethylated in 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, using iodoacetic acid (22Stone K.L. LoPresti M.B. Williams N.D. Crawford J.M. DeAngelis R. Williams K.R. Hugly T.E. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989: 379-380Google Scholar). For each reaction, ∼0.1 mmIscS or IscU was incubated with 1 mm labeling reagent for 1 h. Excess N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetic acid were removed by repeated cycles of ultrafiltration and dilution with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0. IscS desulfurase activity was determined using the sulfide detection assay described by Siegel (23Siegel M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at 23 °C in glass culture tubes capped with rubber septa stoppers. Samples contained 100 nm IscS, 10 μm pyridoxal phosphate, and 10 mmmagnesium chloride in 0.8 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (7Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of l-cysteine (Sigma) in water containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 20 mm N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and 100 μl of 30 mm ferric chloride. Product was determined by measuring methylene blue formation at 670 nm (23Siegel M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The rate of sulfide production (Vo ) was determined for each concentration of l-cysteine by linear regression analysis, and Km and Vmax values were determined by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to a plot ofVo versus the concentration ofl-cysteine using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). The rates reported represent an average of three independent experiments with error bars corresponding to ±1 S.D. Maximal turnover numbers for different preparations, 8–9 min−1, were slightly greater than the specific activities previously reported for IscS from E. coli (7Flint D.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3416-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which ranged from 3 to 6 mol of sulfide/mol of IscS/min−1 under similar conditions.Km values could not be determined accurately due to limitations in sulfide determination, but a value of 2.7 ± 0.4 μm was estimated from data obtained using cysteine concentrations ranging from 2 to 60 μm. SPR studies were carried out at 25 °C with a Biacore 3000 instrument (Piscataway, NJ) as described previously (17Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proteins were randomly cross-linked to the surface of the sensor chip by amine coupling as recommended by the manufacturer. Experiments were conducted in HKM buffer containing 5 mm DTT at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Prior to injections, all proteins were dialyzed against running buffer. Experiments were repeated three or four times to verify that changes in the sensor chip did not occur during the course of the measurements. A Microcal Omega titration calorimeter (Amherst, MA) was used to investigate the binding of IscU to IscS and IscSΔ376–413 in HKM buffer containing 5 mm DTT using procedures previously described (17Hoff K.G.

Reaction mixtures were prepared under anaerobic conditions (Controlled Atmosphere Chamber; Plas-Labs, Lansing, MI) and contained 1 μm IscS or IscSΔ376–413, 50 μm IscU, and 2 mmferric citrate in HKM buffer. Following a preincubation period of 5 min, reactions were initiated by the addition of 2.5 mml-cysteine and 5 mm DTT. Fe/S cluster formation was monitored by circular dichroism. The visible region absorption spectrum of IscU-Fe/S is given in Ref. 17Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar. Antiserum to purified IscU and immunoblotting methods have been described (17Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Antiserum to IscS was prepared from a single rabbit by Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX) and was used without further purification. Western immunoblotting was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 1:750 dilution of rabbit anti-IscS serum was followed by a 1:10,000 dilution of an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Concentrations of IscS were determined at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 40,600 (m·cm)−1 calculated from its amino acid sequence (28Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar, 29Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 30Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary 1 spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments), and circular dichroism measurements were recorded using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter. We used35S-labeled cysteine to monitor sulfur transfer catalyzed by IscS. To preclude possible involvement of reducing agents as sulfur carriers, all protein samples were extensively dialyzed and diluted to remove dithiothreitol that had been included in the purification procedures. In a typical experiment, IscS (1 μm) was incubated with [35S]cysteine (15 μm) in the absence or presence of acceptor protein (20 μm), separated from residual [35S]cysteine on a size exclusion spin column, and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Sulfur transfer was found to be essentially complete within the time required for reagent separation on spin columns, and reaction labeling profiles therefore represent end points. The locations of proteins on gels were determined by Western immunoblotting, and the pattern and extent of 35S labeling were determined by phosphorimaging. Fig. 1 B shows an experiment to test 35S transfer from IscS to IscU, and the migration positions of IscU and IscS are revealed in the immunoblots shown in Fig. 1, C and D, respectively. Lane 1 shows that in the absence of acceptor, 35S label is incorporated into IscS. Radioactivity is observed in bands corresponding to monomeric (∼45 kDa) and dimeric forms of IscS with the majority of the protein migrating as a monomer under the conditions used. Lanes 2 and 3 show the labeling pattern in the presence of IscU. In the absence of IscS, no significant labeling of IscU is observed (lane 2), but two new bands of 35S radioactivity are observed when a mixture of IscS and IscU is used (lane 3). The lower band corresponds to a dimer of IscU (∼28 kDa), establishing that35S label is transferred from IscS to IscU. The upper band corresponds to a complex formed between IscS and IscU. Based on its migration position, this complex appears to be a heterodimer of IscS and IscU, and it is not possible to determine whether 35S label is present on IscS, IscU, or both proteins. In addition, the amount of label present in the IscS monomer is reduced ∼7-fold compared with that observed in the absence of IscU, and no label appears associated with the IscS dimer (compare lane 1). We assume that the decrease in labeling of IscS reflects a transfer of 35S to IscU because the immunoblot presented in Fig. 1 C, lane 9, shows that approximately half of the IscS remains present as the free monomer under these conditions. The finding that the IscS dimer is not labeled to the same extent as in the absence of IscU (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 1 and 3) also suggests efficient transfer of 35S to IscU. To test the specificity of IscS-mediated 35S transfer, we incubated IscS and [35S]cysteine with several other potential acceptor proteins under similar conditions. No significant label incorporation was obtained using purified recombinant forms of other proteins present in the isc-hsc-fdx operon (24Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), including IscA, HscB (Hsc20), HscA (Hsc66), and ferredoxin (data not shown). IscA, Hsc66, and ferredoxin contain free thiol groups that might be labeled by nonspecific processes, and their failure to serve as acceptors suggests that the labeling observed with IscU reflects specific interactions with IscS. To investigate binding interactions between IscS and IscU, we first used the SPR method. Fig. 2 shows the result of a titration experiment in which IscS was randomly cross-linked to the sensor chip and exposed to different concentrations of IscU. IscU was observed to bind to and dissociate from IscS rapidly (within the mixing time of the experiment) and to exhibit stable complex formation with an apparent binding constant Kd of 2.0 μm. The maximal signal observed corresponds to ∼0.37 mol of IscU bound per mol of IscS, indicating that not all of the immobilized IscS is able to bind IscU. Because complications can arise from surface and/or immobilization effects in SPR, we also used isothermal titration calorimetry to independently determine the binding constant as well as the stoichiometry of the interaction. Fig. 3shows the results of an experiment in which successive additions of IscU were made to a solution containing IscS. The data are plotted as the integrated heats of binding versus the molar ratio of IscU/IscS. The best fit curve shown corresponds to binding of 0.95 mol of IscU/mol of IscS with Kd = 2.2 μm. The binding ratio observed is consistent with the 1:1 complex observed under the partially denaturing electrophoresis conditions used in Fig.1; in solution, however, both IscS and IscU exist as dimers (7Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and it seems likely that the active complex will contain a dimer of each protein. The dissociation constant is similar to that observed in the SPR measurements (Fig. 2), and because cellular levels of IscU and IscS are estimated to be >10 μm, a large fraction of IscU would be expected to be bound to IscS in vivo. 3The cellular concentration of IscU has been estimated by immunoblotting methods to be ∼40 μm in cells grown in rich medium to stationary phase (17Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Similar immunoblotting measurements for IscS using W3110, DH5α, and BL21 strains of E. coli yield a value ∼45 μm(H. D. Urbina and L. E. Vickery, unpublished observations). Additional experiments were carried out using [35S]cysteine to investigate the role of cysteine residues in the mechanism of sulfur transfer between IscS and IscU (Fig. 4). A control reaction is shown in lane 1, and the effects of the addition of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol to samples during or following the transfer reaction are shown inlanes 2 and 3, respectively. The presence of β-mercaptoethanol during the sulfur transfer reaction results in a decrease in label incorporation into both free IscU (∼54% less) and the IscU-IscS complex (∼31% less), but the failure to fully prevent labeling suggests that intermediates formed are at least partially protected from this reductant during the transfer process. The addition of β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min following the reaction, in contrast, leads to complete loss of35S from both IscU and IscS as well as the IscU-IscS complex. The finding that label is released by prolonged exposure to reducing agent is consistent with formation of cysteine persulfide derivatives on IscU as well as on IscS and suggests that the cysteine residues involved are solvent-accessible. To further assess the possible role of cysteine residues, we tested the effects of thiol-blocking reagents on both IscS and IscU. Based on the reactivity of the active site cysteine of NifS (15Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), treatment of IscS withN-ethylmaleimide would be expected to alkylate Cys-328 and inactivate the enzyme. Fig. 4 (lane 4) shows that this treatment completely inhibits 35S incorporation, consistent with involvement of Cys-328 of IscS in persulfide transfer.Lane 5 shows that treatment of IscU with the cysteine carboxymethylation reagent iodoacetic acid blocks the transfer of 35S, and label remains associated with IscS. Only a small amount of 35S is associated with the IscS-IscU complex, suggesting that the majority of the radioactivity inlanes 1 and 2 associated with the IscS-IscU complex is due to labeled IscU. The findings that carboxymethylated IscU will not accept 35S and that β-mercaptoethanol releases 35S from IscU suggest that cysteine residue(s) of IscU serve as acceptor(s) for persulfide transferred from IscS. Differences in the amino acid sequences near the C termini of different NifS and IscS proteins suggest that this region may be important in determining the specificity of interactions with acceptor proteins. To test this possibility, we prepared a truncation mutant of IscS lacking 29 C-terminal residues by insertion of a stop codon at the location of Ser-376. This mutant, designated IscSΔ376–404, was expressed in aniscS − strain of E. coli (31Schwartz C.J. Djaman O. Imlay J.A. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). TheiscS − disruption strain grows poorly on glucose minimal medium (31Schwartz C.J. Djaman O. Imlay J.A. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), but cells expressing IscSΔ376–404 exhibited normal growth rates, suggesting that IscSΔ376–404 was active. The mutant enzyme was purified, and its kinetic properties were compared with full-length wild-type IscS. As shown in Fig.5, IscSΔ376–404 exhibited cysteine desulfurase activity (kcat = 8.3 ± 0.5 min−1; Km = 2.2 ± 0.5 μm) similar to that observed for wild-type IscS (kcat 8.5 ± 0.3 min−1 andKm 2.7 ± 0.4 μm). We next tested the mutant in the 35S transfer assay. As shown in theinset of Fig. 5, the IscSΔ376–404 mutant is active but exhibits reduced 35S transfer activity compared with full-length IscS. With IscSΔ376–404, label incorporation into the band corresponding to the IscU dimer is only 38% of that observed using wild-type IscS. In addition, less labeling is associated with the band corresponding to the IscSΔ376–404-IscU complex compared with the IscS-IscU complex, and a greater portion of label is associated with the uncomplexed dimeric form of the mutant protein. To determine whether the reduced ability of IscSΔ376–404 to transfer sulfur to IscU might result from altered binding, we attempted to investigate the interaction of IscU with IscSΔ376–404 by isothermal titration calorimetry. As shown in Fig. 2, however, no enthalpic change was observed when IscSΔ376–404 was mixed with IscU. This result could reflect a failure of the truncation mutant to bind to IscU but could also arise from a lack of a significant net enthalpic change upon binding of the mutant to IscU. We therefore used SPR as an independent measure of the interaction. Because SPR measurements are sensitive to how substrate molecules are immobilized on the surface, we made use of a competitive binding system in which another protein is immobilized on the chip surface and interactions between IscU and IscS occur in solution. For this purpose, we used Hsc20, a co-chaperone protein shown to bind and target IscU to the molecular chaperone Hsc66 (17Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the results of experiments in which the binding of IscU to immobilized Hsc20 was determined in the absence or presence of full-length or mutant IscS. Under the conditions used, full-length IscS bound to IscU and inhibited its binding to immobilized Hsc20 (87 and 56% inhibition using 0.1 and 0.3 μm IscU, respectively). The mutant IscSΔ376–404, on the other hand, gave significantly less inhibition (∼15% inhibition using 0.1 or 0.3 μm IscU). While it is difficult to determine the exact binding constant of IscSΔ376–404 for IscU by this method, the results indicate a significantly lower affinity than that of the wild-type protein. This finding, together with the reduced activity of IscSΔ376–404 in the 35S transfer assay, suggests that formation of a specific complex between IscS and IscU is required for efficient sulfur transfer. The decreased affinity of IscSΔ376–404 for IscU and its lower activity in 35S transfer to IscU afforded the opportunity to investigate the importance of complex formation between IscS and IscU in assembly of Fe/S clusters on IscU. Fig. 7 shows the rate of formation of the IscU-Fe/S complex using either full-length IscS or the IscSΔ376–404 mutant. In these experiments, cysteine was provided as the source of sulfur, and ferric citrate was used to provide iron. DTT was included to provide reducing equivalents required for cluster generation, and incubations were carried out anaerobically (8Agar J.N. Zheng L. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2136-2137Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K.

A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Fe/S cluster formation was monitored by circular dichroism to avoid complications due to overlapping absorption spectra of IscS and ferric citrate with the IscU-Fe/S complex. The amount of IscU-Fe/S formed using wild-type IscS was found to be similar to the maximal level obtained by the careful addition of sodium sulfide together with ferric citrate (cf. Ref. 17Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, the rate of cluster formation using the wild-type E. coli enzyme was similar to that reported by Agar et al. using IscS and IscU fromA. vinelandii under similar conditions (8Agar J.N. Zheng L. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2136-2137Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The IscSΔ376–404 mutant, however, was less effective in cluster assembly and yielded only 46% of the amount of IscU-Fe/S complex formed using IscS. Because IscSΔ376–404 has desulfurase activity similar to that of wild-type IscS, this result suggests that complex formation between IscS and IscU is important not only for efficient sulfur transfer but also for efficient Fe/S cluster assembly. Previous studies have shown that the cysteine desulfurase enzymes NifS and IscS can provide sulfur for assembly of Fe/S proteins, but the mechanism of sulfur transfer to the acceptor proteins was not determined. The findings described herein provide three lines of evidence that transfer of sulfur from IscS to IscU proceeds by a direct interaction between the two proteins without the involvement of an intermediate sulfur carrier. First, by employing35S-labeled cysteine, we were able to measure sulfur transfer independent of Fe/S protein formation and avoid the use of added reducing reagents required for Fe/S cluster assembly. Sulfur transfer from IscS to IscU was found to proceed efficiently in highly purified samples treated to remove reducing agents, suggesting that intermediate carriers are not required. Second, IscS and IscU were found to form a 1:1 complex with high binding affinity. The dissociation constant observed (Kd ∼2 μm) is well below the estimated cellular concentrations of both IscS and IscU,3 suggesting that the interaction is physiologically relevant. Finally, a mutant form of IscS having lower binding affinity for IscU was found to exhibit reduced activity in both sulfur transfer and in Fe/S cluster assembly experiments. The requirement for high affinity binding between IscS and IscU for efficient sulfur delivery provides additional support for a direct mechanism of sulfur transfer between the two proteins. The finding that the mutant is less effective in Fe/S cluster assembly despite having cysteine desulfurase activity similar to the wild-type protein further suggests that specific interactions between IscS and IscU may in some way facilitate Fe/S cluster assembly as well as sulfur transfer. Specific interactions between IscS and IscU could play a role in determining the pathway of sulfur transfer or in subsequent steps involved in Fe/S cluster formation. The mechanism of sulfur transfer between IscS and IscU is not known, but two results obtained suggest that transfer involves formation of cysteine persulfide derivatives on both IscS and IscU; incubation of reaction products with reducing agent released label as expected for formation of [35S]persulfide-cysteine, and pretreatment of either IscS or IscU with the cysteine-blocking agents prevented35S label incorporation. The finding that IscS and IscU form a high affinity complex suggests that sulfur transfer between the two proteins is likely to proceed by persulfide exchange in which Cys-328 of IscS interacts directly with a specific cysteine residue of IscU. Preliminary crystallographic data obtained for E. coliIscS indicate that Cys-328 is in a solvent-accessible mobile loop 4J. Cupp-Vickery, H. Urbina, and L. Vickery, unpublished observations. as has been proposed for NifS from T. maritima (16Kaiser J.T. Clausen T. Bourenkow G.P. Bartunik H.-D. Steinbacher S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), consistent with such a direct transpersulfidation mechanism. In the case of IscU, however, the cysteine residue that serves as the sulfur acceptor has not been identified. Three cysteine residues are conserved in the sequences of IscU proteins reported to date, but the structure of IscU and solvent accessibility of these residues have not been determined. Two cysteine residues are expected to be involved in Fe/S cluster binding, and it is possible that the third may play a role in sulfur transfer from IscS to the nascent cluster. Our finding that IscU can accept sulfur in the absence of iron suggests that sulfur transfer may precede iron binding. Once iron is bound, release of persulfide sulfur (S0) to the metal cluster as sulfide (S2−) requires reduction, and thus additional electron transfer proteins are likely to be required to complete cluster formation. Studies are under way to investigate the roles of specific residues of IscU in sulfur transfer and to identify other proteins involved in Fe/S cluster assembly.

The nuclear receptor PPARα has been shown to serve as a key transcriptional regulator of this energy metabolic pathway (Ref. 8Gulick T. Cresci S. Caira T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PPARα is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors and binds cognate response elements as an obligate heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). PPARα is ligand-activated by a variety of natural and synthetic agonists, including arachidonic acid derivatives, fibrates, and long-chain fatty acids: metabolic substrates for cardiac FAO enzymes. The important role played by PPARα in cardiac metabolism is underscored by the marked reduction in the basal level of cardiac FAO enzyme gene expression in PPARα −/− mice (10Djouadi F.

Evidence has emerged that PPARα plays a critical role in the energy metabolic stress response in tissues that rely largely on mitochondrial fat oxidation for energy production, such as heart and liver. Under normal physiologic conditions, the expression of cardiac FAO enzyme genes are induced after a short term fast coincident with increased use of fatty acids for myocardial energy production (1Leone T.C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24114-24124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, PPARα −/− mice do not exhibit the expected fasting-mediated induction of most FAO enzyme genes, but instead develop hypoglycemia, exhibit inadequate ketogenesis, accumulate neutral lipid in both heart and liver, and have a high death rate relative to wild-type mice (1Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). In addition, metabolic inhibition experiments and studies of senescent PPARα −/− mice implicate PPARα in the cardiac and hepatic lipid homeostatic response (10Djouadi F. Weinheimer C.J. Saffitz J.E.

Finally, PPARα expression and activity are induced by physiologic stimuli known to increase energy demand and mitochondrial oxidative flux such as electrical activation of canine skeletal muscle (15Cresci S. Wright L.D. Spratt J.A. Briggs F.N. Kelly D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1413-C1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in humans subjected to a course of endurance training (16Horowitz J.F. Leone T.C. Feng W. Kelly D.P. Klein S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E348-E355PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that PPARα serves as a metabolic stress response factor to transduce changes in cellular energy demand and fatty acid uptake into oxidative energy-producing capacity via the transcriptional control of FAO enzyme expression. The response of the postnatal heart to growth and stress stimuli includes activation of a network of signal transduction cascades, including the stress-activated protein kinases, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (reviewed in Refs. 17Sugden P.H.

Given the regulation of PPARα activity during cellular stress, the present study sought to examine whether the p38 stress-activated protein kinase signal transduction cascade influences PPARα activity in heart. Herein, we show that PPARα exists as a phosphoprotein in cardiac myocytes and that p38 activation significantly enhances this state of phosphorylation, leading to an increase in ligand-dependent transactivation of targets and enhanced cooperativity with the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1. Ventricular cardiac myocytes were isolated from 1–2 day-old rats as described (4Barger P.M. Brandt J.M. Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin.

The PPARα-GAL4DBD fusion expression vector was created by subcloning a cDNA encoding mouse PPARα tagged with a NH2-terminal FLAG epitope into pCMXGAL4, which was obtained along with (UAS)3TKLuc from David D. Moore (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Expression vectors for wild-type p38α kinase and constitutively active MKK6 (MKK6b(E)) were obtained from Jiahuai Han (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The expression vector for SRC-1 was a gift of Ming-Jer Tsai and Sophia Y. Tsai (Baylor College of Medicine); the expression vector for PBP was a gift of Janardan K. Reddy (Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL). PPARαS6–21A-GAL4DBD, PPARαS73–77A-GAL4DBD, and PPARαS6–77A-GAL4DBD were created by site-directed mutagenesis of PPARαGAL4DBD using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. CV-1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. SB202190 and oleic acid (250 μm)/BSA complex (Sigma) as well as Me2SO or BSA vehicle were added 12 h after transfection as indicated. Adenovirus expressing both green fluorescent protein and murine PPARα tagged with an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope was created by subcloning the FLAG-PPARα cDNA from PPAR-GAL4DBD into pAdTrackCMV and produced as described (29He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar). Primary cardiac myocytes were infected with FLAG-PPARα-expressing adenovirus 24 h after initial plating at a multiplicity of infection sufficient to infect greater than 95% of the cells based on green fluorescent protein fluorescence. Some plates were treated with SB202190 for 48 h prior to orthophosphate labeling. The cells were then washed and maintained in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 1 mCi of H332PO4 for 3 h. At that time, plates were treated with anisomycin (0.2 μm) (Calbiochem) or Me2SO vehicle with and without SB202190 for an additional 30 min. Following labeling, the cells were washed and scraped into phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), Na3VO4 (200 μm), Na4P2O7 (100 μm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mg/ml). Cells were pelleted and lysed in RIPA buffer plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above. Lysates were precleared with Protein L-Sepharose (Pierce) and then incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antisera (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on Protein L-Sepharose and electrophoresed via SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and imaged via phosphorimager. Western blot analysis to demonstrate loading was performed with anti-PPARα antibody (provided by John Woods and Joel Berger, Merck Co.). A murine PPARα cDNA containing an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope was cloned in-frame with GST in pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant protein was expressed in BL21 bacteria and partially purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. GST-PPARα protein was left bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and in vitro kinase assays were performed with activated p38α kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in 1× kinase reaction buffer (Stratagene). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C, and products were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Site-directed mutagenesis of pGEX-PPARα was performed as above using the same oligonucleotides to produce recombinant proteins containing the identical mutations present in the PPARα-GAL4DBD plasmid series. Values presented in graphs are mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.). Differences between values were analyzed by a one-factor analysis of variance or unpaired Student's t test. To determine whether PPARα is a target for SAPK-mediated phosphorylation in cardiac myocytes, 32P labeling of adenoviral-expressed, epitope-tagged PPARα in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes was performed under serum-free conditions. Immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled FLAG-PPARα demonstrated that PPARα exists as a phosphoprotein under basal culture conditions in cardiac myocytes (Fig.1, lane 1). To determine whether SAPK pathways contribute to the phosphorylation of PPARα in myocytes, phospholabeling experiments were performed in the presence of SB202190, an inhibitor primarily of the p38 kinase pathway. The presence of SB202190 reduced the phosphorylation of FLAG-PPARα (Fig.1, lane 2). Conversely, a brief exposure to anisomycin, an activator of both p38 and JNK kinases, the major SAPK pathways in cardiac myocytes, dramatically increased levels of phosphorylated PPARα (Fig. 1, lane 3). Finally, SB202190 prevented the anisomycin-induced increase in PPARα phosphorylation (Fig. 1,lane 4). Given that SB202190 is capable of inhibiting p38 MAPK and, under certain conditions, the JNK pathway, these data are consistent with PPARα serving as a downstream target of either the p38 MAPK or JNK pathway in cardiac myocytes. The phosphorylation of PPARα shown above could occur as a result either of direct phosphorylation by SAPKs or phosphorylation via other downstream kinases. To examine whether PPARα is a direct substrate of p38 kinase, in vitro kinase assays were performed. Incubation of GST-PPARα fusion proteins with activated p38α kinase resulted in a robust phosphorylation of PPARα (Fig.2, lane 2). Examination of the primary amino acid sequence of murine PPARα reveals a number of putative MAPK (S/T)P recognition sequences, all of which are located in the NH2-terminal A/B domain (Fig. 2). To localize the primary phospho-acceptor sites within PPARα, the in vitrokinase assay was repeated with mutant PPARα proteins containing substitutions of nonphosphorylatable alanines for serines at amino acid positions 6/12/21 (S6–21A), 73/76/77 (S73–77A), or all six putative phospho-acceptor serines (S6–77A). Examination of the relative degree of phosphorylation of the mutant PPARα proteins demonstrated that the major serine phosphorylation sites are localized within the grouping of serines at positions 6, 12, and 21. Although S6–21A is still phosphorylated, this occurs at a significantly reduced degree relative to wild-type and the S73–77A mutant. As expected, no phosphorylation of the S6–77A mutant was observed in this assay, effectively localizing all the p38 kinase phospho-acceptor sites to within the A/B domain. To determine whether activated p38 kinase affects PPARα transactivating function in cardiac myocytes, transient transfection studies were performed with a luciferase reporter construct (MCPT.Luc.781) containing the promoter from the human muscle-type carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (M-CPT I or CPT Iβ) gene, a known cardiac PPARα target involved in the mitochondrial FAO pathway (13Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). MCPT.Luc.781 was transiently transfected into rat neonatal cardiac myocytes in the absence and presence of SB202190. M-CPT I promoter activity was reduced greater than 70% by addition of SB202190 to the medium (Fig.3). When a M-CPT I promoter-reporter construct containing a mutated PPAR response element (MCPT.Luc.781.m1; Ref. 13Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) was used in identical experiments, p38 kinase inhibition had no effect, indicating that an intact PPAR binding site is necessary for the p38 MAPK effect (Fig. 3). These results together with the in vitro kinase data suggest that phosphorylation by p38 kinase augments PPARα-mediated activation of M-CPT I gene transcription in cardiac myocytes. To further examine the functional interaction between p38 kinase and PPARα, MCPT.Luc.781 transfections were performed in CV-1 cells, which are functionally null for PPARα, RXR, and activated p38 kinase. Activation of p38 MAPK was achieved by cotransfection with a constitutively active upstream kinase of p38 kinase (MKK6b(E)) and wild-type p38α. Fig. 4 Ashows that neither p38 kinase activation, via cotransfection of MMK6b(E) with p38α, nor treatment with SB202190 affected the basal activity of MCPT.Luc.781 in CV-1 cells. Ligand-mediated activation of cotransfected PPARα and RXRα was demonstrated with the addition of oleic acid, a known PPARα ligand, to the culture medium (Fig.4 A). In the presence of activated p38 MAPK, the ligand-mediated PPARα induction of M-CPT I promoter activity was significantly greater relative to treatment with ligand alone (20-foldversus 6-fold; Fig. 4 A). This p38 kinase mediated-enhancement of PPARα activity was inhibited by SB202190, confirming that the effect was specific for the p38 kinase pathway. Thus, activated p38 kinase significantly enhances the transactivation properties of the PPARα/RXRα heterodimer. To exclude the possibility that the p38 kinase effects are mediated by PPAR-independent pathways via elements other than the PPARα response element (FARE-1) within the M-CPT I promoter, the cotransfection experiments were repeated with a reporter containing an independent PPAR response element derived from the peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) gene, upstream of a heterologous promoter ((ACO)3TKLuc) (Fig. 4 B). As was observed with MCPT.Luc.781, PPARα/RXRα-mediated transactivation of (ACO)3TKLuc was significantly increased by cotransfection of p38α kinase and MKK6b(E) (Fig. 4 B). In this series of experiments, MKK6b(E)/p38α cotransfection activated PPARα/RXRα heterodimers both in the absence and presence of exogenous ligand. To confirm that PPARα rather than its heterodimeric partner RXR was the direct functional target of activated p38 kinase in the transfection experiments described above, a modified mammalian one-hybrid system was employed. For these experiments, a full-length PPARα-GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion protein (PPARα-GAL4DBD) was cotransfected with a GAL4-responsive reporter ((UAS)3TKLuc) and MKK6b(E)/p38α. The PPARα-GAL4DBD fusion protein retains the ability to be activated by PPARα ligand to a similar degree as that observed earlier in the PPARα/RXRα heterodimer transfections (Fig.5). Cotransfection of MKK6b(E)/p38α with PPARα-GAL4DBD revealed that, in the absence of PPARα ligand, p38α kinase does not activate PPARα-GAL4DBD (Fig. 5). However, a significant increase in PPARα-GAL4DBD activity is seen with p38α activation in the presence of PPARα ligand, demonstrating a ligand-mediated induction of ∼20-fold in the presence of p38 MAPK activation versus 6-fold ligand-mediated induction in the absence of p38 MAPK activation. To exclude the possibility that these results were caused by spurious activation of the JNK pathway, the (UAS)3TKLuc cotransfections were repeated with an expression vector for a c-Jun-GAL4DBD hybrid protein, a known JNK-specific target. c-Jun-GAL4DBD was not activated by MKK6b(E)/p38α but was increased (5-fold) by cotransfection of JNK and its activator MEKK (data not shown), indicating that the observed activation of PPARα-GAL4DBD in CV-1 cells was the result of the specific effects of the p38 kinase pathway. To confirm that the PPARα-GAL4DBD fusion protein does not heterodimerize with endogenous RXR in CV-1 cells, parallel control experiments were performed with addition of the RXR ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid, in the presence or absence of cotransfected RXRα. Addition of 9-cis-retinoic acid with or without cotransfection of RXR had no effect on the target reporter activity in the presence of PPARα-GAL4DBD (data not shown), confirming that RXR is not interacting with PPARα-GAL4DBD in this system and, therefore, is not the mediator of the effect of p38 kinase on PPARα/RXR heterodimer transactivation. These results indicate that p38 MAPK activates PPARα in a RXR-independent manner. Moreover, these data demonstrate that the activation of PPARα by p38 kinase is independent of effects on DNA binding. To determine whether the phosphorylation sites identified within the PPARα A/B domain byin vitro kinase studies confer the functional effects shown above, the mammalian one-hybrid experiments were repeated using full-length PPARα-GAL4DBD expression vectors containing the same mutations used for the in vitro kinase assays. Fig.6 A shows that, as predicted by the results of the in vitro kinase assays, the S6–21A and S6–77A mutants are not responsive to p38α kinase in the absence or presence of PPARα ligand (Fig. 6 A and data not shown). However, MKK6b(E)/p38α-mediated activation of the S73–77A fusion protein is similar to the wild-type protein (Fig. 6 A), a result that is also consistent with the results of the in vitro phosphorylation studies. Fig. 6 B shows that the mutant PPARα-GAL4DBD fusion proteins retain the ability to be activated by PPARα ligand, indicating that A/B domain phosphorylation is not necessary for ligand-dependent AF-2 function in CV-1 cells. These data indicate that phosphorylation of PPARα by p38 kinase on one or more of the serines at position 6, 12, or 21 is responsible for p38-mediated enhancement of PPARα transactivation function. Ligand activation of nuclear receptors leads to recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. We sought to test whether the activation of PPARα by p38 MAPK phosphorylation involved the action of specific coactivators. Cotransfection experiments were performed with PPARα-GAL4DBD expression vectors for wild-type or mutant PPARαs and known PPARα coactivators, including PGC-1 (28Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), SRC-1 (30Dowell P. Ishmael J.E. Avram D. Peterson V.J. Nevrivy D.J. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and PBP (31Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25500-25506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). As we have shown previously (28Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), the wild-type PPARα-GAL4DBD fusion protein was activated by PGC-1 in the presence of ligand (Fig. 7). When cotransfection of PGC-1 was combined with MKK6b(E)/p38α in the presence of ligand, a dramatic increase in PPARα coactivation was seen, nearly 6-fold relative to PGC-1 cotransfection in the absence of p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 7). In striking contrast, although the PPARα-S6–21A-GAL4DBD mutant was PGC-1-responsive to the same degree as wild-type PPARα-GAL4DBD, it was not activated further by MKK6b(E)/p38α in the presence or absence of ligand (Fig. 7). Unlike the results with PGC-1, neither SRC-1 nor PBP coactivation of PPARα-GAL4DBD was influenced by activation of p38 MAPK in these experiments (data not shown), suggesting that phosphorylation of PPARα serves to enhance coactivation by a specific subset of coactivators. PPARα, a lipid-activated transcription factor, plays a critical role in the control of cellular energy metabolism in a variety of physiologic and pathologic states. Evidence has emerged that PPARα activity is modulated in heart and liver during diverse stress responses, including fasting (1Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), cardiac hypertrophy (4Barger P.M. Brandt J.M. Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and cellular hypoxia (32Huss J.M. Levy F.H. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27605-27612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This implies that upstream signaling events activated by cellular stressors are linked to changes in PPARα activity, which in turn regulates mitochondrial energy metabolism. Members of the p38 kinase family, so-called “stress-activated protein kinases,” represent likely candidates to serve as upstream regulators of PPARα. In this report, we show that p38 kinase-mediated phosphorylation activates PPARα in a ligand-influenced manner and results in enhanced functional cooperation with the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1. These results suggest that p38 kinase signaling promotes cardiac mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation during periods of stress. Certain pathologic conditions lead to a decrease in myocardial oxidative energy production through reduced FAO enzyme gene expression linked to antagonism of PPARα activity. For example, the PPARα gene regulatory pathway is deactivated during α1-adrenergic agonist stimulation of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (4Barger P.M. Brandt J.M. Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). We have shown that PPARα activity is diminished by a post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by ERK-MAPK, confirming that signal transduction cascades linked to G-protein-coupled receptors can affect the activity of PPARα. Similarly, the related nuclear receptor, PPARγ, is deactivated by ERK-mediated phosphorylation through a mechanism that reduces affinity for ligand (33Shao D. Rangwaia S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 34Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Given these previous findings, the results shown here indicating that phosphorylation of PPARα by p38 MAPK leads to activation of PPARα function was surprising. Taken together with the results of the ERK-MAPK studies (4Barger P.M. Brandt J.M. Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), we conclude that distinct limbs of the MAPK network, namely ERK and p38, have opposing effects with respect to PPARα activity in the heart. The molecular mechanism(s) underlying this differential response of PPARα to MAPK signaling remains unknown. Our results do not exclude the possibility that, in certain cellular contexts, including cardiac myocytes, the JNK pathway may also alter PPARα activity. A diverse array of molecular consequences have been attributed to nuclear receptor phosphorylation, including increased or decreased ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation (reviewed in Ref. 37Shao D.

Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that p38 MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of PPARα leads to an increase in ligand-dependent transactivating function. We also found that p38-mediated phosphorylation of PPARα results in a strong functional cooperation with PGC-1, a known ligand-influenced PPARα coactivator (28Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we conclude that enhanced interaction with coactivator rather than increased DNA binding or heterodimerization with RXR is the primary mechanism responsible for increased activity. Interestingly, the mechanism described here does not extend to several other ligand-recruited coactivators, including SRC-1 and PBP. We speculate that phosphorylation of PPARα by p38 MAPK not only increases its trans-activating properties but also dictates coactivator selectivity. PGC-1, as an activator of cardiac mitochondrial function and biogenesis (44Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M.

Invest. 2000; 106: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), is a likely component of the energy metabolic stress responses. Previous studies have demonstrated that PPARα exists as a phosphoprotein in primary rat adipocytes (46Shalev A. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Yen P.M. Wahli W. Burger A.G. Chin W.W. Meier C.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4499-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and that insulin signaling leads to phosphorylation of the A/B domain and enhanced AF-1 activity (47Juge-Aubry C.E. Hammar E. Siegrist-Kaiser C. Pernin A. Takeshita A. Chin W.W. Burger A.G. Meier C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10505-10510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our results suggest an alternative mechanism. The earlier studies reported activation of AF-1 activity using a PPARα A/B domain-GAL4DBD fusion construct as the target (47Juge-Aubry C.E. Hammar E. Siegrist-Kaiser C. Pernin A. Takeshita A. Chin W.W. Burger A.G. Meier C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10505-10510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, our results demonstrate that the full-length PPARα-GAL4DBD fusion protein has no constitutive (ligand-independent) AF-1 activity in CV-1 cells (Fig. 5). Moreover, p38 MAPK-mediated phosphorylation does not activate PPARα-GAL4DBD in the absence of ligand, indicating that AF-1 functionper se within the context of the full-length molecule, is not enhanced by A/B domain phosphorylation. These results suggest a functional, if not physical interaction between the AF-1 and AF-2 regions of PPARα following phosphorylation in the context of engaged ligand. It is possible that AF-1 activity is increased by A/B domain phosphorylation only when PPARα is ligand-bound, leading to enhanced interaction with specific coactivators, such as PGC-1. This is similar to the mechanism by which phosphorylation of SF-1 in the AF-1 domain enhances cofactor recruitment only when the ligand-binding domain is present, although SF-1 is not known to be ligand-activated (39Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 521-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Alternatively, phosphorylation of the AF-1 region may lead to direct recruitment of coactivators to AF-1 as is seen with ERβ (40Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence that PGC-1 interacts with the A/B domain of PPARα, although a separate PPARα/PGC-1 interacting protein could serve as an adaptor. In summary, we have shown that p38 MAPK phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor PPARα, leading to enhanced ligand-mediated coactivation by the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1. These results identify PPARα as a target of stress-activated signaling. In cardiac myocytes, p38 MAPK activation would be predicted to increase the capacity for energy production by the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, as a component of the metabolic response to diverse physiologic stressors.

DNA-PK comprises a catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and a DNA-binding Ku70 and Ku80 heterodimer. To define the activities of individual DNA-PK components in DSB repair, we targeted the DNA-PKcs gene in chicken DT40 cells. DNA-PKcs deficiency caused a DSB repair defect that was, unexpectedly, suppressed byKU70 disruption. We have shown previously that genetic ablation of Ku70 confers RAD54-dependent radioresistance on S–G2 phase cells, when sister chromatids are available for HR repair. To test whether direct interference by Ku70 with HR might explain theKu70−/− /DNA-PKcs −/−/− radioresistance, we monitored HR activities directly in Ku- and DNA-PKcs-deficient cells. The frequency of intrachromosomal HR induced by the I-SceI restriction enzyme was increased in the absence of Ku but not of DNA-PKcs. Significantly, abrogation of HR activity by targeting RAD54 in Ku70−/− orDNA-PKcs −/−/− cells caused extreme radiosensitivity, suggesting that the relative radioresistance seen with loss of Ku70 was because of HR-dependent repair pathways. Our findings suggest that Ku can interfere with HR-mediated DSB repair, perhaps competing with HR for DSB recognition. Two major complementary double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways exist in vertebrates, homologous recombination (HR), which involves Rad54, and non-homologous end-joining, which requires the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK comprises a catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and a DNA-binding Ku70 and Ku80 heterodimer.

Vertebrates possess two major, complementary DSB repair pathways, homologous DNA recombination (HR) and nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ). DSB repair by HR uses homologous sequence provided by either a homologous chromosome or sister chromatid, whereas NHEJ joins DNA ends through a process that is largely independent of terminal homologies and that can produce junctions of varying sequence. The HR pathway requires genes of theRAD52 epistasis group, whose products include Rad51 and Rad54. NHEJ is necessary for V(D)J recombination, which generates antibody diversity and is essential for the development of the immune system. The NHEJ pathway requires the DNA-dependent protein kinase, DNA-PK (1Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), XRCC4 (2Li Z. Otevrel T.

The nature of its physiological target(s) in the NHEJ pathway is still uncertain. The Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer binds to DSBs, recruits DNA-PKcs, and eventually stimulates its kinase activity (1Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P.

Although mice deficient in DNA-PK proteins consistently exhibit elevated radiosensitivity and impaired V(D)J recombination, a defect in Ku appears to disrupt end-joining more profoundly than one in DNA-PKcs, because neither V(D)J coding nor signal joints are observed in Ku-deficient mice (11Nussenzweig A.

Remarkably, mice deficient in either XRCC4 or ligase IV show even more severe phenotypes than DNA-PK-deficient mice, exhibiting early embryonic lethality and extensive chromosomal aberrations (18Gao Y. Sun Y. Frank K.M. Dikkes P. Fujiwara Y. Seidl K.J. Sekiguchi J.M. Rathbun G.A. Swat W. Wang J. Bronson R.T. Malynn B.A. Bryans M. Zhu C. Chaudhuri J. Davidson L. Ferrini R. Stamato T. Orkin S.H.

NHEJ and HR play complementary roles in repairing DNA damaged by IR; NHEJ dominates during G1 to early S phase of the cell cycle, and HR is used in late S to G2 phases (20Takata M. Sasaki M.S.

Swagemakers S.M. Vermeij M. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1703-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, the overlap between these two pathways raises the possibility of competition between them. A recent model for vertebrate DSB repair proposed from a biochemical study that competition between NHEJ and HR proteins for the initial binding of a DNA lesion determines the eventual outcome of repair, i.e. whether the lesion is repaired by HR or by NHEJ (22Van Dyck E. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. West S.C. Nature. 1999; 398: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Ku, as the DNA-binding component of NHEJ, is a good candidate for the “switch” controlling entry to this pathway. To test this model and to gain further insight into the interplay between the DNA-PK subunits and HR, we engineered chicken DT40 cells with defective Ku70, DNA-PKcs, or both and examined their IR-induced DSB repair capacities at various cell-cycle stages. Furthermore, because a major prediction of the “competitive” model was that HR frequencies should be elevated in the absence of Ku, we tested the effects of Ku on cellular HR capability directly using expression of the restriction endonuclease I-SceI to generate DSBs. Chicken genomic DNA from the PRKDC locus was amplified using primer pairs designed to amplify between exons 61–63 and 65–69 (23Fujimori A. Araki R. Fukumura R. Ohhata T. Takahashi H. Kawahara A. Tatsumi K. Abe M. Immunogenetics. 2000; 51: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and then used to generate targeting vectors carrying neomycin, hygromycin, or histidinol resistance cassettes. Targeting with these constructs was expected to replace amino acids 2888 to 3012 of DNA-PKcs, which are upstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase homology domain. The previously described chicken KU70 targeting construct pKu70-puro (20Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar) was modified to carry a blasticidin resistance cassette (pKu70-bsr) and a RAD54 vector carrying blasticidin resistance, pRad54-bsr, was cloned from pRad54-neo (24Bezzubova O.Y. Silbergleit A. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. Buerstedde J.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 185-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To make the Ku70 expression constructs, the full-length chicken Ku70 cDNA was ligated into pAneo (25Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), yielding pAneo-GdKu70. The conditions of cell culture were described previously (26Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.-M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). For gene targeting of the chickenDNA-PKcs locus, 107 cells were electroporated with 30 μg of the linearized DNA-PKcs (PRKDC) targeting vectors conferring neomycin, hygromycin, and then histidinol resistance. Drug-resistant colonies were selected in the presence of 2.0 mg/ml G418, 2.5 mg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem), and 1 mg/ml histidinol (Sigma). Genomic DNA was extracted from each clone by standard procedures, and clones that had undergone targeted recombination were identified by PCR or Southern blot analysis. The number of targeting events per analyzed clones following transfection of targeting vectors containing the neomycin, hygromycin, and histidinol resistance genes is 3/4, 4/24, and 3/21, respectively. To generateKU70−/−/DNA-PKcs−/−/− double mutants, a DNA-PKcs −/−/− clone was sequentially transfected with pKu70-puro and pKu70-bsr. The number of targeting events per analyzed puro- and bsr-resistant clones is 16/37 and 3/81, respectively. To makeDNA-PKcs −/−/− /RAD54−/− double mutants, the DNA-PKcs −/−/− clone was sequentially transfected with pRad54-puro and pRad54-bsr. The number of targeting events per analyzed puro- and bsr-resistant clones is 3/40 and 2/85, respectively. Serially diluted cells were plated in triplicate onto 6-well clusters with 5 ml/well of 1.5% (w/v) methylcellulose (Aldrich) plates containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 15% fetal calf serum, 1.5% chicken serum, and 10−5m β-mercaptoethanol. Subsequently, γ-radiation of the cells was performed using 137Cs (0.02 Gy/s; Gammacell 40; Atomic Energy of Canada Limited Industrial Products, Ontario, Canada). Colonies were counted at 7 days after irradiation treatment. Percentage survival was determined relative to numbers of colonies from untreated cells. For cell-cycle analyses, cells were labeled for 10 min with 20 μm BrdUrd (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). They were then harvested and fixed at 4 °C overnight with 70% ethanol and successively incubated as follows: (i) in 4 N HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature; (ii) in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for 1 h at room temperature; (iii) in 5 μg/ml phosphatidylinositol in phosphate-buffered saline. Between each incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal calf serum and 0.1% sodium azide. Subsequent flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Fluorescence data were displayed as dot plots using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). Western blot analysis of DNA-PKcs and Ku70 was performed as described previously (26Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.-M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were lysed in 20 μl of SDS lysis buffer. Following sonication and boiling, the lysates (10 μl/lane) were separated by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. After transfer to a nylon membrane, proteins were detected by anti-DNA-PKcs antiserum (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody and Super Signal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The same lysates (10 μl/lane) were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. After transfer to a nylon membrane, proteins were detected by anti-GdKu70 antiserum (20Takata M.

Modified SCneo (27Johnson R.D. Liu N. Jasin M. Nature. 1999; 401: 397-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into the previously described OVALBUMIN gene construct and then targeted into the OVALBUMIN locus in wild-type,KU70−/− , andDNA-PKcs −/−/− DT40 cells. In transient transfections, 5 × 106 cells suspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline were mixed with each of the following plasmid DNA (30 μg) without linearization: pBluescript SK, I-SceI expression vector (pCBASce), and chicken Ku70 expression vector and electroporated at 250 V, 960 microfarads. 24 h after electroporation, cells were transferred to 96-well clusters containing 2.0 mg/ml G418. Cells were grown for 5–7 days, and surviving G418 resistant colonies were counted. To investigate competition between the two DSB repair pathways, we generated chicken DT40 cells (28Buerstedde J.M. Reynaud C.A. Humphries E.H. Olson W. Ewert D.L. Weill J.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 29Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) with defective Ku70, DNA-PKcs, or both and examined their HR-mediated DSB repair capability and radiosensitivity. The chicken DNA-PKcs gene (Prkdc) lies on chromosome 2, which is trisomic in DT40 cells. Thus, three disruption constructs, DNA-PKcs-neo, DNA-PKcs-hyg, and DNA-PKcs-his (Fig.1 A) were sequentially transfected to generate DNA-PKcs −/−/− clones. Targeted integration was verified by genomic PCR and Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). One DNA-PKcs −/−/− clone was transfected subsequently with two KU70 disruption constructs to generate aKU70−/−/DNA-PKcs−/−/− clone, and the disruption of the DNA-PKcs andKU70 genes was verified by Western blotting using antibodies to human DNA-PKcs and chicken Ku70, respectively (Fig. 1 C). The proliferative properties of KU70−/−, DNA-PKcs −/−/− andKU70−/−/DNA-PKcs−/−/− cells were indistinguishable from those of wild-type cells, as monitored by growth curves and by cell-cycle analysis (data not shown) To monitor the ability of the cells to carry out DSB repair, we performed clonogenic survival assays following DSB induction by γ-irradiation. AsynchronousDNA-PKcs −/−/− cells were more radiosensitive than either wild-type or KU70−/− cells (Fig.2). AsynchronousKU70−/− cells showed a biphasic pattern of radiosensitivity as IR dose increased (Fig. 2), reflecting the presence of two distinct fractions, as we have described previously (20Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). In nocodazole-synchronized populations, KU70−/− cells in G1 to early S phase of the cell cycle, where end-joining is used exclusively (20Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), are extremely sensitive to IR (Fig. 3, A and B).KU70−/− cells in late S–G2 phase, where HR is used preferentially over end-joining for DSB repair, are more resistant to IR than wild-type cells (Fig. 3 C).KU70−/− andDNA-PKcs −/−/− cells showed equal radiosensitivity in G1 to early S phase (Fig.3 B), demonstrating that the NHEJ pathway is impaired to the same extent in either mutant line. However, in late S–G2phase, DNA-PKcs −/−/− cell populations were slightly more radiosensitive than wild-type cells, which contrasts markedly with the enhanced radioresistance ofKU70−/− cells (Fig. 3 C) (20Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar).Figure 3Synchronization of DT40 cells with nocodazole and cell-cycle stage-specific sensitivity to γ-irradiation of cells deficient in NHEJ components. A, indicated cells were synchronized with nocodazole for 7 h or left untreated. At the indicated time points after the removal of nocodazole cells were labeled with BrdUrd (BrdU), harvested, fixed, and subjected to analysis by flow cytometry (20Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E.

Numbers indicate the percentage of cells in the gated regions. 4 (B) or nine (C) h after the removal of nocodazole, most cells are synchronized in G1–early S phase or late S–G2 phase, respectively. At these two time points, the radiosensitivity of synchronized populations was examined, as described for Fig. 2.Error bars show the mean ± S.D. for at least three separate experiments. Two independently targeted clones of each genotype show the same sensitivity to γ-rays (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether the radioresistance of Ku-deficient cells is caused by the absence of Ku or by the presence of DNA-PKcs, we analyzed the radiosensitivity ofKU70−/−/DNA-PKcs−/−/− cells. Strikingly, cells that lack both DNA-PKcs and Ku70 showed the same pattern of radiosensitivity as KU70−/− cells in both asynchronous and synchronized populations (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, B and C). Importantly, the expression ofKU70 cDNA inKU70−/−/DNA-PKcs−/−/− cells increased radiosensitivity to the level ofDNA-PKcs −/−/− cells (Fig. 2). These findings reveal that the absence of Ku70, rather than the presence of Ku-deficient DNA-PKcs, increases the cellular DSB repair capacity in late S to G2 phases. Because NHEJ is disrupted to the same extent in KU70−/− andDNA-PKcs −/−/− cells (Fig. 3 B), these observations suggest that the other major DSB repair pathway, HR, acts more efficiently in the absence of Ku70 in late S–G2. DNA ligase IV-deficient DT40 cells show significantly higher IR sensitivity than DNA-PKcs −/−/− or wild-type cells. Deletion of Ku70 in the DNA ligase IV-deficient cells makes them relatively more radioresistant with a survival profile that matches that of KU70−/− cells (30Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This result supports our data that Ku proteins suppress homologous recombination in late S–G2 phase. A possible complication was potentially aberrant cell-cycle checkpoint response in the mutants described here. Because DT40 cells are p53-deficient, they lack a G1/S arrest. In yeast, Ku70 proteins are involved in G2/M arrest after DNA damage (31Lee S.E. Moore J.K. Holmes A. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). However, after treatment with ionizing radiation, all cell lines described in this paper showed similar G2/M arrest and inhibition of DNA synthesis (data not shown), indicating that our results are not because of any difference in cell-cycle checkpoint. If the model that the different IR sensitivities of KU70−/− andDNA-PKcs −/−/− cells are because of different HR efficiencies is correct, disruption of HR-mediated repair in the two mutants should result in identical IR sensitivity in them. To test this hypothesis, we disrupted HR-mediated DSB repair by targeting the Rad54 gene in KU70−/− andDNA-PKcs −/−/− cells, thus generatingKU70−/−/RAD54−/−/− andDNA-PKcs −/−/− /RAD54−/− clones. Consistent with our model, both clones exhibited the same high level of radiosensitivity (Fig. 4). Therefore, the increased IR tolerance of KU70−/− cells in late S to G2 phase requires functional HR-mediated repair. This conclusion supports the idea that Ku can interfere with HR-mediated DSB repair. To investigate directly the Ku protein's suppression of HR-mediated repair, we measured DSB-induced HR using the SCneo substrate (27Johnson R.D. Liu N. Jasin M. Nature. 1999; 401: 397-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which we integrated into theOVALBUMIN locus of wild-type,KU70−/− , andDNA-PKcs −/−/− cell lines by gene targeting. In each clone containing the modified SCneo, a single DSB was introduced at the I-SceI site by transient expression of the I-SceI endonuclease. Because HR generates a functional neomycin resistance (neo+ ) gene from SCneo, the number of HR events can be determined by counting the number ofneo-resistant colonies (27Johnson R.D. Liu N. Jasin M. Nature. 1999; 401: 397-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Liang F. Han M. Romanienko P.J. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

AKU70−/− clone transfected with an I-SceI expression vector showed significantly higher HR frequencies than a wild-type clone (paired t test,p = 0.0047 < 0.01; see TableI) and aDNA-PKcs −/− cell line (p = 0.0409 < 0.05). Notably, the expression of Ku70 reduced the recombination frequency by 25–40% in KU70−/− cells but not in wild-type DT40s (TableII). The higher level of HR inKU70−/− cells correlates with the increased late S to G2 phase radiotolerance seen in Ku-deficient cells relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, Ku70 expression decreases the frequency of DSB-induced HR, providing a mechanistic explanation for the radiotolerization induced by Ku deficiency.Table IDSB-induced recombination frequencies of NHEJ-deficient cellsDNACell lineRecombination frequency ± S.D.Range of neo+ colony numbersNumber of experimentspBluescript SKWild-type132–1125Ku70 −/−0.14 ± 0.073–155DNA-PKcs −/−/−0.34 ± 0.0811–143I-SceI expression vectorWild-type16900–402005Ku70 −/−2.37 ± 0.7018750–590005DNA-PKcs −/−/−1.62 ± 0.497400–270003PsP OVA + SCneo-puro was stably integrated into theOVALBUMIN locus of wild-type, KU70 −/− and DNA-PKcs −/−/− cell lines by gene targeting. 5 × 106 cells of each genotype were transfected with 30 μg of either the I-SceI expression vector pCBASce (38Richardson C.

To define how the association of Ku with DSBs interferes with HR, we measured the induction of IR-induced subnuclear Rad51 foci and gene targeting efficiency in the presence and absence of Ku. We found no delay in kinetics of Rad51 focus formation in response to IR inKU70−/− cells when compared with wild-type andDNA-PKcs −/−/− cells (data not shown). Thus, the Ku proteins do not necessarily affect the assembly of Rad51 in nucleoprotein filaments at DSBs. There was no significant difference in gene targeting efficiencies in wild-type andKU70−/− cells, whereas a slight reduction of random integration frequencies was observed in the absence of Ku70 (data not shown). Thus, the Ku proteins do not suppress all HR reactions but specifically interfere with HR-mediated DSB repair. Presumably, the association of Ku with DSBs may disturb D-loop formation, i.e. interaction of the nucleoprotein filaments with homologous sequences and/or inhibit DNA synthesis following D-loop formation. Although genetic analyses of DNA repair in DT40 cells have recapitulated consistently the results gleaned from mammalian systems, there seems to be a quantitative difference in the relative usage of the two DSB repair pathways in late S to G2 phase, with HR apparently playing a more important role in DSB repair in DT40 cells than in mammalian cell lines (20Takata M.

In contrast, deletion of the Ku genes in mammalian cell lines including murine embryonic stem (ES) cells consistently increases their IR sensitivity (13Gao Y. Chaudhuri J. Zhu C. Davidson L. Weaver D.T. Alt F.W. Immunity. 1998; 9: 367-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 35Gu Y. Jin S. Gao Y. Weaver D.T. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8076-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). However, asynchronous Ku70-deficient ES cells show a biphasic survival curve with increasing radiation dose, being highly radiosensitive up to 2 Gy and less sensitive at doses of 2–4 Gy. This biphasic curve likely reflects two distinct fractions with different IR sensitivities, as observed in Ku70-deficient DT40 cells, although no data exist for synchronized ES cells. DNA-PKcs-null mutant ES cells exhibit no radiosensitivity, suggesting that DNA-PKcs is not required for end-joining in ES cells (13Gao Y. Chaudhuri J. Zhu C. Davidson L. Weaver D.T. Alt F.W. Immunity. 1998; 9: 367-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, because Gao et al.(13Gao Y. Chaudhuri J. Zhu C. Davidson L. Weaver D.T. Alt F.W. Immunity. 1998; 9: 367-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) also showed that primary fibroblasts derived from DNA-PKcs-null mice were significantly more radiosensitive than those from wild-type mice, as has been observed in other DNA-PKcs-deficient mammalian cell lines, the requirement for DNA-PKcs in NHEJ may vary between tissues and cell lines. Therefore, the occasional discrepancies of between the results of IR sensitivity we have obtained using DT40 and those obtained in mammalian cells may actually prove useful in choosing appropriate experimental models for investigating NHEJ. Finally, more prominent enhancement of HR caused by defective Ku70 than by DNA-PKcs deficiency has been also observed in mammalian cells. 2A. J. Pierce, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, personal communication. Accumulating evidence points to the use of differential HRversus NHEJ depending on the cell-cycle phase, although cell type may further influence the competitive balance between these two complementary DSB repair pathways. Defective Rad51 focus formation following IR in G1 phase implies the presence of regulatory mechanisms that can specifically suppress HR at the step of formation of nucleoprotein filaments (36Bishop D.K. Ear U. Bhattacharyya A. Calderone C. Beckett M. Weichselbaum R.R. Shinohara A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21482-21488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A defect in this suppression might lead to ectopic recombination and heteroallelic recombination, possibly causing the loss of heterozygosity and eventually tumorigenesis. Conversely, a defect in suppressive regulation of the end-joining pathway could interfere with other repair pathways, as well as the HR-mediated repair pathway (37Haber J.E. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 259-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). As an example of this, we found that Ku70-deficient DT40 cells are rather more tolerant than wild-type cells of the chemotherapeutic DNA damage-inducing agent cisplatin, which does not directly induce DSBs (20Takata M.

Thus, the molecular regulation of the DSB repair pathway to be used may determine the sensitivity of various tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Further understanding of this balance will grant us insight into the chromosomal events preceding malignant transformation. We thank Dr. T. Honjo (Kyoto, Japan) and D. J.

https://openalex.org/W3105912696,"Although crystals are usually quite stable, they are sensitive to a disordered environment: even an infinitesimal amount of impurities can lead to the destruction of crystalline order1. The resulting state of matter has been a long-standing puzzle. Until recently it was believed to be an amorphous state in which the crystal would break into ‘crystallites’2. But a different theory3 predicts the existence of a novel phase of matter: the so-called Bragg glass, which is a glass and yet nearly as ordered as a perfect crystal. The ‘lattice’ of vortices that contain magnetic flux in type II superconductors provide a good system to investigate these ideas4. Here we show that neutron-diffraction data of the vortex lattice provides unambiguous evidence for a weak, power-law decay of the crystalline order characteristic of a Bragg glass. The theory also predicts accurately the electrical transport properties of superconductors; it naturally explains the observed phase transitions4,5,6 and the dramatic jumps in the critical current7,8 associated with the melting of the Bragg glass. Moreover, the model explains experiments as diverse as X-ray scattering in disordered liquid crystals9,10 and the conductivity of electronic crystals11,12."

What determines the fate of a specific receptor type after it is internalized is poorly understood. Here we show that the rapidly recycling β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) binds via a determinant including the last three amino acids in its carboxyl-terminal tail to the membrane fusion regulatory protein,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF). This is documented by in vitro overlay assays and by cellular coimmunoprecipitations. Receptors bearing mutations in any of the last three residues fail to interact with NSF. After stimulation with the agonist isoproterenol, a green fluorescent protein fusion of NSF colocalizes with the wild type β2AR but not with a tail-mutated β2AR. The β2AR-NSF interaction is required for efficient internalization of the receptors and for their recycling to the cell surface. Mutations in the β2AR tail that ablate NSF binding reduce the efficiency of receptor internalization upon agonist stimulation. Upon subsequent treatment of cells with the antagonist propranolol, wild type receptors return to the cell surface, while tail-mutated receptors remain sequestered. Thus, the direct binding of the β2AR to NSF demonstrates how, after internalization, the fate of a receptor is reliant on a specific interaction with a component of the cellular membrane-trafficking machinery.

An almost universal feature of these receptors is their ability to be desensitized in response to prolonged exposure to ligand (1Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). This is achieved mainly by the action of GPCR kinases that only phosphorylate agonist-occupied receptor molecules, allowing βarrestin molecules to then bind and physically interdict further coupling of the receptor to heterotrimeric G proteins (2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Receptor desensitization is usually accompanied by the rapid internalization of the receptor molecules. This serves two main purposes. Firstly, it allows a cell to resensitize its responsiveness to a ligand by trafficking the receptors through a series of intracellular vesicular compartments in which they are returned to a naı̈ve state (i.e. dephosphorylated) before recycling them back to the cell surface (3Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar, 4Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Secondly, by trafficking the receptors to alternative vesicular structures in which they are degraded, a cell can permanently reduce the receptor density in the plasma membrane and thus diminish its responsiveness to subsequent exposures to the ligand (7Tsao P. Cao T. von Zastrow M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 91-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 8Futter C.E. Pearse A. Hewlett L.J. Hopkins C.R. J.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 329-338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proportion of a GPCR that is targeted for recycling or degradation varies greatly between receptor types, as do the rates with which these two processes occur. Some GPCRs, including the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR), are rapidly recycled back to the cell surface within minutes of being internalized (3Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 19Hoxie J.A. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Pizarro S. Parton R. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13756-13763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The postendocytic fate of some receptors appears to be determined by the mechanism by which they are internalized (20Roettger B.F. Rentsch R.U. Pinon D. Holicky E. Hadac E. Larkin J.M. Miller L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1029-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 21Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). For others it is an intrinsic property of the receptor molecule itself. This is demonstrated most clearly in situations where two types of receptors internalizing by the same mechanism subsequently suffer different postendocytic fates. For example, in HEK293 cells both the β2AR and δ opioid receptor are internalized through clathrin-coated pits, but while almost all the β2AR is then rapidly recycled, the δ opioid receptor is mainly targeted to lysosomes for degradation (18Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies utilizing receptor chimeras between the β2AR and vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) (16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and between the substance P receptor and the thrombin PAR1 receptor (22Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have shown that interchanging the carboxyl termini of receptors is sufficient to bestow the recycling or degradative sorting properties of one receptor onto the other. From such studies it has been hypothesized that there exist domains within the carboxyl termini of receptors that act as determinants of receptor fate. These domains are presumably amino acid sequences that act as specific binding sites for protein factors involved in sorting, trafficking, and recycling or degrading the receptor. One such domain, a serine cluster in the tail of the V2 receptor, has implicated the βarrestins as members of this group of factors (15Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13096-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Upon agonist binding, phosphorylation of the V2R within the cluster promotes the formation of a stable complex between the receptor and βarrestin. The complex is subsequently internalized and targeted to a recycling pathway in which the receptor is detained within endosomal compartments for long periods of time before being returned to the cell surface. Furthermore, removal of such a serine cluster from, or its addition to, the tail of a receptor is sufficient to bestow on it fast or slow recycling kinetics. A number of other proteins have been identified that interact with the tails of specific receptors (23Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Fraser I.D. Cong M. Kim J. Rollins E.N. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Scott J.D. Curr.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). While in some cases such proteins have been shown to alter the rate of receptor internalization, their effects on receptor fate are largely unknown. One exception is the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF), which binds to the tails of a small number of GPCRs including the β2AR (26Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T.

Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Disruption of the interaction between the β2AR and NHERF is accompanied by a shift in the postendocytic sorting of the receptor from being rapidly recycled to instead being mostly targeted for degradation (28Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). It is likely that NHERF represents just one member of a large group of factors that influence the fate of specific sets of GPCRs. Identification of these factors is an important step in furthering our understanding of the complex mechanisms that regulate receptor fate. Here we describe the identification of such a fate-determining factor for the β2AR, the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF), and describe its ability to regulate the sorting of the internalized receptor.

Products were restriction digested with HpaI andXbaI and used to replace the equivalent fragment in the FLAG-β2AR/pcDNA3 construct. The sequences of the clones were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis. Fragments and point mutations of the β2ARct flanked byEcoRI and SalI restriction sites were generated by PCR using the FLAG-β2AR/pcDNA3 clone as template DNA. The PCR products were purified and digested with EcoRI andSalI and ligated into the pGEX-4T vector. The sequences and orientations of the clones were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis. A DNA fragment encoding amino acids 328–413 of the human β2AR and flanked by EcoRI andSalI sites was amplified by PCR and ligated into theEcoRI and SalI restriction sites of the pAS2–1 vector DNA. This construct (pAS2–1/β2ARct) was used as bait to screen a rat brain cDNA library in pGAD10 (CLONTECH). Plasmid pAS2–1/β2ARct and the rat brain cDNA library were cotransformed into yeast strain PJ69–4A using standard yeast transformation protocols from the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast were plated on selective medium (SD-Leu-Trp-His, + 2 mm 3-aminotriazole) and allowed to grow for 4–6 days at 30 °C. Yeast colonies capable of growth were restreaked on selective medium plates (SD-Leu-Trp-Adenine or SD-Leu-Trp-His). Plasmid DNA was rescued from clones that exhibited growth on both selective media plates and were then transformed into DH5α Escherichia coli cells. Plasmid DNAs were purified, sequenced, and then identified using the BLAST search program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site.

Samples were resolved on 10% or 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (Novex) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters for immunoblotting. Filters were blocked with 5% w/v fat-free milk powder in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TTBS: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mmNaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate primary antisera. After thorough washing in TTBS, filters were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed again with TTBS, immersed in ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and exposed to x-ray film. HEK293 cells overexpressing FLAG-β2AR, FLAG-β2AR-412A, or FLAG-β2AR-410A alone, or FLAG-β2AR and FLAG-β2AR-412A with NSF were stimulated with 10 μm isoproterenol for various times. Agonist-induced receptor internalization was measured as the loss of cell surface FLAG epitopes available for M2 antibody binding by detection of a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody as previously described (31Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For recycling experiments, 10 μm of the antagonist propranolol was added to displace isoproterenol and return the receptors to an inactive state. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-β2AR or FLAG-β2AR-412A and with NSF-GFP. Under serum free conditions, transfected cells were treated with or without isoproterenol at 37 °C for various times. To look at receptor recycling, 10 μm propranolol was added for an additional 20 min after 30 min of isoproterenol treatment. Cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with M2 anti-FLAG antibody (1:250) in 0.1% Triton X100 solution for 45 min. Receptors were then labeled with Texas Red-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:250) in 0.1% Triton X100 solution. NSF-GFP and Texas Red-labeled receptor were visualized with a Zeiss LSM-510 laser confocal microscope. 4 μg of GST-fusion proteins were resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked with 5% w/v fat-free milk powder in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TTBS: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in a solution containing 100 nm purified NSF. Blots were then washed three times with TTBS buffer and incubated with anti-NSF monoclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TTBS, filters were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed again with TTBS, immersed in ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and exposed to x-ray film. To identify potential binding partners for the tail of the β2AR, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat brain cDNA library was performed using as bait the GAL4 binding domain fused to residues 328–413 (the entire carboxyl terminus) of the β2AR. In this manner three clones encoding the rat NSF (32Novick P. Ferro S. Schekman R. Cell. 1981; 25: 461-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 33Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) were isolated, which allow growth on selective media plates of yeast coexpressing both fusion proteins (data not shown). The interaction is detectable in vitro using an overlay assay where recombinant NSF binds to a GST fusion protein of the β2AR tail but not to a GST fusion of the β1 adrenergic receptor (β1AR) tail or to GST alone (Fig.1 A). Furthermore, NSF coexpressed in COS7 cells with epitope-tagged receptors is detected specifically in immunoprecipitates of the β2AR and not in those of β1AR or of control cells lacking a tagged receptor (Fig.1 B). Moreover, NSF coexpressed in cells with epitope-tagged receptors is only detected in immunoprecipitates of the wild type β2AR and not in those of β2AR mutants carrying deletions of 53 and 28 residues from the distal region of the tail (Fig.2 A). These data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal tail of the β2AR contains all the determinants required for the receptor to interact with NSF.Figure 2Mapping of the NSF binding site in the β2AR. A, tail truncation mutants of the β2AR fail to bind NSF. In COS7 cells, His6-NSF-c-Myc was overexpressed alone or with wild type FL-β2AR (wt: residues 1–413), FL-β2ART385 (residues 1–385) or FL-β2ART360 (residues 1–360). After treating the cells with a cell-permeable cross-linker, receptors were immunoprecipitated (IP: FL-ARs) using M2 anti-FLAG affinity beads, and proteins resolved by PAGE. The amount of NSF in the immune complex (upper panel) and cell lysate (lower panel) was detected with an anti-hexahistidine antiserum (IB: His6-NSF). Results are representative of three experiments. B, the β2AR carboxyl terminus confers NSF binding on the V2R. In COS7 cells, HA-tagged V2 receptor (HA-V2R), V2β2, and β2V2 receptor chimeras were overexpressed together with His6-NSF-c-Myc. Cells were treated with a cell-permeable cross-linker, receptors were immunoprecipitated (IP: HA-ARs) using 12CA5 anti-HA affinity beads, and proteins resolved by PAGE. The amount of NSF in the immune complex (upper panel) and cell lysate (lower panel) was detected with an anti-hexahistidine antiserum (IB: His6-NSF). Results are representative of three experiments. C, schematic diagram showing the GST-β2AR tail fusion proteins used in overlay assays to determine the region to which NSF binds. D, overlay assays identify the distal region of the β2AR as the NSF binding domain. 4 μg of the GST-fusion proteins represented in C were separated by PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (loading of proteins was assessed by Coomassie staining an identical gel, upper panel). The filter was incubated overnight in 100 nmpurified NSF protein and washed, and a Western blot was performed using an anti-NSF monoclonal antibody (NSF overlay, IB: NSF,bottom panel). Results are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) This hypothesis was tested further by comparing the NSF binding ability of β2AR and vasopressin V2 receptor chimeras, whose tails had been interchanged (Fig. 2 B). NSF is detectable in immunoprecipitates of the V2 receptor chimera carrying the β2AR tail but is absent or only weakly detectable in immunoprecipitates of the wild type V2 receptor or of the β2AR chimera carrying the V2 receptor tail. These data demonstrate that the presence of the β2AR tail is sufficient to confer on a receptor the ability to bind NSF. The site in the tail of the β2AR responsible for binding to NSF was mapped further using a series of GST fusion proteins of fragments of the β2AR tail in overlay assays with recombinant NSF (Fig. 2,C and D). Deletions of large sections of the proximal region of the tail do not affect its ability to bind NSF (residues 329–359 or 329–384 deleted), indicating that NSF interacts at a site within the last 28 residues of the tail. This finding is in agreement with the coimmunoprecipitation data from the β2AR truncation mutants, where deletion of the distal 28 residues of the tail also ablates NSF binding (Fig. 2 A). Indeed, a GST fusion consisting of just this distal region of the tail retains the ability to bind NSF (GST 385–413 in Fig. 2, Cand D). Furthermore, a GST fusion protein of the β2AR tail lacking just the final 10 amino acids (GST 329–403) no longer binds NSF. These data indicate that all the components of the NSF binding domain in the β2AR reside within the distal 10 residues of the tail, thus making it possible to precisely define the key residues responsible for this interaction. This was done utilizing the NSF overlay approach with GST-β2AR tail fusions in which each of the last 10 residues was sequentially mutated to alanine. While mutations at the seven proximal sites have no effect on the ability of the tail to interact with NSF, mutations at any of the last three residues (S411A, L412A, or L413A) ablate NSF binding (Fig.3 A). Introduction of the equivalent mutations in to the tail of the β2AR greatly reduces the quantity of NSF detectable in immunoprecipitates of the β2AR from cells overexpressing both the proteins (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, another GPCR that has three residues at the end of its tail that are similar to those of the β2AR, the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor (SLV rather than SLL), also binds NSF (data not shown). It has been reported previously that the NHERF binds via a PDZ domain to the same region of the β2AR tail as is demonstrated here for NSF (27Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 28Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). NSF does not contain a PDZ domain, and therefore it must be interacting with the tip of the β2AR tail through a wholly different mechanism than that utilized by NHERF. In support of this, sequential mutation analysis of the β2AR tail has revealed different residue requirements for NHERF and NSF binding; in particular, an alanine at position 412 does not affect NHERF binding while it decreases NSF binding, and an alanine at position 410 ablates NHERF binding but does not affect NSF binding (shown here by cellular coimmunoprecipitations in Fig. 3, B and C and by in vitrooverlay in Ref. 27Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). If the sites of interaction of NHERF and NSF do indeed overlap, we would expect that the binding of one protein to the β2AR tail should inhibit the binding of the other. We tested this by measuring what effect overexpression of NHERF has on the ability of NSF to coimmunoprecipitate with the β2AR (Fig.4). Coexpression of both NHERF and NSF with the β2AR leads to a complete loss of NSF from receptor immunoprecipitates, while NHERF is now detected. This is supportive of the concept that NSF and NHERF share an overlapping binding domain within the tail of the β2AR and that NHERF is capable of competing with NSF for binding to this site. Having demonstrated that NSF can bind to the tail of the β2AR, we then investigated the sites at which the interaction occurs in cells using a GFP-tagged NSF molecule and fluorescent-labeled antibodies for detecting the epitope-tagged β2AR. In unstimulated HEK293 cells, the majority of the β2AR is located at the cell surface in the plasma membrane, while NSF is evenly distributed throughout the cytosol with a small amount colocalizing with the β2AR at the plasma membrane-cytosol interface (Fig. 5). After agonist stimulation with (-) isoproterenol, the β2AR undergoes endocytosis into the cell to collect in small puncta, presumably endocytic vesicular structures that enlarge with prolonged exposure of the cells to agonist. The initial weak colocalization of the receptor with NSF becomes more pronounced with continuing exposure to agonist and occurs mainly at the vesicular structures within the cytosol (Fig.5, lower panels). As would be expected for a mutant receptor that is unabl"

Here, we report the molecular mechanism by which PARP-1 activates the sequence-specific binding of NF-κB to its oligodeoxynucleotide. We co-incubated pure recombinant human PARP-1 and the p50 subunit of NF-κB (NF-κB-p50) in the presence or absence of βNAD+ in vitro. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that, when PARP-1 was present, NF-κB-p50 DNA binding was dependent on the presence of βNAD+. DNA binding by NF-κB-p50 was not efficient in the absence of βNAD+. In fact, the binding was not efficient in the presence of 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) either. Thus, we conclude that NF-κB-p50 DNA binding is protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation dependent. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis revealed that PARP-1 physically interacts with NF-κB-p50 with high specificity in the absence of βNAD+. Because NF-kB-p50 was not an efficient covalent target for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, our results are consistent with the conclusion that the auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction catalyzed by PARP-1 facilitates the binding of NF-κB-p50 to its DNA by inhibiting the specific protein·protein interactions between NF-κB-p50 and PARP-1. We also report the activation of NF-κB DNA binding by the automodification reaction of PARP-1 in cultured HeLa cells following exposure to H2O2. In these experiments, preincubation of HeLa cells with 3-AB, prior to oxidative damage, strongly inhibited NF-κB activation in vivo as well.

It is also a phylogenetically ancient protein widely conserved in eucaryotes, with a noticeable exception in yeast (2D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The modular structure of PARP-1 indicates that this protein contains bipartite zinc fingers (5Mazen A. Menissier-de Murcia J. Molinete M. Simonin F. Gradwohl G. Poirier G. de Murcia G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4689-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in its N-terminal sequence. When bound to DNA nicks, the zinc finger motifs activate the C-terminal catalytic domain of PARP-1 to processively transfer the ADP-ribose moiety from βNAD+ to covalently modify acceptor proteins (5Mazen A.

During this process, numerous nuclear proteins, including histones, DNA polymerases and ligases, Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonuclease, and transcription factors (e.g. TFIIF, YY1, and p53) are covalently poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated in vitro and/orin vivo (8Tanaka Y.

Furthermore, PARP-1 appears to also be involved in cellular commitment to apoptosis, because the proteolytic cleavage of PARP-1 by caspases 3 and/or 7 is frequently used as a hallmark of apoptotic execution (14Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar, 15Oliver F.J. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1282-1288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been suggested that the cleavage of PARP-1 allows cells to conserve energy reserves (βNAD+ and ATP) by inactivating the ADP-ribose polymerizing activity of PARP-1 (15Oliver F.J. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1282-1288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Until recently, most studies on PARP-1 had focused on its enzymatic activity following DNA damage (1de Murcia G. Menissier de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 2D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, it has also been suggested that PARP-1 may play a more sophisticated molecular role in chromatin structure and function by forming protein complexes with other proteins. For example, PARP-1 physically associates with DNA polymerase α and stimulates DNA replication in vitrowithout degrading βNAD+ (16Simbulan C.M. Suzuki M. Izuta S. Sakurai T. Savoysky E. Kojima K. Miyahara K. Shizuta Y. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 93-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PARP-1 enhances activator-dependent transcription as an active component of the pre-initiation complex in vitro, and this enhancement appears to be silenced by its auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (17Meisterernst M. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2261-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Roeder and co-workers (18Slattery E. Dignam J.D. Matsui T. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5955-5959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously concluded that transcription factor TFIIC, a protein that stimulated nick translation, was identical to PARP-1. More recently, PARP-1 has also been shown to bind the oncogenic protein B-MYB to enhance its transactivating property (19Cervellera M.N. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10692-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, PARP-1 may regulate the expression of specific genes by physical association with specific transcription factors. A good example for PARP-1-regulated gene expression events may be execution of the cell death program (15Oliver F.J. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1282-1288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because the degradation of PARP-1 triggers the execution phase of apoptosis (14Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar) and NF-κB is considered an anti-apoptotic transcription factor, we hypothesized that the nuclear activation of NF-κB might also be regulated by PARP-1. Transcription factor NF-κB was originally described in B-lymphoid cells (20Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). Classic NF-κB is a heterodimer composed of a DNA-binding p50 subunit and a transactivating p65-subunit (RelA). NF-κB is pre-synthesized in the cytosol and immediately sequestered as a protein complex with IκB in the cytoplasm (21Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). NF-κB is activated for nuclear translocation by specific extracellular stimuli. In fact, this phenomenon has been shown to be independent of protein synthesis (22Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). A plethora of heterogeneous, seemingly unrelated signal molecules, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), lipopolysaccharide, γ-radiation, etoposide, or H2O2 can activate NF-κB in target cells. These stimuli activate a signal transduction cascade that targets IκB degradation in the cytoplasm. As a result of this process NF-κB reveals its nuclear localization signal and translocates to the nucleus. The rapidly nuclear-translocated NF-κB activates genes concerned with inflammatory or immune responses such as inducible nitric-oxide synthase, IL-1 β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Other studies have shown that NF-κB activation is accompanied by the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (23Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar, 24Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Res.

Traenckner E.B. Meier B. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27136-27142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For example, the addition of micromolar concentrations of H2O2 can also activate NF-κB in Jurkat and HeLa cells, a process that may be blocked in the presence of antioxidants (23Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar, 25Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). The notion that H2O2 may specifically lead to NF-κB nuclear targeting is noteworthy, because H2O2 can also activate the protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation pathway and automodification reaction of PARP-1 by causing DNA strand breaks (27Schraufstatter I.U.

As indicated above, eucaryotic gene expression may be controlled by the physical association of specific transcription factors with other proteins, such as PARP-1, which together form a multiprotein complex on enhancers and promoters (30Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). For example, studies have recently suggested that PARP-1 participates in the regulation of eucaryotic transcription and gene expression, including NF-κB (17Meisterernst M. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G.

In fact, PARP-1 was shown to be required for proper NF-κB activation in lipopolysaccharide-treated mice (33Oliver F.J. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nacci C. Decker P. Andriantsitohaina R. Muller S. de la Rubia G. Stoclet J.C. de Murcia G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4446-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the NF-κB activation-dependent transcription of nitric-oxide synthase was suppressed by PARP-1 inhibitors in murine macrophages (31Le Page C. Sanceau J. Drapier J.C. Wietzerbin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the exact biochemical mechanism that mediated the PARP-1-dependent transcriptional activation was not shown. Therefore, to determine the biochemical role of PARP-1 in NF-κB activation in vitro, we co-incubated pure PARP-1 and the p50 subunit of NF-κB (NF-κB-p50) in the presence or absence of βNAD+. Our study illustrates the βNAD+-dependent binding of NF-κB-p50 to its oligodeoxynucleotide, a reduction in the DNA binding efficiency by 3-AB, and the physical interaction of PARP-1 with NF-κB-p50. Furthermore, our study also demonstrates a strong relationship between protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and NF-κB activation in oxidatively stressed HeLa cells. Construction of recombinant baculovirus containing cDNA of human PARP-1, its expression inSpodoptera frugiperda, and protein purification are described elsewhere (34Beneke S. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Burkle A. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For Fig. 4 B (see below), human PARP-1 and human NF-κB-p50 (Promega) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a mixture (20 μl) containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μg/ml synthetic octameric DNA (5′-GGAATTCC-3′, Integrated DNA Technologies) (35Grube K. Burkle A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11759-11763Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). For this experiment, we used32P-labeled βNAD+ (ICN) as a substrate. The reaction was terminated by adding 2× SDS sample buffer, and proteins were fractionated through a 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide gel. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For Fig. 4 A, pure PARP-1 and NF-κB-p50 were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a mixture (20 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (12Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Schweiger M. Ziegler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31644-31647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this case, we used 32P-labeled βNAD+as a substrate. Cold NF-κB oligodeoxynucleotide (≈2.5 ng of DNA) was then added, and the mixtures were further incubated for another 20 min. After terminating the reaction with 2× SDS sample buffer, proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE through a 4 to 15% gradient gel. For the radiolabeled probe of NF-κB, a duplex oligodeoxynucleotide containing the consensus sequence (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) and T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase (United States Biochemical Corp.). For EMSA with purified proteins, pure PARP-1 and NF-κB-p50 were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (12Oei S.L. Griesenbeck J. Schweiger M. Ziegler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31644-31647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In some reactions, βNAD+ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 3aminobenzamide (3-AB) (Sigma Chemical Co.), or duplex octameric DNA (5′-GGAATTCC-3′) was included. Equal amounts of32P-labeled NF-κB oligodeoxynucleotide (≈2.5 ng) were added, and the mixtures (20 μl) were incubated for another 20 min. Samples were separated at room temperature through a native 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 17.8 mm Tris borate and 0.4 mm EDTA. Protein-oligodeoxynucleotide complexes were visualized by autoradiography. For EMSA with HeLa nuclear extracts, cell treatment and nuclear extract preparation were done immediately before EMSA. Extracts containing 10 μg of protein each, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the binding buffer before 32P-labeled NF-κB oligodeoxynucleotide (≈1.5 ng) were added. Reactions (20 μl) were incubated for another 15 min, and samples were electrophoresed through a native 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA. For the identification of protein·oligodeoxynucleotide complex, 1 μg each of NF-κB-p50 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control antibody (PAb421 for p53; Oncogene Research) was incubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min at 4 °C before poly(dI-dC) and 32P-labeled NF-κB oligodeoxynucleotide were added. In the competition experiment shown in Fig. 1 below, we determined the off-rate for NF-κB-p50 from its DNA probe by EMSA also. To accomplish this, we incubated 80 ng each of NF-κB-p50 with pure32P-labeled NF-κB oligodeoxynucleotide (Promega) in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled oligodeoxynucleotide probe for 20 min at room temperature. Equimolar amounts of PARP-1 (800 ng) and NF-κB-p50 (350 ng) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (19Cervellera M.N. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10692-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As a control experiment, NF-κB-p50 (350 ng) alone was also incubated. Protein was immunoprecipitated for 1 h at 4 °C with goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immune complexes were pulled-down by adding 30 μl of protein G-agarose beads (1:1 slurry) and incubating for 45 min at 4 °C with rocking. Beads were washed five times with the same buffer and adding 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min eluted the bead-bound proteins. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE using an 8% gel under non-reducing conditions, and proteins were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was immunoblotted with rabbit anti-NF-κB-p50 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and NF-κB-p50 was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma) and an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa (CCL-2; American Type Culture Collection) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 and air. For H2O2 and 3-AB treatment, exponentially growing cells were seeded in disc plates (≈0.4 × 106 cells/60-mm-diameter disc) 20–24 h before treatment. Cells were pre-treated with 10 mm 3-AB or its vehicle control for 1 h before treatment with H2O2for 1 h. H2O2 was diluted from 30% stock (Sigma) immediately before use. The vehicle did not interfere with NF-κB DNA binding (data not shown). Extracts were prepared by a modified method from Dignam et al. (36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9168) Google Scholar) immediately before EMSA. Treated cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested to microcentrifuge tubes, and briefly centrifuged (16,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 s). Cells were washed again with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended at 4 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors (5 μg each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin per ml). Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, then Nonidet P-40 (0.15% final conc.) was added, and each sample was vigorously mixed. Nuclei were pelleted (16,000 ×g, 4 °C, 30 s) and resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors (5 μg each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin per milliliter). Nuclear lysates were maintained on ice for 15 min with occasional mixing. Nuclear extracts were cleared (16,000 × g, 4 °C, and 5 min) and transferred to new tubes. For 3-AB-pretreated cells, 10 mm of the inhibitor was included throughout the preparation of nuclear extracts. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. To be able to determine the molecular role of protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the sequence specific binding of NF-κB-p50 binding to its consensus DNA sequence, we first proceeded to show the specificity of DNA binding of this polypeptide to its32P-radiolabeled DNA probe by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Fig. 1 A shows the off-rate of NF-κB-p50 from its radiolabeled probe following the addition of increasing amounts of unlabeled DNA probe to a fixed amount of its 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide consensus sequence, and 80 ng of the DNA binding protein. After 20 min of incubation, the samples were fractionated through a 5% native polyacrylamide gel containing 0.2× Tris borate EDTA buffer and the protein·oligodeoxynucleotide complexes were visualized by autoradiography. As Fig. 1 A (lanes 1–8) shows, the mobility shift of the radiolabeled probe disappeared as a function of the amount of unlabeled oligodeoxynucleotide added. Therefore, from this experiment we conclude that our mobility shift test can be applied to study the role of protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the sequence-specific DNA binding of NF-κB-p50. Fig. 1 B shows the disappearance of the mobility shift as a function of the concentration of unlabeled DNA added to the EMSA mixture and densitometric analysis of the data illustrated in Fig. 1 A. From the graphical representation observed here, it was clear that 50% of DNA binding specificity was lost when less than 1 pmol of unlabeled DNA probe was added, even after 20 min of incubation. These results are consistent with a strong and highly specific binding of pure NF-κB-p50 to the radiolabeled DNA probe used in these studies (see above under “Experimental Procedures”). Previous studies have suggested that PARP-1 may participate in NF-κB activation in various cell lines (31Le Page C. Sanceau J. Drapier J.C. Wietzerbin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 32Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 33Oliver F.J.

Ota K. Tetsuka T. Tanaka Y. Itaya A. Okamoto T. Yoshihara K. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on NF-κB-p50 DNA binding in vitro, we co-incubated pure PARP-1 and NF-κB-p50 either in the presence or absence of βNAD+. The enzymatic activity of PARP-1 was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature, and the 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide containing the consensus sequence for NF-κB was added. To avoid a potential effect of exogenous DNA on NF-κB-p50 DNA binding, nicked DNA was omitted as an enzymatic activator of PARP-1. The binding of NF-κB-p50 to DNA was analyzed by subjecting the incubation reaction mixture to electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Autoradiographic analysis showed the absence of mobility shift in the PARP-1 control (80 ng; Fig. 2, lane 1) in the presence of βNAD+. By contrast, we observed the presence of a single shift in the NF-κB-p50 control (80 ng; Fig. 2, lane 2), demonstrating the specificity of the NF-κB oligodeoxynucleotide. In the absence of βNAD+, adding PARP-1 (80 ng) to the NF-κB-p50 control caused an immediate reduction in the efficiency of binding of NF-κB-p50 to the oligodeoxynucleotide (Fig. 2, lane 3). When more PARP-1 (400 ng) was added to the mixture, a stronger inhibition of the specific DNA binding was observed, and this effect was accompanied by an apparent supershift of radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide (Fig. 2, lane 4). Whether this was an indication of competition between NF-κB-p50 and PARP-1 for the DNA probe or a reflection of protein·protein interactions was not initially clear. However, doubling the amount of PARP-1 to 800 ng (Fig. 2, lane 5) resulted in a stronger supershift and the complete absence of the typical mobility shift observed with NF-κB-p50 alone (compare with Fig. 2, lane 2). Interestingly, the PARP-1-dependent inhibition of NF-κB-p50 DNA binding was reversed by βNAD+ (200 μm) (Fig. 2, lanes 6–8). Indeed, the presence of βNAD+ abolished the inhibition of NF-κB-p50 binding to its oligodeoxynucleotide, presumably due to either the covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of NF-κB-p50, the automodification reaction of PARP-1, or both. Those NF-κB-p50·oligodeoxynucleotide complexes (Fig. 2, lanes 6–8) co-migrated with that of the NF-κB-p50 control (Fig. 2, lane 2), suggesting that NF-κB-p50 DNA binding became independent of PARP-1. Regardless of the PARP-1 concentration in the incubation mixture, the radiographic intensity of the NF-κB-p50·oligodeoxynucleotide complex (lanes 6–8) was similar to that of the NF-κB-p50 control (Fig. 2, lane 2). Therefore, these data suggest that there was no dilution effect of PARP-1 to NF-κB-p50 DNA binding. 3-Aminobenzamide (3-AB) is a well-established competitive inhibitor of βNAD+ in the protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction catalyzed by PARP-1. Therefore, we next evaluated the efficiency of the βNAD+-dependent NF-κB-p50 DNA binding following co-incubation of PARP-1, NF-κB-p50, and βNAD+in the presence of 10 mm 3-AB (see above). Fig. 3shows that addition of 400 ng of PARP-1 inhibited NF-κB-p50 DNA binding in the absence of βNAD+. This inhibition was accompanied by an apparent supershift of radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide (Fig. 3, lane 3), as compared with NF-κB-p50 control (80 ng; Fig. 3, lane 2). As shown above, addition of 200 μm βNAD+ resulted in the nullification of the PARP-1 inhibitory effect and NF-κB-p50·oligodeoxynucleotide complex co-migrated with that of the NF-κB-p50 control (Fig. 3, lane 4). By contrast, inhibition of the auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction of PARP-1 with 10 mm 3-AB led to the characteristic inhibition of NF-κB-p50 DNA binding by native PARP-1 (Fig. 3, lane 5). These data demonstrates that the βNAD+-dependent NF-κB-p50 DNA binding is indeed the result of covalent protein-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Overall, data shown in Figs. 2 and 3 indicate that PARP-1 interacts with NF-κB-p50 when PARP-1 is not poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated. Thus, when NF-κB-p50 interacts with PARP-1, it does not efficiently bind to its oligodeoxynucleotide. However, the auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1 does not allow protein·protein interactions with NF-κB-p50, which in turn facilitates the DNA sequence-specific binding of the latter. We next proceeded to determine whether this effect observed on NF-κB-p50 DNA binding, as a result of the addition of PARP-1 and βNAD+ (Figs. 2 and 3), was due to the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of th"

Indeed, we demonstrated that UDCA acts on the distinct region of the ligand binding domain when compared with the classical GR agonist dexamethasone, resulting in loss of coactivator recruitment and differential regulation of gene expression by the GR. Our data clearly indicated that UDCA, at least in part via activation of the GR, suppresses NF-κB-dependent transcription through the intervention of GR-p65 interaction. Together with the established clinical safety of UDCA, we may propose that UDCA could be a prototypical compound for development of a novel and selective GR modifier.

Despite this cumulative evidence of the cytoprotective and immunosuppressive effects of UDCA, both the target molecule and pathway of UDCA action remain unknown.The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a member of the nuclear receptors and an important transcriptional regulator involved in widely diverse physiological functions such as control of embryonic development, cell differentiation, and metabolic homeostasis (12Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. Poellinger L. Okret S. Wikstrom A.C. Bronnegard M. Gillner M. Dong Y. Fuxe K. Cintra A. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 185-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 13Reichardt H.M. Tronche F. Berger S. Kellendonk C. Schutz G. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, therapeutic activities of glucocorticoids are believed to inevitably be mediated by the GR (14Boumpas D.T. Chrousos G.P. Wilder R.L. Cupps T.R. Balow J.E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 119: 1198-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The nuclear receptors share several structural features (e.g. the ligand binding domain (LBD), DNA binding domain (DBD), and several transactivation domains (15Lee K.C. Lee Kraus W. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 191-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)). Concerning the GR, the NH2-terminal domain activation function-1 contains sequences responsible for activation of target genes and presumably interacts with the components of the basal transcription machinery and/or with cofactors and other transcription factors, largely in a cell- or tissue-specific context. The central part of the receptor constitutes the DBD, which participates in receptor dimerization, nuclear translocation, and transactivation. The structural motif of the DBD is two zinc fingers formed by the coordination of four cysteines to one zinc atom. Adjacent to the second zinc finger, the amino acids responsible for the nuclear localization, the nuclear localization signal, exist. The carboxyl-terminal portion of the receptor includes the LBD and the sequences for heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) binding, nuclear translocation, dimerization, and transactivation. The COOH-terminal transcriptional activation domain is hormone-dependent and termed activation function-2. The very COOH-terminal portion of the receptor, activation function-2 core, serves as a molecular switch that recruits coactivator proteins and activates the transcription of target genes when flipped into the active conformation by hormone binding (12Gustafsson J.A.

Yamamoto K.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the GR can also mutually interfere with other signaling pathways such as those mediated by the transcription factor NF-κB (19Gottlicher M. Heck S. Herrlich P. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), which is an inducible transcription factor that regulates expression of various genes involved in inflammation and immune responses (20Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4249) Google Scholar, 21Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev.

NF-κB consists of a dimer from five related proteins, most typically a heterodimer composed of p65/RelA and p50 subunits. The regulation of NF-κB is achieved through interaction with an inhibitory protein known as IκB that binds to NF-κB and sequesters it in the cytoplasm. Once cells are stimulated with inducers such as proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1), two serine residues of the IκB protein are phosphorylated by IκB kinases. Phosphorylation of IκB targets it for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome and renders the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB unmasked. Then NF-κB translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and regulates the transcription of target genes (23Karin M.

In addition to this “classical” milieu, recent reports have suggested that several alternative pathways lead not only to activation but also to repression of NF-κB (25Uranishi H. Tetsuka T.

Inhibition of NF-κB by glucocorticoids has been well documented, which may constitute a plausible mechanism of anti-inflammation and immunosuppression by glucocorticoids (19Gottlicher M. Heck S. Herrlich P. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although several possibilities have been proposed as an inhibitory mechanism, involvement of the GR appears to be consistent (28Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M.

Despite possible therapeutic antagonism of NF-κB by the GR in inflammatory disorders, however, side effects such as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis insufficiency, diabetes, altered lipid metabolism, osteoporosis, steroid myopathy, and infectious and neuropsychiatric complications limit the therapeutic use of the classical glucocorticoid agonists (14Boumpas D.T. Chrousos G.P. Wilder R.L. Cupps T.R. Balow J.E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 119: 1198-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In this line, dissociation of glucocorticoid-dependent transactivation and transrepression may lead to the development of better tolerated drugs (20Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4249) Google Scholar). Already several compounds have been reported to exhibit strong inhibition of NF-κB but weak induction of the GRE-dependent reporter gene; however, clinical application of those compounds is still pending (33Adcock I.M.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).We previously described that UDCA, without direct binding to the GR, activates the GR into DNA binding species but does not elicit its transactivational function in a transient transfection assay (37Tanaka H. Makino Y. Miura T. Hirano F. Okamoto K. Komura K. Sato Y. Makino I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1601-1608PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we predicted that the target domain in the GR of UDCA might be the LBD (37Tanaka H. Makino Y. Miura T. Hirano F. Okamoto K. Komura K. Sato Y. Makino I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1601-1608PubMed Google Scholar). Here we further studied the molecular mechanism of UDCA action and revealed that the LBD is responsible for UDCA-dependent nuclear translocation of the GR. Indeed, it is suggested that UDCA interacts with the distinct region of the LBD when compared with a classical GR agonist dexamethasone, resulting in differential regulation of gene expression by the GR. Our data clearly indicated that UDCA-activated GR suppresses NF-κB-dependent transcription via interaction with the p65 subunit. Taking into consideration the established clinical safety of UDCA, we propose that UDCA could be a prototypical compound for the development of a novel and selective GR modifier.DISCUSSIONAlthough it is known that UDCA modulates various cellular and immunological processes in vitro and influences the clinical course and pathology of inflammatory liver diseases, its molecular mechanism has remained unknown (43Poupon R. Chazouilleres O. Balkau B. Poupon R.E. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We previously reported that UDCA activates the GR into DNA binding species in the absence of steroid ligand (37Tanaka H. Makino Y. Miura T. Hirano F. Okamoto K. Komura K. Sato Y. Makino I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1601-1608PubMed Google Scholar). We here describe that UDCA interacts with the GR through the LBD, with neither recruitment of p160 coactivator TIF-2 nor eliciting transactivational function of the GR. Moreover, we indicate that UDCA-activated GR represses NF-κB-dependent transcription.Recent emerging studies have widened the spectrum of ligand for the nuclear receptors. Among others, it is revealed that a number of bile acids, including chenodeoxycholic, cholic, deoxycholic, and lithocholic acids, bind and activate the nuclear receptor FXR/BAR in cultured cells (44Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Consler T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Willson T.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M.

Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). The identification of the target genes for FXR and FXR gene disruption in mice provided the first clues to the physiological function of the interaction between bile acids and the receptor (47Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar,48Tu H. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). FXR heterodimerizes with the common heterodimeric partner RXR and constitutively resides in the nucleus (48Tu H. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, their ligands necessarily pass through not only the plasma membrane but also the nuclear envelope. In this line, the fact that FXR ligand bile acids have considerable lipophilicity appears to be rational. Moreover, overexpression of their transporter potentiates the effect of those bile acids on FXR (45Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). In clear contrast, UDCA, which is a relatively hydrophilic bile acid compared with FXR ligands, does not activate the FXR (45Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar) but rather with the GR as we have shown (37Tanaka H. Makino Y. Miura T. Hirano F. Okamoto K. Komura K. Sato Y. Makino I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1601-1608PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports showed that various actions of UDCA could chiefly be ascribed to its effects on the cell membrane, since it is not conceivable that the hydrophilic bile acid UDCA readily penetrates the cell membrane and directly influences intracellular processes (49Bouscarel B. Fromm H. Nussbaum R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G243-G251PubMed Google Scholar). It may thus be speculated that UDCA initially interacts with the cell membrane and then modulates cytoplasmic events, one of which may be connected to GR activation. For example, UDCA, via interaction with an as yet unknown target machinery or receptor on the membrane, may generate such secondary signals that dissociate hsp90 from the GR even in the absence of glucocorticoid ligands. This perspective is indirectly supported by the fact that overexpression of the ilial bile acid transporter did not influence UDCA-dependent nuclear translocation or transactivation of the GR (data not shown). In the case of heat shock experiments, it has been shown that hsp90 is a target of heat-shock-induced cellular signals (50Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Taking the relative GR specificity of UDCA action into consideration, however, not hsp90 but GR itself might be the final target of such signals, since all steroid receptors used in the present study have been shown to associate with hsp90. Although the precise mechanism still remains unknown, the interplay between UDCA and the GR could be mechanistically distinct from that between other hydrophobic bile acids and FXR.We indicated here that one of the target domains of UDCA (or UDCA-generated signal) on the GR is the LBD, since expressed Gal4-GR LBD still moves into the nucleus after treatment with UDCA. This fusion protein has been shown to have a ligand-inducible transactivational potential (52Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). However, UDCA did not elicit induction of GRE-dependent reporter gene expression in the present study. Again, UDCA induces nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of the wild-type GR, whereas UDCA-activated GR lacks transactivational potential (37Tanaka H. Makino Y. Miura T. Hirano F. Okamoto K. Komura K. Sato Y. Makino I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1601-1608PubMed Google Scholar). Our data may suggest that UDCA, despite interacting with the LBD, cannot activate activation function-2. Already a number of reports have described that the LBD has multiple functions distributed throughout the very domain, and not only steroid ligands but also various stimuli may differentially influence its functionality (53Gustafsson J.A. Dahlman-Wright K. Stromstedt P.E. Wright T. Carlstedt-Duke J. Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1990; 21: 137-155PubMed Google Scholar, 54Wan Y. Coxe K.K. Thackray V.G. Housley P.R. Nordeen S.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 55Sheldon L.A. Smith C.L. Bodwell J.E. Munck A.U. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8146-8157Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For example, the interaction with coactivators is elicited by the majority of glucocorticoid ligands but not by certain steroids including RU486, although RU486 can bind with the LBD and RU486-bound GR could translocate into the nucleus as a DNA-binding species (56Roux S. Terouanne B. Couette B. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Nicolas J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10059-10065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 57Prima V. Depoix C. Masselot B. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 72: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since we showed in two independent experiments that UDCA-activated GR cannot communicate with a coactivator TIF2 in the nucleus, UDCA-activated GR appears to be extremely similar to RU486-activated GR. Interestingly, the domain requirement for UDCA-dependent nuclear translocation is distinct from that for dexamethasone. Our results indicate that UDCA or UDCA-provoked secondary signals influence a broader region of the LBD than dexamethasone; GR-(1–765), in which the very COOH-terminal end of the LBD was chopped off, could not be activated by dexamethasone but was by UDCA, and the effect of UDCA was observed when COOH-terminal deletion progressed to amino acid position 740. Note that these deletion mutants of the GR lack helix 12, which forms an interaction surface with coactivators (Fig. 4 A). We thus may speculate that UDCA, either directly or indirectly, modulates the LBD structure of the GR into such a unique conformation that the GR can translocate into the nucleus and bind DNA but no longer interacts with the coactivators to elicit transcriptional activation. Of course, for confirmation of this scenario, structural analysis of the GR is essential. At this moment, however, we are confronted with several difficulties in performing such experiments. For example, the three-dimensional structure of the LBD of the GR has not yet been made clear, and current structural discussion of the GR LBD, therefore, ought to be based on the knowledge of other nuclear receptors. More importantly, it is likely that the GR is indirectly modulated within the cells after treatment with UDCA via generation of as yet unidentified secondary signal, and at this moment there is no way to reconstitute such activation process in vitro. To overcome these issues, it is necessary to clarify the pathway for UDCA-mediated activation of the GR.We also showed that UDCA suppresses NF-κB-dependent transcription, and this inhibitory effect, at least in part, is mediated by the GR. Various mechanisms have been presented for GR-dependent NF-κB suppression (See the Introduction). Given the data showing that the protein amounts of the NF-κB components (p65, p50, or IκBα), phosphorylation of IκBα, and nuclear translocation of p65 were not significantly influenced after treatment with UDCA, we, among others, favor the idea that UDCA represses transcriptional activity of NF-κB in the nucleus via activation of the GR. Notably, a helix 12-lacking GR-(1–750) does not activate GRE-dependent transcription but suppresses NF-κB-dependent transcription in the presence of UDCA, suggesting that UDCA-dependent suppression of NF-κB does not involve either induction of IκB synthesis or competition of a limiting amount of coactivators. On the other hand, a one-hybrid assay indicates that COOH-terminal transactivation domain of p65 could be a target of UDCA-activated GR; UDCA-activated GR may interact with the p65 subunit in the nucleus and repress NF-κB activity. In the meantime, negative regulation by the GR was more marked in full-length p65 when treated with dexamethasone. However, UDCA-mediated repression was almost comparable between full-length and the COOH-terminal half of p65. It thus is tempting to speculate that UDCA-activated GR may suppress NF-κB in such a manner distinct from dexamethasone-activated GR, at least not involving the NH2-terminal half of p65.From the pharmacological viewpoint, GR is still considered to be one of the therapeutic targets for anti-inflammation and immunosuppression (14Boumpas D.T. Chrousos G.P. Wilder R.L. Cupps T.R. Balow J.E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 119: 1198-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Several steroid compounds have enabled partial dissociation of these pharmacological actions from metabolic side effects (33Adcock I.M. Nasuhara Y. Stevens D.A. Barnes P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 36Belvisi M.G. Wicks S.L. Battram C.H. Bottoms S.E. Redford J.E. Woodman P. Brown T.J. Webber S.E. Foster M.L. J.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 797-806PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has not been elucidated whether these compounds reproduce such distinction in vivo (36Belvisi M.G. Wicks S.L. Battram C.H. Bottoms S.E. Redford J.E. Woodman P. Brown T.J. Webber S.E. Foster M.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Moreover, their receptor specificity has not been critically evaluated. We here showed that UDCA is extremely specific to the GR and represses NF-κB without induction of transactivation function of the GR. Since UDCA is not defined as a classical glucocorticoid despite carrying a steroid structure but as a bile acid, it is plausible that UDCA is a prototype of a novel and selective GR modifier. However, we should state again that the UDCA concentrations required for nuclear translocation and transrepression in our experiments appear to be extraordinarily high as a therapeutic drug. Indeed, it is known that in patients treated with UDCA, serum levels of UDCA are lower than the concentrations used in the present study (59Ozaki S. Tashiro A. Makino I. Nakagawa S. Yoshizawa I. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 240-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 60Lianidou E.S. Papastathopoulos D.S. Siskos P.A. Anal.

Gastroenterology. 1985; 88: 126-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We therefore cannot directly link UDCA action observed in the present study with the therapeutic mechanism of UDCA in inflammatory liver diseases. On the other hand, it has been shown that the concentrations of UDCA are extremely elevated in the liver and bile ducts in patients taking UDCA (62Setchell K.D.R. Rodrigues C.M.P. Clerici C. Solinas A. Morelli A. Gartung C. Boyer J. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 226-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Given the beneficial effect of UDCA in a number of hepatobiliary diseases, it is possible that UDCA, because of its differences in regional concentration, acts only in such regions where UDCA is concentrated (i.e. liver and bile ducts) as an organ-specific immunomodulator. Of course, further identification of the molecular mechanism for UDCA action (e.g. identification of its receptor and signal transducer) would develop a novel pharmacological approach that may act in a more systemic fashion. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)1 is the current mainstay of treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis, which is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by the destruction of biliary epithelial cells (i.e. cholangiocytes), presumably by autoimmune mechanism(s) (1Makino I.

Many studies have provided evidence that emphysema results from lack of the anti-elastase activity of α1-AT in the lung (reviewed in Refs. 1Cox D.W. Scriver C.B. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

These mice develop liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma despite the fact that they have their own endogenous anti-elastases (3Dycaico M.J. Grant S.G. Felts K. Nichols W.S. Geller S.A. Hager J.H.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 294: 1316-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 9Sveger T. Eriksson S. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 514-517PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies we tested the hypothesis that this subgroup of deficient individuals is susceptible to liver injury by virtue of additional unlinked genetic traits or environmental factors that delay degradation of the mutant α1-ATZ molecule after it is retained in the ER (10Wu Y.

With the use of fibroblast cell lines from deficient patients with liver disease (susceptible hosts) compared with those from deficient individuals without liver disease (protected hosts), we found that more efficient degradation of retained mutant α1-ATZ in the ER correlated with protection from liver disease. These results, therefore, focused our attention on the mechanism by which α1-ATZ is degraded in the ER. Subsequent studies showed that lactacystin inhibited ER degradation of α1-ATZ in stable transfected human fibroblast cell lines and in a cell-free microsomal system (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 12Teckman J.H. Gilmore R. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G39-G48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the proteasome and the ubiquitin system were involved in this important quality control mechanism. Degradation of α1-ATZ in stable transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and in primary cultures of human mononuclear phagocytes was also inhibited by lactacystin (13Novoradovskaya N. Lee J.H. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Brantly M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, Cabral et al. (14Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25015-25022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) recently found that lactacystin did not inhibit degradation of α1-ATZ in a stable transfected murine hepatoma cell line. Degradation of α1-ATZ in this cell line was markedly decreased by tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. These authors concluded that the proteasome was only involved in degradation of α1-ATZ in nonhepatocytic cells or alternatively was only involved in α1-ATZ degradation in cell types with lower levels of α1-AT biosynthesis. Because hepatocytes are the predominant site of synthesis of α1-AT and the cells predominantly affected by the pathobiological process of α1-AT deficiency-associated liver disease, this is a very important issue. In this study we examined hepatocytes in further detail by generating rat and murine hepatoma cell lines that express α1-ATZ. We also examined the role of the relative level of α1-AT biosynthesis by generating hepatoma cell lines with regulated expression of α1-ATZ.DISCUSSIONA detailed elucidation of the mechanisms by which mutant aggregated α1-ATZ is degraded in the ER is essential for understanding how the quality control apparatus of the ER works in general and for understanding the specific issue of how a subgroup of α1-AT-deficient individuals become susceptible to liver injury and carcinogenesis. Previous studies have shown that there is a lag in the disposal of this mutant protein in genetically engineered human fibroblasts from “susceptible” deficient patients (10Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Moreover, this lag in the ER disposal/quality control mechanism appears to be specific, i.e. it affected the disposal of two polymerogenic mutants of α1-AT, but not a model unassembled membrane protein (19Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13215-13220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Initial studies of the ER degradation of α1-ATZ indicated that the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal system was involved. Degradation of α1-ATZ in genetically engineered human fibroblast cell lines and in a cell-free microsomal translocation system was inhibited by lactacystin (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Degradation of α1-ATZ in the cell-free system was shown to be dependent on ATP and, more importantly, a polyubiquitinated calnexin-α1-ATZ complex was shown to be a degradative intermediate (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies by Novoradovskayaet al. (13Novoradovskaya N. Lee J.H. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Brantly M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that degradation of α1-ATZ is also inhibited by lactacystin in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and in primary cultures of human mononuclear phagocytes. Using an experimental approach in which the degradative machinery in the reticulocyte lysate of the cell-free system is fractionated and reconstituted with purified components, we have recently found evidence for at least three different pathways in the degradation of α1-ATZ, including ubiquitin-dependent and -independent proteasomal mechanisms and at least one nonproteasomal mechanism (12Teckman J.H. Gilmore R. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G39-G48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have suggested that autophagy may constitute one of the nonproteasomal mechanisms (15Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G961-G974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have substantiated the concept that there are multiple pathways involved in ER degradation of α1-ATZ.In the most recent study of this issue, Cabral et al. (14Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25015-25022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) found that lactacystin did not inhibit degradation of α1-ATZ in a stable transfected murine hepatoma Hepa1–6 cell line. Degradation of α1-ATZ in this cell line was decreased by tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. Lactacystin did inhibit degradation of α1-AT Null Hong Kong, a truncated mutant, in a separate stable transfected Hepa1–6 cell line. Taken together, these results indicated that the proteasome did not play a role in degradation of α1-ATZ in hepatoma cell line even though the proteasome was active in these cells, that an entirely separate mechanism for degradation existed, and that this distinct mechanism was specific for α1-ATZ. Taking into consideration the previous results indicating involvement of the proteasome in degradation of α1-ATZ in genetically engineered fibroblasts (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 13Novoradovskaya N. Lee J.H. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Brantly M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), in primary cultures of human macrophages (13Novoradovskaya N. Lee J.H. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Brantly M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and in the cell-free microsomal system (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), these authors concluded that the proteasomal mechanism was cell type-specific, either for nonhepatocytic cell types and/or cell types with lower levels of endogenous α1-AT expression than hepatocytes (14Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25015-25022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Because the hepatocyte is an extremely important, if not the most important, site of synthesis of α1-ATZ with respect to the development of liver disease, in this study we sought to examine in further detail the involvement of the proteasome in ER degradation of α1-ATZ in cells of hepatocytic lineage. The results show that lactacystin, MG132, epoxomicin, and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone all inhibit degradation of α1-ATZ in several different types of genetically engineered hepatoma cell lines, including the murine hepatoma Hepa1–6 used by Cabral et al. and a rat hepatoma cell line H11, which has the advantages of being highly differentiated for hepatocytic function, but lacking endogenous expression of α1-AT. Degradation of α1-ATZ in hepatoma cell lines with constitutive and inducible expression of α1-ATZ was blocked to an equivalent extent by proteasomal inhibitors. Finally, studies in HeLa and Hepa1–6 cell lines with inducible expression of α1-ATZ showed that the proteasome was involved in degradation of α1-ATZ at both high and 30–100-fold lower levels of expression. These results suggest to us that the lack of involvement of the proteasome in degradation of α1-ATZ in the Hepa1–6 cell line generated by Cabralet al. (14Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25015-25022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) is cell line-specific, perhaps reflecting a type of adaptation. This hypothesis by no means diminishes the importance of the observations of Cabral et al. or the importance of tyrosine phosphatases in the quality control mechanism. There is now ample evidence for multiple mechanisms/pathways in the ER quality control apparatus and for cellular “adaptation.” In fact, gene expression profile analysis has shown marked changes in expression of many genes in yeast cells that accumulate misfolded proteins (20Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodlicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 21Casagrande R. Stern P. Diehn M. Shamu C.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Moreover, if a cellular adaptation mechanism is truly applicable, then the results of Cabral et al. raise the interesting possibility that the adaptation is specific for α1-ATZ, a polymerogenic mutant, and not for α1-AT Null Hong Kong, a mutant that is truncated and not likely to be polymerogenic.Three other results of this study deserve comment. First, there is a marked increase in the formation of insoluble aggregates of α1-ATZ and two distinct degradation products appear exclusively in the insoluble fraction when the proteasome is inhibited. These degradation products could theoretically be generated in, and/or accumulate in, the ER or the cytoplasm. Several lines of evidence make it more likely that they are generated in and localize to the ER. α1-ATZ has not been detected outside the ER lumen in intact cells (15Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G961-G974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in the supernatant of cell-free mammalian translocation reactions (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and proteasome inhibitors do not induce aggresomes in cells that express mutant α1-ATZ (15Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G961-G974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar degradation products are generated processively in the lumen of microsomal vesicles that have translocated wild type α1-ATZ in a cell-free microsomal translocation reaction (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of an endoluminal proteolytic system that recognizes wild type or mutant α1-ATZ when it is retained in the ER for a prolonged period of time. Second, there was no evidence for a significant increase in secretion of α1-ATZ in fibroblasts, hepatoma cells, or HeLa cells in the presence of lactacystin, MG132, epoxomicin, or clasto-lactacystin β-lactone at doses optimal for inhibition of degradation of α1-ATZ. Using the lower doses of lactacystin or longer periods of preincubation with lactacystin described by Novoradovskayaet al. (13Novoradovskaya N. Lee J.H. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Brantly M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we observed a lesser degree of inhibition of degradation, but no increase in secretion of α1-ATZ in fibroblasts, hepatoma cells, and HeLa cells at low and high levels of expression (data not shown). Third, secretion of α1-ATZ did not increase when the level of its synthesis was decreased. This was shown by modulating the level of synthesis 30–100-fold in tetracycline-regulated cell lines. This result is noteworthy because the rate of polymerization of α1-ATZ decreases at lower concentrations in purified systems (6Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The results in this report therefore suggest that other factors working in concert with polymerization play a role in the fate of α1-ATZ when it accumulates in the ER. The classical and most common form of α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT)1deficiency is a relatively unique genetic disease in that it is associated with injury to one tissue, pulmonary emphysema, by a loss-of-function mechanism and injury to another tissue, chronic hepatitis/hepatocellular carcinoma, by a gain-of-function mechanism. Many studies have provided evidence that emphysema results from lack of the anti-elastase activity of α1-AT in the lung (reviewed in Refs. 1Cox D.W. Scriver C.B. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 4125-4158Google Scholar and 2Perlmutter D.H. Schiff E.R. Sorrell M.F. Maddrey W.C. Schiff's Diseases of the Liver. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1999: 1131-1150Google Scholar). Liver disease is due to toxic effects of aggregated α1-ATZ retained in the ER of liver parenchymal cells. The gain-of-function mechanism is most clearly demonstrated by experiments in mice transgenic for human α1-ATZ. These mice develop liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma despite the fact that they have their own endogenous anti-elastases (3Dycaico M.J. Grant S.G. Felts K. Nichols W.S. Geller S.A. Hager J.H.

Hepatology. 1994; 19: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mutant Z allele of α1-AT is characterized by a single nucleotide substitution, which results in the replacement of glutamate 342 by a bulky lysine residue (1Cox D.W. Scriver C.B. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 4125-4158Google Scholar, 2Perlmutter D.H. Schiff E.R. Sorrell M.F. Maddrey W.C. Schiff's Diseases of the Liver. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1999: 1131-1150Google Scholar). The studies of Carrell and Lomas (6Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 7Carrel R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) have shown that this substitution renders the α1-AT molecule more susceptible to polymerization and that highly ordered aggregates accumulate in the ER of liver cells. One interesting observation, arising from unbiased nationwide screening studies of α1-AT deficiency in Sweden, indicates that only 10–15% of deficient individuals develop clinically significant liver disease (8Sveger T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 294: 1316-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 9Sveger T. Eriksson S. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 514-517PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies we tested the hypothesis that this subgroup of deficient individuals is susceptible to liver injury by virtue of additional unlinked genetic traits or environmental factors that delay degradation of the mutant α1-ATZ molecule after it is retained in the ER (10Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). With the use of fibroblast cell lines from deficient patients with liver disease (susceptible hosts) compared with those from deficient individuals without liver disease (protected hosts), we found that more efficient degradation of retained mutant α1-ATZ in the ER correlated with protection from liver disease. These results, therefore, focused our attention on the mechanism by which α1-ATZ is degraded in the ER. Subsequent studies showed that lactacystin inhibited ER degradation of α1-ATZ in stable transfected human fibroblast cell lines and in a cell-free microsomal system (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 12Teckman J.H. Gilmore R. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G39-G48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the proteasome and the ubiquitin system were involved in this important quality control mechanism. Degradation of α1-ATZ in stable transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and in primary cultures of human mononuclear phagocytes was also inhibited by lactacystin (13Novoradovskaya N. Lee J.H. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Brantly M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, Cabral et al. (14Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25015-25022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) recently found that lactacystin did not inhibit degradation of α1-ATZ in a stable transfected murine hepatoma cell line. Degradation of α1-ATZ in this cell line was markedly decreased by tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. These authors concluded that the proteasome was only involved in degradation of α1-ATZ in nonhepatocytic cells or alternatively was only involved in α1-ATZ degradation in cell types with lower levels of α1-AT biosynthesis. Because hepatocytes are the predominant site of synthesis of α1-AT and the cells predominantly affected by the pathobiological process of α1-AT deficiency-associated liver disease, this is a very important issue. In this study we examined hepatocytes in further detail by generating rat and murine hepatoma cell lines that express α1-ATZ. We also examined the role of the relative level of α1-AT biosynthesis by generating hepatoma cell lines with regulated expression of α1-ATZ. DISCUSSIONA detailed elucidation of the mechanisms by which mutant aggregated α1-ATZ is degraded in the ER is essential for understanding how the quality control apparatus of the ER works in general and for understanding the specific issue of how a subgroup of α1-AT-deficient individuals become susceptible to liver injury and carcinogenesis. Previous studies have shown that there is a lag in the disposal of this mutant protein in genetically engineered human fibroblasts from “susceptible” deficient patients (10Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Moreover, this lag in the ER disposal/quality control mechanism appears to be specific, i.e. it affected the disposal of two polymerogenic mutants of α1-AT, but not a model unassembled membrane protein (19Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13215-13220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Initial studies of the ER degradation of α1-ATZ indicated that the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal system was involved. Degradation of α1-ATZ in genetically engineered human fibroblast cell lines and in a cell-free microsomal translocation system was inhibited by lactacystin (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Degradation of α1-ATZ in the cell-free system was shown to be dependent on ATP and, more importantly, a polyubiquitinated calnexin-α1-ATZ complex was shown to be a degradative intermediate (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies by Novoradovskayaet al. (13Novoradovskaya N. Lee J.H. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Brantly M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that degradation of α1-ATZ is also inhibited by lactacystin in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and in primary cultures of human mononuclear phagocytes. Using an experimental approach in which the degradative machinery in the reticulocyte lysate of the cell-free system is fractionated and reconstituted with purified components, we have recently found evidence for at least three different pathways in the degradation of α1-ATZ, including ubiquitin-dependent and -independent proteasomal mechanisms and at least one nonproteasomal mechanism (12Teckman J.H. Gilmore R. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G39-G48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have suggested that autophagy may constitute one of the nonproteasomal mechanisms (15Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G961-G974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have substantiated the concept that there are multiple pathways involved in ER degradation of α1-ATZ.In the most recent study of this issue, Cabral et al. (14Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25015-25022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) found that lactacystin did not inhibit degradation of α1-ATZ in a stable transfected murine hepatoma Hepa1–6 cell line. Degradation of α1-ATZ in this cell line was decreased by tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. Lactacystin did inhibit degradation of α1-AT Null Hong Kong, a truncated mutant, in a separate stable transfected Hepa1–6 cell line. Taken together, these results indicated that the proteasome did not play a role in degradation of α1-ATZ in hepatoma cell line even though the proteasome was active in these cells, that an entirely separate mechanism for degradation existed, and that this distinct mechanism was specific for α1-ATZ. Taking into consideration the previous results indicating involvement of the proteasome in degradation of α1-ATZ in genetically engineered fibroblasts (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 13Novoradovskaya N. Lee J.H. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Brantly M. J. Clin.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and in the cell-free microsomal system (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), these authors concluded that the proteasomal mechanism was cell type-specific, either for nonhepatocytic cell types and/or cell types with lower levels of endogenous α1-AT expression than hepatocytes (14Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25015-25022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Because the hepatocyte is an extremely important, if not the most important, site of synthesis of α1-ATZ with respect to the development of liver disease, in this study we sought to examine in further detail the involvement of the proteasome in ER degradation of α1-ATZ in cells of hepatocytic lineage. The results show that lactacystin, MG132, epoxomicin, and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone all inhibit degradation of α1-ATZ in several different types of genetically engineered hepatoma cell lines, including the murine hepatoma Hepa1–6 used by Cabral et al. and a rat hepatoma cell line H11, which has the advantages of being highly differentiated for hepatocytic function, but lacking endogenous expression of α1-AT. Degradation of α1-ATZ in hepatoma cell lines with constitutive and inducible expression of α1-ATZ was blocked to an equivalent extent by proteasomal inhibitors. Finally, studies in HeLa and Hepa1–6 cell lines with inducible expression of α1-ATZ showed that the proteasome was involved in degradation of α1-ATZ at both high and 30–100-fold lower levels of expression. These results suggest to us that the lack of involvement of the proteasome in degradation of α1-ATZ in the Hepa1–6 cell line generated by Cabralet al. (14Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25015-25022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) is cell line-specific, perhaps reflecting a type of adaptation. This hypothesis by no means diminishes the importance of the observations of Cabral et al. or the importance of tyrosine phosphatases in the quality control mechanism. There is now ample evidence for multiple mechanisms/pathways in the ER quality control apparatus and for cellular “adaptation.” In fact, gene expression profile analysis has shown marked changes in expression of many genes in yeast cells that accumulate misfolded proteins (20Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodlicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 21Casagrande R. Stern P. Diehn M. Shamu C.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Moreover, if a cellular adaptation mechanism is truly applicable, then the results of Cabral et al. raise the interesting possibility that the adaptation is specific for α1-ATZ, a polymerogenic mutant, and not for α1-AT Null Hong Kong, a mutant that is truncated and not likely to be polymerogenic.Three other results of this study deserve comment. First, there is a marked increase in the formation of insoluble aggregates of α1-ATZ and two distinct degradation products appear exclusively in the insoluble fraction when the proteasome is inhibited. These degradation products could theoretically be generated in, and/or accumulate in, the ER or the cytoplasm. Several lines of evidence make it more likely that they are generated in and localize to the ER. α1-ATZ has not been detected outside the ER lumen in intact cells (15Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G961-G974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in the supernatant of cell-free mammalian translocation reactions (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and proteasome inhibitors do not induce aggresomes in cells that express mutant α1-ATZ (15Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G961-G974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar degradation products are generated processively in the lumen of microsomal vesicles that have translocated wild type α1-ATZ in a cell-free microsomal translocation reaction (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of an endoluminal proteolytic system that recognizes wild type or mutant α1-ATZ when it is retained in the ER for a prolonged period of time. Second, there was no evidence for a significant increase in secretion of α1-ATZ in fibroblasts, hepatoma cells, or HeLa cells in the presence of lactacystin, MG132, epoxomicin, or clasto-lactacystin β-lactone at doses optimal for inhibition of degradation of α1-ATZ. Using the lower doses of lactacystin or longer periods of preincubation with lactacystin described by Novoradovskayaet al. (13Novoradovskaya N. Lee J.H. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Brantly M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we observed a lesser degree of inhibition of degradation, but no increase in secretion of α1-ATZ in fibroblasts, hepatoma cells, and HeLa cells at low and high levels of expression (data not shown). Third, secretion of α1-ATZ did not increase when the level of its synthesis was decreased. This was shown by modulating the level of synthesis 30–100-fold in tetracycline-regulated cell lines. This result is noteworthy because the rate of polymerization of α1-ATZ decreases at lower concentrations in purified systems (6Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The results in this report therefore suggest that other factors working in concert with polymerization play a role in the fate of α1-ATZ when it accumulates in the ER. A detailed elucidation of the mechanisms by which mutant aggregated α1-ATZ is degraded in the ER is essential for understanding how the quality control apparatus of the ER works in general and for understanding the specific issue of how a subgroup of α1-AT-deficient individuals become susceptible to liver injury and carcinogenesis. Previous studies have shown that there is a lag in the disposal of this mutant protein in genetically engineered human fibroblasts from “susceptible” deficient patients (10Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Moreover, this lag in the ER disposal/quality control mechanism appears to be specific, i.e. it affected the disposal of two polymerogenic mutants of α1-AT, but not a model unassembled membrane protein (19Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13215-13220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Initial studies of the ER degradation of α1-ATZ indicated that the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal system was involved. Degradation of α1-ATZ in genetically engineered human fibroblast cell lines and in a cell-free microsomal translocation system was inhibited by lactacystin (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Degradation of α1-ATZ in the cell-free system was shown to be dependent on ATP and, more importantly, a polyubiquitinated calnexin-α1-ATZ complex was shown to be a degradative intermediate (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies by Novoradovskayaet al. (13Novoradovskaya N. Lee J.H. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Brantly M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that degradation of α1-ATZ is also inhibited by lactacystin in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and in primary cultures of human mononuclear phagocytes. Using an experimental approach in which the degradative machinery in the reticulocyte lysate of the cell-free system is fractionated and reconstituted with purified components, we have recently found evidence for at least three different pathways in the degradation of α1-ATZ, including ubiquitin-dependent and -independent proteasomal mechanisms and at least one nonproteasomal mechanism (12Teckman J.H. Gilmore R. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G39-G48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have suggested that autophagy may constitute one of the nonproteasomal mechanisms (15Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G961-G974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have substantiated the concept that there are multiple pathways involved in ER degradation of α1-ATZ. In the most recent study of this issue, Cabral et al. (14Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25015-25022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) found that lactacystin did not inhibit degradation of α1-ATZ in a stable transfected murine hepatoma Hepa1–6 cell line. Degradation of α1-ATZ in this cell line was decreased by tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. Lactacystin did inhibit degradation of α1-AT Null Hong Kong, a truncated mutant, in a separate stable transfected Hepa1–6 cell line. Taken together, these results indicated that the proteasome did not play a role in degradation of α1-ATZ in hepatoma cell line even though the proteasome was active in these cells, that an entirely separate mechanism for degradation existed, and that this distinct mechanism was specific for α1-ATZ. Taking into consideration the previous results indicating involvement of the proteasome in degradation of α1-ATZ in genetically engineered fibroblasts (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 13Novoradovskaya N. Lee J.H. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Brantly M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), in primary cultures of human macrophages (13Novoradovskaya N. Lee J.H. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Brantly M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2693-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and in the cell-free microsomal system (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), these authors concluded that the proteasomal mechanism was cell type-specific, either for nonhepatocytic cell types and/or cell types with lower levels of endogenous α1-AT expression than hepatocytes (14Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25015-25022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because the hepatocyte is an extremely important, if not the most important, site of synthesis of α1-ATZ with respect to the development of liver disease, in this study we sought to examine in further detail the involvement of the proteasome in ER degradation of α1-ATZ in cells of hepatocytic lineage. The results show that lactacystin, MG132, epoxomicin, and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone all inhibit degradation of α1-ATZ in several different types of genetically engineered hepatoma cell lines, including the murine hepatoma Hepa1–6 used by Cabral et al. and a rat hepatoma cell line H11, which has the advantages of being highly differentiated for hepatocytic function, but lacking endogenous expression of α1-AT. Degradation of α1-ATZ in hepatoma cell lines with constitutive and inducible expression of α1-ATZ was blocked to an equivalent extent by proteasomal inhibitors. Finally, studies in HeLa and Hepa1–6 cell lines with inducible expression of α1-ATZ showed that the proteasome was involved in degradation of α1-ATZ at both high and 30–100-fold lower levels of expression. These results suggest to us that the lack of involvement of the proteasome in degradation of α1-ATZ in the Hepa1–6 cell line generated by Cabralet al. (14Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25015-25022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) is cell line-specific, perhaps reflecting a type of adaptation. This hypothesis by no means diminishes the importance of the observations of Cabral et al. or the importance of tyrosine phosphatases in the quality control mechanism. There is now ample evidence for multiple mechanisms/pathways in the ER quality control apparatus and for cellular “adaptation.” In fact, gene expression profile analysis has shown marked changes in expression of many genes in yeast cells that accumulate misfolded proteins (20Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodlicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 21Casagrande R. Stern P. Diehn M. Shamu C.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Moreover, if a cellular adaptation mechanism is truly applicable, then the results of Cabral et al. raise the interesting possibility that the adaptation is specific for α1-ATZ, a polymerogenic mutant, and not for α1-AT Null Hong Kong, a mutant that is truncated and not likely to be polymerogenic. Three other results of this study deserve comment. First, there is a marked increase in the formation of insoluble aggregates of α1-ATZ and two distinct degradation products appear exclusively in the insoluble fraction when the proteasome is inhibited. These degradation products could theoretically be generated in, and/or accumulate in, the ER or the cytoplasm. Several lines of evidence make it more likely that they are generated in and localize to the ER. α1-ATZ has not been detected outside the ER lumen in intact cells (15Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G961-G974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in the supernatant of cell-free mammalian translocation reactions (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and proteasome inhibitors do not induce aggresomes in cells that express mutant α1-ATZ (15Teckman J.H. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G961-G974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar degradation products are generated processively in the lumen of microsomal vesicles that have translocated wild type α1-ATZ in a cell-free microsomal translocation reaction (11Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of an endoluminal proteolytic system that recognizes wild type or mutant α1-ATZ when it is retained in the ER for a prolonged period of time.

Using the lower doses of lactacystin or longer periods of preincubation with lactacystin described by Novoradovskayaet al. (13Novoradovskaya N. Lee J.H. Yu Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Brantly M. J. Clin.

Third, secretion of α1-ATZ did not increase when the level of its synthesis was decreased. This was shown by modulating the level of synthesis 30–100-fold in tetracycline-regulated cell lines.

The results in this report therefore suggest that other factors working in concert with polymerization play a role in the fate of α1-ATZ when it accumulates in the ER.

Here we show that gelsolin coprecipitates some of the focal adhesion-associated proteins such as c-Src, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p130Cas, focal adhesion kinase, integrin αvβ3, vinculin, talin, and paxillin. These proteins were inducibly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to integrin activation by osteopontin. Previous studies have defined unique biochemical properties of gelsolin related to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in osteoclast podosomes, and here we demonstrate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate/gelsolin function in mediating organization of the podosome signaling complex. Overlay and GST pull-down assays demonstrated strong phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-PI3K interactions based on the Src homology 2 domains of PI3K. Furthermore, lipid extraction of lysates from activated osteoclasts eliminated interaction between gelsolin, c-Src, PI3K, and focal adhesion kinase despite equal amounts of gelsolin in both the lipid-extracted and unextracted experiment. The cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine amino acid sequences (PEST) was also found to be associated with gelsolin in osteoclast podosomes and with stimulation of αvβ3-regulated phosphorylation of PTP-PEST. We conclude that gelsolin plays a key role in recruitment of signaling proteins to the plasma membrane through phospholipid-protein interactions and by regulation of their phosphorylation status through its association with PTP-PEST. Because both gelsolin deficiency and PI3K inhibition impair bone resorption, we conclude that phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-based protein interactions are critical for osteoclast function.

PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog Osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells with bone-resorbing activity. As osteoclasts crawl over bone surfaces, they require rapid attachment and release from the extracellular matrix. Adhesion structures called podosomes present in highly motile cells are also found in osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are unique because they use the speed of podosome assembly and disassembly to generate high rates of motility. Podosome formation stabilizes the bone matrix-cell interface and forms an isolated compartment between the ruffled border and the bone surface (1Teti A. Blair H.C. Schlesinger P. Grano M.

Horne W. Noda M. Cellular & Molecular Biology of Bone. Academic Press, Inc., NY1993: 445-495Google Scholar). Consistent with their function as adhesion sites, podosomes contain many of the same proteins found in focal adhesions, such as F-actin, vinculin, talin, gelsolin, fimbrin, and α-actinin (3Turksen K. Kanehisa J. Opas M. Heersche J.N. Aubin J.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1988; 3: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Marchisio P.C. Cirillo D. Teti A. Zambonin Zallone A. Tarone G. Exp.

Anat. 1983; 137: 57-70PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that osteopontin (OPN)1 binding to integrin αvβ3 in osteoclasts stimulates gelsolin-associated PI3K. This leads to increased levels of gelsolin-associated polyphosphoinositides, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns 4,5-P2), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, uncapping of actin barbed ends, and actin filament formation (8Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, OPN stimulates gelsolin-associated c-Src, leading to increased gelsolin-associated PI3K activity (9Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Elimination of gelsolin resulted in osteoclasts devoid of podosomes and actin rings but still capable of organization for bone resorption. These osteoclasts failed to respond to OPN with stimulation of motility and bone resorption (10Chellaiah M. Kizer N. Silva M. Alvarez U. Kwiatkowski D. Hruska K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Also, these observations in vitro suggest an important role for gelsolin in osteoclast-actin dynamics in vivo. They also demonstrate the functional role and significance of gelsolin as well as the associated signaling molecules during OPN-induced osteoclast cytoskeletal organization. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the recruitment of signaling molecules with gelsolin have not been elucidated. Integrin activation following matrix-integrin binding results in an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (11Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 12Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of FAK has been shown to induce its association with signal-transducing molecules such as c-Src, PI3K, paxillin, and p130Cas(13Xing Z. Chen H.C. Noelen J.K. Taylor S.J. Shaloway D.

Paxillin acts as a scaffolding adaptor protein in integrin signaling by binding to several other integrin assembly proteins including vinculin, integrin β1, FAK, and c-Src (21Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4139-4140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of OPN- or RGD-containing peptides to αvβ3 stimulated the formation of signal-generating complexes consisting of FAK, c-Src, and PI3K associated with αvβ3 (23Hruska K.A. Rolnick F. Huskey M. Alvarez U. Cheresh D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2984-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and gelsolin (10Chellaiah M. Kizer N. Silva M. Alvarez U. Kwiatkowski D. Hruska K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Integrin receptor engagement to the ligand or clustering of integrin receptors on the surface leads to the formation of focal adhesions. Because gelsolin deficiency blocks podosome assembly and αvβ3-stimulated signaling related to motility and bone resorption (10Chellaiah M. Kizer N. Silva M. Alvarez U. Kwiatkowski D. Hruska K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that gelsolin may be an adaptor protein that could influence actin reorganization by recruiting the signaling proteins in the osteoclast podosome. Moreover, integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins may modulate the protein-protein interactions between integrin and the downstream effectors. A universal feature of the process of signal transduction and transmission in eucaryotic cells is the transient but specific association between protein molecules. A large body of evidence supports the view that these interactions are mediated by distinct functional modules within these proteins (24Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Many of the proteins involved in signal transduction contain recapitulations of polypeptide segments called the Src homology (SH) domains: SH1, SH2, or SH3 (26Kuriyan J. Cowburn D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 828-837Crossref Google Scholar,27Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). SH2-containing proteins are often downstream targets of protein tyrosine kinases (24Pawson T.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar) and SH3 domains, which bind polyproline sequences (30Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T.

Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another new class of functional domain is pleckstrin homology domains. Pleckstrin homology domains have been suggested to bind to inositol phosphates (27Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 7: 51-59Crossref Google Scholar). However, gelsolin does not contain any of the domains mentioned above but does contain actin and phosphoinositide-binding domains (34Kiwatkowski D.J. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J.

Recent evidence suggests that the biochemical and physical organization of lipid molecules in the plasma membrane can affect integrin-mediated cellular functions (41Pande G. Curr. Opin.

The indirect effects of lipid molecules on integrin function are manifested mainly through cytoskeletal or signaling molecules. Cytoskeleton-lipid interactions are involved in mediating the linkage of the cytoskeleton with membrane bilayer and also in defining the membrane architecture in specific areas (such as focal adhesions). Talin, vinculin, and α-actinin are among the main integrin-associated cytoskeletal molecules that bind to or are modulated by membrane lipids (48Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S.

An important insight into the role of phosphoinositides results from the finding that PtdIns P3 associates directly with the SH2 domain of kinase and that PtdIns P3 also disrupts the association of PI3K with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by binding to the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit (52Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PtdIns P3displayed a discriminative affinity to 17-mer peptide, corresponding to the protein kinase C phosphorylation and calmodulin-binding domain of a brain-specific protein (53Baudier J. Deloulme J.C. Van Dorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 229-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to protein kinase C activation, PtdIns P3 provides an alternative mechanism for regulating protein kinase C activity in vivo by recruiting and concentrating its target proteins at the interface to facilitate the subsequent protein kinase C phosphorylation (54Lu P.-J. Chen C.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 466-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A by-product of these studies has been the discovery that not only do SH2 and SH3 domains mediate interactions of proteins, but they may also bind to the lipid products of PI3K. As a result of this interaction, other SH2-containing proteins may be recruited to the plasma membrane to initiate downstream signaling (52Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Lemmon M.A. Falasca M. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J.

From these observations, we hypothesized that the signaling molecules are associated with gelsolin through a unique phospholipid-based association. This report describes the initial characterization of the signaling proteins that are associated with gelsolin as well as the role of PtdIns P3 in the interaction of proteins with gelsolin. We focused on defining the interaction of PtdIns P3 with the SH2 or SH3 domains of kinases, including c-Src, lck, and p85 (PI3K). A unique mechanism of PtdIns P3-SH2 domain-mediated interaction of proteins with gelsolin is described.

Polyclonal gelsolin antibody and full-length gelsolin cDNA were provided by Dr. D. J. Kwiatkowski (Division of Experimental Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School). Monoclonal αv (LM142) as well as αvβ3 (LM609) antibodies and anti-PTP-PEST antibody was a gift from Dr. D. A. Cheresh (Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA) and Dr. M. L. Tremblay (McGill University, Montreal, Canada), respectively. The monoclonal antibody to leupaxin was developed by ICOS, Inc. (Bothel, WA) and provided by Dr. Anandarup Gupta (Dental School, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD). Avian osteoclast precursors were prepared as described previously (8Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse osteoclasts were generated in vitro using mouse bone marrow cells. Cells isolated from five mice were cultured in 100-mm dishes with 20 ml of α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (α-10). After culture for 24 h, nonadherent cells were layered on Histopaque 1077 (Sigma) and centrifuged at 300 × gfor 15 min at room temperature. The cell layer between the Histopaque and the media was removed and washed with α-10 media at 2000 rpm for 7 min at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in α-10 media and cultured with the appropriate concentrations of macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (10 ng/ml) and osteoprotegrin ligand (55–75 ng/ml). After 3 days in culture, media were replaced with fresh cytokines. The multinucleated osteoclasts were seen from day 4. After 4 or 5 days in culture, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and lysates were made from avian or mouse osteoclasts. Protein contents were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent kit. Equal amounts of lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with antibodies or nonimmune serum as mentioned under “Results.” Immunoprecipitations and Western analysis were carried out as described previously (8Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Alvarez U. Hruska K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were also performed in lipid-extracted and unextracted lysates. Lipid extraction was performed in about 10 mg of avian osteoclast lysate protein. An equal volume of chloroform:methanol (4:1) mixture was added to osteoclast lysate, and the aqueous layer containing the proteins was separated. The organic layer containing chloroform was extracted once more with lysis buffer and pooled. Lipid-extracted and unextracted lysates were dialyzed against 4–5 liters of PBS with two to three changes for 24 h at 4 °C. Protein content was measured by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. There was about 25–30% loss in protein content during lipid extraction. Osteoclasts cultured on whale dentine slices or glass coverslips were immunostained with different antibodies as shown (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) (57Wu H. Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parson J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Filardo E.J. Cheresh D.A. Hruska K.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2432-2440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min. The cells were washed and incubated with primary antibodies (1:100 dilution) for 2 h, washed, and then counterstained with Cy2-or Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG for 2 h. The cells were washed and mounted on a slide in a mounting solution (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The cells were viewed on a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Thornwood, NY), and images were recorded as described previously (10Chellaiah M. Kizer N. Silva M. Alvarez U. Kwiatkowski D. Hruska K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 665-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Avian osteoclast precursor cells, after 4 days in culture, were kept in serum-free (PO[stack][low]4[high]−[/stack]) media for 2 h. The cells were labeled as described previously (8Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Meenakshi T. Ross F.P. Martin J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) with carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h at 37 °C. After labeling, they were washed twice with serum-free media and incubated with OPN (25 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. Lipids were extracted from 32P-labeled and unlabeled lysates as described previously (8Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and dried under N2. The dried lipids were reconstituted in 500 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1) and spotted on silica gel TLC plates pretreated with 1.2% potassium oxalate in methanol and water (2:3). The plates were developed as described previously (8Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and bands were visualized by autoradiography. The PtdIns P3, PtdIns P2, PtdIns P, and PtdIns spots were scraped and extracted as described previously with a minor modification (23Hruska K.A. Rolnick F. Huskey M. Alvarez U. Cheresh D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2984-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled phospholipid spots present in the cellulose slurry were incubated overnight with 1 n HCL. The next day, the cellulose slurry was extracted as described previously (23Hruska K.A. Rolnick F. Huskey M. Alvarez U. Cheresh D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2984-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and counted (PtdIns P3 = 1 × 106 cpm, PtdInsP2 = 2 × 106 cpm; PtdIns P = 3.5 × 106 cpm, and PtdIns = 1 × 107 cpm). The incorporation into PtdIns P3 is 50% of the incorporation into PtdIns P2 or 33% of the incorporation into PtdIns P. The purity of the isolated phosphoinositides was analyzed by TLC and high pressure liquid chromatography. For the unlabeled PtdIns P3, labeled PtdIns P3 was used as marker. After purification, a known amount of PtdIns P2(Sigma) was used to quantitate the unlabeled PtdIns P3 by exposing the TLC to iodine vapor. GST fusions proteins coupled to Sepharose beads were allowed to bind to 100 μmphosphatidyl serine vesicle containing the following32P-labeled phosphoinositide: 12,000 dpm of PtdIns 4,5-P2 and 6000 dpm of PtdIns P3. The binding was performed in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 1 mmEDTA buffer containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40. Binding was carried out essentially as described previously (52Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of each phospholipid to the indicated proteins was analyzed. After binding, Sepharose beads were washed with buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the bound lipids were extracted with chloroform:methanol mixture and analyzed by TLC (8Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To spot the purified phosphoinositides onto a nitrocellulose membrane, lipid solutions containing PtdIns P3 (purified), PtdIns P2, and PtdIns P (Sigma) were used. About 2 pmol of purified PtdIns P3 and 3–5 pmol of PtdIns P2or PtdIns P (Sigma) phospholipids in 1–2 μl of a chloroform:methanol:water (1:2:0.8; by volume) mixture were spotted and dried. The blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). The membrane was washed three times with PBS-T and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated proteins (Fig. 9 B) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in PBS-T containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 12 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The blots were washed and immunoblotted with anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) in 1:1000 dilutions as described previously (8Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pGEX vectors containing cDNA sequences encoding the SH2 and SH3 domains of p85, full-length p85, and the SH2 domain of c-Src and lck were expressed in Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins and purified as described previously (52Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the binding of lipid-associated gelsolin to the indicated GST fusion proteins (Fig. 7), 3–5 μg of GST fusion proteins were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in PBS-0.5% Tween 20 for 3 h and subsequently incubated overnight with lipid-extracted or unextracted avian osteoclast lysates (about 3–5 mg of protein) in PBS-T. 2-Mercaptoethanol and bovine serum albumin were added to a final concentration of 12 mm and 0.1%, respectively. The blot was washed twice in PBS-T for 30 min each time and immunoblotted with anti-gelsolin antibody (1:1000 dilution) as described previously (8Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates (unextracted and extracted) were made from two different osteoclast preparations, and binding was performed in duplicate filters for each lysate preparation. 5 μg of GST fusion proteins noncovalently coupled to Sepharose beads were incubated with 500 μg of lipid-extracted and unextracted lysates for 2 h at 4 °C. After binding, the Sepharose beads were washed four to five times with lysis buffer and washed three times with cold PBS. Bound proteins were boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (60Lammelli V.P. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (200913) Google Scholar) and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with anti-gelsolin antibody as described previously (8Chellaiah M. Hruska K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All comparisons were made as a percentage of the control, which refers to vehicle-treated cells. The other treatment groups in each experiment were normalized to each control value. Data presented are the mean ± S.E. of experiments done at different times normalized to intraexperimental control values. For statistical comparisons, analysis of variance was used w"

Uncatalyzed folding traps these proteases into inactive molten-globule-like conformers that switch into active enzymes only when their cognate propeptides are added in trans. Although tight binding and proteolytic susceptibility forces propeptides to function as single turnover catalysts, the significance of their inhibitory function and the mechanism of activation remain unclear. Using pro-subtilisin as a model, we establish that precursor activation is a highly coordinated process that involves synchronized folding, autoprocessing, propeptide release, and protease activation. Our results demonstrate that activation is controlled by release of the first free active protease molecule. This triggers an exponential cascade that selectively targets the inhibitory propeptide in the autoprocessed complex as its substrate. However, a mutant precursor that enhances propeptide release can drastically reduce the folding efficiency by altering the synergy between individual stages. Our results represent the first demonstration that propeptide release, not precursor folding, is the rate-determining step and provides the basis for the proposed model for precise spatial and temporal activation that allows proteases to function as regulators of biological function.

Secreted proteases can also serve as “scavengers” that can provide nutrients by degrading extracellular proteins (9Johnson W.J. Pizzo S.V. Imber M.J. Adams D.O. Science. 1982; 21: 8574-8576Google Scholar). All these processes require proteases to become active at specific times and in precise cellular locations while being stable toward autolysis. Proteolytic stability can be created through tight packing and reduced configurational entropy. The consequence of this rigidity often results in a high energy unfolding transition state that requires total disruption of an extremely tight conformation (10Sohl J.L. Jaswal S.S. Agard D.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Difficulty in unfolding tight conformations can also occur during their folding and, therefore, such proteases require assistance of dedicated propeptides or intramolecular chaperones. Propeptides can function as single-turnover folding catalysts, because they are destroyed during maturation and are not available to catalyze unfolding. This forces the protease to be locked into a stable conformation (10Sohl J.L. Jaswal S.S. Agard D.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 11Shinde U. Inouye M.

Denatured subtilisin and α-lytic protease take biologically prohibitive time scales to adopt native conformations when folded in the absence of their cognate propeptides (10Sohl J.L. Jaswal S.S.

Rheinnecker M. Fersht A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Propeptides of subtilisin and α-lytic protease appear essential only during the late stages of folding, because they can directly stabilize the transition state of folding (15Baker D. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This suggests that precursor folding is the RDS1 that controls the formation of active proteases. We have dissected the individual stages of precursor maturation by using pro-subtilisin as a model. Pro-subtilisin folding initiated by rapid dilution (23Fu X. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol.

Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Degradation is required, because the propeptide can inhibit the active site of subtilisin with an affinity in the nanomolar range (27Li Y. Hu Z. Jordan F. Inouye M. J. Biol.

Therefore, point mutations within the propeptide can alter structure and activity even though the mutation is no longer a part of the protease domain. In the absence of their propeptide, the protease domains of subtilisin and α-lytic protease are trapped into stable inactive molten globule-like intermediates that can readily convert into active conformers when their propeptides are added in trans (15Baker D. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22Eder J. Rheinnecker M. Fersht A.

This established that (a) covalent attachment was not necessary for initiating folding and (b) the propeptide functions only during the late stages of the folding process. These findings suggest that subtilisin folding is the rate-limiting step in pro-subtilisin maturation. By using a recently standardized procedure for rapid renaturation of pro-subtilisin (23Fu X. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we have dissected the maturation pathway of the precursor. Although the free and thereby unstructured propeptide is an extremely good substrate for subtilisin, the autoprocessed propeptide-subtilisin complex is exceptionally stable. A detailed analysis of the kinetics of the individual stages of maturation establishes that the first active subtilisin molecule released can bind with the propeptide in the cleaved complex and, subsequently, degrades it to effectively release two active molecules. This process that initiates a cascade, which destroys the entire propeptide within the complex to release active subtilisin, fits an exponential kinetic equation. Our results establish that (i) the folding and autoprocessing of pro-subtilisin are both extremely rapid processes that occur ∼48- and 6-fold faster, respectively, than the release of enzymatic activity and (ii) the release of the first free enzymatically active molecule is rate-limiting for maturation. Proteins were expressed and purified as described earlier (23Fu X. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Folding was initiated by rapidly mixing 30 μl of 0.65 μm precursor (6 mGdnHCl, pH 4.8) into 3000 μl of folding buffer (50 mmMES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 0.5 m(NH4)2SO4, 1 mmCaCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). CD measurements were performed on an automated AVIV 60DS spectrophotometer maintained at 25 °C, and spectra were taken between 190 to 260 nm as described earlier (23Fu X. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Folding kinetics were monitored using a quartz cuvette (1-cm path length) and simultaneously recording the changes in CD spectra at 225 nm as described earlier (23Fu X. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The software Prism GraphPad version 2.01 was used for the data fitting analysis and graph plotting. After completion of the folding experiments, aliquots of the sample were removed and separately assayed for proteolytic activity and the extent of precursor maturation (trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and quantitative gel scanning densitometry). 200-μl aliquots of the folded precursor were removed at fixed time intervals, and the reaction was stopped by adding 22 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated samples were washed with 100% acetone and then air-dried. The pellet was dissolved in 10 μl of loading dye and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The extent of precursor autoprocessing was quantitated using densitometry. Propeptide (2.3 μm) was added to 120 nm of mature subtilisin to maintain a propeptide-subtilisin complex with a large excess of free propeptide. When active subtilisin degrades its inhibitory propeptide, a free propeptide molecule immediately binds with the free protease. The dynamics of this process enables us to obtain quantitative rates of propeptide degradation. 100-μl aliquots of the mixture were removed at various times, and the reaction was stopped using trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed using densitometry. An aliquot of the sample is incubated at 25 °C in 200 μl of protease assay buffer (folding buffer that contains 0.5 mm N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide). Enzymatic activity of subtilisin is estimated by monitoring (over a 5-min time interval) the release of p-nitroanilide through changes in absorbance at 405 nm, using a Bio-Rad UV-microplate reader as described earlier (23Fu X. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For a fixed substrate concentration, the velocity of p-nitroanilide formation provides an estimate of free subtilisin concentration, because the unautoprocessed and autoprocessed pro-subtilisins are unable to cleave the chromogenic peptide substrate (data not shown). Mature subtilisin (15 nm) was rapidly added to the protease assay buffer, which contained 22.5 nm unautoprocessed precursors, autoprocessed precursors, and the free propeptide. Enzyme activity and inhibition was monitored as described previously (18Marie-Claire C. Yabuta Y. Suefuji K. Matsuzawa H. Shinde U. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Pro-subtilisin folding was initiated through rapid dilution, and aliquots of the precursor were removed at fixed time intervals to assay for protease activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). The release of p-nitroanilide (monitored atA405 nm) was utilized to calculate the amount of active subtilisin produced as a function of time. Fig.1 a has two striking features: (i) active subtilisin can be observed ∼240 min after folding initiation and (ii) formation of mature subtilisin follows an almost “none-to-all” transition, wherein no free enzyme is observed just prior to activation. Furthermore, pro-subtilisin activation is concentration-independent between 2 and 40 ng/μl (data not shown). If the delay in formation of active subtilisin occurs as a consequence of slow folding, this could establish folding as the RDS in maturation. Therefore, rates of pro-subtilisin folding and autoprocessing were measured, and their time scales were compared with the release of free subtilisin. Folding kinetics (Fig. 1 b) were monitored by rapidly diluting guanidine hydrochloride denatured pro-subtilisin into the folding buffer and monitoring the changes in the circular dichroism spectrum at 225 nm as a function of time as discussed under “Experimental Procedures.” Although rapidly diluted pro-subtilisin adopts complete secondary structure within 5 min of folding initiation (Fig. 1 c), free subtilisin appears 240 min after folding initiation (Fig. 1 a). The secondary structures of the refolding proteins after 5 and 240 min were almost identical with the autoprocessed propeptide-subtilisin complex and mature subtilisin, respectively (Fig. 1 c). Therefore pro-subtilisin folding is completed 48-fold faster than the release of free subtilisin. Because formation of active subtilisin requires propeptide cleavage and degradation, we next monitored the autoprocessing rates of pro-subtilisin under conditions identical to those employed for folding. Autoprocessing of the 36-kDa pro-subtilisin (Fig.1 d, inset) results in the formation of a cleaved, non-covalent propeptide-subtilisin complex, in which the 28-kDa band depicts the subtilisin domain whereas the 8-kDa fragment represents the propeptide. Fig. 1 d demonstrates that pro-subtilisin autoprocessing (filled circles) is evident within 2 min of folding initiation, and the formation of mature subtilisin (Fig.1 d, open circles) is completed within 30 min. Hence autoprocessing (30 min) occurs 6-fold slower than the folding of pro-subtilisin (5 min) but is 8-fold faster than the release of free subtilisin (240 min). The yield of active subtilisin was ∼85%. Although the amount of pro-subtilisin decreases as a function of time (Fig. 1 d, filled circles), no increase in the amount of autoprocessed complex (Fig. 1 d, open circles and diamonds) was observed after 30 min of folding initiation (Fig. 1 d and inset). This suggests that the precursor, which remains after 30 min of folding initiation, may be degraded. Furthermore, the autoprocessed propeptide-subtilisin complex observed at 30 min appears stable up to 240 min, after which the propeptide is rapidly destroyed within the next few minutes (Fig. 1 d, open diamonds). We were, however, unable to obtain the exact time-scale of this degradation. Proteolysis of the cleaved propeptide occurs after complete degradation of the unautoprocessed precursor from the folding mixture. Therefore, proteolytic stability of the unautoprocessed and autoprocessed pro-subtilisins appears different. Moreover, folding and autoprocessing of pro-subtilisin are relatively rapid processes that are completed long before the release of free subtilisin and suggest that propeptide degradation is the RDS in precursor activation. The subtilisin propeptide is a competitive inhibitor of proteolytic activity when it is added in trans (27Li Y. Hu Z. Jordan F. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25127-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This inhibition is temporary due to proteolytic sensitivity of the propeptide. Because rates of propeptide autodegradation could not be established from the cleaved propeptide-subtilisin complex, a different strategy was employed. A 20-fold excess of free propeptide was added to mature subtilisin to maintain a propeptide-subtilisin complex with saturating amounts of free propeptide. Aliquots of the reaction were removed at different time intervals, and the reaction was stopped using trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The mixture was resolved using Tricine-SDS-PAGE, and the extent of propeptide-degradation was measured using quantitative gel scanning densitometry (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Approximately 9-fold of this propeptide (45% of the initial amount that was added) was degraded within 15 s (Fig. 2, a andb). This phase represents the time necessary for the unstructured propeptide to fold and subsequently inhibit subtilisin activity (18Marie-Claire C. Yabuta Y. Suefuji K. Matsuzawa H. Shinde U. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Once bound and thereby structured, subtilisin requires ∼30 min to proteolyze the remaining 11-fold excess of propeptide (55% of the initial amount that was added). Fig. 2 (a andb) establishes that trans degradation of the propeptide is an extremely rapid and non-linear process. The release of inhibition due to propeptide degradation was also monitored using a synthetic substrate (N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide). In this experiment, an aliquot of 100 μl of the reaction was removed (after rapidly mixing active subtilisin with the 20-fold excess of the propeptide) and added into 100 μl of the enzyme activity assay buffer that contains 0.5 mm synthetic substrate. The release ofp-nitroanilide was monitored by recording the changes in the absorbance at 405 nm as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The time of p-nitroanilide release (Fig. 2 b,dashed line) coincides with the complete degradation of the added propeptide (Fig. 2 b, filled circles). This is because the relative affinity of the propeptide is 105-fold greater than the synthetic substrate, although both interact with the substrate-binding loop of subtilisin (28Jain S. Shinde U. Li Y. Inouye M. Berman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 32Wells J.A. Estell D.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1988; 13: 291-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). As a result, the synthetic substrate gets degraded only after complete propeptide proteolysis. Our results establish that the propeptide is an excellent substrate for active subtilisin and is degraded at ∼7.5 and 0.05 pmol/s during the rapid and slow phases, respectively. Furthermore, whereas a 20-fold excess of propeptide added to active subtilisin in trans gets degraded within 30 min, the autoprocessed 1:1 propeptide subtilisin complex matures into free subtilisin in 240 min and ∼8-fold slower. Therefore, the presence of free subtilisin dramatically influences the dynamics of propeptide degradation, and the release of free subtilisin may represent the RDS. We next established the extent to which exogenously added active subtilisin can modulate the time of activation of pro-subtilisin. Pro-subtilisin was folded as discussed earlier, and a small amount of active subtilisin was added into the refolded precursor after 30 min. Aliquots were removed from the folding reaction at fixed time intervals, and subtilisin activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Rapidly diluted precursor in the absence of exogenously added mature subtilisin, serves as the positive control, whereas mature subtilisin alone was the negative control used for this reaction. Fig. 3 a establishes that addition of ∼20% of active subtilisin to the folding reaction reduces the time of activation by more than 50%. Addition of mature subtilisin at 0–10 min after folding initiation significantly reduces the folding efficiency (Fig. 3 a, inset) presumably by destroying partially folded protein. Fig. 3 bindicates that the activation time reduces as an exponential function of exogenously added active subtilisin and establishes that the presence of free subtilisin in the folding reaction modulates the activation time. This also suggests that formation of free subtilisin is the RDS in precursor maturation. Because prematurely released active subtilisin may degrade partially structured pro-subtilisin conformers, we examined the stability of the intermediates that accumulate during maturation. A Ser221 → Ala substitution at the active site can block pro-subtilisin autoprocessing (25Li Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4169-4174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), while Ser221→ Cys mutation can prevent degradation of the propeptide from the autoprocessed complex (25Li Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4169-4174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jain S. Shinde U. Li Y. Inouye M. Berman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the rates of folding of pro-Ser221 → Ala- and pro-Ser221 → Cys-subtilisin (Fig. 1 b) and the overall secondary structures of the folded precursors (Fig. 1 c) are similar to the WT precursor. Because the active site substitutions reduce the proteolytic activity of subtilisin by ∼10,000-fold (32Wells J.A. Estell D.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1988; 13: 291-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), pro-Ser221 → Ala- and pro-Ser221 → Cys-subtilisin were used to measure proteolytic stability of the unautoprocessed and autoprocessed precursors. The folded precursors were purified as described earlier (25Li Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4169-4174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Active subtilisin was separately added to equal amounts of the purified precursors and mixed thoroughly. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed, and the reaction stopped as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Fig. 3 c (lower panel) shows that the uncleaved pro-Ser221 → Ala-subtilisin (36 kDa) is completely degraded within 1 min, and the amount of mature subtilisin (28 kDa) does not increase during this process. Therefore, mature subtilisin does not facilitate autoprocessing of the pro-Ser221 → Ala-subtilisinin trans. Furthermore, a transient band of 25 kDa (Fragment 2) that is lower than the 28-kDa mature subtilisin is evident within the 30 s and is degraded within 20 min. Under identical conditions the 8-kDa propeptide domain from the autoprocessed complex is degraded within 30 min (Fig. 3 c, upper panel) through a transient ∼5-kDa band (Fragment 1). This suggests that the entire unautoprocessed precursor and the propeptide domain within the autoprocessed complex can serve as substrates for mature subtilisin. We next established the relative affinities of these intermediates for active subtilisin. Mature subtilisin was rapidly added (separately) to the protease assay buffer that contains unautoprocessed precursors, autoprocessed precursors, and free propeptide. Fig. 3 d depicts the release ofp-nitroanilide as a function of time. The profiles depicted in Fig. 3 d occur as a consequence of the unautoprocessed precursors, autoprocessed precursors, and free propeptide competing with the synthetic substrate for binding with the substrate binding loop active site of subtilisin (18Marie-Claire C. Yabuta Y. Suefuji K. Matsuzawa H. Shinde U. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The amount ofp-nitroanilide released as a function of time would therefore depend upon the relative affinity of the various intermediates to bind with active subtilisin. Fig. 3 dsuggests that the unautoprocessed pro-Ser221 → Ala-subtilisin and autoprocessed propeptide-Ser221 → Cys-subtilisin complex were ∼25- and 5-fold weaker inhibitors, respectively, for mature subtilisin when compared with the free propeptide. These results confirm that the equimolar propeptide-subtilisin complex, whose x-ray structure has been solved (28Jain S. Shinde U. Li Y. Inouye M. Berman H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Gallagher T. Gilliland G. Wang L. Bryan P. Structure. 1995; 3: 907-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), is the most stable form of the precursor (Fig. 1 d,inset, and Fig. 2 c). However, the release of a small amount of free active subtilisin can shift the dynamics of this stable autoprocessed precursor toward maturation, by selectively targeting the non-covalently attached propeptide-domain from the complex as its substrate (Fig. 3 c, upper panel). The initial degradation step may occur at Glu-25 within the propeptide (33Kojima S. Minagawa T. Miura K.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A Glu112 → Ala substitution (23Fu X. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in the interface of the propeptide-subtilisin complex allows the precursor to fold at a rate similar to the WT pro-subtilisin (Fig. 1 b) but can retard the rate of autoprocessing by ∼100-fold (23Fu X. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although the enzymatic activity remains unchanged, Glu112 → Ala-subtilisin can bind its propeptide with a 35-fold weaker affinity (23Fu X. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) as illustrated in Fig.4 a. As a result, equal concentrations of the wild-type propeptide can be degraded more rapidly by Glu112 → Ala-subtilisin when compared with wild-type subtilisin, even though both enzymes have identical specific activities (23Fu X. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Glu112 → Ala-subtilisin releases enzymatic activity earlier than wild-type subtilisin (Fig.4 b). Because the affinity between the propeptide and protease domain and the rate of autoprocessing (Fig. 4 c) was altered, pro-Glu112 → Ala-subtilisin was used to establish the importance of the synergy between the different stages of pro-subtilisin maturation. Folding and autoprocessing of pro-Glu112 → Ala-subtilisin was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Autoprocessing is evident within 60 min after initiation of pro-Glu112 → Ala-subtilisin folding (Fig. 4 c). However, as a consequence of 35-fold weaker binding of the propeptide with the protease domain (Fig.4 b), enzymatically active Glu112 → Ala-subtilisin will be released earlier than the WT precursor (23Fu X. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The 35-fold weaker inhibition causes premature release of enzymatic activity, and this coupled with slower autoprocessing can provide active Glu112 → Ala-subtilisin with large amounts of unprocessed precursor. As shown earlier, this precursor is the most proteolytically unstable conformer of pro-subtilisin (Fig.3 c, lower panel). Degradation of the unprocessed precursor reduces the yields of mature subtilisin by ∼10-fold. Specific activity of Glu112 → Ala-subtilisin is identical to the WT protease (data not shown). Based on the data highlighted under “Results,” a mechanistic model for precursor activation is proposed. Although pro-subtilisin is used as a model, it is likely that similar mechanisms exist within other proteases that are produced as precursors. Fig. 5 describes the propeptide-mediated protein folding pathway and provides a mechanism of coordinated activation of pro-subtilisin. The unfolded precursor of pro-subtilisin when refolded through rapid dilution undergoes maturation to produce mature subtilisin through a process that involves folding, autoprocessing, and degradation (Figs. 1 a and4 a). Folding of pro-subtilisin, which requires the presence of the propeptide domain (13Zhu X. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M. Nature. 1989; 339: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), is a rapid process (Fig. 1 b) that occurs through a partially structured non-native folding intermediate (14Inouye M. Fu X. Shinde U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The non-native intermediate then undergoes structural changes to give a native-like folded, but un-autoprocessed precursor (Fig. 1 c). The orientation of the propeptide with subtilisin is critical for the autoprocessing reaction (23Fu X. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which is also a fairly rapid process (Fig. 1 d). Once autoprocessed, the propeptide-subtilisin complex appears to a remarkably stable state due to the inhibitory function of the propeptide. Because all autoprocessed subtilisin would be obligatorily bound with the propeptide, the protease domain within this complex has to somehow free itself of its cognate propeptide-domain to promote proteolysis. This release is the RDS of maturation reaction, which occurs on a time-scale of 230–260 min under the experimental conditions that are employed in this work. The addition of free mature subtilisin can shift this release to an earlier time-scale (Fig. 3, a andb). Once a free protease molecule is formed, it can bind to the propeptide domain in the autoprocessed complex and facilitatetrans degradation. It is important for the propeptide-subtilisin complex to interact with mature subtilisin, because this allows a rapid exponential activation. Our results also suggest that the rate constants of the various steps of the maturation appear to be optimized for maximum yield of the protease domain. It appears that the folding and autoprocessing should be completed before the release of the first active subtilisin molecule. This is confirmed by our finding that the autoprocessed complex is the most proteolytically stable intermediate of the maturation pathway (Fig.3 c). Hence, premature release of active subtilisin is detrimental for the efficiency of the folding process, because the unautoprocessed precursors are excellent protease substrates. This is confirmed by the finding that Glu112 → Ala substitution within pro-subtilisin dramatically reduces the yield of the maturation reaction (Fig. 4), although the rates of folding are not affected (23Fu X. Inouye M. Shinde U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Hence, inhibition of proteolytic activity by the propeptide serves to coordinate exponential release of enzymatic activity. Because the propeptide can destabilize its cognate protease domain (24Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Shinde U.P. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), propeptide-proteolysis indirectly serves to enhance the stability by locking the protease-domain into a stable conformer (10Sohl J.L. Jaswal S.S. Agard D.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the location of this RDS is extremely crucial for efficient maturation. Tight binding of the cleaved propeptide is necessary to allow the remaining precursor to complete its folding and autoprocessing, because premature activation can dramatically reduce the folding efficiency as evident in pro-Glu112 → Ala-subtilisin. Our results establish that, although the propeptide is essential for folding of the protease domain, the inhibitory function is required for the maximum efficiency of this process and to control the precision of protease activation. Although the delay between completion of autoprocessing and release of enzyme activity is quite large, it is possible that additional factors or signals may contribute to early in vivo activation. We are grateful to Prof. Shigeru Nakamori for constant support of this work."

ApoB mRNA editing takes place in mammalian small intestine and generates a protein species that participates in dietary lipid absorption yet functions in lipoprotein uptake in a metabolically distinct manner from the full-length protein, apoB100, which is generally secreted by the liver (5Young S.G. Circulation. 1990; 82: 1574-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Accordingly, C to U RNA editing of apoB plays an important physiological role in mammalian lipoprotein metabolism.

Computer modeling studies, based on structural homology, as well as direct biochemical evidence suggest that apobec-1 is a dimer with the composite active site assembled through the interaction of each monomer (14Lau P.P.

In addition, apobec-1 is an RNA-binding protein that binds to the consensus sequence UUUN(A/U)U, located within the terminal loop in apoB RNA immediately downstream of the edited base and spanning the 5′ end of the mooring sequence (16Anant S.

Davidson N.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1982-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This apparently broad substrate binding activity, coupled with the observation that overexpression of apobec-1 in the livers of transgenic mice and rabbits results in hepatocellular carcinomas in association with promiscuous editing of other RNAs (19Sowden M.

Recently, two groups have independently identified a 65-kDa protein (ACF/ASP) that, when added with apobec-1, reconstitutes editing of an apoB RNA template in vitro (24Lellek H. Kirsten R. Diehl I. Apostel F. Buck F. Greeve J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19848-19856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 25Mehta A. Kinter M.T. Sherman N.E. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Data from several laboratories have now confirmed that ACF and apobec-1 together represent the minimal core of the apoB RNA editing enzyme (26Blanc V. Navaratnam N. Henderson J.O. Anant S. Kennedy S.

However, it is currently unknown whether other factors can function interchangeably in an editing reaction. Directly coupled to this uncertainty is the lack of conclusive information concerning the functional size of the holo-editing enzyme, one that might include both catalytic and regulatory components. Earlier studies demonstrated that apoB RNA editing occurs in the context of a large, macromolecular 27 S editing complex or “editosome” that assembles on the apoB mRNAin vitro, suggesting that additional factors may play a role in the editing process (9Smith H.C.

In the course of these studies, several proteins were identified, by their ability to bind either apoB RNA or apobec-1 (7Harris S.G. Sabio I. Mayer E. Steinberg M.F. Backus J.W. Sparks J.D.

Ser. 1997; 36: 115-118Google Scholar). Nevertheless, despite extensive examination of editing complexes isolated from both tissue and cell sources, there is no firm consensus concerning the composition of the intact holo-enzyme. In the present study, we have cloned and identified a 54-kDa protein (CUGBP2) as an apobec-1-binding protein. CUGBP2 has been identified by various groups and demonstrated to play a role in regulating RNA splicing (35Good P.J. Chen Q. Warner S.J. Herring D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28583-28592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 36Ladd A.N. Charlet N. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 37Timchenko L.T. Timchenko N.A. Caskey C.T. Roberts R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that CUGBP2 interacts with apobec-1, ACF, and apoB RNA both in vitro and in vivo and co-fractionates with editing complementing activity in bovine liver S-100 extracts. Addition of GST-APOBEC-1 to bovine liver S-100 extracts resulted in formation of an apoB RNA editing holoenzyme, which upon further fractionation was found to contain apobec-1, ACF, and CUGBP2. RNA binding studies demonstrated that CUGBP2 is an apoB RNA-binding protein, which binds to an AU-rich sequence upstream of the edited cytidine. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of CUGBP2 from rat hepatoma cells revealed the presence of co-precipitated apoB RNA. In co-transfection experiments, CUGBP2 co-localized with apobec-1 and ACF in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, respectively. Finally, antisense-mediated knockout of CUGBP2 expression in rat hepatoma cells increased apoB mRNA editing 3-fold. Taken together, the data suggest that CUGBP2 is a regulatory component of the apoB RNA editing holo-enzyme. The evidence suggests that CUGBP2 acts to modulate editing either by binding to apobec-1 in the cytoplasm and restricting apobec-1 shuttling to the nucleus and/or by binding to ACF and apoB mRNA in the nucleus and disrupting their functional interaction. apobec-1 was expressed as a GST fusion protein as previously described (16Anant S. MacGinnitie A.J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14762-14767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 38MacGinnitie A.J. Anant S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14768-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Full-length CUGBP2 cDNA was cloned into plasmid pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at the BamHI and SalI restriction sites, respectively and expressed as a GST fusion protein. ACF cDNA, isolated from human liver RNA using primers ACF1 (5′-GGATCCCCATATGGAATCAAATCACAAATCCG-3′, BamHI restriction site underlined) and ACF2 (5′-CTCGAGTCAGAAGGTGCCATATCCATC-3′, XhoI restriction site underlined), was cloned into plasmid PET-28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) at the BamHI and XhoI sites and expressed as a histidine-tagged protein. Protein expression was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Novagen). The proteins were size fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and silver-stained. The purity of GST/APOBEC-1, GST/CUGBP2, and ACF was determined to be >90%, >90%, and >99%, respectively. Antibody to the full-length CUGBP2 was generated in rabbits (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), which was affinity purified using a Sepharose column covalently coupled with recombinant CUGBP2. A 32P-labeled rat apoB cRNA template (50,000 cpm at 2.5–3.0 × 108 cpm/μg) was incubated with 250 ng of purified recombinant GST/CUGBP2 for 20 min at room temperature and then sequentially treated with RNase T1 (final concentration, 1 unit/μl) and heparin (final concentration, 5 mg/ml) for 5 min each (16Anant S.

For supershift analysis, undiluted α-CUGBP2 IgG was added, and the incubation was continued for additional 20 min before RNase T1 and heparin treatments. The mixture was immediately analyzed by 4% native PAGE (37.5:1) using 45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.6, 0.1 mm EDTA. The gels were dried and autoradiographed at −70 °C. For UV cross-linking analysis, the reaction mixture was further subjected to cross-linking in a Stratalinker (Stratagene, 250 mJ/cm2) for 90 s and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Where indicated, competition for binding was performed in the presence of a 125-fold excess of cold competitor as described previously (26Blanc V. Navaratnam N. Henderson J.O. Anant S. Kennedy S.

CUGBP2 was cloned into plasmid pHOOK-2 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites for expression as a COOH-terminal HA epitope-tagged fusion protein. apobec-1 was cloned into plasmid pCMV-Tag 2B (Stratagene) at the BamHI and SalI sites for expression as an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged fusion protein. ACF was cloned into the BamHI andXhoI sites of plasmid pCMV-Tag 2B and expressed as an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged fusion protein. The plasmids were transfected individually using FUGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) into COS-7 cells grown on coverslips. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. The FLAG and HA epitopes were used to detect the proteins using mouse α-FLAG M2 monoclonal (Stratagene) and rabbit α-HA Y-11 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), respectively, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and by Cy3-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). For standard immunofluorescence analysis, coverslips were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing diamidinophenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for visualization of nuclei. Stained cells were imaged with a Zeiss Axiostop 2 MOT microscope equipped with a 40× plan-neofluor objective and a 3CCR camera (DAGE-MTI Inc., Michigan City, IN). A Zeiss Attoarc variable intensity lamp was used with filters designed for Cy3, FITC, and diamidinophenylindole. To detect interaction of apobec-1 and ACF with CUGBP2, the plasmids were transfected together (CUGBP2 and apobec-1 or CUGBP2 and ACF) using FUGENE-6 transfection reagent into COS-7, HepG2, and McArdle7777 cells. Staining for the various proteins was performed as mentioned above, but nuclei were visualized by TO-PRO-3 iodide staining (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The cells were imaged with a microscope equipped with a 63× Zeiss planapochromatic objective and a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal adaptor. A krypton-argon laser was used with epifluorescence filter sets designed for Texas Red (Cy3), fluorescein (FITC), and cyanine (Cy5). The confocal aperture was set at 1.8, and 15–40 images, at planes separated by 0.5 μm, were obtained. This increment allows sectioning of the entire image giving a range of signals covering every plane of the cells in that image. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 4.0 software (Deneba Software, CA). Anti-CUGBP2 IgG was covalently coupled to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as directed by the manufacturer. Briefly, the resin was washed with 15 bed volumes of ice-cold 1 mm HCl and mixed with 200 μg of α-CUGBP2 IgG in coupling buffer (0.2 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Excess active groups were blocked by incubating with buffer A (0.5 m ethanolamine, 0.5m NaCl, pH 8.3) for 4 h at room temperature with gentle mixing. The antibody-coupled resin was washed extensively and sequentially with buffer A and B (0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.5m NaCl, pH 4.0) to disrupt any ionic interactions of the antibody with the resin. Subsequently, the resin was washed with buffer D (20 mm Hepes·HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm benzamidine) and mixed overnight at 4 °C with 75 μg of Superdex-200 fraction 16 of bovine liver extract. After extensive washes, the proteins bound to the antibody in the column were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0. The eluant was immediately neutralized with 200 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.0, and dialyzed against buffer D. The starting material, the unbound column flow-through, and the eluant were subjected to Western blot analysis using α-ACF (4–18) antibody (kind gift of Donna Driscoll (25Mehta A. Kinter M.T. Sherman N.E. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar)) and α-CUGBP2 IgG. The unbound column flow-through was also dialyzed against buffer D and assayed for complementation activity in thein vitro editing assay (38MacGinnitie A.J. Anant S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14768-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). S-100 extracts or Superdex-200 fractions and recombinant proteins were size fractionated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For Western blot analyses, the membranes were blocked overnight in buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk followed by sequential incubations with either α-CUGBP2 IgG, α-HSP40 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), or α-ACF (4–18) antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.). The membranes were then subjected to chemiluminescence detection using luminol according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Far Western analyses, the blotted proteins were denatured in buffer containing 6 m guanidium HCl and renatured by washing 12 times in buffer D containing increasing, 2-fold dilutions of guanidium HCl (25Mehta A.

The membranes were blocked overnight in buffer D containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 5% bovine serum albumin followed by incubation with in vitro translated 35S-CUGBP2 or 35S-apobec-1 at a final concentration of 5 × 105 cpm/ml in buffer D containing 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% nonfat dry milk, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 18 h. The membranes were subsequently washed in buffer D containing 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.1% Tween 20, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. S-100 extracts from McArdle cells were prepared as previously described (38MacGinnitie A.J. Anant S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14768-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). 1 mg of extract was incubated with 5 μg of α-CUGBP2 IgG or preimmune serum and 200 units RNAsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 4 °C for 60 min with agitation. The immune complex was precipitated by addition of 50 μl of protein A-agarose and washed twice with NET buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and the RNA was extracted with 250 μl of Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RNA was resuspended in water and used for first strand cDNA synthesis with random hexanucleotides and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase followed by PCR for apoB and, as control, GAPDH. The PCR reaction was optimized for both apoB and GAPDH cDNAs to ensure amplification within the logarithmic phase. PCR parameters are: 95 °C for 3 min for 1 cycle; 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min for 18 cycles; 72 °C for 10 min for 1 cycle; and hold at 4 °C. The primers used for these PCR reactions have been previously published (38MacGinnitie A.J. Anant S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14768-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis of the amplicon was conducted as previously described to determine the relative proportions of edited and unedited apoB (38MacGinnitie A.J. Anant S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol.

For determining the efficiency of CUGBP2 binding to apoB RNA, 32P-labeled 470-nucleotide apoB RNA spanning the edited site was added at concentrations of either 3,000 or 30, 000 cpm to 500-μg McArdle S-100 extracts. The reaction mixture was incubated with either 2.5 μg of α-CUGBP2 IgG or preimmune serum and 200 units of RNAsin at 4 °C for 60 min with agitation. The immune complexes were precipitated with 25 μl of protein A-agarose. The pellet and supernatant were counted in a Beckman LS-3801 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA), in the presence of Ultima Gold scintillation fluid (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT). Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides for CUGBP2 (5′-GCTCCGTTCATCTTGTTGGCTGTGC-3′, 5′ located at nucleotide 103), ACF (5′-GATTTGTGATTTGATTCCATTGAGA-3′, 5′ located at nucleotide 160), apobec-1 (5′-CCTGTCTCGGAACTCATCTTGCTCT-3′, 5′ located at nucleotide 49), and a scrambled control morpholino oligonucleotide (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′) were generated by GeneTools (LLC, Corvallis, OR). McArdle cells were plated onto 35-mm culture dishes and grown to ∼70% confluence. The oligonucleotides (final concentration, 5 mm) were mixed with delivery agent (EPEI, GeneTools) and incubated with the cells for 3 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The delivery solution was replaced with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. RNA was extracted and subjected to primer extension analysis using a 300-nucleotide cDNA fragment amplified by RT-PCR with primers ND1 and ND3 to determine apoB mRNA editing (35Good P.J. Chen Q.

Bovine liver S-100 extract preparation and in vitro RNA editing assays coupled with primer extension analyses were performed according to previously published methods (38MacGinnitie A.J. Anant S.

The primer extension products were separated by electrophoresis in an 8 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For RT-PCR of CUGBP2 homologs, primers previously described by Ladd and co-workers (36Ladd A.N. Charlet N. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell.

The precipitated material was dialyzed against buffer D (41Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

Fractionations were also performed after the addition of 0.5 mg GST/APOBEC-1. The fractions were collected and analyzed for complementation/editing activity by an in vitro RNA editing assay.

This effect was almost completely blocked by the protein kinase C (PKC) delta inhibitor Rottlerin and by PKCdelta antisense oligonucleotides. At variance, overexpression of wild-type PKCdelta or of an active PKCdelta mutant induced PDH complex activity in both L6 and liver cells. Insulin stimulation of the activity of the PDH complex was accompanied by a 2.5-fold increase in PDH phosphatases 1 and 2 (PDP1/2) activity with no change in the activity of PDH kinase. PKCdelta antisense blocked insulin activation of PDP1/2, the same as with PDH. In insulin-exposed cells, PDP1/2 activation was paralleled by activation and mitochondrial translocation of PKCdelta, as revealed by cell subfractionation and confocal microscopy studies. The mitochondrial translocation of PKCdelta, like its activation, was prevented by Rottlerin. In extracts from insulin-stimulated cells, PKCdelta co-precipitated with PDP1/2. PKCdelta also bound to PDP1/2 in overlay blots, suggesting that direct PKCdelta-PDP interaction may occur in vivo as well. In intact cells, insulin exposure determined PDP1/2 phosphorylation, which was specifically prevented by PKCdelta antisense. PKCdelta also phosphorylated PDP in vitro, followed by PDP1/2 activation. Thus, in muscle and liver cells, insulin causes activation and mitochondrial translocation of PKCdelta, accompanied by PDP phosphorylation and activation. These events are necessary for insulin activation of the PDH complex in these cells."

This family of GEFs invariantly contain a Dbl homology (DH) domain adjacent to a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and while the DH domain usually is sufficient to catalyze nucleotide exchange, possible roles for the conserved PH domain remain ambiguous. Here we demonstrate that the conserved PH domains of three distinct Dbl family proteins, intersectin, Dbs, and Tiam1, selectively bind lipid vesicles only when phosphoinositides are present. While the PH domains of intersectin and Dbs promiscuously bind several multiphosphorylated phosphoinositides, Tiam1 selectively interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (K D ∼5–10 μm). In addition, and in contrast to recent reports, catalysis of nucleotide exchange on nonprenylated Rac1 provided by various extended portions of Tiam1 is not influenced by (a) soluble phosphoinositide head groups, (b) dibutyl versions of phosphoinositides, or (c) lipid vesicles containing phosphoinositides. Likewise, GEF activity afforded by DH/PH fragments of intersectin and Dbs are also not altered by phosphoinositide interactions.

Consistent with their central role in regulating cellular differentiation and proliferation, constitutively active Rho GTPases are sufficient to promote cellular transformation. Similarly, Ras-induced transformation is dependent on Rac1, a Rho GTPase (6Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv.

Since the proper control of a multitude of signaling cascades by G proteins depends critically upon the state of bound nucleotide, G proteins have evolved several, tightly controlled processes for regulating the binding and hydrolysis of guanine nucleotides. For Rho GTPases, the exchange of bound GDP for GTP is catalyzed by a large class of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 related to the gene product for Dbl (diffuse B-celllymphoma) (10Quilliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Similarly to constitutively active forms of Rho GTPases, the unregulated activation of Dbl family members is generally associated with cellular transformation, and many Dbl family members are proto-oncogenic (7Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Olson M.F. Sterpetti P.

Dbl family proteins invariantly contain an ∼300-amino acid span composed of a Dbl homology (DH) domain in tandem with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (12Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 13Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). DH domains are sufficient to catalyze nucleotide exchange; however, exchange activity is often enhanced by inclusion of the adjacent PH domain (14Rossman K.L. Campbell S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 25-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While DH domains serve as the major docking site for Rho GTPases, roles for the adjacent, conserved PH domains remain unclear. The invariant DH/PH domain architecture in all Dbl family members strongly suggests that associated PH domains have a unique and highly conserved role in regulating nucleotide exchange. Simple structural stabilization of the DH domain by the adjacent PH domain as suggested by the Tiam1-DH/PH·Rac1 crystal structure (15Worthylake D. Rossman K. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) is an unsatisfactory explanation for the universal pairing of DH and PH domains. A multitude of other domains could easily be imagined to serve this purpose. In many other proteins, PH domains bind phosphoinositides to function as regulated tethers to cellular membranes (16Hurley J.H. Tsujishita Y. Pearson M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Although PH domains typically share very low sequence identity, all possess a common β-sandwich fold capped at one end with a C-terminal helix. Numerous studies indicate that PH domains generally bind phosphoinositides with a wide degree of affinity and specificity via clusters of basic residues located within the highly variable loops between strands β1/β2 and β3/β4 (21Ferguson K.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25751-25759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) identifies phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) as an obligate activator of nucleotide exchange activity, while another report (27Fleming I.N. Gray A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) describes the identical phosphoinositide as inhibitory to exchange and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) as activators of GEF activity. To define potential functions underpinning the invariant conservation of DH domains with PH domains, we have used several techniques to measure interactions between phosphoinositides and the DH/PH fragments of Tiam1, Dbs (Dbl's bigsister), and intersectin. Here we demonstrate that phosphoinositide binding localizes to the PH domains with no appreciable binding attributable to the DH domains. Also, the PH domains possess measurable affinities only for lipid vesicles containing phosphoinositides. While the DH/PH fragments of intersectin and Dbs bind various phosphoinositides, Tiam1 preferentially binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns (3Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar)P) with low micromolar affinity. Among PH domains, preferential binding of PtdIns(3)P is rare and may implicate Tiam1 in events that occur on the surface of endosomal components where PtdIns(3)P is localized. In addition, and in contrast with previous studies (24Russo C. Gao Y. Mancini P. Vanni C. Porotto M. Falasca M. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. Eva A. J. Biol.

The coding regions for each construct (human intersectin-DH-(1229–1445), intersectin-DH/PH-(1229–1580), murine Dbs-DH-(623–831), Dbs-DH/PH-(623–967), and human Tiam1-DH/PH-(1033–1401)) were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified to homogeneity as previously described (7Whitehead I.P.

The coding region for Tiam1-PSD-95/Dlg/ZO1/DH/PH (residues 858–1406) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, subcloned into pPROEX HTA (Life Technologies, Inc.), and overexpressed as a hexahistidine fusion inE. coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were lysed by French press and clarified by ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by elution with an imidazole gradient. Fractions rich in Tiam1-PDZ/DH/PH were pooled and loaded onto an S-200 gel filtration column to isolate highly purified Tiam1-PDZ/DH/PH. An insect cell expression vector harboring the coding region of the last 1199 residues of Tiam1 fused to a KT3 epitope of SV40 large T antigen was kindly supplied by Onyx Pharmaceuticals and expressed in 1 liter of High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) for 48 h at 27 °C. The cells containing the overexpressed Tiam1 fragment (hereafter called Tiam1-PH/PDZ/DH/PH) were harvested, lysed by sonication, and clarified by ultracentrifugation. Visualization by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting with monoclonal antibody directed against the KT3 tag (Babco) verified the presence of Tiam1-PH/PDZ/DH/PH in the soluble fraction of the lysate. This supernatant was subsequently applied to a HiTrap SP ion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by elution with a linear salt gradient. Fractions rich in Tiam1-PH/PDZ/DH/PH were pooled and concentrated for analysis. For dot-blot screens, DH/PH proteins were expressed as GST fusions (see below). Human Rac1 (residues 1–188, C188S) and Cdc42 (residues 1–188, C188S) were expressed and purified bound to GDP as previously described (15Worthylake D. Rossman K. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined byA 280 using calculated extinction coefficients. Dot-blot assays were performed exactly as described (23Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Briefly, DH/PH fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pGEX-2TK. Expressed and purified DH/PH proteins fused to GST were radiolabeled with 32P using protein kinase A and were applied to nitrocellulose filters containing various phosphoinositides prior to extensive washing and visualization of bound radioactivity using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). One-microliter spots of phospholipids (at 2 mg/ml) were placed on the nitrocellulose in the pattern shown in Fig. 1. Phospholipids were purchased from Matreya, Inc. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared by bath sonication of a dispersion of lipids into aqueous 20 mmHepes (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl. SUVs contained (by molar fraction) 80% dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, 17% dipalmitoyl phosphatidylserine, 3% of a phosphohyinositide (PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2, or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), and 0.1% N-biotinylated dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine when indicated. SUV binding was monitored by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000 instrument. A streptavidin (SA5) chip (BIAcore) was mounted in the instrument, and SUV surfaces were created in each flow cell by capturing the SUVs via biotin-streptavidin interactions. An empty flow cell was maintained to control for nonspecific binding to the carboxymethylated dextran chip. Equal amounts of SUV were immobilized on each respective flow cell as judged by increases in response units displayed on the sensorgrams. Typically, SUVs were loaded onto flow cell surfaces until 2000 response units were achieved. The surfaces were stable and did not decay significantly throughout the titrations. Experiments were performed at 25 °C with 100 μl/min as the flow rate. Proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl, filtered by centrifugation, and degassed. Each surface of the biosensor was then exposed to 25-μl injections of protein solution (association phase) followed by 100 μl of buffer (dissociation phase) via the kinject command. Between injections, a 5-μl pulse of 1 m NaCl and 50 mm NaOH regenerated the SUV surfaces. Each GEF was injected at concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 μm. Raw sensorgrams from each titration were aligned, and the signal due to binding the empty flow cell was subtracted from each curve. The data were then globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding isotherm using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (29Myszka D. Bioessays. 1997; 8: 50-57Google Scholar). The resulting dissociation constants (K D) were obtained from the average of several experiments. Representative titrations are plotted as the steady state binding response (R eq) over the range of GEF concentrations. Inositol phosphates were purchased from Echelon or Calbiochem. Eachd-myo-inositol phosphate ligand (inositol 1,3-bisphosphate (Ins(1,3)P2),d-myo-inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate,d-myo-inositol 1,3,5-trisphosphate,d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate,d-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, andd-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate) was dissolved in isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) buffer (20 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and their concentrations were based on the amount stated by the supplier. Protein solutions were dialyzed exhaustively against ITC buffer, filtered, and degassed before each injection. Titrations were performed at 20 °C using an Omega MCS calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.). Twenty 15-μl injections or 30 10-μl injections of each inositol phosphate (260–360 μm) were titrated into a GEF solution (26–36 μm) in the calorimeter cell (1.39 ml). Data were analyzed by integrating the peaks with Origin 5.0 software. Heats of dilution were subtracted from heats of binding, and the data were fit to a one-binding site model (30Ladbury J.E. Chowdhry B.Z. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotide exchange assays were performed as previously described in 2-ml reactions (15Worthylake D. Rossman K. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Briefly, nucleotide exchange was monitored as the increase in relative fluorescence of the GTP analog mant-GTP upon binding G protein in a reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. Prior to the addition of GEF, a 1 μmconcentration of the appropriate G protein was incubated with 200 nm mant-GTP at 20 °C in a thermostatted cuvette, and fluorescence was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B (λex = 360 nm; λem = 440 nm; slits = 5/5 nm) (31Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After equilibration, 10 nm GEF or buffer (uncatalyzed trace) was added. In order to rapidly screen Dbl PH domains for phosphoinositide affinity, we utilized an established dot-blot assay (23Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This qualitative method has been used to identify PH domain-phosphoinositide interactions, and results typically correlate well with other modes of binding analysis. The DH/PH regions from intersectin, Dbs, and Tiam1 fused to GST were expressed, purified, and radiolabeled with protein kinase A as previously described (23Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). These32P-labeled GST-DH/PH proteins were next applied to nitrocellulose filters that were spotted previously with various phosphoinositides (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig.1, intersectin and Dbs recognized several phosphoinositides, while Tiam1 specifically interacted with only PtdIns(3)P of the panel of phosphoinositides screened. The GST protein alone did not display significant signal for any lipid (data not shown). This differential phosphoinositide selectivity observed for these GEFs using the dot-blot assay prompted us to further evaluate these interactions using more quantitative measurements. Given the ability of the DH/PH fragments of Tiam1, Dbs, and intersectin to bind phosphoinositides on a dot-blot screen, we sought to assess these protein-lipid interactions in a more physiological situation. SUVs composed of 3% molar fraction phosphoinositide were immobilized on a streptavidin SA chip (BIAcore) in a BIAcore 2000 instrument via biotinylated phosphatidylethanolamine (33Jin L. Shieh J.J. Grabbe E. Adimoolam S. Durbin D. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15659-15665Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Solutions of highly purified, untagged, catalytically active DH and DH/PH fragments (see “Experimental Procedures”) were injected over SUV surfaces followed by buffer to promote dissociation. Binding was monitored in real time using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Fig.2 displays representative sensorgrams of intersectin-DH and intersectin-DH/PH applied to flow cells coated with PtdIns(3)P-, PtdIns(4,5)P2-, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-containing vesicles respectively. The DH domain of intersectin or that of Dbs (data not shown) displayed no measurable affinity for any lipid surface tested, while extended fragments of intersectin or Dbs containing the tandem DH and PH domains possessed significant affinity for SUVs doped with phosphoinositides. This differential binding between DH and DH/PH domains implicates the PH domain of Dbl family GEFs in mediating phosphoinositide-dependent membrane localization. We measured GEF binding to SUVs over a range of DH/PH concentrations to obtain quantitative binding constants. Dissociation constants for each GEF-SUV binding curve were estimated by globally fitting the sensorgrams to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, and resulting binding isotherms are presented as the steady state binding signal as a function of GEF concentration in Fig. 3. All GEFs displayed little affinity for vesicles that lack phosphoinositides (80% dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, 20% dipalmitoyl phosphatidylserine, and trace amounts ofN-biotinylated dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (0.1% molar fraction)). In contrast, intersectin-DH/PH and Dbs-DH/PH bound with micromolar range K D values to vesicles containing phosphoinositides, with higher affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 relative to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3)P. Tiam1-DH/PH showed significant specificity for SUVs containing PtdIns(3)P, consistent with the dot-blot results, but did not bind significantly to PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The estimated dissociation constants for these titrations are summarized in TableI and correlate very well with the pattern of binding observed using the dot-blot assay.Table ISPR results for DH/PH fragments binding to phosphoinositide-containing SUVsSUVIntersectin-DH/PHDbs-DH/PHTiam1-DH/PH3% PtdIns(3,4,5)P3> 50> 50> 503% PtdIns(4,5)P24.2 ± 211 ± 6> 503% PtdIns(3)P> 50> 5010 ± 7K D values (μm) were estimated from best fits to the SPR data presented in Fig. 3.

Each dissociation constant is the mean of several experiments with the errors cited as S.D. Open table in a new tab K D values (μm) were estimated from best fits to the SPR data presented in Fig. 3. Values reported with a greater than sign reflect lack of saturable binding for the highest concentration of GEF (50 μm) examined. Each dissociation constant is the mean of several experiments with the errors cited as S.D. To investigate the selectivity of these PH domains for the head groups of phosphoinositides in solution, ITC was used to measure heats of binding upon titration of individual inositol phosphates into solutions of GEFs (see Fig.4). The small amount of heat released during the titrations strongly limits our ability to discern specificities between PH domains and phosphoinositides. However, consistent with the other methods of analysis, Tiam1-DH/PH displayed the greatest affinity for Ins(1,3)P2, the head group of PtdIns(3)P, and consistently bound with an approximateK D of 5 μm, which is similar to theK D of 10 μm measured by SPR for the interaction of Tiam1-DH/PH and SUVs doped with PtdIns(3)P. The only other inositol phosphate releasing any measurable amount of heat upon binding Tiam1-DH/PH was Ins(1,3,4)P3. Intersectin-DH/PH exhibited increasing affinity for inositol phosphates with an increasing number of phosphate groups (negative charge). This trend for intersectin argues that, at least in bulk solution, in the absence of negative phospholipid membranes, intersectin favors phosphoinositide head groups possessing a large degree of localized negative charge, with little stereospecificity. The combination of our detection of selective phosphoinositide affinity by DH-associated PH domains, coupled with previous reports of phosphoinositide-induced modulation of GEF catalysis in solution, prompted us to evaluate the effects of phosphoinositides on guanine nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the DH/PH portions of intersectin, Dbs, and Tiam1 (see Fig.5) (34Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Sakelis C. Patki V. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1859-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous work (14Rossman K.L. Campbell S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 25-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Worthylake D. Rossman K. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar),2 the DH/PH portions of all three Dbl family GEFs efficiently catalyze the exchange of bound GDP for GTP within the appropriate G protein substrates as compared with reactions lacking GEF (uncatalyzed reactions). However, the addition of 333 μmSUVs containing 3% PtdIns(4,5)P2, 10 μmPtdIns(4,5)P2, water-soluble 10 μmdibutyl-PtdIns(4,5)P2, or 10 μmIns(1,4,5)P3, the corresponding soluble head group, did not significantly affect catalysis by intersectin-DH/PH (Fig.5 A) on Cdc42. Similar results were obtained using SUVs containing 3% PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, (data not shown). In contrast, the addition of 10 μm PtdIns(4,5)P2dramatically decreased the rate of Dbs-catalyzed nucleotide exchange on Cdc42 (Fig. 5 B). However, this inhibition was also observed upon the addition of equivalent amounts of the neat organic solvent required to solubilize PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the absence of SUVs. In a similar fashion, SUVs with added PtdIns(3)P, 10 μm dibutyl-PtdIns(3)P, or 10 μmIns(1,3)P2 had no effect on nucleotide exchange catalyzed by Tiam1-DH/PH operating on Rac1. Therefore, under various conditions, phosphoinositides fail to alter guanine nucleotide exchange within nonprenylated forms of Rac1 or Cdc42 catalyzed by three distinct Dbl family GEFs. Like most Dbl family GEFs, Tiam1 contains multiple domains aside from the signature DH/PH region that may influence exchange activity (Fig.6 A). Consequently, two larger fragments of Tiam1 were analyzed for exchange activity potentially regulated by phosphoinositides. A 73-kDa segment of Tiam1 spanning the PDZ domain through the DH/PH region catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange within Rac1 similar to the smaller DH/PH fragment (Fig.6 B). Furthermore, similar to our previous observations, the exchange activity of Tiam1-PDZ/DH/PH is not modulated by phosphoinositides under a variety of conditions (Fig. 6 B). Similarly, a 135-kDa fragment of Tiam1 produced in baculovirus and spanning the C-terminal PH domain through the N-terminal PH domain (28Crompton A.M. Foley L.H. Wood A. Roscoe W. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Symons M. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25751-25759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) also efficiently catalyzes nucleotide exchange within Rac1 but not Cdc42 that cannot be altered by the additions of various phosphoinositides (Fig. 6 C and data not shown). The catalyzed exchange cannot be attributed to e"

However, topoisomerase inhibitors have little or no antineoplastic activity unless they are topoisomerase poisons, a special subclass of topoisomerase-targeting drugs that stabilize topoisomerase-DNA strand passing intermediates and thus cause the topoisomerase to become a cytotoxic DNA-damaging agent. Here we report that ICRF-193 is a very significant topoisomerase II poison. Detection of topoisomerase II poisoning by ICRF-193 required the use of a chaotropic protein denaturant in the topoisomerase poisoning assays. ICRF-193 caused dose-dependent cross-linking of human topoisomerase IIβ to DNA and stimulated topoisomerase IIβ-mediated DNA cleavage at specific sites on 32P-end-labeled DNA. Human topoisomerase IIα-mediated DNA cleavage was stimulated to a lesser extent by ICRF-193. In vivo experiments with MCF-7 cells also showed the requirement of a chaotropic protein denaturant in the assays and selectivity for the β-isozyme of human topoisomerase II. Studies with two topoisomerase IIβ-negative cell model systems confirmed significant topoisomerase II poisoning by ICRF-193 in the wild type cells and were consistent with β-isozyme selectivity.

However, there is also evidence that metal chelation plays little, if any, role in their anticancer activity (2Creighton A.M. Prog. Antimicrob. Anticancer Chemother. 1970; 1: 167-169Google Scholar). Numerous bis(dioxopiperazine)s have been studied for anticancer activity and for interactions with other anticancer drugs and radiation (1Creighton A.M. Hellmann K. Whitecross S.

(I)-4,4′-(1,2-propanediyl)-bis-(4-piperazine-2,6-dione) (ICRF·159, NSC 129943) has pronounced effects on tumor vasculature, and it has been claimed that this is the basis of its antimetastatic activity (3Herman E.H.

Soc. 1982; 104: 3453-3456Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Bis(2,6-dioxopiperazine)s were reported to be strong catalytic inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II (7Tanabe K. Ikegami Y. Ishida R. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4903-4908PubMed Google Scholar), and ICRF-1931 is the most potent of the analogs studied (8Hasinoff B.B. Kuschak T.I. Yalowich J.C. Creighton A.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The meso configuration of the 2,3-butanediyl linker has been shown to be critical for topoisomerase II inhibition (9Snapka R.M. Woo S.H. Blokhin A.V. Witiak D.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). ICRF-193 was shown to inhibit topoisomerase II-dependent steps in SV40 DNA replication in intact mammalian cells (10Permana P.A. Ferrer C.A. Snapka R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1510-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and topoisomerase II was shown to be the cytotoxic target of bis(dioxopiperazine)s in yeast (11Ishida R. Hamatake M. Wasserman R.A. Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2299-2303PubMed Google Scholar). The term “catalytic inhibitor,” when applied to topoisomerases, is used to distinguish them from topoisomerase poisons that stabilize topoisomerase-DNA strand passing reaction intermediates in which the topoisomerases are covalently attached to the DNA at DNA strand breaks (12Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar). This distinction is important because topoisomerase poisons are much more cytotoxic than topoisomerase catalytic inhibitors. Topoisomerase poisons, in contrast to topoisomerase catalytic inhibitors, often have good anticancer activity. The well known topoisomerase II poisons m-AMSA, VM-26, and VP-16 are in widespread clinical use, and topoisomerase I poisons are the focus of numerous studies and clinical trials. The term “topoisomerase poison” was coined to express the idea that this special class of topoisomerase-targeting drugs convert normal enzymes into cellular poisons. These drug-stabilized “cleavable complexes” or “DNA cleavage complexes” are thought to be converted to lethal DNA lesions, such as double strand DNA breaks, when they interact with DNA replication or transcription machinery (12Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar, 13Snapka R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4221-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Assays for topoisomerase poisoning use protein denaturants to inactivate the topoisomerases trapped in cleavage complexes by topoisomerase poisons, thus converting the cleavage complex into an irreversible protein-linked DNA strand break. SDS, a strong detergent, is used almost universally as the protein denaturant in these assays. Various topoisomerase poisoning assays then measure either the DNA strand breaks or the protein-DNA cross-links. Topoisomerase catalytic inhibitors inhibit topoisomerase reactions at other steps of the topoisomerase reaction cycle and are much less cytotoxic because no DNA lesion is formed. For many topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitors, such as proflavine (14Sehested M. Jensen P.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Shin C.-G.

The SV40 Replicon Model for Analysis of Anticancer Drugs. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 65-100Google Scholar), the step inhibited appears to be DNA binding or DNA cleavage site recognition by the topoisomerase. ICRF-193 inhibits topoisomerase II by a unique mechanism in which the topoisomerase becomes locked in a “closed clamp” and is unable to hydrolyze ATP, as required to regenerate the active form of the enzyme (17Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Until recently, bis(dioxopiperazine)s were thought to be pure catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase II that do not stabilize the covalent topoisomerase II-DNA strand passing intermediates that are the basis of topoisomerase poisoning. However, Jensen, et al. reported evidence for very weak topoisomerase II poisoning by ICRF-193 but found it far too weak to account for the cytotoxicity of the drug and suggested that it has a novel cytotoxic mechanism (18Jensen L.H. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Dong J.W. Zhou J.F. Hu T. Osheroff N. Jensen P.B. Sehested M. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2137-2146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here we report evidence that ICRF-193 is a very significant topoisomerase II poison and that a chaotropic protein denaturant must be used to efficiently detect the topoisomerase poisoning. Studies with purified topoisomerases and with intact cells both indicate that ICRF-193 also has a preference for the β-isozyme of human topoisomerase II. However, given the predominance of topoisomerase IIα in actively dividing cells, we feel that topoisomerase IIα poisoning probably contributes significantly to ICRF-193 cytotoxicity. Earlier studies of ICRF-193 may have failed to detect significant topoisomerase II poisoning because of the common use of SDS in topoisomerase poisoning assays. MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells were from the American Type Culture Collection and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. CV-1 African green monkey kidney cells were from the American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf serum. AMCV1 cells are a CV-1 cell subclone maintained in 3 μm m-AMSA (NSC 249992) (19Gao H.L. Huang K.C. Yamasaki E.F. Chan K.K. Chohan L. Snapka R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Leonard Zwelling and Miloslav Beran and were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. ICRF-193 was a gift of Dr. Donald Witiak and Dr. Andrei V. Blokhin. Topoisomerase IIα was from TopoGen (Columbus, OH) and Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL). Topoisomerase IIβ was provided by Dr. Anni H. Andersen (University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark) and Dr. Caroline Austin (University of Newcastle, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK). Topoisomerase IIα-specific antibody was from TopoGen, and topoisomerase IIβ-specific antibody was from Dr. Daniel M. Sullivan (H. Lee Moffitt Hospital, Tampa, FL). The enzymes and antibodies used in these studies were fully active as shown by studies done concurrently with this work (19Gao H.L. Huang K.C. Yamasaki E.F. Chan K.K. Chohan L. Snapka R.M. Proc.

GF/C glass fiber filter assays measure protein-DNA cross-links and are based on the selective binding of proteins to glass fiber filters in 0.4 m GuHCl. The assay is used to measure topoisomerase poisoning in intact cells and in in vitroassays involving purified enzymes and DNA substrates (19Gao H.L. Huang K.C. Yamasaki E.F. Chan K.K. Chohan L.

Forin vitro assays, purified topoisomerases were incubated with [3H]dT-labeled SV40 DNA (12,000 dpm) in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP) for 15 min at 37 °C (22Strumberg D.

The reactions were stopped by the addition of protein denaturants (SDS or GuHCl), and aliquots were removed and added to either 0.4 or 4.0 m GuHCl solutions for filtration through GF/C glass fiber filters. In 4 m GuHCl, all nucleic acids bind the filter, and scintillation counting of the dried filter gives a measure of total labeled DNA in the aliquot. In 0.4 m GuHCl, only protein binds to the glass fiber filter, and DNA is not retained unless it is cross-linked to protein. Comparison of the radioactivity retained on the filter in 0.4 m GuHCl to the radioactivity retained on the filter in 4 m GuHCl gives the fraction of DNA molecules cross-linked to protein. The topoisomerase subunits trapped in topoisomerase-DNA strand passing intermediates at the time of denaturation are covalently cross-linked to the substrate DNA and cause its retention on the glass fiber filter in 0.4 m GuHCl. Thus, the assay can be used to measure topoisomerase poisoning. Forin vivo assays with intact cells, cellular DNA is prelabeled with [3H]dT (1.0 μCi/ml, 85 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the cells are exposed to suspected topoisomerase poisons before lysis with protein denaturants (SDS or GuHCl). The protein denaturants trap drug-stabilized topoisomerase-DNA strand passing intermediates (cleavable complexes) as irreversible protein-DNA cross-links. The cellular DNA is sheared by vortexing, and duplicate aliquots of each lysate are added to 0.4 and 4 mGuHCl solutions for the GF/C filter assay. The in vivo topoisomerase cleavage complex assay, as modified from Subramanin et al.(23Subramanin D. Kraut E. Staubus A. Young D.C. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar), has been described (19Gao H.L. Huang K.C. Yamasaki E.F. Chan K.K. Chohan L. Snapka R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12168-12173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured MCF-7 cells were treated with drugs or the drug solvent, Me2SO, and then lysed with either SDS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.6% SDS) or 6 m GuHCl. The DNA from the lysates was banded by ultracentrifugation in a CsCl step gradient and was eluted from the bottom. Free proteins are left at the top of the gradient, and proteins that are covalently attached to DNA band with the DNA. The fractions containing DNA were pooled and dialyzed to remove CsCl, MgCl2 was added to the dialyzed sample to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the sample was treated with DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) 0.1 unit/μl at 37 °C for 1 h. The DNase I-digested sample was then applied to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a slot blot device. The DNase treatment reduces the viscosity of the sample and greatly facilitates its application to the membrane. Proteins adhere to the membrane tightly. The membrane was subsequently blocked with 10% nonfat milk in TBS buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl), followed by probing with either topoisomerase IIα- or topoisomerase IIβ-specific antibody. The primary antibody was recognized by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Finally, the chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal; Pierce) was added, and the signal detected by a Lumi-Imager (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was analyzed by LumiAnalyst 3.0 software. Nuclear extracts of late log MCF-7 cells were prepared as described (24Snapka R.M. Gao H. Grabowski D.R. Brill D. Chan K.K. Li L. Li G.C. Ganapathi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1155-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Western blotting with topoisomerase IIα- and IIβ-specific antibodies, as described (19Gao H.L. Huang K.C.

Topoisomerase IIα- and IIβ-mediated DNA cleavage sites were mapped on a 516-base pair DNA substrate, consisting of an EcoRI-ScaI fragment of pBR322 (residues 3846–4362). The DNA fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the excised band was isolated with a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valentia, CA). The overhangingEcoRI end was labeled with 32P in a 40-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mm of each deoxynucleotide (dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP), 60 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 3000 Ci/mmol) and Klenow fragment, 5 units (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH). After a 15-min incubation at 25 °C, unlabeled dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and dATP were added (10 nmol of each), and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min before termination by heating at 70 °C for 10 min. The end-labeled DNA fragment was then purified with a mini-Quick Spin DNA column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Assays for topoisomerase IIα/β-dependent DNA cleavage contained end-labeled DNA fragments (1–2 × 105dpm/reaction), 10 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm ATP, and the drug being tested. After a 5-min preincubation at 37 °C, the reaction (total reaction volume, 20 μl) was started by the addition of 0.8 μg of purified human topoisomerase IIα or 1.2 μg of purified topoisomerase IIβ. These amounts gave approximately equal topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage with the isozyme-nonspecific topoisomerase II poison VM-26. The reaction mix was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before termination by the addition of 2 μl of 4m GuHCl. The DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation and then resuspended in 28 μl of proteinase K solution (0.2 mg/ml, 2 h, 45 °C). The DNA was then repurified by ethanol precipitation before resuspension in 4 μl of loading buffer (80% formamide, 10 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). The samples were heated to 70 °C for 2 min, cooled to room temperature, and then loaded onto a DNA sequencing gel (8% polyacrylamide, 19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) containing 7m urea in 1× Tris borate buffer (25Felix C.A. Lange B.J. Hosler M.R. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4287-4292PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed at 1800 V for 2 or 6 h. The gel was then transferred to Whatman 3MM paper, (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sanger dideoxy DNA sequence ladders were generated by using thefmol cycle DNA sequencing system (Promega, Madison WI). The primer 5′-AAATTCTTGAAGACGAAAGGGCC-3′, complementary to theEcoRI end of the 516-base pairScaI/EcoRI pBR322 primer was labeled at the 5′ end by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled primer was used directly without further purification. For each set of sequencing reactions, the appropriate d/ddNTP mix was added, and polymerase chain reaction amplification was carried out for 30 cycles with Taq DNA polymerase. Following the thermal cycling program, the reactions were stopped by the addition of fmolsequencing reaction stop solution, and DNA was denatured at 70 °C immediately before gel loading. Because the sequenced strand was labeled on the 5′ EcoRI end and was complementary to the strand on which topoisomerase-mediated DNA cleavages were mapped, it was necessary to translate the sequence to determine the cutting sites. Many key DNA cleavage sites were also confirmed by Maxam and Gilbert sequence ladders, involving direct sequencing of the strand on which topoisomerase-mediated DNA cleavages were mapped (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.78-13.104Google Scholar). The32P-end labeling for the Maxam and Gilbert sequencing was done as described above for the topoisomerase substrate DNA. A + G and C + T sequencing ladders were used. Cytotoxicity induced by ICRF-193 was determined by a soft agar colony forming assay. Cells (1 × 106/ml) in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum were treated with a range of drug concentrations for 3 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 plus 95% air atmosphere. Following treatment, the cells were washed, and 1 × 104 cells were plated in triplicate in 35 × 10-mm Petri dishes using Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, and 20% fetal bovine serum. Colonies were counted following incubation of the Petri dishes for 6–7 days in a humidified 5% CO2 plus 95% air atmosphere (27Tabata M. Tabata R. Grabowski D.R. Bukowski R.M. Ganapathi M.K. Ganapathi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8029-8036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Colony forming efficiency of the HL-60/S and HL-60/AMSA cells was 29 and 14%, respectively. We use GuHCl as a protein denaturant in both in vitroand in vivo topoisomerase poisoning assays, because our experience has suggested that it traps topoisomerase-DNA cleavage complexes more efficiently than the detergent, SDS, even in the absence of topoisomerase poisons. Routine use of GuHCl for topoisomerase poisoning assays led us to the observation that topoisomerase poisons vary with respect to the increase in efficiency of cleavage complex trapping in GuHCl as opposed to SDS. A remarkable example is chloroquinoxaline sulfonamide, whose topoisomerase II poisoning is detectable only when GuHCl or urea is used as the protein denaturant in the topoisomerase poisoning assay (21Gao H. Yamasaki E.F. Chan K.K. Shen L.L. Snapka R.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5937-5940PubMed Google Scholar). To specifically test the effects of protein denaturant on topoisomerase II poisoning by ICRF-193, we carried out in vitro topoisomerase poisoning assays, using purified human topoisomerase IIα and topoisomerase IIβ. Topoisomerase IIα poisoning was not detected in this in vitro assay when the in vitro reactions were stopped with either SDS or with GuHCl (data not shown). ICRF-193 induced dose-dependent topoisomerase IIβ-DNA cross-links when GuHCl was used to terminate the reaction, but no significant increase in topoisomerase IIβ-DNA cross-links was detected when SDS was used to terminate the reaction (Fig. 1). The background topoisomerase IIβ-DNA cross-linking, in the absence of added drug, was higher when GuHCl was used as the protein denaturant than when SDS was used. This suggests that GuHCl is more efficient than SDS at trapping topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes even in the absence of topoisomerase poisons. ICRF-193 did not cause any filter binding of the DNA substrate in the absence of topoisomerase II. Because topoisomerase poisoning involves drug stabilization of topoisomerase-DNA cleavage complexes, the covalent attachment of the topoisomerase subunits to the DNA occurs at the site of a DNA strand break. To further test topoisomerase poisoning by ICRF-193, we mapped ICRF-193-induced topoisomerase IIα- and IIβ-mediated cleavages on a cloned fragment of pBR322 (Fig. 2), using GuHCl to trap the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes by denaturation and inactivation of the enzyme. Much more extensive DNA cleavage was seen with topoisomerase IIβ than with topoisomerase IIα. The ICRF-193-induced topoisomerase II-DNA cleavages at nucleotides 343 and 346 were seen for both topoisomerase II isozymes, but unique, strong ICRF-193-induced topoisomerase IIβ-DNA cleavages were seen at many other sites, such as nucleotides 329, 396, and 399. Most of the ICRF-193-induced topoisomerase IIβ cleavages (nucleotides 203, 207, 295, 298, 304, 313, 343, 346, 357, 361, 396, and 399; Fig.3) correspond to sites of VM-26-stimulated topoisomerase IIα cleavages that we have mapped in separate experiments (not shown).Figure 3Map of ICRF-193-induced topoisomerase IIα and IIβ cleavage sites in the pBR322 fragment. At the EcoRI end, the primer used for dideoxy DNA sequence ladders is indicated byunderlining, and the 32P-labeled adenine residues incorporated into the strand used for mapping topoisomerase II cleavages and Maxam and Gilbert DNA sequence ladders are indicated bybold type and shading. ICRF-193-induced topoisomerase II cleavage sites are indicated in bold type in the sequence, and the residues are further identified above these residues as either topoisomerase IIα or IIβ cleavage sites with the relative strength of the cleavage indicated bybold text (strong cleavages), normal text(moderate cleavage), and gray text (weak cleavages). The break at C413 is a weak DNA strand break that is always present in our preparations of this pBR322 fragment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ICRF-193 also caused dose-dependent protein-DNA cross-links in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4 A). In cells prelabeled with [3H]dT for 2 days, ICRF-193-induced protein-DNA cross-links increased steeply with the concentration of ICRF-193 and reached a maximum by about 5 μm. ICRF-193 did not cause protein DNA cross-links when it was added after lysis of the cells, suggesting that active enzymes are required for ICRF-193-induced protein DNA cross-links (data not shown). A higher level of ICRF-193-induced protein-DNA cross-linking was reached when cells were pulse labeled with [3H]dT immediately before exposure to the drug (Fig. 4 B). ICRF-193-induced protein-DNA cross-links were only seen when MCF-7 cells were lysed with GuHCl in the presence of the drug but not when the cells were lysed with SDS (Fig. 4 B). ICRF-193-induced protein-DNA cross-links were not significantly higher than background (Me2SO solvent control) when the cells were lysed with SDS buffer. This SDS-based cell lysis efficiently traps topoisomerase-DNA cleavage complexes stabilized by topoisomerase poisons such as teniposide (VM-26), etoposide (VP-16), and m-AMSA (19Gao H.L. Huang K.C. Yamasaki E.F. Chan K.K. Chohan L. Snapka R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12168-12173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The background in this assay consists of a few percent of nonspecific DNA binding to the filters plus a few percent of background protein-DNA cross-linking (removable by proteinase predigestion) that may be due to trapping of intracellular topoisomerase-DNA cleavage complexes in the absence of topoisomerase poisons (21Gao H. Yamasaki E.F. Chan K.K. Shen L.L. Snapka R.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5937-5940PubMed Google Scholar). As in the in vitro experiment with topoisomerase IIβ, protein-DNA cross-linking in the absence of the drug (the solvent controls) was higher with the GuHCl lysis than with the SDS lysis. Again, this suggests that GuHCl is more efficient at trapping topoisomerase-DNA cleavage complexes even in the absence of added topoisomerase poisons. Levels of topoisomerase IIα and IIβ in nuclear extracts of the MCF-7 cells are indicated by Western blotting with topoisomerase IIα-specific antibody and topoisomerase IIβ-specific antibody (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). The high levels of ICRF-193-induced protein-DNA cross-links achieved in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4) suggested the possibility of testing for topoisomerase poisoning in vivo and for determining thein vivo topoisomerase II isozyme preference of ICRF-193. We used the IVCT assay and antibodies specific for topoisomerase IIα and IIβ to test which topoisomerase II isozyme is covalently linked to DNA by ICRF-193 (see “Experimental Procedures”). VM-26 and XK469 were included as controls (Fig.5). The results indicated ICRF-193 selectivity for topoisomerase IIβ, although this selectivity was not as great as that of XK469. As previously reported (19Gao H.L. Huang K.C. Yamasaki E.F. Chan K.K. Chohan L. Snapka R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12168-12173Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), XK469 was highly selective for topoisomerase IIβ and VM-26 was less selective for topoisomerase II isozyme. When SDS was used for lysis of ICRF-193-treated cells, neither topoisomerase IIα nor topoisomerase IIβ was detectable in the IVCT assay (not shown). To further characterize topoisomerase poisoning by ICRF-193in vivo, we studied two topoisomerase IIβ-negative cell"

The dual specificity protein-tyrosine phosphatase MAPKphosphatase-1 (MKP-1) was highly represented in this library. Clones were arrayed on glass slides to create a hypoxia-specific cDNA microarray chip. Microarray, northern blot, and western blot analyses confirmed that MKP-1 mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated by hypoxia by ∼8-fold. The magnitude of the effect of hypoxia on MKP-1 was approximately equal to that induced by KCl depolarization and much larger than the effects of either epidermal growth factor or nerve growth factor on MKP-1 mRNA levels. In contrast to the calcium-dependent induction of MKP-1 by KCl depolarization, the effect of hypoxia on MKP-1 persisted under calcium-free conditions. Cobalt and deferoxamine also increased MKP-1 mRNA levels, suggesting that hypoxia-inducible factor proteins may play a role in the regulation of MKP-1 by hypoxia. Pretreatment of cells with SB203580, which inhibits p38 kinase activity, significantly reduced the hypoxia-induced increase in MKP-1 RNA levels. Thus, hypoxia robustly increases MKP-1 levels, at least in part through a p38 kinase-mediated mechanism.

In recent years, the mechanisms by which cells respond and adapt to decreased O2 levels have begun to be elucidated. For example, the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1 family of proteins includes transcription factors that are stabilized and activated specifically under conditions of low O2 (for review, see Ref. 3Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1983-1991PubMed Google Scholar). Upon activation by hypoxia, the HIF-α/β heterodimer can enhance expression of genes that contain the hypoxia response element motif (5′-RCGTG-3′) in their 5′-flanking regions, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, erythropoietin, glucose transporter-1, and many others (see Ref. 3Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1983-1991PubMed Google Scholar). Other transcription factors that can be activated by hypoxia include the cAMP response element-binding protein, c-Fos, JunB, Elk-1, and nuclear factor-κB (4Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol.

The intracellular signaling pathways that are modulated by hypoxia have also begun to be characterized, and these include calcium-dependent signaling pathways, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the p38 stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), Akt, and Src (6Muller J.M.

However, the coordinated processes by which these genes mediate the whole cellular response to hypoxia are virtually unknown. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which cells respond to and adapt to a reduction in O2 levels would provide important insight toward developing useful therapies against hypoxia-related disorders. To address this issue, we have used subtractive suppression hybridization (SSH) to generate a cDNA library enriched in transcripts that are specifically regulated by hypoxia in pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Coupled with cDNA microarray analysis, this study represents the first step toward delineating the global gene expression profile that is regulated by hypoxia. One of the genes that was most frequently represented in this SSH library was identified as MAPKphosphatase-1 (MKP-1; also termed 3CH134 and CL100) (16Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar, 17Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This phosphatase is one member of a family of dual specificity phosphatases or MKPs that oppose the effects of MAPKs and SAPKs (18Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 19Martell K.J. Angelotti T. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 8: 2-11Google Scholar, 20Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MAPKs and SAPKs can be induced by a wide array of cellular stimuli (for review, see Refs. 21Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar and 22Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation in specific Thr-X-Tyr motifs, these enzymes become activated and can translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate various transcription factors, thereby regulating gene expression. The MKP enzymes are capable of dephosphorylating both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine in Thr-X-Tyr motifs, such as those found in MAPKs and SAPKs. Thus, MKPs oppose the effects of MAPKs and SAPKs. Activation of MAPKs and SAPKs is frequently associated with activation of MKPs, suggesting that MKPs play a role in feedback control of MAPK signaling (23Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). MKPs can be generally classified as being primarily localized either in the nucleus (MKP-1 and MKP-2) or in the cytosol (MKP-3, MKP-4, MKP-5, and M3/6) (19Martell K.J. Angelotti T. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 8: 2-11Google Scholar). The nuclear MKPs are highly inducible and are considered to be immediate-early genes. Recently, it has been shown that the physical interaction of MAPKs or SAPKs with MKPs can stimulate the catalytic activity of both cytosolic and nuclear MKPs (24Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C.

It has also been suggested that an increase in MKP gene expression represents another level of negative feedback regulation on MAPK signaling pathways (23Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J.

Here, we employ SSH coupled with cDNA microarray analysis to demonstrate that MKP-1 is strongly induced by hypoxia in PC12 cells. We also show that this occurs in a calcium-independent manner and that the p38 SAPKs are involved in mediating this effect. PC12 cells were cultured as described previously (4Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19834-19839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). HepG2 and Hep3B cells were grown in the same culture medium used for PC12 cells. HEK293 and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. In some experiments, cells were switched to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium formulated in the absence of calcium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and supplemented with 1 mm EGTA as described previously (4Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19834-19839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Prior to experimentation, cells were grown to ∼80% confluence on 100-mm plates in an environment of 21% O2 and 5% CO2. Hypoxia was delivered in an O2-regulated incubator (Forma Science, Inc., Marietta, OH) as described previously (30Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 760-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were switched to serum-free medium and treated with various drugs (or the corresponding vehicle) for 1 h prior to the initiation of hypoxia. BAPTA-AM, cobalt chloride, and deferoxamine mesylate were obtained from Sigma. Wortmannin, PD098059, and SB203580 were all obtained from Calbiochem. Nerve growth factor (NGF) (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) and epidermal growth factor I (EGF) (Calbiochem) were applied for 20 min under normoxic conditions at final concentrations of 50 ng/ml. When peptide growth factors were used, experiments were performed in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of the indicated growth factors. RNA was isolated from PC12 cells with TrireagentTM (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), essentially according to the suggested protocol, with the addition of two extra acid phenol/chloroform extractions following the single chloroform extraction recommended by the manufacturer. This modification significantly improved the quality of RNA that was recovered. RNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water and quantified with a spectrophotometer as the average of triplicate absorbance readings at 260 nm. RNA quality was verified by visualization of 20 μg on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels containing SYBR® Green II (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). For cDNA library construction, mRNA was isolated from total RNA using the Oligotex Direct mRNA minikit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RNA was treated with amplification-grade DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) to remove genomic DNA. A custom-subtracted cDNA library was constructed using the PCR-SelectTM cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, PC12 cells were exposed to hypoxic or normoxic conditions for 6 h, and mRNA was isolated as described above. Double-stranded cDNA was generated and subjected to restriction digest with RsaI. Following the digest, the hypoxic (tester) sample was split into two pools. Each pool was ligated with a different adaptor (N1 or N2R). Each ligated pool was then denatured and hybridized with an excess of denatured normoxic (driver) cDNA. The hybridized pools were mixed, and a second round of hybridization was performed with an excess of denatured driver. The population of hybrid molecules that contains both adaptors (N1 and N2R) is the population that represents the differentially expressed tester sequences. The entire population of hybridized molecules was subjected to PCR to amplify these desired sequences. In this PCR, driver sequence does not get amplified because it has no adaptors. Tester/driver hybrids are only linearly amplified because they contain adaptor at only one end. Tester/tester hybrids that have the same adaptor at both ends will form hairpin loops under the conditions used and will not be amplified. The amplified fragments were then ligated into the pCR®2.1-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Ligated clones were electroporated into DH10B cells. The library was amplified in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin (growth medium), and the titer was determined. A portion of the library was plated, and colonies were picked into 96-well microtiter plates containing growth medium. Copies of the library were stored in this format at −80 °C as a glycerol stock. The entire library was subjected to DNA sequencing by MWG Biotech, Inc. (High Point, NC) using the M13 reverse primer. Clone inserts were amplified by bacterial PCR using either M13 forward (−40) and reverse primers or primers to the adaptor sequences from the PCR-SelectTM kit. PCR products were isopropyl alcohol-precipitated and resuspended in 3× SSC. The final concentration of each PCR product was 0.2–1 μg/μl. PCR products were spotted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides using an OmniGridTM robot (GeneMachines, San Carlos, CA). Poly-l-lysine slides were either prepared by the method of Brown et al. (31Schena M. Shalon D. Davis R.W. Brown P.O. Science. 1995; 270: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (7671) Google Scholar) or purchased from CEL Associates (Houston, TX); there was no difference in quality between the two types of slides. Slides were post-processed using the succinic anhydride method (31Schena M. Shalon D. Davis R.W. Brown P.O. Science. 1995; 270: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (7671) Google Scholar) and stored at room temperature in a desiccator cabinet until used. Probes for cDNA microarrays were generated using 100 μg of total RNA from cells exposed to normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) in a standard reverse transcriptase reaction in which some of the dTTP was replaced with either 50 μmCy3-labeled dUTP or 75 μm Cy5-labeled dUTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some experiments, the hypoxic sample was labeled with Cy3; and in others, it was labeled with Cy5, with essentially identical results. Probes were cleaned using the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (QIAGEN Inc.). Probes were combined and hybridized to the array overnight at 58 °C in buffer containing 0.57 μg/μl COT-1 DNA, 0.57 μg/μl (dA)40–60, 0.23 μg/μl yeast tRNA, 3.5× SSC, and 0.3% SDS. Slides were washed in the following buffers at room temperature: 1) 10 min in 2× SSC and 0.2% SDS; 2) 5 min in 1× SSC and 0.2% SDS; 3) 1 min in 2× SSC; and 4) 1 min in 0.05× SSC. Slides were then dried by centrifugation at room temperature and scanned immediately. Slides were scanned with a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) at 532 nm (Cy3) and 635 nm (Cy5) simultaneously. The images were analyzed using GenePix Version 2.0 software. The background-subtracted median ratio value was calculated for each spot, and replicate spots on each slide were averaged. RNA was isolated as described above, transferred to nylon membranes (HybondTM-N+,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and subjected to UV cross-linking. Membranes were stained with methylene blue to ensure quantitative transfer of the RNA to the membrane. Membranes were then prehybridized in a solution containing 1.0% SDS and 0.1 m NaCl in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water for a minimum of 1 h at 42 °C in a rotating hybridization tube. One of the fragments identified as a partial cDNA sequence of rat MKP-1 was a 243-base pair RsaI fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1498–1740 of this gene (99.4% identity to GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number X84004). This fragment was released from the pCR2.1-TOPO vector by enzymatic digestion with RsaI and then excised and purified from a 1.2% agarose gel. The insert (25 ng) was labeled with deoxycytidine 5′-[32P-]trisphosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by the random priming method (Prime-a-Gene, Promega, Madison, WI). Probes containing 1 × 107 cpm were added to 10 ml of high efficiency system hybridization solution with 50% formamide (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). Blots were hybridized for a minimum of 18 h at 42 °C in a rotating hybridization tube. Blots were washed three times in 15 ml of 1× SSC (3.0 m sodium chloride and 0.3m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 1.0% SDS in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated aqueous solution. mRNA signals were detected and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Following exposure to hypoxia, cells were harvested and prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described previously (13Conrad P.W. Rust R.T. Han J. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23570-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity levels were evaluated by subjecting samples of whole cell lysates (60 μg of protein) to immunoblotting with antibodies specific for MKP-1 (V-15, 1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-p42/p44 MAPK (1:1000 dilution; New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), total p42/p44 MAPK (1:1000 dilution; New England Biolabs Inc.), phospho-Ser473 Akt (1:1000 dilution; New England Biolabs Inc.), or total Akt (1:1000 dilution; New England Biolabs Inc.). Immunoreactivity was detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified by densitometric analysis using an ImagePro digital analysis system. Cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia, and total RNA was isolated as described above. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScriptTMfirst-strand synthesis system for real-time PCR (Life Technologies, Inc.) with oligo(dT) as the primer according to the manufacturer's directions. Real-time PCR was performed in a Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) using the LightCycler DNA Master SYBR Green I dye intercalation assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Primers (forward, 5′-TGAACTCAGCACATTCGGGACC-3′; and reverse, 5′-AGGGGCGAGCAAAAAGAAACC-3′) were generated to human MKP-1 (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number XM_003720) and used to amplify a 113-base pair fragment. Measurements were taken at the end of the 72 °C extension step in each cycle, and the second-derivative method was used to calculate threshold cycle. Melt curve analysis showed a single sharp peak for all samples. The sequence data obtained from the SSH library revealed that the library contained 200 different genes that corresponded to known sequences in the current public data bases. A number of sequences in the library were found to be present in multiple copies, including JunB (14 copies), tyrosine hydroxylase (five copies), and vascular endothelial growth factor (three copies), which are all genes that are strongly regulated by hypoxia (7Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. Conforti L. Conrad P.W. Kobayashi S. Yuan Y. Rust R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 475: 131-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Six copies of the rat homolog of MKP-1, also known as CL100 or 3CH134, were also found in this library. As a first step toward verifying regulation of the genes in the SSH library, PCR products derived from each clone in the library were spotted onto glass slides and evaluated by cDNA microarray analysis (Fig. 1) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” cDNA microarray analysis revealed that tyrosine hydroxylase, JunB, and vascular endothelial growth factor were all strongly regulated by hypoxia (6 h, 1% O2), as expected. These experiments also demonstrated that MKP-1 mRNA was similarly increased by an average of ∼5-fold. To further confirm that MKP-1 was regulated by hypoxia, MKP-1 mRNA levels were determined by northern blot analysis. These experiments revealed that MKP-1 mRNA was up-regulated by an average of 8.6-fold in response to hypoxia (6 h, 1% O2) in PC12 cells (Fig.2 A). A similar increase was observed in MKP-1 immunoreactivity on western blots (Fig.2 B). Thus, hypoxia induces MKP-1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in PC12 cells. To determine whether or not this effect is specific to PC12 cells, the effect of hypoxia on MKP-1 expression levels was examined in HepG2, Hep3B, HEK293, and COS-7 cell lines. The probe used for northern blotting was not sensitive enough to detect MKP-1 mRNA in these cell lines, so real-time PCR was used instead. Comparison of the threshold cycles for normoxicversus hypoxic samples showed a significant increase in MKP-1 mRNA expression in response to hypoxia in the HepG2 (20.89 ± 0.22 for normoxic versus 16.73 ± 0.32 for hypoxic, p = 9e −5) and Hep3B (20.19 ± 0.50 for normoxic versus 18.07 ± 0.24 for hypoxic, p = 0.004) cell lines. This threshold cycle difference corresponds to a 13.89-fold up-regulation of MKP-1 in HepG2 cells and a 7.06-fold up-regulation of MKP-1 in Hep3B cells (Fig.2 C). There was a slight increase in MKP-1 mRNA levels in HEK293 cells and a slight decrease in MKP-1 mRNA in COS-7 cells, but these differences did not achieve statistical significance. In other experiments, PC12 cells were exposed to hypoxia for various times between 20 min and 18 h (Fig.3). The earliest time at which MKP-1 levels were elevated in response to hypoxia was 1 h. The maximal effect of hypoxia on MKP-1 mRNA levels occurred between 3 and 6 h of exposure to hypoxia. PC12 cells were also exposed to a range of oxygen levels between 21% (normoxia) and 1% O2for 4 h. These experiments showed that the effects of hypoxia occurred in a dose-dependent manner, with a modest effect at 10% and a maximal effect at 1% O2 (Fig.4).Figure 4Dose-dependent regulation of MKP-1 by hypoxia. PC12 cells were exposed to various levels of hypoxia, between 21% (normoxia) and 1% O2, for 4 h as indicated. RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, a representative MKP-1 northern blot is shown.

As shown in Fig. 5 A, the effects of both hypoxia and KCl on MKP-1 levels were quite robust, averaging 7.6- and 6.9-fold over basal levels, respectively (Fig.5 B). The effects of CoCl2 and deferoxamine, two agents that mimic hypoxia, were also tested. CoCl2 (Fig.5 C) and deferoxamine (data not shown) also increased MKP-1 mRNA levels to a similar extent compared with hypoxia. In contrast, the effects of EGF and NGF on MKP-1 levels were modest in this cell type, averaging only 28 and 47% increases over control levels, respectively. A series of experiments designed to identify the signaling pathways involved in the hypoxia-induced regulation of MKP-1 were then performed. To test whether the induction of MKP-1 expression is Ca2+-dependent, PC12 cells were incubated in Ca2+-free medium supplemented with 1 mm EGTA and then exposed to either normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (6 h, 1% O2). As shown in Fig.6, the hypoxia-induced increase in MKP-1 mRNA persisted in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. The possibility that MKP-1 was induced by the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores was next tested. Both extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ were removed by preloading cells with BAPTA-AM, a membrane-permeable calcium chelator, and then incubating cells in Ca2+-free medium during exposure to hypoxia. As a control, cells that were depolarized with KCl were also included in this experiment. As shown in Fig.7, the hypoxia-induced increase in MKP-1 persisted in the absence of both intracellular and extracellular calcium, whereas the effect of KCl depolarization was completely blocked under calcium-free conditions.Figure 7Induction of MKP-1 in response to hypoxia, but not KCl, persists in the absence of both intracellular and extracellular calcium. Cells were preincubated for 40 min either in serum-free medium with Ca2+([Ca2+]free = 1 mm) and vehicle or in serum-free medium without Ca2+ (Ca2+-free medium supplemented with 1 mm EGTA) containing 100 μm BAPTA-AM. After 40 min, the external Ca2+-containing or Ca2+-free medium was replaced (not including vehicle or BAPTA-AM), and the cells were exposed to normoxia (21% O2), hypoxia (1% O2), or KCl (75 mm) for 4 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, a representative MKP-1 northern blot is shown.

PC12 cells were pretreated with vehicle or PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK-1, the kinase directly upstream of MAPK in the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK signaling cascade. As shown Fig.8 (A and B), MKP-1 expression was not diminished by pretreatment with PD98059. In fact, there was a tendency toward a greater effect of hypoxia on MKP-1 levels in the cells that were pretreated with PD98059 compared with vehicle, although this effect did not achieve statistical significance (p > 0.1). The PD98059 pretreatment was efficacious in that it blocked the hypoxia-induced increase in phospho-MAPK immunoreactivity, as shown in Fig. 8 (C andD). To determine whether the p38 pathway might be involved in the regulation of MKP-1, the effect of SB203580 on the hypoxia-induced increase in MKP-1 RNA levels was tested.

The role of gangliosides in triggering keratinocyte apoptosis, however, is unknown. Addition of GT1b to keratinocyte-derived SCC12 cells, grown in serum-free medium but exposed to fibronectin, suppressed Bad phosphorylation, activated caspase-9, and inhibited cyclin D and E expression, resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and initiation of apoptosis. The mechanism of GT1b activation of caspase-9 involved inhibition of β1 integrin serine/threonine phosphorylation and decreased phosphorylation of both integrin-linked kinase and protein kinase B/Akt at its Ser-473 site, leading to cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Consistently, blockade of GT1b function with anti-GT1b antibody specifically activated the Ser-473 site of Akt, markedly suppressing apoptosis. The ganglioside-induced inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was GT1b-specific and was not observed when cells were treated with other keratinocyte gangliosides, including GD3. These studies suggest that the modulation of keratinocyte cell cycle and survival by GT1b is mediated by its direct interaction with α5β1 and resultant inhibition of the integrin/integrin-linked kinase/protein kinase B/Akt signaling pathway.

Survival of these cells is protected by signaling from soluble factors in serum and from cell interactions with the extracellular matrix. In the absence of serum, keratinocytes are able to survive in the presence of FN1 (2Ilic D. Almeida E.A. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J.

Tai T Kawashima I. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8436-8444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a process that requires glycosylation of the α5β1. Given the known interaction of α5β1 with ILK, we hypothesized that the GT1b/α5β1interaction could modulate ILK phosphorylation and thereby trigger keratinocyte apoptosis via inhibition of PKB/Akt phosphorylation. Using pharmacological addition of gangliosides and specific blockade of ganglioside function with anti-ganglioside antibodies, we investigated the ability of gangliosides to trigger keratinocyte apoptosis in the presence of FN and the mechanism of the induction of this apoptosis. Our studies show that ganglioside GT1b is a potent stimulant of apoptosis when keratinocyte-derived cells are exposed to FN via a mechanism that involves inhibition of Ser/Thr phosphorylation of ILK and ultimately inhibition of phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at its Ser-473 site; consistently, blockade of GT1b function by anti-GT1b antibodies suppresses the induction of cell apoptosis, increasing phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at the Ser-473 but not at the Thr-308 phosphorylation site. Both gangliosides GT1b and GD3 trigger cytochrome c release from mitochondria and keratinocyte apoptosis. However, GD3-induced apoptosis is not modulated by the ILK/PKB/Akt signaling pathway. Antibodies directed against GT1b and GM3 were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Antibodies directed against PKB/Akt-phospho (p)-Ser-473, PY-20, integrin β1, cyclin D1, D2, D3, and cyclin E were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)4 and anti-cytochromec antibodies were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Antibodies directly against ILK, caspase-9, cdk2, Ser-p-112 Bad, Ser-p-136 Bad, and inactivated glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-PKB/Akt were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Antibody against PKB/Akt-p-Thr-308, the PKB/Akt Kinase Assay Kit, and the soluble cell-binding fragment of FN were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Antibodies directed against Bads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Anti-BrdUrd antibody was purchased from Roche (Indianapolis, IN). Gangliosides, antibodies directed against 9-O-acetyl GD3 or GD3, and other chemical regents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated. SCC12F2 (SCC12; courtesy of Dr. James Rheinwald, Boston, MA), a human keratinocyte-derived cell line, was used for studies because of its close resemblance to normal human keratinocytes in its biologic behavior, its ganglioside content, and its response to supplemental gangliosides. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 (1:1) medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. When cells were incubated with gangliosides for 24–48 h, the medium was changed to DMEM/F12 with 2% FBS. When cells were incubated with anti-ganglioside antibodies, the medium was switched to serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Expression of annexin V as an indicator of apoptosis was assayed in SCC12 cells grown in serum-free medium containing 10 μg/ml soluble cell-binding fragment of FN for 24 h without or with GT1b (1 μm), GD3 (1 μm), GM3 (200 μm), or GM2 (200 μm). The expression of annexin V was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-annexin V antibody following manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). Necrotic cells were labeled with 1.5 μm PI. Staining was monitored at 200× magnification by immunofluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TE300 immunofluorescence microscope linked to a computer with Neurolucida software, MicroBrightField, Inc., Colchester, VT). The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined as 100 × apoptotic cells/total healthy + apoptotic cells and expressed as mean ± S.D. Five high power fields (about 400–450 cells) were counted. Studies of apoptosis were performed in triplicate at least four times. To evaluate the ability of gangliosides to cause DNA fragmentation, cells were treated without or with ganglioside GT1b (1 nmto 10 μm), GD3 (1 nm to 10 μm), GM3 (1–200 μm), or GM2 (50–200 μm) for 48 h in either DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS (no FN), serum-free DMEM/F12 with 10 μg/ml soluble cell-binding fragment of FN, or medium devoid of both FBS and FN. Genomic DNA was isolated and purified using a DNeasy Tissue Kit per manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA). The DNA concentration was measured atA260 nm. 5 μg of total genomic DNA was loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel, electrophoresed, viewed under ultraviolet light, and photographed. Cells were treated without or with gangliosides GT1b (1 nm-10 μm), GD3 (1 nm-10 μm), GM3 (1–200 μm), or GM2 (50–200 μm) for 48 h or with anti-ganglioside antibodies for 30 min. Cells were harvested and lysed (0.5 ml of buffer/107 cells) in either cold immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) or boiled in boiling buffer (1% SDS, 1.0 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) to denature as appropriate for the protein to be immunoprecipitated. Total protein from the cell lysates (500 μg) was mixed with 5 μg of anti-integrin β1, -ILK, -PKB/Akt, -cdk2, -cdk4, -Bad, -caspase-9, or -cytochrome cantibody, and the total reaction volume was adjusted to 1 ml in the appropriate buffer. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous agitation, 10 μl of 50% protein A-agarose was added into each reaction, vortexed, and incubated with agitation for 30 min at 4 °C. If monoclonal antibodies were used, 5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody was also applied to each sample for additional 30 min of incubation before adding the protein A-agarose. After incubation, protein A-agarose beads were washed three times, and the precipitated proteins were released from the beads by boiling in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer (30Laemmli UK. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207460) Google Scholar) for 10 min prior to loading onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) mini-gels. Immunoblotting was carried out as described (29Wang X.Q. Sun P. Al-Qamari A. Tai T Kawashima I. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8436-8444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using appropriate antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following antibodies were used to detect separated proteins by Western blotting: anti-β1 integrin, anti-ILK, anti-PKB/Akt-p-Ser-473, anti-PKB/Akt-p-Thr-308, anti-PKB/Akt, anti-phosphoserine, anti-phosphothreonine, anti-cyclins D1, D2, D3, and E, anti-cdk2, anti-cdk4, anti-Bad-Ser-p-112, anti-Bad-Ser-p-136, anti-caspase-9, and anti-cytochrome c antibodies. For reprobing the same blots with more than one antibody, the blot was rinsed with double distilled water, followed by incubation for 20 min in 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.9, at room temperature. After rinsing the blot with washing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), the efficiency of removal of the first blot was confirmed by re-exposure to x-ray film with an ECL kit. The blot was then used for probing another antibody, beginning with the blocking step. Blot were reprobed a maximum of two times. ILK kinase activity was determined in cell extracts by immunoprecipitation as described previously (11Persad S. Attwell S. Gary V. Delcommenne M. Troussard A. Sanghera J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3207-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) after treatment with gangliosides for 48 h or with anti-ganglioside antibodies for 30 min. Myelin basic protein (MBP) and GST-PKB/Akt were used as substrates for ILK activity in separate experiments, and the phosphorylated proteins stimulated by the immunoprecipitated ILK were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. When MBP was used as a substrate, [γ-32P]ATP was used as the phosphate donor in the kinase assay and the [32P]MBP was detected by exposing the autoradiograph overnight at −80 °C; band density analysis was performed using the Fluorescence PhosphorImager Storm 860 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). When GST-PKB/Akt was used as a substrate, ATP was used as the phosphate donor in the kinase assay. The proteins were electrotransferred from the SDS-PAGE mini-gels to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and phosphorylated GST-PKB/Akt was detected by immunoblotting using anti-PKB/Akt, -PKB/Akt-p-Ser-473, or -PKB/Akt-p-Thr-308 antibodies. For PKB/Akt kinase assay, cells were lysed with PKB/Akt lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described (11Persad S. Attwell S. Gary V. Delcommenne M. Troussard A. Sanghera J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3207-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of PKB/Akt were immunoprecipitated by anti-PKB/Akt antibody prebound to Protein A-agarose beads, and kinase assays were carried out according to manufacturer's instructions with the PKB/Akt Kinase Assay Kit using GSK-3 fusion protein as the substrate for PKB/Akt. Phosphorylated proteins were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE mini-gels and electrotransferred onto PVDF membrane to detect phosphorylated GSK-3 using the p-GSK-3 α/β(ser 21/9) antibody. To monitor whether gangliosides GT1b or GD3 can affect the progress of the cell cycle, cells were pretreated for 48 h with GT1b, GD3, or GM2. Cells were washed, then synchronized in the G0 phase by both serum and growth factor starvation for 18 h without further ganglioside exposure. Cells were then trypsinized, detached, and plated onto 96-well plates (104 cells/well) precoated with or without 5 μg/cm2 FN or with 10 μg/cm2poly-l-lysine. The cells were grown in serum-free, growth factor-free medium containing 10 μm BrdUrd for 24 h, and BrdUrd incorporation was stopped by washing with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In other studies, the effects of anti-ganglioside antibodies were assessed. After the 18-h incubation in serum-free, growth factor-free medium to synchronize cells, anti-GT1b, anti-GD3, anti-GM3, or anti-9-O-acetylGD3 antibodies were added for 30 min prior to trypsinization and replating. Cells were stained with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody, and incorporation was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (31Spadari S. Ciarrocchi G. Focher F. Verri A Maga G. Arcamone F. Infrate E. Manzini S. Garbesi A. Tondelli L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1231-1238PubMed Google Scholar). Absorbance was read at A450 nm as indicated by the manufacturer's guidelines (Roche). To determine the effect of increased content of gangliosides through supplementation on cyclin expression, SCC12 cells were grown as described above in 25-cm2 flasks until 80% confluent. Cells were then treated without or with 1 μm GT1b, 20 μm GD3, or 200 μm GM2 for 48 h followed by culture in medium devoid of both FN and serum for an additional 18 h. In other experiments, cells were treated with anti-GT1b, anti-GM3, or anti-9-O-acetylGD3 antibodies for 30 min after growth in the serum-free and FN-free medium for 18 h. Cdk2 or cdk4 was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of cell lysate. The immunoprecipitates were applied onto 12% SDS-PAGE mini-gels, and the protein was transferred to PVDF membrane. Equal loading of cdk4 and cdk2 was determined with anti-cdk4 or anti-cdk2 antibody. The blots were then washed and reprobed with anti-cyclin D1 or anti-cyclin E antibody. Cells were treated with or without gangliosides as above, trypsinized, and harvested at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cytosol and mitochondrial fractions were isolated as described previously (32Pastorino J.G. Chen S.T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE mini-gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Cytochrome c was detected by immunoblotting with anti-cytochrome c antibody and an ECL kit. All data were analyzed statistically by Student's ttest, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Keratinocytes and SCC12 cells become apoptotic when withdrawn from both serum and FN; in contrast, exposure to either serum or to FN provides a pro-survival signal and prevents apoptosis. To explore the influence of gangliosides on cell survival and apoptosis in the presence of FN, keratinocyte-derived SCC12 cells were either allowed to grow on culture plates with or without precoated 5 μg/cm2 cell-binding fragment of FN, or cells were suspended in serum-free DMEM/F12 medium containing 10 μg/ml soluble cell-binding fragment of FN. Immunofluorescent annexin V-staining assays showed that ganglioside GT1b (1 μm)triggered the apoptosis of cells grown in contact with FN from <5% of the cells to 58.2% of the cells (Figs.1, A–I). Ganglioside GD3 (1 μm) caused the SCC12 cells to become apoptotic, despite exposure to either FN (from 5% of the cells without GD3 to 59.5% of the cells with GD3, Fig. 1 I) or to serum without FN (from 4% of the cells without GD3 to 26.4% of the cells with GD3, data not shown). Gangliosides GM2 and GM3 at concentrations as high as 200 μm had no effect on induction of cell apoptosis when cells were suspended in the presence of the soluble cell-binding fragment of FN. Similarly, when cells were plated on FN-coated wells, 1 μm GT1b and 1 μm GD3, but not other gangliosides, also increased apoptosis to more than 50% of cells (data not shown). No ganglioside caused cell necrosis; less than 1% of cells in the same fields in which healthy and apoptotic cells were counted stained with PI (Figs. 1, E–H). Pharmacological addition to the SCC12 cells of gangliosides GT1b and GD3, but not GM2 nor GM3, induced collapse and fragmentation of the chromatin as shown by DNA laddering when cells were grown in serum-free medium in the presence of soluble cell-binding fragment of FN (Fig.2). Addition of concentrations of GD3 greater than 20 μm led to keratinocyte toxicity; however, as in the studies with annexin V staining and DNA laddering, keratinocytes treated with 1–20 μm GD3 became apoptotic in the presence of either serum or FN.Figure 2GT1b and GD3 induce DNA laddering of SCC12 cells. Cells were treated without or with ganglioside GM2 200 μm, GD3 1 μm, or GT1b 1 μmfor 48 h in either DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS (no FN), or in serum-free DMEM/F12 with 10 μg/ml soluble cell-binding fragment of FN. Genomic DNA was isolated and purified using a DNeasy Tissue Kit. 5 μg of total genomic DNA was loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel, electrophoresed, and viewed under ultraviolet light.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Addition of supplemental of GT1b, but not GD3, GM3, or GM2 inhibited the phosphorylation of integrin β1threonine and serine sites. Consistently, blockade of GT1b function by anti-GT1b antibody, but not other anti-ganglioside antibodies, increased integrin β1 phosphorylation (Fig.3). Modulation of GT1b did not affect β1 expression (data not shown). The kinase activity of ILK was inhibited by as little as 1 nm GT1b in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of FN, as detected by phosphorylation of MBP (Fig.4 A, top row); treatment with 1 μm GT1b resulted in maximal inhibition of ILK activity. Using the GST fusion protein GST-PKB/Akt as the substrate to test in vitro ILK kinase activity, as little as 100 nm GT1b similarly inhibited PKB/Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation, with maximal inhibition by 1 μm GT1b (Fig. 4 A, third row). GT1b had no detectable effect on Thr-308 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A, lowest row). ILK activity was not inhibited by gangliosides GD3, GM3, or GM2. Blockade of GT1b function with anti-GT1b antibody stimulated ILK serine/threonine phosphorylation, while treatment with GT1b inhibited it. In contrast treatment with GD3, GM3, or GM2 or antibodies directed against GM3, GD3, or 9-O-acetylGD3 had no effect on ILK phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B). Expression of ILK was not altered by treatment with gangliosides or with anti-ganglioside antibody (data not shown).Figure 4GT1b inhibits activation of ILK serine/threonine phosphorylation. SCC12 cells were grown on 6-well plates to 80% confluence in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS then treated with gangliosides or anti-ganglioside antibodies as described for Fig.3. Non-denatured ILK was immunoprecipitated with α-ILK antibody from cells (A). To determine the effect of GT1b on ILK activityin vitro, MBP and GST-PKB/Akt recombinant protein were tested as substrates for the activated ILK. The ILK immunoprecipitates were mixed with MBP in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction products were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE mini-gel, and the phosphorylated MBP was detected on Kodak X-Omat film (A, top row). The ILK immunoprecipitates were also reacted with recombinant GST-PKB/Akt, the product was applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE mini-gel, and protein was transferred to PVDF membrane. Equal loading of recombinant GST-PKB/Akt protein was verified by Western blotting with α-PKB/Akt antibody and ECL detection (A, second row). Phosphorylation of the Ser-473 site was detected with specific α-PKB/Akt-ser-p-473 antibody (A, third row) and of the Thr-308 site with α-PKB/Akt-thr-p-308 antibody (A, bottom row). The effect of GT1b and α-ganglioside antibodies on ILK phosphorylation itself in SCC12 cells was detected by West"

Anderson M.A. Clarke A.E. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1315-1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2de Nettancourt D. Incompatibility and Incongruity in Wild and Cultivated Plants. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2001Crossref Google Scholar). Gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI)1 is controlled genetically by a single locus (S-locus) with multiple alleles (1Newbigin E. Anderson M.A. Clarke A.E. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1315-1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2de Nettancourt D. Incompatibility and Incongruity in Wild and Cultivated Plants. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2001Crossref Google Scholar). When a pollen grain lands on a stigma of the pistil, a process that discriminates as to whether an S-allele of the pollen matches one of the two S-alleles of the pistil takes place. The pollen grain germinates on the stigma and grows into the style toward the embryo. If its S-allele matches one of the two S-alleles of the pistil, pollen tube growth is arrested in the style, and no fertilization takes place. In solanaceous, scrophulariaceous, and rosaceous plants that have GSI, the pistil glycoproteins that cosegregate with the S-alleles have been identified as ribonucleases of the RNase T2family (S-RNase) (3Kawata Y. Sakiyama F. Hayashi F. Kyogoku Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). McClure et al. (4McClure B.A. Gray J.E. Anderson M.A. Clarke A.E. Nature. 1990; 347: 757-760Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar) reported that pollen rRNA is degraded after self-pollination but not after cross-pollination and suggested that GSI expression is mediated by degradation of the pollen rRNA of self-pollen tubes by S-RNase, leading to depletion of protein biosynthesis and the eventual arrest of tube growth. S-RNase has been confirmed necessary for GSI from results of gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments on transgenic plants of solanaceous species (5Lee H.S. Huang S. Kao T.-H. Nature. 1994; 367: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 6Murfett J. Atherton T.L. Beiquan M. Gasser C.S. McClure B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Transgenic experiments also have shown that the RNase activity of S-RNase is necessary for GSI (7Huang S. Lee H.S. Karunanaadaa B. Kao T.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), which in petunia the carbohydrate moiety is not responsible for GSI (8Karunanandaa B. Huang S. Kao T.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1933-1940PubMed Google Scholar), and that mutant S-RNase, which has lost RNase activity, acts as a dominant negative for GSI (9McCubbin A.G. Chung Y.-Y. Kao T.-H. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 85-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, two models have been proposed to explainS-allele-specific inhibition of pollen tube growth; the receptor and inhibitor models (10Dodds P.N. Clarke A.E. Newbigin E. Cell. 1996; 85: 141-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the receptor model, the pollenS-gene product(s) is(are) the receptor that incorporates the S-RNase that matches the pollen S-allele. In the inhibitor model, S-RNase enters the pollen tube nonspecifically and is inhibited, except for the enzyme that has the same pollen S-allele. Recently, immunocytochemical research has shown that S-RNase enters and is accumulated in the cytoplasm of all pollen tube haplotypes without S-allele specificity, thus experimentally supporting the inhibitor model (11Luu D.-T. Qin X. Morse D. Cappadocia M. Nature. 2000; 407: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The function of the GSI mechanism, however, is still not clear, because no pollen S-gene products that interact with S-RNase and cause self and non-self recognition between the pollen and pistil have yet been found. Amino acid sequence analyses of solanaceous S-RNases have identified two hypervariable regions, HVa and HVb, with extremely high levels of divergence between allelic sequences; candidates for sequences that would be recognized as S-allele-specific by pollen (12Kao T.H. McCubbin A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12059-12065Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In fact, the S-allele specificity of the Solanum chacoense S11-RNase was changed to theS13-allele by swapping the HVa and HVb domains (13Matton D.P. Maes O. Laublin G. Xike Q. Bertrand C. Morse D. Cappadocia M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1757-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and mutation in the HVa and HVb regions of S11-RNase produced a new S-RNase with dual specificity,S11- and S13-alleles (14Matton D.P. Luu D.T. Xike Q. Laublin G. O'Brien M. Maes O. Morse D. Cappadocia M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, only one hypervariable region (HV), corresponding to the HVa of the solanaceous S-RNase, has been detected in sequences of rosaceous S-RNases (15Ishimizu T. Shinkawa T. Sakiyama F. Norioka S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Norioka N. Norioka S. Ohnishi T. Ishimizu T. Oneyama C. Nakanishi T. Sakiyama F. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the HVb region apparently being deleted (16Norioka N. Norioka S. Ohnishi T. Ishimizu T. Oneyama C. Nakanishi T. Sakiyama F. J.

This structural feature suggests that the recognition mechanism of S-allele specificity may differ for solanaceous and rosaceous S-RNases. Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure is required for further investigation of the recognition mechanism of rosaceous S-RNases at the molecular level. We therefore made a three-dimensional structural analysis of the S-RNases from Pyrus pyrifolia (Japanese pear), a member of the Rosaceae family. Seven S-RNases (S1- through S7-RNase) have been identified in and purified from the styles of P. pyrifolia (15Ishimizu T. Shinkawa T. Sakiyama F. Norioka S. Plant Mol.

From these we chose S3-RNase for this x-ray crystallographic analysis, because it has only two N-glycosylation sites (19Ishimizu T. Mitsukami Y. Miyagi M. Shinkawa T. Natsuka S. Hase S. Sakiyama F. Norioka S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 624-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and its amino acid sequence is highly homologous to that ofP. pyrifolia S5-RNase (95.5% identity) (15Ishimizu T. Shinkawa T. Sakiyama F. Norioka S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Identification of the three-dimensional structures of the S3- and S5-RNases will pave the way for a structural comparison that provides high resolution information on molecular recognition between these S-RNases and the pollenS-gene product(s). We report the crystal structure ofP. pyrifolia S3-RNase at 1.5-Å resolution and discuss the recognition site(s) present on S3-RNase and the structural basis of its enzymatic activity. This is the first report on the three-dimensional structure of a rosaceous S-RNase. P. pyrifoliaS3-RNase was purified and crystallized as described previously (20Matsuura T. Unno M. Sakai H. Tsukihara T. Norioka S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 172-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the P21 space group with unit cell dimensions of a = 45.65,b = 52.59, c = 47.57 Å, and β = 106.45° (20Matsuura T. Unno M. Sakai H. Tsukihara T. Norioka S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 172-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Diffraction data were collected with an image plate detector Raxis IV (Rigaku) at the beam line of BL40B2 at SPring-8 to 1.5-Å resolution. Image data were processed by the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38436) Google Scholar) (Table I). Multiple isomorphous replacement was used to determine the crystal structure of S3-RNase. Two ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid derivatives (Hg1, Hg1′), a mercury(II) ammonium thiocyanate derivative (Hg2), and a lead(II) acetate derivative (Pb) were prepared by soaking the crystals in heavy atom reagents (Table I). All diffraction data on the derivative crystals were collected at the Photon Factory with a charge-coupled device detector Quantum 4R (ADSC) at the beam line of BL6A and processed by the MOSFLM (22Leslie A.G.W.

Open table in a new tab Patterson maps were automatically interpreted by the program SOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) to locate the heavy atom coordinates of each derivative. By use of the solution coordinates, MIR phase calculation was done at 2.5-Å resolution by the maximum-likelihood refinement program SHARP (25de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) (Table I). The experimental MIR phases were improved by the DM (23Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar) and wARP (26Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) programs. First, the phases at 2.5-Å resolution gradually were extended to 1.7-Å resolution by DM with solvent flattening and histogram matching. The phases obtained were further refined and extended to 1.5-Å resolution by weighted averaging of multiple-refined dummy atomic models implemented in wARP. This technique for averaging the structure factors was very effective for improving the phases and provided substantial improvement in the resulting electron density map. The subsequent main-chain trace was done by wARP. Based on the automatically traced main chain coordinates, 200 amino acid residues were successfully built by program O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic refinement was done by the CNS program (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16946) Google Scholar). One cycle of simulated annealing refinement, followed by positional and temperature factor refinements, was repeated several times. Throughout the refinements bulk solvent correction was applied, and the resolution range was gradually extended from 2.3 to 1.5 Å. At each stage of crystallographic convergence, the model was carefully checked and rebuilt into the simulated annealed omit map calculated by CNS. Solvent water molecules were picked up from a difference Fourier map by use of the automated scripts implemented in CNS. The lower cut-off level for picking up the solvent water molecules in the residual electron densities was set at 3ς. High resolution model coordinates of sugar chains were obtained from the Uppsala web server, HIC-Up (xray.bmc.uu.se/hicup/) (29Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The crystal structure was refined to the respective R- and free R-factors of 17.2 and 20.2% in the resolution range of 500–1.5 Å. The final model has 1643 protein atoms, 59 sugar atoms, and 266 water atoms. A Ramachandran plot from the program PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) shows that 91.5% of the residues are in the most favorable region, 8.5% in the additional allowed region, and none in the generally allowed and disallowed regions. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code1IQQ. The crystal structure of P. pyrifolia S3-RNase was determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) and refined to an R-factor of 17.2% at 1.5-Å resolution. Table Isummarizes the data collected and gives the final refinement statistics. The geometry of the current model is such that the root mean square deviations from the ideal values are 0.022 Å for bond length and 2.02° for bond angles. A stereo view of the three-dimensional structure of S3-RNase is shown in Fig. 1. The molecule's size is ∼40 × 50 × 30 Å. This protein has an α + β type structure consisting of eight helices (six α-helices (α1, α2, α4, and α6-α8), two 310-helices (α3 and α5)), and seven β-strands (β1-β7) (Fig. 1 a). The folding topology of its main chain is very similar to the topologies of the RNase T2family enzymes: the RNase Rh from Rhizopus niveus (31Kurihara H. Mitsui Y. Ohgi K. Irie M. Mizuno H. Nakamura K.T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Kurihara H. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 298: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and RNase MC1 from bitter gourd seeds (34Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Sakai R. Nakashima T. Funatsu G. Kimura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1433: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), all of whose tertiary structures have been determined (Fig. 1 b). Two secondary structural element characteristics are present in S3-RNase; the length of the α2-helix is shorter than the lengths of the other RNases, and a very short 310-helix (α3), Arg74-Lys76, not seen in the RNase T2 family, is present (Fig.2). The electron density map for S3-RNase clearly shows four disulfide bridges: Cys15-Cys22, Cys48-Cys91, Cys155-Cys193, and Cys170-Cys181. The topologies of these bridges are the same as those of the P. pyrifoliaS4-RNase and Nicotiana alataS2-RNase determined by mass spectrometry of fragmented peptides (35Ishimizu T. Norioka S. Kanai M.

Amino acid residue numbering is based on that for P. pyrifoliaS3-RNase. Amino acid residues that form secondary structures are the α-helix (red), 310-helix (red, slanted), and β-strand (blue).

Biol. 1996; 255: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The main-chain frameworks, including the catalytic P1 site residues of RNase Rh (β2 and α4), were well superimposable on those of S3-RNase (Fig. 1 b), indicating that their P1 site topologies are similar. The P1 site is here defined according to the nomenclature of the subsites of RNase A given by Richards and Wyckoff (46Richards F.M. Wyckoff H.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 4. Academic Press, NY1971: 647-806Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 a, the His33 and His88 of S3-RNase were superimposable geometrically on the general acid and base catalysts His(46) and His(109) of RNase Rh (amino acids numbered in parentheses are those of RNase Rh) (32Kurihara H. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 38Sanda A. Takizawa Y. Irie M. Chem. Pharm.

Biochem. 1992; 112: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that His33 and His88 are the catalysts in S3-RNase. Glu84 and Lys87 are the respective counterparts of the Glu(105) and Lys(108) of RNase Rh, which are considered to stabilize a pentacovalent intermediate of substrate RNA in the transition state (32Kurihara H. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Tanaka N. Arai J. Inokuchi N. Koyama T. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T.

Iwama M. Ogawa Y. Hagiwara C. Ono E. Kawaguchi R. Kanazawa C. Irie M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1996; 19: 1080-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Glu84 and Lys87 therefore may have the same respective roles as Glu(105) and Lys(108). Trp36 is the counterpart of the Trp(49) of RNase Rh (Fig. 3 a), which functions in the fixation of catalytically important Glu(105) and His(109). Trp(49)Nε1 forms a hydrogen bond with the γ-carboxyl group of Glu(105), and the indole ring of Trp(49) has a partial stacking interaction with the imidazole ring of His(109) (32Kurihara H. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In S3-RNase, a similar stacking interaction between Trp36 and His88 is possible, because the distance between the indole ring of Trp36 and the imidazole ring of His88 is about 3.50 Å, and both rings are nearly parallel (Fig. 3 a). Trp36Nε1cannot, however, interact directly with Glu84Oε1 by hydrogen bonding, because the distance between the two atoms is 4.59 Å. Possibly, they may interactvia a water molecule. Indeed, a water molecule that can hydrogen bond to both Trp36Nε1 and Glu84Oε1 is present in the P1pocket (Fig. 3 a). Two pockets, which correspond to the base binding B1 and B2 sites of RNase Rh (32Kurihara H. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,33Tanaka N. Arai J. Inokuchi N. Koyama T. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), are present on either side of the P1 site in S3-RNase (Fig. 1 c). These B1 and B2 sites also have the nomenclature given by Richards and Wyckoff (46Richards F.M. Wyckoff H.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 4. Academic Press, NY1971: 647-806Google Scholar). The amino acid residues that constitute these sites could be superimposed geometrically on S3-RNase and RNase Rh (Fig. 3, b and c). As for the B1 site of S3-RNase, Trp36, Ser38, and Asp44 are the respective counterparts of the Trp(49), Asp(51), and Tyr(57) of RNase Rh (Fig.3 b). The Trp(49) of RNase Rh has two important functions; to fix the active side residues (described above) and to recognize the base of the substrate RNA by an aromatic π-π stacking interaction together with Tyr(57) (called double-sided stacking) (32Kurihara H. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Tanaka N. Arai J. Inokuchi N. Koyama T. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Trp36 may bind to the base of the substrate in the same manner as Trp(49), but the position corresponding to Tyr(57) is occupied by Asp44, consequently double-sided stacking recognition is impossible in S3-RNase (Fig. 3 b). The base therefore probably is recognized at the B1 site of S3-RNase by a single-sided stacking interaction with Trp36, unlike RNase Rh and RNase LE (32Kurihara H. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Tanaka N. Arai J. Inokuchi N. Koyama T. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic data on the RNase Rh/2′-AMP complex shows that Asp(51) contributes to the adenylic acid preference at the B1 site of RNase Rh by hydrogen bonding to the adenine base of 2′-AMP (32Kurihara H. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Tanaka N. Arai J. Inokuchi N. Koyama T. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The position corresponding to Asp(51), however, is occupied by Ser38 in S3-RNase (Fig. 3 b). Experiments on substrate specificity done with dinucleotide monophosphate showed that the base specificity at the B1site of S3-RNase is wider than that of RNase Rh (data not shown). This extended base specificity may be due to substitution of Asp(51) with Ser38, to single-sided stacking with Trp36, or both. The B2 site of S3-RNase seems to be comprised of Gln9, Pro69, Asn70, Val71, Phe72, and Phe80 (Fig.3 c), which geometrically correspond to the Gln(32), Pro(92), Ser(93), Asn(94), Gln(95), and Phe(101) of RNase Rh that have been identified as components of the B2site based on x-ray crystallographic data for the complex with d(ApC) (33Tanaka N. Arai J. Inokuchi N. Koyama T. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In RNase Rh, the base is thought to be recognized at the B2 site by an aromatic stacking interaction with Phe(101) and van der Waals contact with the side chains of Asn(94) and Gln(95) (33Tanaka N. Arai J. Inokuchi N. Koyama T. Ohgi K. Irie M. Nakamura K.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similar recognition should occur at the B2 site of S3-RNase, because Val71, Phe72, and Phe80, respectively, can be superimposed geometrically on Asn(94), Gln(95), and Phe(101) (Fig. 3 c). One hypervariable (HV) region with an allele-specific sequence is present in the rosaceous S-RNases (Fig.4 a) and is a candidate for the recognition site of pollen S-gene product(s) (15Ishimizu T. Shinkawa T. Sakiyama F. Norioka S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The HV region of S3-RNase (Pro49-Gln63) is made up of a loop ("

Previous studies have shown that several acylated proteins exist in mitochondria isolated from COS-7 cells and rat liver. Here, a prominent fatty-acylated 165-kDa protein from rat liver mitochondria was identified as carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS 1). Covalently attached palmitate was linked to CPS 1 via a thioester bond resulting in an inhibition of CPS 1 activity at physiological concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA. This inhibition corresponds to irreversible inactivation of CPS 1 and occurred in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Fatty acylation of CPS 1 was prevented by preincubation with N-ethylmaleimide and 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine, an ATP analog that reacts with CPS 1 active site cysteine residues. Our results suggest that fatty acylation of CPS 1 is specific for long-chain fatty acyl-CoA and very likely occurs on at least one of the essential cysteine residues inhibiting the catalytic activity of CPS 1. Inhibition of CPS 1 by long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs could reduce amino acid degradation and urea secretion, thereby contributing to nitrogen sparing during starvation.

Protein fatty acylation is the modification of proteins by fatty acids. It is divided into two categories, myristoylation and palmitoylation. In myristoylation, the 14-carbon myristate is co-translationally attached to the N-terminal glycine residue of a protein via a stable amide bond. Palmitoylation is characterized by the post-translational attachment of the 16-carbon fatty acid palmitate to cysteine residues of a protein via a thioester bond. Due to its reversible nature, palmitoylation has been shown recently to regulate the subcellular localization of several proteins involved in signal transduction processes (1Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 5Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 6Dunphy J.T Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). For protein palmitoylation to occur, palmitate needs to be activated in the form of its coenzyme A derivative, palmitoyl-CoA. Interestingly, palmitoyl-CoA, the acyl donor for protein palmitoylation, inhibits several enzymes including rat adipocyte pyruvate dehydrogenase (7Moore K.H. Dandurand D.M. Kiechle F.L. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), rat liver ADP/ATP translocase (8Morel R. Lauquin G. Lunardi J. Duszynski J. Vignais P.V. FEBS Lett. 1974; 39: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase (9Kawaguchi A. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1406-1412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and bovine liver methylmalonyl semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH)1 (10Berthiaume L. Deichaite I. Peseckis S. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6498-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Deichaite I. Berthiaume L. Peseckis S.M. Patton W.F. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13738-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas MMSDH was shown to be fatty-acylated, preliminary studies also indicated that bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase is likely to be fatty-acylated (10Berthiaume L. Deichaite I. Peseckis S. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6498-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2M. M. Corvi, C.-L. M. Soltys, and L. G. Berthiaume, unpublished observations. Whether inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase and ADP/ATP translocase by palmitoyl-CoA is mediated by covalent fatty acylation has not been investigated. In addition to playing a role in signal transduction, dynamic protein fatty acylation has been postulated to play a potential role in the regulation of amino acid catabolism (10Berthiaume L. Deichaite I. Peseckis S. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6498-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Deichaite I. Berthiaume L. Peseckis S.M. Patton W.F. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13738-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the well fed state, amino acids originating from digestion of dietary proteins in the gastrointestinal tract are absorbed into the bloodstream and may be used for protein synthesis. Alternatively, amino acid surplus can be metabolized to glucose, be used for fatty acid synthesis, or be catabolized to generate energy. The amino group of amino acids is removed by transamination and deamination prior to urea synthesis in periportal hepatocytes, although the residual carbon skeleton is metabolized to gluconeogenic precursors. In starvation, proteolysis of muscle protein is the main source of circulating amino acids. Transamination of the amino acids, particularly branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), occurs in muscle, whereas liver is postulated to lack BCAA aminotransferase activity. However, liver has branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase activity and can oxidize branched-chain ketoacids in the mitochondria. During the early stages of fasting, the body draws selectively on its supply of energy in the form of triacylglycerol in adipose tissue, sparing at first the breakdown of vitally needed proteins (12Moran, L. A., Scrimgeour, K. G., Horton, H. R., Ochs, R. S., and Rawn, J. D. (1994) Biochemistry, 2nd Ed, pp. 20.1–20.50, 21.1–21.54, and 23.1–23.28, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJGoogle Scholar). In this case, β-oxidation from fatty acids is very active in the liver, and large quantities of acetyl-CoA are formed that promote gluconeogenesis. The bulk of energy production from fatty acid and amino acid carbon skeletons occurs in the mitochondria. In mitochondria, enzymes that are part of different catabolic pathways must compete for a common pool of reduced coenzyme A, NAD+, and FAD+ cofactors and for a common electron transport chain (13Brass E.P. Beyerinck R.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As such, the variable availability of such cofactors, appropriate catabolites, and the activity of the competing enzymes can affect the rate of a given catabolic pathway. However, little is known about the coordination mechanisms that are responsible for the regulation of the degradation of the substrates to be oxidized. The mitochondrial protein methylmalonyl semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH), an enzyme of the valine and pyrimidine catabolic pathways, was shown to be fatty-acylated on its active site cysteine residue thereby inhibiting its enzymatic activity (10Berthiaume L. Deichaite I. Peseckis S. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6498-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Deichaite I. Berthiaume L. Peseckis S.M. Patton W.F. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13738-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the extent of fatty acylation of MMSDH varied with mitochondrial energy level, was reversible, and was specific for long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs, it was proposed that fatty acylation of MMSDH could act as a novel mode of regulation of enzymatic activity. In addition, as a way to prioritize substrate degradation, this novel mode of regulation has been proposed to mediate a metabolic cross-talk between amino acid and fatty acid catabolism (10Berthiaume L. Deichaite I. Peseckis S. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6498-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Deichaite I. Berthiaume L. Peseckis S.M. Patton W.F. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13738-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fatty acylation of MMSDH required only fatty acyl-CoA and seemed to be spontaneous in vitro in apparently pure preparations of MMSDH. Thus, protein fatty acylation of a few select mitochondrial proteins could perhaps be regulated by intramitochondrial levels of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. Upon incubation of mitochondria with radiolabeled fatty acids, several proteins have been shown to incorporate fatty acids in a covalent manner in mitochondria isolated from rat liver and COS-7 cells (10Berthiaume L. Deichaite I. Peseckis S. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6498-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Stucki J.W. Lehmann L.H. Siegal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6376-6380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but to date, only one fatty-acylated mitochondrial protein has been identified, MMSDH. We report the apparent similarity in protein fatty acylation electrophoretic patterns in mitochondria isolated from different rat tissues. In addition, we found that the majority of fatty-acylated proteins are found in the mitochondrial matrix and the inner mitochondrial membrane. A new fatty-acylated 165-kDa protein was identified as rat liver carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS 1). CPS 1 is the first and rate-limiting step of the urea synthesis (15Ratner S. Adv. Enzymol. 1973; 39: 1-90PubMed Google Scholar, 16Krebs H.A. Hems R. Lund P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1973; 11: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Tatibana M. Shigesada K. Grisolia S. Baguena R. Mayer F. The Urea Cycle. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 301-313Google Scholar) and catalyzes the removal of ammonia, a by-product of amino acid catabolism. Based on our kinetic results, palmitoyl-CoA inhibition of CPS 1 was time- and concentration-dependent and corresponded to an irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. Further fatty acylation studies indicated that CPS 1 is likely fatty-acylated on at least one of its essential cysteine residues. The fact that both MMSDH and CPS 1 are involved in amino acid catabolism, are fatty-acylated on cysteine residues, and inhibited by physiological concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA further reinforces the possibility of a metabolic cross-talk between amino acid and fatty acid catabolic pathways. Bovine albumin, fatty acyl-CoAs, acyl-CoA ligase, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pyruvate kinase,N-ethylmaleimide, lactate dehydrogenase, and Ultrogel AcA 34 were from Sigma. Leupeptin and bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Mono Q HR 5/5, SP-Sepharose HP and phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 columns, Hiprep Sephacryl-200 26/60, phenyl-Sepharose gels, and Percoll were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Macro-Prep Ceramic hydroxyapatite (40-μm beads) were from Bio-Rad. Mitochondria were purified from rat liver, heart, brain, kidney, and gastrocnemius leg muscle from five Sprague-Dawley rats (∼200 g), using a combination of differential and Percoll gradient centrifugation (18Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All buffers contained freshly added 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The only modification to the procedure was at the homogenization step, in which the rat heart and leg muscle were also minced prior to homogenization with a Polytron at level 2.5 for 30 s. All isolation procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Liver mitochondrial subfractions were prepared from two rat livers by the established swell shrink-sonication procedure of Ohlendiecket al. (19Ohlendieck K. Riesinger I. Adams V. Krause J. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 672-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) followed by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation with the following modifications: mitochondria were swollen in 6 ml of swell medium (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) with subsequent addition of 6 ml of shrink medium (10 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mmMgCl2, 30% glycerol, 32% sucrose, pH 7.4) after 15 min. Radioiodination of the iodopalmitate with [125I]NaI (2.14 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed as described in Berthiaume et al. (20Berthiaume L. Peseckis S.M. Resh M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 455-466Google Scholar) without the high pressure liquid chromatography purification step. Typical specific activity of [125I]iodopalmitate was 2 Ci/mmol. Synthesis of the [125I]iodopalmitoyl-CoA derivative was carried out using acyl-CoA ligase as reported previously (20Berthiaume L. Peseckis S.M. Resh M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 455-466Google Scholar). Highly purified mitochondria were incubated in the mitochondrial acylation buffer (MAB) described by Stucki et al. (14Stucki J.W. Lehmann L.H. Siegal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6376-6380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as modified in Berthiaume et al. (10Berthiaume L. Deichaite I. Peseckis S. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6498-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MAB buffer contained 60 mm KCl, 7.5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 40 mm triethanolamine HCl neutralized with KOH to pH 7.4, 15 mm potassium succinate, 2 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm potassium malate, 1 mm K-ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CoA, 1 mm carnitine, and 0.65 μg/ml rotenone. All in vitro fatty acylation assays with radiolabeled palmitate analog were carried out in a final volume of 50 μl. In mitochondrial protein fatty acylation assays, 40 μg of purified mitochondria were incubated with 10 μCi of [125I]iodopalmitate (∼100 μm) in 1× MAB from a 5× MAB stock in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The incubation was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature (typically 25 °C) and then stopped by the addition of 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were incubated for 2 min at 95 °C, loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresed. The gel was fixed, stained with Coomassie G-250, destained, dried, and exposed to autoradiographic film. Fatty acylation assays of chromatographic fractions were carried out in a final volume of 50 μl with typically 10 μg of purified proteins (or the amount of proteins necessary to contain 1 μg of CPS 1) or with 0.1 μCi of [125I]iodopalmitoyl-CoA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT buffer (final concentrations were achieved by using a 5× buffer stock solution) for 30 min at 25 °C. The reaction was then stopped by the addition of 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (10Berthiaume L. Deichaite I. Peseckis S. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6498-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and processed as described above. Fatty acylation assays of CPS 1 in the presence of various substrates, cofactors, and reagents were carried out in a final volume of 50 μl using 2 μg of purified CPS 1 and 1.0 μCi of [125I]iodopalmitoyl-CoA (∼10 μm final concentration) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (final concentration was achieved by using a 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, stock solution), for 30 min at 25 °C. Typically, CPS 1 was preincubated with saturating concentration of reactants (2 mm AGA, 1.7 mm ATP) or 50 μm5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (FSBA) containing 10 mm MgCl2 or 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA or 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 60 min at 25 °C prior to addition of 0.8 μCi of [125I]iodopalmitoyl-CoA (8 μm final concentration) for another 30 min at 25 °C. Reactants were first incubated with CPS 1 individually and then in various combinations as described in Figs. 4 and 9. Reactions were stopped and processed as described above. For reactions with FSBA or NEM, CPS 1 was previously dialyzed for 16 h at 4 °C to remove DTT. FSBA was dissolved in dimethylformamide (21Potter M.D. Powers-Lee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2023-2031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 9CPS 1 fatty acylation protection assays.CPS 1 was preincubated for 60 min in the presence, as indicated, of 2 mm AGA, 1.7 mm MgATP, 50 μmpalmitoyl-CoA (PalCoA), or 50 μm MgFSBA and then incubated for 60 min with [125I]iodopalmitoyl-CoA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Autoradiogram of the 12% SDS-PAGE is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All manipulations and purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Mitochondria were prepared from 30 g of rat liver as described above using the Percoll gradient method. Purified rat liver mitochondria were solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT for 30 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman JA20 rotor. The resulting supernatant was adjusted to 20 mm K-MES (MES neutralized with KOH), pH 6.0, by addition of a 10× concentrated 200 mm K-MES, pH 6.0, buffer. The supernatant was dialyzed against S buffer (20 mm K-MES, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF). The dialyzed protein solution containing 80 mg of protein was loaded at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min onto a prepacked 1-ml SP-Sepharose HP column, equilibrated with S buffer. By using FPLC, a linear NaCl gradient (0–500 mm) was applied to the column over 17 ml, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots of chromatographic fractions were labeled with the [125I]iodopalmitoyl-CoA as described above and separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the radiolabeled p165-kDa protein were pooled. The SP-Sepharose protein pool was then equilibrated with TD buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT) by dialysis, overnight at 4 °C, and then applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. By using FPLC, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of TD buffer and then eluted stepwise with a 2-ml gradient (0–80 mm NaCl in TD buffer) followed by a 10-ml gradient (80–500 mm NaCl in TD buffer). One-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots of chromatographic fractions were radiolabeled as described above, and fractions containing the radiolabeled p165-kDa protein were pooled. The protein pool from the Mono Q column was loaded onto a 0.5× 5-cm column of Macro-Prep ceramic hydroxyapatite used on FPLC and equilibrated in 10 mm K2HPO4, pH 6.8. The column was eluted with a 16-ml linear gradient (0–300 mm K2HPO4). Aliquots of chromatographic fractions were analyzed as described above for p165 content. 4 m ammonium sulfate solution was added to the protein pool from the hydroxyapatite column to yield a 2 m ammonium sulfate solution and applied at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using the FPLC to a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column equilibrated with 2m ammonium sulfate in 100 mmK2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.0. The column was eluted with a 15-ml linear gradient of 2.0–0 m ammonium sulfate in 100 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.0. One-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots of chromatographic fractions were analyzed as described above for p165 content. All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. An apparently homogeneous sample of p165 was analyzed by the Alberta Peptide Institute (University of Alberta) using Edman degradation with a HP-G-1005A (HewlettPackard) protein sequencing system using version 3.0 chemistry. Rat liver carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 was isolated at 4 °C as described previously (21Potter M.D. Powers-Lee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2023-2031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Powers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11160-11165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following changes. Crude mitochondrial fractions were prepared from livers of 10 male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g) by differential centrifugation (18Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Powers-Lee S.G. Corina K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15349-15352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final pellet enriched in mitochondria was suspended in IM buffer (250 mm mannitol, 5 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% albumin (essentially fatty acid free), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin) and stored frozen at −80 °C in aliquots containing 1 g of total mitochondrial protein. For each preparation of CPS 1, 1 g of crude mitochondria aliquot was thawed and swollen in 90 ml of hypotonic buffer (1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 20 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min on ice. The suspension was then sonicated twice for 2 min at setting 2 on a Heat Systems sonicator. Nine ml of 200 mm Tris, pH 7.4, was then added to the solution, and the lysed mitochondria were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min in a Beckman Ti45 rotor. The pellet was discarded. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to give a 35% saturated solution; the extract was stirred for 30 min at 4 °C; the suspension was centrifuged at 20,500 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was discarded. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to make it an 80% saturated solution; the extract was stirred for 30 min at 4 °C, and the suspension was centrifuged as above. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of 0.3 m K2HPO4, pH 7.6, buffer and dialyzed for 2 h against K2HPO4buffer (20 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF). The solution was loaded either onto a Hiprep Sephacryl S-200 26/60 or Ultrogel AcA 34 packed in a XK 16/100 column equilibrated with 0.3 mK2HPO4, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin and eluted with the same buffer at 1 ml/min; 4-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots of chromatographic fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE as described above. The CPS 1 pool from the gel filtration column was then equilibrated with TD buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmDTT) by dialysis overnight at 4 °C and applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of TD buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm DTT) and eluted with a 2-ml gradient of 0–80 mm, followed by a 10-ml gradient of 80–300 mm, followed by a 2-ml gradient from 300 to 500 mm NaCl in TD buffer. One-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Aliquots of chromatographic fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE as described above. Highly purified CPS 1 samples were radiolabeled with [125I]iodopalmitoyl-CoA as described above and separated in different lanes on 12% SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresed samples contained in different lanes of the gel were soaked in either 1 mhydroxylamine, pH 7.0, or 1 m Tris, pH 7.0, for 48 h prior to gel drying. Residual radiolabel incorporation into proteins was visualized by autoradiography. Alternatively, following electrophoresis, the wet gel was frozen at −80 °C and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 2 days. The gel slice containing the radiolabeled protein was hydrolyzed with 1m NaOH and extracted with chloroform (24Alland L. Peseckis S.M. Atherton R.E. Berthiaume L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16701-16705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that the residue was analyzed by TLC on a 250 μm/Silica Gel 60 plate (VWR Scientific) and that the TLC plate was developed with a mobile phase containing water:glacial acetic acid:acetonitrile (1:1.75:1.75. v/v/v). Following air drying, PhosphorImager analysis was performed. Purified CPS 1 (1–2 μg) was preincubated for 30 min in the absence or presence of 1, 2, 5, or 10 mm NEM diluted in 100 mm K-MOPS, pH 7.0, and then radiolabeled with 0.8 μCi of [125I]iodopalmitoyl-CoA for 30 min at 25 °C in a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and processed as above. The enzymatic activity was measured by the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase coupled assay (25Raijman L. Jones M.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of CPS 1 was incubated with the reaction mixture in a final volume of 1 ml at 25 °C. This mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mmKHCO3−, 35 mmSO4(NH4)2, 15 mmSO4Mg, 10 mm ATP, 5 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.5 mm NADH, 10 mmacetylglutamate, 33 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 67.5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. The activity was expressed as the amount of carbamoyl phosphate produced, assuming a stoichiometry of 1 mol of carbamoyl phosphate produced per 2 mol of ADP released. CPS 1 was also incubated at 25 °C in the absence or presence of palmitoyl-CoA (5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μm) or 50 μm FSBA with or without 2 mm AGA in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, buffer and assayed for enzymatic activity in a 1-ml final volume at different times as described above. For kinetic measurements, CPS 1 was incubated with 0, 20, or 50 μm of palmitoyl-CoA for 60 min in a 100-μl final volume and then assayed in the presence of different concentrations of AGA (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mm), NH4+ (0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mm), HCO3− (0, 0.66, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mm), and ATP (0, 1, 1.75, 2.5, 5, and 10 mm). While varying the concentrations of these substrates, the concentrations of other reagents in the CPS 1 assay were kept at the saturating concentrations indicated in the standard CPS 1 enzymatic assay mixture described above. In addition, CPS 1 was incubated with 0, 20, or 50 μm FSBA for 60 min in a final volume of 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, buffer prior to the spectrophotometric assay in the presence of different concentrations of ATP described above. Data show the average of at least 4 independent experiments. CPS 1 was preincubated in the presence or absence of either 2 mm AGA, 1.7 mm MgATP, or both for 60 min in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and then either 50 μmpalmitoyl-CoA or MgFSBA were subsequently added to the mixture and incubated for another 60 min in a total volume of 100 μl. The mixture was then assayed for residual enzymatic activity in a 1-ml reaction volume. In all assays, the concentration of MgCl2 was kept constant at 10 mm. For specificity assays, CPS 1 was incubated with 50 μm coenzyme A, 50 μmacetyl-CoA A, 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA, or 50 μmpalmitate for 60 min and then assayed for enzymatic activity. All incubations were carried out at room temperature (∼25 °C). Protein concentration was measured (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purified CPS 1 (2 μg) was preincubated with 0.8 μCi (8 μm) of [125I]iodopalmitoyl-CoA for 2 h at 25 °C in 40 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. After this period, CPS 1 was further incubated in the absence or presence of palmitoyl-CoA (10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 μm) dissolved in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, for 1 h at 25 °C in a total volume of 50 μl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and processed as for SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described above. Several proteins were shown previously to incorporate radiolabeled fatty acids in mitochondria isolated from rat liver and COS-7 cells (10Berthiaume L. Deichaite I. Peseckis S. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6498-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Stucki J.W. Lehmann L.H. Siegal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6376-6380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether similar mitochondrial fatty-acylated proteins exist in mitochondria isolated from different tissue origins, isolated mitochondria were incubated with [125I]iodopalmitate in a mixture containing all of the necessary cofactors for mitochondrial fatty acid import. Radiolabel incorporation into proteins after electrophoresis and autoradiography was taken as evidence these proteins have been acylated by the [125I]iodopalmitate analog. Furthermore, soaking of gel slices containing radiolabeled rat liver mitochondrial proteins in 1m neutral hydroxylamine prior to autoradiography removed more than 95% of the label from the majority of proteins.2This suggested that the radiolabel was incorporated into these proteins via a thioester bond. We show that there are many proteins that could be labeled in this manner in mitochondria isolated from rat heart, liver, brain, kidney, and leg gastrocne"
https://openalex.org/W2074692709,"Abstract We identified a novel cDNA (IG20) that is homologous to cDNAs encoding a proteindifferentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells (DENN-SV) and human MADD (MAPK-activating deathdomain-containing protein). Furthermore, we show that the above variants most likely result from alternative splicing of a single gene. Functional analyses of these variants in permanently transfected HeLa cells revealed that IG20 and DENN-SV render them more susceptible or resistant to tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-induced apoptosis, respectively. All variants tested could interact with TNF receptor 1 and activate ERK and nuclear factor κB. However, relative to control cells, only cells expressing IG20 showed enhanced TNF-α-induced activation of caspase-8 and -3, whereas cells expressing DENN-SV showed either reduced or no caspase activation. Transfection of these cells with a cDNA encoding CrmA maximally inhibited apoptosis in HeLa-IG20 cells. Our results show that IG20 can promote TNF-α-induced apoptosis and activation of caspase-8 and -3 and suggest that it may play a novel role in the regulation of the pleiotropic effects of TNF-α through alternative splicing."

We report here the identification and characterization of SSB proteins ofMycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sequence comparison of M. smegmatis SSB revealed that it is homologous to M. tuberculosis SSB, except for a small spacer connecting the larger amino-terminal domain with the extreme carboxyl-terminal tail. The purified SSB proteins of mycobacteria bound single-stranded DNA with high affinity, and the association and dissociation constants were similar to that of the prototype SSB. The proteolytic signatures of free and bound forms of SSB proteins disclosed that DNA binding was associated with structural changes at the carboxyl-terminal domain. Significantly, SSB proteins from mycobacteria displayed high affinity for cognate RecA, whereasEscherichia coli SSB did not under comparable experimental conditions. Accordingly, SSB and RecA were coimmunoprecipitated from cell lysates, further supporting an interaction between these proteinsin vivo. The carboxyl-terminal domain of M. smegmatis SSB, which is not essential for interaction with ssDNA, is the site of binding of its cognate RecA.

Escherichia coli SSB, a prototypical member of this super family, binds single-stranded DNA as a homotetramer with high affinity and generally with positive cooperativity (1Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 2Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). SSB binds to single-stranded DNA in at least three distinct binding modes as (SSB) n, where n = 35, 56, and 65 nucleotides/SSB tetramer (reviewed in Ref. 1Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The binding site size of E. coli SSB is influenced by solution variables such as pH, temperature, monovalent and divalent cations, anions, and binding density (3Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bujalowski W. Overman L.B. Lohman T.M. J. Biol.

Electron microscopic analysis of SSB-ssDNA complexes suggests that the binding modes of SSB correspond to different morphologies of DNA-protein lattice (8Griffith J.D. Harris L.D. Register III., J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 553-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The (SSB)56/(SSB)65 binding mode formed in solutions containing high salt and lower binding densities display “limited” cooperativity and a “beaded” appearance to ssDNA. The (SSB)35 mode formed in solutions containing low salt and higher binding density confers “unlimited” cooperativity and “smooth” appearance to ssDNA (1Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 8Griffith J.D. Harris L.D. Register III., J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 553-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transition between the two binding modes is reversible and modified by the solution variables (1Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev.

In this regard, different binding modes may be used selectively for different processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Both genetic and biochemical studies indicate that E. coliSSB influences the activities of its cognate RecA and RecBCD proteins (reviewed in Refs. 9Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K.

The most extensively investigated homologous recombination process is the 3-strand exchange reaction between circular single-stranded DNA and homologous linear duplex DNA. The reaction proceeds in three sequential phases: (i) thepresynaptic polymerization of RecA protein on single-stranded DNA forming a helical nucleoprotein filament; (ii)synapsis, the homologous alignment of nucleoprotein filament with naked duplex DNA; and (iii) unidirectional strand exchange, which creates long heteroduplex DNA (9Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rocca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, SSB is involved in both early and later steps of homologous recombination promoted by RecA (9Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rocca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the early phase, SSB abets the formation of nucleoprotein filaments of RecA-ssDNA. This activation depends on the ability of SSB to remove secondary structure in ssDNA and mediate coordinated assembly of RecA across structural barriers (12Muniyappa K. Shaner S.L. Tsang S.S.

However, the latter point is controversial and is the subject of ongoing debate. In the subsequent steps of three-strand exchange reaction, SSB helps in sequestering the 5′ end of the displaced ssDNA and, consequently, inhibits its participation in additional pairing reactions (18Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9315-9320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mycobacterium tuberculosis has emerged as a successful obligate human pathogen and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Combined with the increasing number of people infected with bothM. tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus, it presents an imminent hazard to public health. Although much research has focused on immunology, biochemistry, and microbiology of this pathogen, investigations into molecular interactions between specific gene products has not been possible because of the lack of defined mutants with specific phenotypes. Therefore, understanding of the mechanistic aspects of homologous recombination may help molecular genetic manipulation of mycobacteria. We previously reported the biochemical characterization and x-ray structure of M. tuberculosis RecA protein (20Kumar R.A. Vaze M.B. Chandra N.R. Vijayan M. Muniyappa K. Biochemistry. 1986; 35: 1793-1803Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Vaze M.B. Muniyappa K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3175-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Datta S. Prabhu M.M. Vaze M.B. Ganesh N. Chandra N.R. Muniyappa K. Vijayan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4964-4973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the molecular aspects of homologous recombination promoted by RecA and its cognate SSB, we have isolated and characterized ssb genes and developed expression systems and purification protocols for bothM. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis SSB proteins. We observed that DNA binding by SSB proteins of mycobacteria was associated with enhanced sensitivity to proteases at the carboxyl-terminal domain, which is also the site of interaction of its cognate RecA. Accordingly, SSB and RecA co-immunoprecipitated fromM. smegmatis cell lysates, further supporting an interaction between these proteins in vivo. These results provide the first evidence for stable association of an eubacterial SSB with its cognate RecA suggesting that these two proteins might function togetherin vivo during DNA repair and/or recombination. All chemicals were of reagent grade. Buffers were prepared using deionized water. Phage T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from New England Biolabs. Chymotrypsin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. E. coli RecA protein (23Cox M.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4676-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SSB (24Lohman T.M. Green J.M. Beyer R.S.

Biol. 1985; 185: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). RecA proteins were purified as described (23Cox M.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4676-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysate was treated with polymin P, the pellet was extracted with NaCl, the supernatants were combined, and the proteins were precipitated with ammonium sulfate. The dialyzed fraction was chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose, and active RecA protein was obtained from ssDNA-cellulose column as described (23Cox M.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4676-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single-stranded oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotides were purified on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea, eluted from acrylamide gels with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, and their concentration was estimated using ε260 provided by the manufacturer. Purified oligonucleotides were stored in the same buffer at −20 °C. Oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′ end using [γ-32P]ATP and phage T4 polynucleotide kinase (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Free ATP was removed from the labeling reaction by gel filtration on a Sephadex G50 column (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The sequence of 40-mer DNA used in mobility shift assays is as follows: 5′-ACTATGT- ATGTACTATGACTATAATACTATGATGAGCTAC-3′. The structural gene coding for SSB of M. smegmatismc2155 and M. tuberculosis were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Taq DNA polymerase from genomic and cosmid DNA, respectively. Two PCR primers designed from the reported M. tuberculosis ssb gene sequence (27Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Chrucher C. Harris D. et al.Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6504) Google Scholar) were used to obtain both M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis PCR products of ssb. The 5′ primer contained a restriction site for NdeI (underlined) and 3′ primer forKpnI (underlined). The nucleotide sequence is as follows: 5′ primer, 5′-GAATTCCATATGGCTGGTGACACCACCATC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-GGGGTACCTCAGAATGGCGGTTCGTC AT-3′. The PCR product (∼0.5 kilobase pair) was purified from agarose gel, digested with both NdeI and KpnI to remove the flanking 15 base pairs. The PCR products were phenol-extracted, followed by precipitation with ethanol. The 498-base pair fragment was ligated into the expression vector, pET17b (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) between restriction sites NdeI and KpnI downstream of the phage T7 promoter. Similarly, the structural gene coding for M. tuberculosis SSB was amplified from cosmid MTCY21D4 (27Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Chrucher C. Harris D. et al.Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6504) Google Scholar) and inserted into the expression vector, pET17b, as described above. The resultant recombinant plasmids were designated pSRMS and pSRMT, which harbor M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis ssbgenes, respectively. The recombinant plasmids were transformed intoE. coli DH5α cells. Plasmids prepared from this host were subsequently transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain (Novagen) for protein expression. The nucleotide sequence of the clonedM. smegmatis ssb gene is the same as reported for its genomic sequence (preliminary sequence data were obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research web site at www.tigr.org/cgi-bin/BlastSearch/ blast.cgi?organism=m_smegmatis). The DNA sequence of ssb genes was determined by dideoxy DNA sequencing of both strands using insert-specific fluorescent primers in an ABI Prism 377 automated sequenator and with the Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of M. smegmatis ssb has been deposited with GenBank™ (accession numberAF349434). The native and chymotryptic peptides of SSB were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane (Bio-Rad). The bands were excised from the membrane, and the amino-terminal sequencing of native and tryptic peptides was carried out on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences protein sequencer. Nucleic acid and protein sequence analysis was carried out using programs in GCG (29Devereux J. Haelberti P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) and ClustalW 1.81 (30Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55635) Google Scholar) and displayed using BOXSHADE version 3.31 (31Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis and E. coli ssb sequences were obtained from the Wellcome Trust Pathogen Genome Unit (Sanger Center, Hinxton Hall, United Kingdom) (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/M.tuberculosis/blast-server.shtml) and the NCBI genome data base, respectively. The multiple alignments were performed to maximize regions of overlap using PILEUP. E. coli strains harboring plasmids pSRMS and pSRMT were cultured in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. At mid-exponential phase (A 600 = 0.4), gene expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were further incubated for 5 h and collected by centrifugation at 5000 × gfor 10 min. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C unless indicated otherwise. The cells were washed with 30 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m NaCl and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2m NaCl, 10% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.1 mm PMSF). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml, and the suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were disrupted by sonication (Vibra Cell Sonicator, Sonics and Materials Inc, Danbury, CT) in a pulse mode (50% duty cycle) and a power setting of 8 for 10 min. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 25,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 28 rotor for 90 min. SSB protein was precipitated from supernatant by the addition of polymin P (pH 6.9) to a final concentration of 0.4% over 15 min. The pellet was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min in a Beckman JA20 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA, 0.4m NaCl, and 20% (v/v) glycerol and stirred for 15 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. SSB protein was precipitated from supernatant by the addition of (NH4)2SO4 (0.2 g/ml) over 30 min. The pellet obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min was resuspended in 25 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m NaCl, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. This procedure was repeated, and the pellet thus obtained was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m NaCl, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. The resuspended solution was dialyzed against 500 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The dialyzed protein solution was applied onto a DEAE-cellulose column, which had been equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mNaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. The column was washed with the same buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl until the eluate contained no material that absorbed light at 280 nm. The bound proteins were eluted with the equilibration buffer containing 0.3m NaCl. The fractions containing SSB were combined and dialyzed against 500 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol. Aliquots of the dialyzed SSB preparation were stored at −20 °C. The yield of SSB was in the range of 1.5 mg/g cell paste. Protein purity was assessed by 10% SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Blue staining and was generally >98% pure (Fig. 2). The presence of both ATP-dependent and ATP-independent exo- and endonucleases in purified SSB preparation was assayed by incubating M13 circular single-stranded, linear, or negatively supercoiled DNA for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and the identity of DNA was visualized by UV illumination of agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Protein concentration was determined by the dye-binding method (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the internal standard. Standard reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 3 μm32P-labeled 40-mer DNA was incubated with the indicated concentrations of SSB. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 3 μl of loading buffer (20% glycerol containing 0.12% (w/v) each of bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol) to each reaction mixture. The individual samples were separated on a 8% polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis in 13.2 mm Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.4) at 12 V/cm for 4 h at 4 °C. The gel was dried at 80 °C on a Whatman no. 3MM filter paper, and DNA-SSB complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Reaction mixtures (40 μl) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, 300–600 pmol of SSB, 2.4–4.8 nmol of M13 ssDNA (where mentioned), and 0.2 μg of chymotrypsin. After incubation for indicated periods of time at 37 °C, reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and PMSF to a final concentration of 0.2 mm to each reaction mixture. Samples were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The chymotryptic peptide of M. smegmatis SSB lacking the 35 amino acid residues at the carboxyl terminus was generated by limited chymotryptic digestion. Reaction mixtures like those described in the preceding section were scaled up with increase in the amount of SSB to 3 mg. After digestion the resulting mixture was subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superdex 75 column. The second peak of the chromatographic profile contained the chymotryptic peptide and appeared to be homogeneous, as ascertained by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SPR studies were performed using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Asia Pacific Pvt. Ltd.) at 25 °C. RecA protein in buffer A (10 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) was diluted to 100 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.5). RecA protein from the indicated source was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip, which had been activated previously using the standard coupling chemistry as recommended by the manufacturer, by passing protein solutions at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. Coupling of RecA protein on CM 5 chip produced response signals of 2000 response units (RU). (Immobilization of SSB resulted in loss of its ability to interact with RecA, perhaps because of masking of sites.) A control empty surface was created in a similar fashion. SSB from E. coli, M. smegmatis, or M. tuberculosis was injected at varying concentrations at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 10 min. The flow buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. In addition, where mentioned, the flow buffer contained 1 mmATP plus 12 mm MgCl2. Surfaces were regenerated using a solution containing 10 mm NaOH. To prepare biosensor surface with DNA, 3′-biotinylated 60-mer DNA (5′-AATTCTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGGTCAAGTTGACTACGTATACATC-biotin-3′) was immobilized in the flow cells of a streptavidin-coated chip to ∼400 RU, with flow cell number 1 serving as control. The interaction of native forms of SSB or the amino-terminal domain of M. smegmatis SSB was monitored using a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 5 min. The flow buffer contained 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 12 mm MgCl2, 1.4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl. The surface was regenerated using solutions containing 0.1% SDS, followed by 100 mm NaCl. Affinity and kinetic analysis was performed using BIAevaluation software, version 3.0. Each experiment was repeated at least two times to ensure reproducibility of results. M. smegmatis mc2155 wild-type or M. smegmatisΔrecA (HS42) (34Papavinasasundaram K.G. Colston M.J. Davis E.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.2 m NaCl by sonication in a pulse mode (50% duty cycle) and power setting of 5 for 2 min. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a Beckman JA 20 rotor for 15 min at 4 °C, and stored at −70 °C. For nuclease treatment, cell lysates (200 μg) were incubated with 10 μg of DNase I at 37 °C for 15 min, before coimmunoprecipitation. Under conditions of DNase I treatment, 5 ng of M13 DNA was completely degraded to acid-soluble nucleotide residues. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments were performed as described (35Moynahan M.E. Pierce A.J. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot (50 μl) of cell-free lysate was incubated with preimmune serum, anti-RecA or anti-SSB antibodies in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0. 2 m NaCl, and 1 mm ATP at 4 °C for 6 h, and was then combined with a 20-μl slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated for an additional 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed six times with 500 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, and 1 mm ATP, suspended in SDS sample buffer (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a submerged transfer apparatus filled with a solution containing 25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine. After blocking with NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Triton X-100) for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with appropriate primary antibody for 6 h. The membranes were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. Protein-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence (36Scneppenheim R. Rautenberg P. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1987; 6: 49-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ssb structural genes ofM. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis were amplified using a set of primers by PCR from genomic and cosmid DNA, respectively. Each primer contained 2 or 6 nucleotide residues of unrelated sequence, followed by a site for restriction enzyme, and then nucleotide residues corresponding to the amino acid sequence ofM. tuberculosis or M. smegmatis ssb genes. PCR amplification of ssb genes of M. smegmatis andM. tuberculosis yielded products of predicted length and nucleotide sequence (data not shown). The products purified from agarose gels were ligated into the expression vector, pET17b. Recombinant plasmids were amplified in E. coli DH5α strain. Fig. 1 depicts the amino acid sequence of SSB proteins deduced from the nucleotide sequence. Pairwise comparison of amino acid sequence suggested that M. smegmatis SSB displayed 84% identity and 89% similarity toM. tuberculosis SSB. A similar comparison of the amino acid sequence of E. coli SSB with those of mycobacteria suggest that the carboxyl-terminal tail is extended by 14 amino acid residues in the former. The identity of amino acid sequence between E. coli and mycobacterial SSBs is ∼36% (61% similarity), when compared over their entire length. There are two highly conserved portions between the mycobacterial SSB proteins. The first stretch includes the amino-terminal amino acid residues from Met1through Gly125 corresponding to the DNA-binding and tetramerization domains (1Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 2Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). The second conserved region, situated at the carboxyl-terminal domain comprises a short stretch of amino acid residues from Asp145 through Phe165 except at Ser157 and Ala159, which are replaced by Gly at both the positions in MtSSB. Strikingly, sequence comparison between mycobacterial SSBs encompassing amino acid residues from Gly124 through Gly136 revealed that MsSSB contains a significantly high amount of glycine (11 of 13), and substantial sequence divergence between residues Phe130 and Lys143. To ascertain whether M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis open reading frames amplified truly represents their SSBs, we purified them for biochemical characterization. A source for large scale preparation of SSB was developed by allowing expression of recombinant plasmids inE. coli strain, BL21(DE3)pLysS. SSBs that accumulated as soluble proteins were detected on SDS"

Because macrophages play a central role in the inflammatory response, and the atherosclerotic lesion has features associated with chronic inflammatory settings, we investigated foam cell inflammatory potential. THP-1-derived macrophages were treated with oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) for 3 days to lipid load the macrophages and establish a foam cell-like phenotype. The cells were then activated by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and RNA was harvested at 0, 1, and 6 h after LPS addition. RNA from treated and control cells was hybridized to microarrays containing ∼16,000 human cDNAs. Genes that exhibited a 4-fold or greater increase or decrease at either 1 or 6 h after LPS treatment were counted as LPS-responsive genes. Employing these criteria, 127 LPS-responsive genes were identified. Prior treatment of THP-1 macrophages with OxLDL affected the expression of 57 of these 127 genes. Among these 57 genes was a group of chemokine, cytokine, and signal transduction genes with pronounced expression changes. OxLDL pretreatment resulted in a significant perturbation of LPS-induced NFκB activation. Furthermore, some of the OxLDL effects appear to be mediated by the nuclear receptors retinoid X receptor and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor γ because pretreatment of THP-1 macrophages with ligands for these receptors, followed by LPS treatment, recapitulates the OxLDL plus LPS results for several of the most significantly modulated genes.

These features include local enrichment of inflammatory cells, persistent cell damage, changes in the extracellular matrix, increased cell proliferation, and fibrosis (1Glass C. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2615) Google Scholar). In nascent arterial lesions, changes in surface endothelium occur due to the entry and oxidation of lipids (2Lusis A. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4638) Google Scholar). The location of such lesions is usually at major arterial branches, where endothelial cell shapes are nonuniform, and shear stress from blood flow is irregular (3Gimbrone M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Resultant endothelial changes include increased expression of adhesion proteins and the secretion of chemoattractant molecules. This in turn leads to the recruitment, binding, and subsequent entry of monocytes and lymphocytes into subendothelial spaces. (1Glass C. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2615) Google Scholar). In the early stages of the atherosclerotic lesion, lipid-engorged macrophages, or foam cells, appear to be most prominent (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) As the lesion progresses, a necrotic core of lipid, oxidized lipid, and other cell debris accumulates. Increases in extracellular matrix production result in the formation of a fibrous cap or plaque that walls off the necrotic core from the endothelium (2Lusis A. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4638) Google Scholar, 5Ross R.N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19128) Google Scholar). In time, increased lesion size and local proliferation of smooth muscle cells can cause the plaque to protrude into the lumen. Weakening events, possibly associated with the local inflammatory response, can lead to plaque rupture, thrombosis, and the ensuing myocardial infarction or stroke (5Ross R.N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19128) Google Scholar, 6Libby P. Am. J. Cardiol. 2000; 86: 3-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). During this complex process, the foam cell macrophage is generally thought to play a major role in the pathology of the disease (2Lusis A. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4638) Google Scholar, 4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Foam cell macrophages comprise the major volume of the early lesion or “fatty streak,” and they are enriched in late-stage lesions as well (1Glass C. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2615) Google Scholar). Macrophages carry out several critical functions that are likely to impact the development of atherosclerosis. As scavenger cells, they rid the body of dead cells and cell debris. As antigen-presenting cells, they perform an “early warning” function that helps mobilize additional members of the immune system in the case of infection. In addition, macrophages secrete cytokines and chemokines that direct and amplify the local immune response once it is triggered. Altered or unregulated control of these processes in the foam cell would likely have profound effects on the recruitment and behavior of macrophages and lymphocytes within the atherosclerotic lesion. Previous in vitro studies involving foam cell macrophages have observed changes in gene expression and/or cellular response that suggest that excess lipid loading can modulate macrophage inflammatory potential (7Hamilton T.A.

In situ studies of human and animal atherosclerotic lesions have identified the increased expression of several chemokine, tissue-remodeling, and lipid metabolism genes (1Glass C. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2615) Google Scholar,11Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Couse T.L. Wilcox J.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

In vivo, infectious agents like cytomegalovirus andChlamydia pneumoniae have been linked to atherosclerosis (14de Boer O.J. van der Wal A.C. Becker A.E. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 15Temesgen Z. Expert. Opin. Pharmacother. 2001; 2: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In addition, antibodies to OxLDL1 epitopes and increases in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines have been observed to correlate with vascular disease (16Hansson G.K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17Horkko S. Binder C.J. Shaw P.X. Chang M. Silverman G. Palinski W. Witztum J. Free Radic. Biol.

These and other studies implicate a role for activated macrophages and other inflammatory cells in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. In an attempt to address the question of whether inflammatory gene expression programs are altered in the foam cell macrophage, we have carried out the following study. PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were treated with OxLDL for 3 days to lipid load the macrophages and establish a foam cell-like phenotype. The cells were then activated by treatment with LPS followed by large scale gene expression analysis using DNA microarrays. The LPS effects on transcription were determined by comparing gene expression at 1 and 6 h after LPS stimulation with that of unstimulated cells. The effects of OxLDL pretreatment on LPS-induced transcription were determined through matched time point comparisons between OxLDL-treated and untreated cells. The results of these and other accompanying studies indicate that pretreatment of THP-1 macrophages with OxLDL significantly alters inflammatory gene expression programs initiated after LPS stimulation. In addition, our data suggest that OxLDL modulation of inflammatory signaling is partially mediated through altered regulation of NFκB signaling and activation of the nuclear receptors RXR and PPARγ. Human THP-1 cells (ATCC 10801) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), 0.45% glucose (w/v), 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 × 10−5mβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For OxLDL loading experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in medium containing PMA (Research Biochemical International, Natick, MA) at 1 × 10−7m for 24 h. The medium was then replaced by culture medium with or without 100 μg/ml human oxidized low density lipoprotein (prepared by CuS04 oxidation of low density lipoprotein; Intracel Corp., Rockville, MD) for 3 days. The cells were then treated with 0.5 μg/ml LPS to activate the macrophages. RNA, supernatants, and cell extracts were harvested at the indicated times and assayed as described in individual experiments. For experiments investigating the involvement of the nuclear receptors PPARγ, LXR, and RXR in modulating inflammatory gene expression, PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were incubated with either 3 μm 15-deoxy-12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15dPGJ2), 0.75 μm 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22RHC), or 0.5 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cisR) or left untreated for 2 days followed by stimulation with 0.5 μg/ml LPS to activate the macrophages. RNA was harvested at the times indicated and assayed as described in individual experiments. Total RNA extraction was performed using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation systems (Promega, Madison, WI) and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent dyes for microarray hybridization on UniGEM-V2 and H-GEM1 (Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, CA) as described elsewhere (19DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 24: 680-686Crossref Scopus (3690) Google Scholar). A given gene was analyzed if at least one of its readings had a signal to background ratio of 2.5 or more, a signal intensity above 250 units for one or both dyes, and a spot size of at least 40% of the spotted area. These criteria assured that the signal level was sufficiently high above background to be reliably read and that the reading was not the result of nonuniform noise on spotted DNA sites. The identity of spotted DNA was verified by polymerase chain reaction, with a failure in polymerase chain reaction testing resulting in the exclusion of the spot measurement. Of the ∼16,000 human cDNAs that were probed, 1190 genes showed 2-fold or greater differential expression at 1 and/or 6 h due to LPS treatment as compared with time 0. Of these 1190 genes, 127 genes were 4-fold or greater regulated and are described in this study. These 127 genes were clustered into four groups based on expression pattern, and each gene was highlighted if it was 2-fold or greater changed due to pretreatment with OxLDL. These latter values were measured in paired time point probings (i.e. +OxLDL, 1 h LPS/−OxLDL, 1 h LPS and +OxLDL, 6 h LPS/−OxLDL, 6 h LPS). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed on ABI Prism Sequence Detection System 5700 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A set of primers was designed for each gene using Primer Express (PE Applied Biosystems). DNA sequence was obtained from GenBankTM, and amplicons of 100–200 base pairs with Tm between 68 °C and 85 °C were selected. RT-PCR reactions utilizing 0.1–1 μg of DNase-treated total RNA were performed under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. A dissociation curve was generated at the end of the polymerase chain reaction cycle to verify that a single product was amplified. A standard curve for each amplicon was obtained using serial dilutions of total RNA prepared from THP-1 cells. The results from triplicate (for ±OxLDL, +LPS sample RNAs) or duplicate (±nuclear receptor ligands, +LPS sample RNAs) polymerase chain reactions for a given gene at each time point were used to determine mRNA quantity relative to the corresponding standard curve. The relative mRNA quantity for a given gene measured from a single reverse transcription reaction was divided by the value obtained for either glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or ribosomal protein S9 to correct for fluctuations in input RNA levels and varying efficiencies of reverse transcription reactions. The differential expression curves obtained using either of these genes as the correction factor consistently showed the same pattern. PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were treated with or without OxLDL for 3 days as described above. The cells were then treated with LPS, and culture media were collected at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 18 h after the addition of LPS. Supernatants were then assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of IL-1β using reagents and protocols of the supplier (R&D Systems). Nuclear extract preparations, generation of probes, and DNA binding conditions for gel shift mobility assays followed standard protocols that have been described previously (20Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nable G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotide and complement were used to generate the NFκB-specific probe: 5′-AGTTG- AGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were treated with OxLDL for 3 days to lipid load the macrophages and establish a foam cell-like phenotype. Control cells were maintained in culture for the same length of time without OxLDL. The foam cell phenotype was determined by increased oil red-o staining and increased mRNA levels for CD36, adipophilin, PPARγ, and other foam cell marker genes (9Shiffman D. Mikita T. Tai J.T.

The OxLDL-pretreated and control cells were then activated by treatment with LPS, and RNA was harvested at 0, 1, and 6 h after LPS addition to generate six unique samples (Scheme FS1). These six samples were then compared in two ways using DNA microarrays. LPS effects on transcription were determined in the non-OxLDL-treated cells by comparing 1 h and 6 h RNA samples to time 0 levels (data designated −Ox, 1hr LPS/−Ox, 0hr and −Ox, 6hr LPS/−Ox, 0hr; Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). LPS effects on transcription in the OxLDL-pretreated cells were similarly determined (data designated +Ox, 1hr LPS/+Ox, 0hr and+Ox, 6 hr LPS/+Ox, 0 hr; Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). These procedures identified the total number of LPS-regulated genes for these cells. LPS-responsive genes were tabulated (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) if they exhibited a 4-fold or greater change in message levels at either 1 or 6 h after LPS treatment. This cutoff was chosen to select only those genes most affected by LPS treatment.Figure 1Microarray data. Gene expression values for LPS-activated genes in the −OxLDL- and +OxLDL-treated THP-1 cells were organized into four groups based on the LPS-induced expression patterns observed in the control (−OxLDL) cells. Group 1 includes 41 LPS-activated genes that exhibit peak up-regulation at 1 h. LPS effects on transcription were determined in the −OXLDL-treated cells by comparing 1 h and 6 h RNA samples with time 0 levels (data designated −Ox, 1hr LPS/−Ox, 0hr and −Ox, 6hr LPS/−Ox, 0hr). LPS effects on transcription in +OxLDL-treated cells were similarly determined (data designated +Ox, 1hr LPS/+Ox, 0hr and +Ox, 6hr LPS/+Ox, 0hr). OxLDL effects on LPS-responsive genes were determined through matched time point comparisons of RNA from −OxLDL- and +OxLDL-treated cells after the addition of LPS (data designated +Ox, 1hr LPS/−Ox, 1hr LPSand +Ox, 6hr LPS/−Ox, 6hr LPS). The matched time point values are highlighted in light gray if OxLDL pretreatment results in a 2-fold or greater up-regulation of the control LPS response and in medium gray if OxLDL pretreatment results in a 2-fold or greater down-regulation of the control LPS response. Genes modulated by OxLDL before LPS treatment have time 0 values (+Ox, 0hr/−Ox, 0hr) marked in dark gray.

In these experiments, matched time point comparisons were made between RNA from −OXLDL- and +OxLDL-pretreated cells after LPS treatment to directly measure the effects of OxLDL on LPS-responsive genes (data designated +Ox, 1hr LPS/−Ox, 1hr LPS and +Ox, 6hr LPS/−Ox, 6hr LPS; Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). This second set of hybridizations to determine the effects of OxLDL on LPS-responsive genes was required because only comparisons between two RNA populations hybridized to a single chip can be made using Incyte microarrays. Thus, LPS responsiveness was determined through the first set of hybridizations, and OxLDL effects were determined through the second set of hybridizations. Inspection of the column data for LPS response in control and OxLDL-pretreated cells shows that interchip comparative differences (for example, −Ox, 1hr LPS/−Ox, 0hr versus +Ox, 1hr LPS/+Ox, 0hr values, Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) were often highly concordant with the values observed in the single chip, matched time point measurements. A gene was considered to be affected by OxLDL pretreatment if there was a 2-fold or greater difference in the LPS response of the gene compared with the control matched time point value. A 2-fold cutoff has been shown to be reliable and reproducible using Incyte Genomics hybridization methodology (22Yue H. Eastman P.S. Wang B.B. Minor J. Doctolero M.H. Nuttall R.L. Stack R. Becker J.W. Montgomery J.R. Vainer M. Johnston R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 15: 29-35Google Scholar). Employing the above criteria, 127 genes that were regulated 4-fold or greater by LPS were identified (108 were up-regulated, and 19 were down-regulated). Of these 127 genes, 56 genes were modulated by OxLDL pretreatment. The majority of these OxLDL effects were suppressive, resulting in diminished LPS-induced gene expression. However, several chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes were further up-regulated by the combination of OxLDL plus LPS treatment. To study the effects of OxLDL pretreatment on LPS-regulated gene expression, we first analyzed the expression patterns of LPS-responsive genes in cells not exposed to OxLDL. 1 h and 6 h LPS treatment times were chosen to observe both early and late transcription events. Four main gene expression patterns or groups were observed for these LPS-treated cells (−Ox, 1hr LPS/−Ox, 0hr and −Ox, 6hr LPS/−Ox, 0hr values). Group 1 (Fig. 1) includes 41 LPS-activated genes that exhibit peak up-regulation at 1 h. To meet the criteria for inclusion in group 1, a gene must be 4-fold or greater up-regulated at 1 h with diminished up-regulation at 6 h. Thus, genes in this group exhibit early but transient LPS-activated expression. Group 2 (Fig.2) consists of 14 LPS-activated genes that begin up-regulation at 1 h but are further increased at 6 h. Genes in group 2 are at least 2-fold up-regulated at 1 h and 4-fold or greater up-regulated at 6 h. As such, these genes exhibit both an early and increasing expression pattern over the 6-h time course of LPS treatment. In group 3 (Fig.3), there are 53 genes that are up-regulated at 6 h but not at 1 h. Group 3 genes are less than 2-fold changed at 1 h and 4-fold or greater induced at 6 h. Thus, genes in this group are late up-regulated genes. Finally, in group 4 (Fig. 4), there are 19 genes that are 4-fold or greater down-regulated at 1 and/or 6 h. The OxLDL effects on genes contained within these individual expression groups are described below. The effect of OxLDL treatment on LPS-regulated gene expression was measured by comparing OxLDL-treated samples with untreated samples at 1 and 6 h. 1 h and 6 h matched pair values (i.e. +Ox, 1hr LPS/−Ox, 1hr LPS and +Ox, 6hr LPS/−Ox, 6hr LPS, Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) are highlighted in light gray if OxLDL pretreatment results in a 2-fold or greater up-regulation of the control LPS response. The matched paired values are highlighted inmedium gray if OxLDL pretreatment results in a 2-fold or greater down-regulation of the control LPS response. Genes modulated by OxLDL before LPS treatment have time 0 values (+Ox, 0hr/−Ox, 0hr) marked in dark gray. As the highlighted values in Group1(Fig. 1) show, 31 of the 41 LPS-up-regulated genes in this group are modulated by OxLDL. 9 of these genes are further up-regulated at 6 h (light gray), including the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. 6 of these 9 genes exhibit diminished up-regulation at the 1 h time point, suggesting a possible time delay in the induced expression of these genes compared with that of the controls. Included among these are 4 chemokines, Mip-1α, Mip-1β, Mip-3α, and IL-8, which signal for the recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes (23Moser B. Loetscher P. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 24Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar, 25Mackay C.R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Also included are the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and one gene of unknown function, PMA-induced protein 1. The AP1 component Jun is further up-regulated at 1 h. AP1 is known to be activated by LPS and, like NFκB, plays an important role in the activation of pro-inflammatory genes. The transcription factor activating transcription factor 3 and the cytoskeleton and cell migration regulator RhoE are up-regulated by OxLDL before the addition of LPS (dark gray), hence the message level of these genes is already elevated before further LPS induction. In the experiments discussed below, the expression pattern of several chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes was studied over a longer time course using RT-PCR. We also investigated the involvement of the nuclear receptors PPARγ, LXR, and RXR in mediating the effects of OxLDL on these LPS-activated genes. The remaining OxLDL-modulated genes in group 1 show diminished LPS up-regulation (medium gray). Included among these 20 genes are several pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1α, Mip-2α, pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor, and cyclooxygenase 2, as well as the NFκB signaling regulators I-Traf and A20. The repression of LPS-induced cyclooxygenase 2 expression is particularly strong, consistent with a previous study (26Eligini S. Colli S. Basso F. Sironi L. Tremoli E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1719-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Other genes with diminished up-regulation include the cell cycle-implicated genes GOS2,PacI, and MCLS1 and three related orphan nuclear receptors, Nurr1, TR3, and MINOR. Originally studied in development, Nurr1 has recently been implicated in inflammation (27Murphy E.P. McEvoy A. Conneely O.M. Bresnihan B. FitzGerald O. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 782-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and TR3 has been shown to play a novel role in triggering apoptosis (28Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X. Hobbs P.D. Lin B. Chen G. Lu J. Lin F. Xie Z. Fontana J.A. Reed J.C. Zhang X. Science. 2000; 289: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). As the array data show, OxLDL strongly represses the LPS induction of these orphan nuclear receptors (confirmed by RT-PCR; data not shown). Two molecules, DSCR1 and EGR3, which modulate or are modulated by the calcineurin-NFAT pathway, also exhibit strongly repressed LPS induction. NFAT proteins play a critical role in T-cell activation, thus this pathway may have a role in macrophage inflammatory response. Interestingly, DSCR1 is both an OxLDL- and LPS-up-regulated gene. However, pretreatment with OxLDL precludes further induction by LPS (confirmed by RT-PCR; data not shown). Two molecules that encode AP1 components, FosB, and Fos2A, also exhibit strongly repressed LPS induction, as do urokinase-type plasminogen activator and the G-protein-coupled receptor EB12. The reduction in FosB and Fos2A contrast with the OxLDL-mediated increased induction in c-Jun levels, which is also an AP1 component. Interestingly, RGS-1, like DSCR1, is both an OxLDL-induced and LPS-induced gene, but pretreatment with OxLDL precludes further induction by LPS (confirmed by RT-PCR; data not shown). RGS proteins have been shown to modulate chemotaxis through G-protein-coupled chemokine receptors (29Denecke B. Meyerdierks A. Bottger E.C. J. Biol.

This process is catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS),1 each species of which discriminates with high selectivity among the many structurally similar tRNAs and amino acids (1Normanly J. Abelson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 1029-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 2Schulman L.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 41: 23-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To avoid misacylation of tRNAs from any of the 19 non-cognate groups, tRNAs possess identity elements within their sequence or tertiary structure that are strictly recognized only by the cognate synthetase. These identity elements are most commonly located in the anticodon and in the acceptor stem, particularly the discriminator base at position 73 (2, 3). However, in the case of the serine tRNA of Escherichia coli, several biochemical experiments have revealed that neither the anticodon stem/loop nor the discriminator base is involved in recognition (4Himeno H. Hasegawa T. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Shimizu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6815-6819Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5Sampson J.R. Saks M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4467-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); instead, the E. colitRNASer identity elements are located in the characteristic long extra arm (4Himeno H. Hasegawa T. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Shimizu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6815-6819Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5Sampson J.R. Saks M.E.

Biol. 1994; 236: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These findings conform well with analyses of the crystallographic structures of seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS)-tRNASer complexes from E. coli andThermus thermophilus (8Price S. Cusack S. Borel F. Berthet-Colominas C. Leberman R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which indicate that the N-terminal long helical domain of SerRS plays an important role in recognizing the long extra arm and the TΨC loop of tRNASer. In eukaryotic systems, cytoplasmic tRNASer also has a long variable arm, and biochemical studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human tRNAsSer have revealed that it contains the major identity element of tRNASer (11Achsel T. Gross H.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3333-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Dock-Bregeon A.C. Garcia A. Giege R. Moras D. Eur. J.

Soma A. Nishikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The recognition mechanism of SerRS thus appears to be evolutionarily conserved in both prokaryote and eukaryotic cytoplasm. The mammalian mitochondrial (mt) translation system utilizes two tRNASer species, one specific for codon AGY and the other for UCN. Neither of these tRNAs has a long extra arm as a recognition site for cytoplasmic SerRS (15Lenhard B. Orellana O. Ibba M. Weygand-Durasevic I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, each possesses an unusual secondary structure; tRNAGCUSer (for codon AGY) lacks the entire D arm (16Steinberg S. Gautheret D. Cedergren R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas tRNAUGASer (for codon UCN) has an unusual cloverleaf configuration with an extended anticodon stem (17Yokogawa T. Watanabe Y. Kumazawa Y. Ueda T. Hirao I. Miura K. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6101-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the single mt SerRS recognizes these distinct isoacceptors with almost the same activity (18Yokogawa T. Shimada N. Takeuchi N. Benkowski L. Suzuki T. Omori A. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Spremulli L.L. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19913-19920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additionally, inspection of the primary sequences of several mt SerRSs revealed differences between mammalian mt SerRS and its prokaryotic counterpart in the N-terminal domain responsible for tRNA recognition, which are in line with structural and recognition differences between the extra arms of mammalian mt and prokaryotic tRNAsSer. Because no other tRNA investigated to date recognizes structurally different tRNA isoacceptors, it is supposed that the recognition mechanism of mammalian mt SerRS differs considerably from that of any other ARS. Elucidating the mystery of how mammalian mt SerRS recognizes and discriminates two isoacceptors with no common structure and sequence from non-cognate tRNAs will not only extend our knowledge of the recognition mechanism of ARS but also shed light on hidden aspects of the mammalian mt translation system. To investigate the recognition mechanism of mammalian mt SerRS, we recombinantly expressed bovine mt SerRS in E. coli and performed a series of biochemical experiments using this enzyme and several tRNA variants. On the basis of the results, we report here the unique recognition mechanism of mammalian mt SerRS. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was purchased from Sigma; [14C]l-serine (5.59 GBq/mmol), [32P]pCp, and a HiTrap chelating column were fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech; the vector pET-19b was from Novagen; nucleotide-specific RNases T1 and U2 were fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech and Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo), respectively; vectors pUC18 and pUC19 were from Takara; an anion-exchange tip was from Qiagen; and a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene. Recombinant mt LeuRS was overproduced from an expression vector kindly provided by Dr. L. L. Spremulli (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Native bovine mt tRNAs were purified from bovine mitochondria by selective hybridization using a solid phase DNA probe as described by Wakita et al. (19Wakita K. Watanabe Y. Yokogawa T. Kumazawa Y. Nakamura S. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Nishikawa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). cDNA for bovine mt SerRS without an N-terminal peptide for mitochondrial importation was amplified by PCR using synthetic primers; a forward primer corresponding to the N-terminal end of mature mt SerRS (atataccatgggccatcatcatcatcatcatcatggcagcgacgacgacgacaaggcaacggagaggcaggatcg) possessing an NcoI site, and a reverse primer for the C-terminal end (cagccggatcctcagctcgaggcaggctgg) carrying aBamHI site. The PCR product was cloned into pET-19b to construct an expression vector for mature bovine mt SerRS with a hexahistidine tag in the N-terminal region. E. coliBL21 (DE3) was used as a host for expression of the recombinant mt SerRS. The culture conditions for overproducing cells were optimized to maximum the expression of soluble enzyme. The transformant was cultured in LB broth (100 μg/ml ampicillin) at 37 °C to anA 600 value of 0.6, and then induced by 10 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 20 h at 28 °C. Cells harvested from 3 liters of LB broth were resuspended in 40 ml of HT buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.03% (w/v) egg white lysozyme, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and disrupted by 12-min sonication (repeated 1-s bursts after 4-s cooling periods) at 100 watts and 0 °C. The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. The supernatant fraction (S100) was loaded onto a nickel-charged HiTrap chelating column (5 ml). After washing out nonbound proteins, the recombinant protein was eluted with a 60-ml linear gradient from 0 to 350 mm imidazole in HT buffer. mt SerRS was eluted in a fraction containing ∼200 mmimidazole. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Glycerol was added to pooled mt SerRS fractions at a final concentration of 30%, frozen quickly with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. The mt tRNASer-mt SerRS complex was formed as described by Yokogawa et al. (18Yokogawa T. Shimada N. Takeuchi N. Benkowski L. Suzuki T. Omori A. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Spremulli L.L. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19913-19920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Native PAGE was performed as described by Hornung et al. (20Hornung V. Hofmann H.P. Sprinzl M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7260-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and toluidine blue to analyze the components of the mt tRNASer-mt SerRS complex. To determine theKd value by gel retardation assay, each mt tRNASer was labeled with 32P at the 5′ end. Nonradioactive mt tRNASer was added to each labeled tRNA as a carrier tRNA. Assays were performed by using five different concentrations of tRNAsSer ranging from 0.25 to 5 μm (0.25, 1.0, 3, 4, and 5 μm) for tRNAGCUSer or from 0.25 to 3 μm (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 μm) for tRNAUGASer with a fixed concentration (0.44 μm) of mt SerRS. The relative radioactivity of the RNA band was quantified by a BAS-1000 imaging system (Fuji Photo Film). The amounts of tRNASer-mt SerRS complexes were calculated by subtracting the free tRNA counts from that of the whole count. TheKd value for each native tRNASer was obtained by Scatchard plots. tRNA footprinting using ethylnitrosourea was performed as described by Vlassov et al. (21Vlassov V.V. Kern D. Giege R. Ebel J.P. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with slight modification. mt tRNASer was alkylated with or without mt SerRS at room temperature for 4 h in a reaction mixture containing 5′ end-labeled mt tRNASer(∼50,000 cpm/tube) with 1.5 μm cold carrier tRNASer, 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.11 volume of saturated ethylnitrosourea (ethanol solution). The recombinant mt SerRS and non-cognate mt LeuRS were added to the reaction mixture at final concentrations of 1–5 and 5 μm, respectively. The following experiment conducted after the alkylation was described previously (21Vlassov V.V. Kern D. Giege R. Ebel J.P. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis using 12% acrylamide, 7 murea gel was performed to analyze the footprint site of tRNASer in the presence of mt SerRS. The band position was assigned by comparison with partial RNase T1 and/or U2 digests. The gel was exposed to an imaging plate, followed by analysis using a Fuji BAS-1000 imaging analyzer. Mitochondrial tRNA variant genes were constructed on pUC18 under a T7 class III promoter as described previously (22Reyes V.M. Abelson J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 90-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The transcriptional template harboring the T7 promoter and tRNA gene terminating at its discriminator base (position 73) was amplified from the constructed plasmid by PCR and transcribed to in vitro according to the literature (23Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), except that the reaction mixture contained E. coli CCA, adding at 8 μg/1 ml. After the reaction, a small part of the mixture was electrophoresed on 12% long denaturing polyacrylamide gel (40 cm × 20 cm × 0.35 mm) to check the purity of the synthesized tRNA. All tRNA variants with the complete CCA sequence at the 3′ end were synthesized with more than 70% purity. The transcribed tRNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform treatment, applied onto an anion-exchange tip (Qiagen), and then the complete tRNA band was cut out from the 12% denaturing gel to separate it from the adjacent minor bands. In this way, highly purified tRNA was obtained. The 3′ end of each tRNA was confirmed by thin layer chromatography analysis of the 3′-terminal adenosine, which was labeled with [32P]pCp (data not shown). In addition, the RNA sequences of some variants were verified by Donis-Keller's enzymatic digestion method (data not shown) (24Donis-Keller H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We finally succeeded in recovering about 0.2 A 260 unit of pure tRNA/1-ml reaction mixture. To prepare variants of mt tRNAGCUSer in vivo, the plasmid vector pUC19 carrying the tRNA gene with the T7 promoter and terminator was constructed as reported previously (25Hayashi I. Kawai G. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The plasmids for the other tRNAGCUSer derivatives used were prepared with a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). tRNA variants were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) according to Hayashi et al. (25Hayashi I. Kawai G. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Expressed tRNA was extracted from the cells as described (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and purified by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 murea and 20% formamide. The aminoacylation reaction was performed as described by Yokogawa et al. (18Yokogawa T. Shimada N. Takeuchi N. Benkowski L. Suzuki T. Omori A. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Spremulli L.L. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19913-19920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The initial rates of aminoacylation were ascertained by using six different tRNA concentrations between 0.1 and 2 μm, determined, respectively, according to the amount of each tRNA recovered. In each case, mt SerRS was used at a fixed concentration optimized according to the activity of each tRNA and ranging from 7.15 nm to 14.3 μm. Kinetic experiments gave reasonable Hanes-Woolf plots for determining the kinetic parameters of K m andk cat. All values are the averages of three independent determinations, which varied less than 15%. The aminoacylation reaction for the minihelix tRNAsSer and non-cognate mt tRNAs for Gln, Glu, and Tyr was carried out in 60 μl of a reaction mixture containing 18 pmol of tRNA substrate and 9.5 μg of mt SerRS. At each point, a 10-μl aliquot was withdrawn. We calculated the quantity of each tRNA per A 260unit according to its length, namely 1800 pmol for tRNAUGASer and its variants, 2000 pmol for tRNAGCUSer and 3600 pmol for the two minihelix tRNAs. Other conditions were the same as those used to determine the kinetic parameters. Because it is almost impossible to obtain sufficient native mt SerRS from bovine liver to carry out a detailed investigation of the recognition mechanism, recombinant mt SerRS with an N-terminal histidine tag was overexpressed in E. coli cells. The optimized culture conditions for maximum expression of the soluble protein are described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1, mt SerRS was purified almost homogeneously by nickel-chelating chromatography. The yield was 8.4 mg from 1 liter of the cell culture. The overall structure of the recombinant mt SerRS was examined by measuring the circular dichroism (CD) in the far-UV spectrum, which exhibited CD troughs at 209 and 222 nm, typically indicative of a high α-helical content (data not shown). E. coli SerRS has a similar CD spectrum. According to the online COILS algorithm for the prediction of coiled coils from amino acid sequences (dot.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu:9331/seq-search/struc-predict.html) (29Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3482) Google Scholar), mt SerRS has a single long α-helix in the N-terminal region (residues 57–87), which could explain the CD spectral observation that mt SerRS has a high helical content similar to that of E. coli SerRS. In the crystal structure, E. coli SerRS is known to have two long anti-parallel α-helices in the N-terminal domain (residues 28–53 and 71–103) (27Oakley M.G. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2544-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Hartlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), which were clearly predicted by the COILS algorithm. In addition, the apparent molecular mass of mt SerRS in solution was estimated by gel filtration column chromatography. The enzyme was eluted mainly at 33 min, corresponding to a molecular mass of 109 kDa, with minor peak at 37 min corresponding to 57 kDa (data not shown). As the molecular mass of the enzyme has been calculated from its gene sequence to be 56.3 kDa (18Yokogawa T. Shimada N. Takeuchi N. Benkowski L. Suzuki T. Omori A. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Spremulli L.L. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19913-19920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), mammalian mt SerRS seems to take a homodimeric form, as is the case with prokaryotic SerRS (9Biou V. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1404-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 27Oakley M.G. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2544-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Cusack S. Berthet-Colominas C. Hartlein M. Nassar N. Leberman R.

Legrand J.-F. Lehmann M. Cusack S. Science. 1994; 263: 1432-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To establish whether the recombinant mt SerRS could specifically recognize the two mt tRNAsSer, the serylation activity kinetic parameters were determined using the native mt tRNAGCUSer and tRNAUGASer as substrates. As shown in Table I, the parameters of the recombinant mt SerRS were almost identical to those of the native mt SerRS. A gel retardation assay was performed to ascertain the complex formation of mt SerRS with each isoacceptor. The assay showed that mt SerRS specifically formed binary complexes with the two serine isoacceptors, whereas no complex was formed with non-cognate mt tRNAUAALeu (Fig. 2 A). The dissociation constant (Kd) for each tRNA substrate was determined by means of Scatchard plots (Fig. 2 B). The largerKd value of tRNAGCUSer (1 μm) is indicative of a lower affinity toward mt SerRS. The difference in the dissociation constants seems to reflect the differentK m values of the two substrates (Table I). In addition, it appears that the x-intercept of each Scatchard plot approaches 1.8, suggesting that the two tRNAsSer bind into one dimeric form of mt SerRS, although further structural analysis is necessary to clarify the stoichiometry of the mt SerRS-tRNASer complex.Table IKinetic parameters in aminoacylation of bovine mitochondrial serine tRNAsEnzymeSubstrateK mk catk cat/K mμm1/s1/(μm × s)Wild-typetRNAGCUSer0.37 ± 0.100.35 ± 0.100.95tRNAUGASer0.22 ± 0.030.63 ± 0.062.86RecombinanttRNAGCUSer0.35 ± 0.080.64 ± 0.111.84tRNAUGASer0.29 ± 0.080.67 ± 0.172.31Experimental conditions for aminoacylation are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Experimental conditions for aminoacylation are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because the foregoing observations strongly suggested that the recombinant mt SerRS retained the original characteristics of the native enzyme, the subsequent experiments were performed with this recombinant enzyme. tRNA footprinting was carried out with ethylnitrosourea for both mt tRNAsSer in the presence of mt SerRS, which strongly protected mt tRNAGCUSer against alkylation by ethylnitrosourea at two specific regions, i.e.phosphate positions 57–58 and 64–67 (Fig. 3 A). mt tRNAUGASer was also protected at similar phosphate positions (55–59 and 65–67). No protection was observed in the presence of human mt leucyl-tRNA synthetase (mt LeuRS), which was used as a negative control for each mt tRNA (lanes 5 and6 in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively). Moreover, no strong protection was found in the 5′ region of mt tRNAsSer (data not shown). These results indicate that the probable contact sites on both tRNAs are on the TΨC loop and at the bottom of the acceptor stem. As shown in Fig. 3 C, mammalian mt SerRS contacts both tRNAs at similar positions though they have different topologies. The crystal structure of T. thermophilus SerRS reveals that Arg195 contacts positions 66–67 in the acceptor helix of tRNASer, which is the same location as one of the mt SerRS contact sites. Because Arg195 is conserved in mammalian mt SerRS (18Yokogawa T. Shimada N. Takeuchi N. Benkowski L. Suzuki T. Omori A. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Spremulli L.L. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19913-19920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it can be speculated that the contact site at phosphate positions 64–67 may not be required for specific recognition but would be involved in the essential interaction needed to arrange the CCA terminus at the catalytic center of the enzyme. Although tRNA footprinting clearly demonstrated that mammalian mt SerRS contacts both isoacceptors similarly on the TΨC loop and at the junction between the TΨC and acceptor stems, it was still unclear how mt SerRS specifically recognizes two tRNAs having no common structure or sequence and identifies them among the 22 mt tRNAs. To clarify the unique recognition mechanism of mt SerRS, the identity elements of the respective isoacceptors needed to be determined. To examine the recognition elements of mt tRNAUGASer, we constructed several variants carrying a mutation(s), mainly at bases in the TΨC loop, which is one of the mt SerRS contact sites and is predicted to be involved in tertiary interactions according to a previously proposed model (31Watanabe Y.

The mutational variations are shown in Fig. 4 A, and the kinetic parameters are summarized in Table II. To achieve efficient transcription by T7 RNA polymerase, the two terminal base pairs, 1–72 and 2–71, were replaced with G·C pairs. The transcribed tRNAUGASer with the canonical sequence was shown to have a K m value 4 times higher than that of the native tRNA from bovine liver. According to Hayashiet al. (32Hayashi I. Kawai G. Watanabe K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), replacement of the two terminal base pairs should have no effect on serylation activity, in which case the relatively high K m value is apparently attributable to the lack of modified bases.Table IIKinetic parameters for bovine mitochondrial tRNAUGASertranscriptsSubstrateK mk catk cat/K mk cat/K mPosition of mutationμm1/s1/(μm × s)relativeNative tRNAUGASer0.290.672.3111Transcripts tRNAUGASer1.20.250.211.0 tRNAUGASerA15U0.950.130.140.67A15-U59 tertiary interaction tRNAUGASerU59A1.10.130.120.57 tRNAUGASerA15U,U59A1.30.160.120.57 tRNAUGASerG18U0.740.0240.0320.15G18-U55 tertiary interaction tRNAUGASerU55G1.30.110.0800.38 tRNAUGASerG18U,U55G1.30.130.100.48 tRNAUGASerG19C5.90.0220.00370.018G19-C56 tertiary interaction tRNAUGASerC56G6.00.0170.00280.013 tRNAUGASerG19C,C56G0.790.150.190.90 tRNAUGASerU54A4.20.00990.00240.011U54-A58 tertiary interaction tRNAUGASerA58U3.00.0440.0150.071 tRNAUGASerU54A,A58U4.90.0590.0120.057 tRNAUGASerC56U,U59C1.10.00120.00110.0052TΨC loop of tRNATyr tRNAUGASerC56A2.50.00850.00340.016TΨC loop of tRNAGlu tRNAUGASerU34G,G35U,A36C1.00.220.221.0Anticodon tRNAUGASerA73G0.300.592.09.5Discriminator tRNAUGASer G46.1insertion0.230.0470.200.95(7472 mitochondrial disease) tRNAUGASer (cloverleaf type)2.90.210.0730.35 tRNAUGASer (D arm → tRNAGCUSer)2.10.00170.000820.0039 tRNAUGASer (TΨC loop → tRNAGCUSer)0.840.520.633.0 tRNAUGASer (D arm, TΨC loop → tRNAGCUSer)0.840.250.301.4 tRNAUGASer(minihelix)ND2-aND, no activity was detected.NDNDND2-a ND, no activity was detected. Open table in a new tab We first examined the variants with mutations in the anticodon at positions 34–36 and at the discriminator base (position 73), which are recognition elements in most tRNAs. Replacement of the anticodon sequence or the discriminator base caused no significant reduction in serylation activity. As it was revealed that the A73G mutation could be recognized more efficiently by the enzyme, mt SerRS apparently prefers G73 as the discriminator base, which is in agreement with a previous observation that a G73A mutation in tRNAGCUSer caused an ∼3-fold reduction in activity (33Ueda T. Yotsumoto Y. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2217-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It can thus be postulated that tRNAUGASer possesses the less efficient A73 as a discriminator base to balance the serine-accepting activities of the two isoacceptors in vivo (Table I). Next, to evaluate the effects of tertiary interactions in mt tRNAUGASer on serylation activity, point mutations were introduced at bases involved in four possible interactions (31Watanabe Y. Kawai G. Yokogawa T. Hayashi N. Kumazawa Y. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Hirao I. Miura K. Watanabe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5378-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar): A15·U59, G18·U55, G19·C56, and U54·A58 (Fig. 4 A). The A15·U59 interaction was shown not to be involved in the activity because the individual mutations A15U and U59A as well as the double mutation A15U,U59A all had relatively little effect in reducing the serylation activity (Table II). The variants G18U and U55G had k cat/K m values that were respectively reduced to 15 and 38% that of the wild type, which probably resulted from destabilization of D loop-TΨC loop interaction induced by the mutations. Severely reduced serylation activity was induced by the mutations G19C and C56G, the relativek cat/K m values being 2 orders of magnitude lower (Table II). However, the variant carrying both mutations (G19C and C56G) completely recovered its activity, suggesting that the Watson-Crick base pair G19·C56 supporting D loop-TΨC loop interaction is indispensable for recognition. U54·A58 interaction in the TΨC loop was also revealed to be a strong recognition element for serylation. The U54A and A58U mutants exhibited significantly reduced serylation activity. Unlike the case of the G19·C56 tertiary base pair, no restoration in the activity was observed in the double mutant U54A,A58U, indicating that mt SerRS probably recognizes the U54·A58 interaction not only structurally but also sequence-specifi"

Here, we have analyzed the effect of polyamine deprivation on the structure and polyamine affinity of the heparan sulfate chains in various glypican-1 glycoforms synthesized by a transformed cell line (ECV 304). Heparan sulfate chains of glypican-1 were either cleaved with heparanase at sites embracing the highly modified regions or with nitrite atN-unsubstituted glucosamine residues. The products were separated and further degraded by heparin lyase to identify sulfated iduronic acid. Polyamine affinity was assessed by chromatography on agarose substituted with the polyamine spermine. In heparan sulfate made by cells with undisturbed endogenous polyamine synthesis, free amino groups were restricted to the unmodified, unsulfated segments, especially near the core protein. Spermine high affinity binding sites were located to the modified and highly sulfated segments that were released by heparanase. In cells with up-regulated polyamine uptake, heparan sulfate contained an increased number of clusteredN-unsubstituted glucosamines and sulfated iduronic acid residues. This resulted in a greater number of NO/nitrite-sensitive cleavage sites near the potential spermine-binding sites. Endogenous degradation by heparanase and NO-derived nitrite in polyamine-deprived cells generated a separate pool of heparan sulfate oligosaccharides with an exceptionally high affinity for spermine. Spermine uptake in polyamine-deprived cells was reduced when NO/nitrite-generated degradation of heparan sulfate was inhibited. The results suggest a functional interplay between glypican recycling, NO/nitrite-generated heparan sulfate degradation, and polyamine uptake.

Glypican constitutes a family of cell surface-bound PGs where the protein is covalently connected at the C terminus to membrane lipids via a so-called glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The central part of the protein consists of a cysteine-rich globular domain that contains information that ensures a high level of heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan substitution at three sites located close to the C terminus (1Chen R.L. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7507-7517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). So far six different human glypicans with the same overall design have been molecularly cloned (for review, see Ref.2Bernfield M. Götte M. Park P.-W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of the HS glycan chains proceeds in a stepwise manner. Serine residues in sequences like DDGSGSGSD (glypican-1) are first substituted with xylose and then the common glycosaminoglycan-to-protein linkage region GlcUA-Gal-Gal-xylose is formed. HS assembly is initiated by a unique α-GlcNAc-transferase that adds the first GlcNAc (3Fritz T.A. Gabb M.M. Wei G. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28809-28814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By the alternating addition of GlcUA and GlcNAc, catalyzed by HS-copolymerases (4Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), the extended, linear heparan backbone is formed. A unique step in HS biosynthesis is the regional exchange of N-acetyl for sulfate on glucosamine (4Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) catalyzed by various isoforms ofN-deacetylase/sulfotransferase (NDST). NDST-1, -2, and -4 have an ND/ST ratio well below 1, whereas NDST-3 has a 10-fold higher deacetylase activity (5Aikawa J.-i. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, expression and participation of this isoform during HS biosynthesis would yield a significant proportion of N-unsubstituted glucosamine (GlcNH3+). Free amino groups could also be generated by N-desulfation catalyzed by sulfamidases. After the formation of N-sulfate (-NSO3) groups, further modifications of the HS chain take place, including epimerization of GlcUA to iduronic acid (IdoUA) andO-sulfations at various positions, yielding a characteristic pattern of alternating unmodified and highly modified segments separated by transition regions. A hypothetical HS sequence is shown in Scheme FS1, and the overall structural pattern is depicted in SchemeFS2 A, top.Figure FS2Flow chart of the strategy for analyzing HS structure and spermine affinity. ECV cells not treated or treated with DFMO to deplete endogenous polyamine pools were used in all cases (A–C). In A, large size glypican-1 precursor was isolated from cells that were also exposed to BFA, and in B, smaller-size glypican-1 and HS oligosaccharides obtained from cells not treated with BFA were separately isolated. In C, selected fractions were examined for spermine affinity. As shown underA, HS chains consist of a backbone (GlcUA-GlcNAc,solid line) that is modified by exchange ofN-acetyl for N-sulfate by epimerization of GlcUA to IdoUA and by various O-sulfations (boxes) either extensively (filled boxes) or partially (open boxes). Possible positions for GlcNH3+ (+) and sulfated IdoUA (S) are indicated. Previous studies indicated clustering of GlcNH3+ to regions near the core protein attachment (Ser) and clustering of sulfated IdoUA to the highly modified domains (8Ding K. Jönsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Heparanase cleavage sites are located at the reducing (filled arrow) or nonreducing side (open arrow) of highly modified regions (20Bame K.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The glypican preparations were either treated with alkali to release HS chains or directly with heparanase (see II andIII) to generate HS fragments and core protein with remaining HS stubs. Intact, alkali-released HS chains were exposed to HNO2 at pH 3.9 to identify the location of GlcNH3+ residues. Fragments obtained were separated and digested with heparin (Hep) lyase to identify sulfated HexUA and by HS lyase to cleave the unmodified backbone. Alternatively, HS chains were directly cleaved by HS lyase to liberate the modified sections and those containing GlcNH3+. These products were also separated and subsequently treated with either HNO2 at pH 3.9 or heparin lyase. Cleavage of HS in intact glypican by heparanase yields both long and short fragments (II and III, respectively). The former pool includes stubs attached to the core protein via Ser. The core protein has a C-terminal, hydrophobic glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor (filled circlewith two rods). The latter property was used to separate the degradation products, and HS stubs were released from the core protein by alkali treatment. Heparanase-released HS fragments (from II and III) were further degraded by heparin lyase or HNO2 at pH 3.9.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously studied the nature of recycling glypican glycoforms in fibroblasts and ECV 304 cells (for review, see Ref. 6Fransson L.-Å. Belting M. Jönsson M. Mani K. Moses J. Oldberg Å. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the latter cells, a brefeldin A (BFA)-arrested, large size glypican-1 glycoform with long HS chains containing multiple GlcNH3+ residues is degraded by heparanase during a chase, generating HS oligosaccharides and a glypican-1 glycoform with truncated HS chains (7Mani K. Jönsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This glycoform can serve as a precursor for the reformation of a PG with full size HS chains. Re-synthesis of HS on the stubs is prevented by nitrite deprivation and restored when an NO donor is supplied (7Mani K. Jönsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have proposed that heparanase degradation proceeds until the GlcNH3+ residues are near the nonreducing end of the stubs, then NO-derived nitrite cleaves at these residues, providing fresh acceptor sites. More recent studies have shown that the GlcNH3+ residues are indeed concentrated to sites near the reducing side of heparanase cleavage sites in the transition region between unmodified and modified chain segments near the core protein (Ref. 8Ding K. Jönsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar; see also SchemeFS2 A, top). Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are essential for growth and differentiation of all cells, and they bind electrostatically to polyanions like nucleic acids. The intracellular polyamine levels are tightly regulated by synthesis, degradation, and transport (for review, see Ref. 9Cohen S.S. A Guide to the Polyamines. Oxford University Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Inhibition of endogenous synthesis,e.g. by inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase with α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) results in increased polyamine uptake from the environment. The partly disappointing results with DFMO in anti-cancer trials may be explained by compensatory retrieval of extracellular polyamines by tumor cells (9Cohen S.S. A Guide to the Polyamines. Oxford University Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Inhibition of both polyamine synthesis and uptake could therefore be a useful anticancer strategy. However, the nature of a polyamine transport system in mammalian cells still remains elusive. Studies from this laboratory show that HS binds the polyamine spermine with an affinity that is 10 times greater than that of DNA (10Belting M. Havsmark B. Jönsson M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have also obtained direct evidence for an involvement of HSPG in the uptake of polyamines by cultured fibroblasts (11Belting M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Removal of cell surface HS or inhibition of PG synthesis or sulfation reduces spermine uptake. Upon depletion of the intracellular polyamine pool, cells respond by synthesizing increased amounts of HSPG forms that have higher spermine affinity. Mutant CHO cells deficient in PG synthesis have a reduced polyamine uptake and fail to proliferate and form colonies in the presence of the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor despite the presence of exogenous spermine. Transfection with cDNA for the missing enzyme restores polyamine uptake. 2M. Belting, L.-Å. Fransson, and J. D. Esko, unpublished observations. 2M. Belting, L.-Å. Fransson, and J. D. Esko, unpublished observations. It is thus conceivable that the HS chains of recycling glypi-an could carry polyamines into cells when endogenous synthesis is inhibited by DFMO. After degradation of the HS chains, polyamines bound to HS oligosaccharides would be separated from the recycling truncated PG. To explore whether polyamine deprivation induces changes in HS structure and function that would facilitate polyamine uptake, we have made a comparative study of glypican HS from ECV 304 cells with undisturbed polyamine synthesis and from cells treated with DFMO. The PG and its HS chains were examined for spermine affinity as well as for content and location of sulfated hexuronic acids (HexUA) and heparanase and nitrite cleavage sites. We provide evidence that polyamine deprivation induces structural changes that favor increased formation of HS oligosaccharides with higher spermine affinity and that inhibition of HS degradation reduces spermine uptake. Cells, culture media, sera, antiserum to glypican-1, BFA, α-DFMO, radioactive precursors, enzymes, prepacked columns, a spermine-substituted HiTrap column, Centriplus tubes, and other media or chemicals were obtained from sources listed previously (7Mani K.

Enzymatic digestions of HS were performed with HS or heparin lyase and deaminative cleavage at GlcNH3+ with HNO2 at pH 3.9 as previously described (7Mani K. Jönsson M. Edgren G. Belting M.

Radioactivity measurements, buffer changes, concentrations, and recovery procedures as well as carriers were the same as described previously (7Mani K. Jönsson M. Edgren G. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å.

The rate of uptake of different concentrations of [14C]spermine was measured as described (11Belting M. Persson S. Fransson L.-Å. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A flow chart for the structural analysis of glypican-1 HS is shown in Scheme FS2. We first examined HS chains of large (A) and small (B) glypican-1 glycoforms as well as HS oligosaccharides from ECV cells with undisturbed polyamine synthesis and then corresponding HS material from ECV cells that were treated with DFMO to up-regulate polyamine import. HS chains and oligosaccharides were analyzed for the content and location of GlcNH3+ residues, sulfated IdoUA, and heparanase cleavage sites in relation to the unmodified and modified regions and for high affinity spermine-binding sites (C). Finally, we explored whether inhibition of HS degradation could affect polyamine uptake. HS chains from the [3H]glucosamine- and [35S]sulfate-labeled large size glypican PG of BFA-treated ECV cells were cleaved with nitrite at pH 3.9 at GlcNH3+ residues (Scheme FS1, site 4), and the various products (Scheme FS2) were separated by chromatography on Superdex peptide (Fig. 1 A). As expected, most of the fragments were large and appeared in the excluded volume (8Ding K. Jönsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The presence of clustered GlcNH3+ residues would yield small fragments (Scheme FS2 A). The results showed that no disaccharides were generated, indicating that consecutive GlcNH3+-containing repeats were very rare or nonexisting. The tetra- and hexasaccharide pools (see4 and 6 in Fig. 1 A) derived from the sequences GlcNH3+-(HexUA-GlcNR)1–2-HexUA-GlcNH3+,i.e. sites with clustered residues, were treated with heparin lyase to identify GlcNSO3-HexUA(2-OSO3) bonds (see Scheme FS1, site 3) and with HS lyase to cleave at unmodified repeats, i.e. principally GlcNR-GlcUA bonds (see Scheme FS1, site 1). The hexasaccharide was resistant to heparin lyase (Fig. 1 B) but partially degraded by HS lyase to both di- and tetrasaccharide (2 and 4 in Fig. 1 C), indicating that GlcUA-GlcNR repeats could be present (13Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Sugahara K. Tohno-Oka R. Yamada S. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The resistant hexasaccharides (6 in Fig. 1 C) may contain IdoUA-GlcNR repeats. Similar results were obtained with the tetrasaccharide (Fig. 1, D andE). Also, because some tetrasaccharides were resistant to both treatments (4Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) in Fig. 1, D and E), a sequence, GlcNH3+-HexUA-GlcNSO3-IdoUA-GlcNH3+, may be present in small amounts in the HS chains. Because heparin lyase may not cleave at IdoUA(2-OSO3) in small fragments (15Yamada S. Murakami T. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8696-8705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Ernst S. Rhomberg A.J. Biemann K. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), large HS lyase-resistant fragments were also examined for free amino groups and heparin lyase-sensitive sites. HS chains from the [3H]glucosamine- and [35S]sulfate-labeled glypican PG of BFA-treated cells were directly treated with HS lyase (Scheme FS2 A). Highly modified regions and repeats containing GlcNH3+ were expected to be spared. The HS lyase degradation products were separated on Superdex peptide into oligosaccharides ranging from di- to decasaccharides or even larger (Fig. 1 F). The disaccharides (2 in Fig. 1 F), which are the major products, emanate from the extended unmodified stretches of the HS backbone (Scheme FS2 A). Each oligosaccharide pool was treated with heparin lyase to identify GlcNSO3-HexUA(2-OSO3) bonds or with nitrite to identify GlcNH3+-HexUA bonds. The decasaccharides (10 in Fig. 1 F) were partly degraded by heparin lyase to sulfate-enriched smaller saccharides (2–8 in Fig. 1 G), indicating the presence of heparin-type repeats. Very little if any GlcNH3+-containing repeats were detected (Fig. 1 H). Thus, highly modified regions contain few if any GlcNH3+ residues (see SchemeFS2 A, top). The tetrasaccharides (4 in Fig. 1 F), derived from the sequence GlcNR-GlcUA-GlcNR-HexUA-GlcNR-GlcUA, were insensitive to heparin lyase (Fig. 1 I) but sensitive to nitrous acid at pH 3.9, indicating the presence of GlcNH3+residues (see 2 in Fig. 1 J). Hence, the saccharide (HexUA-GlcNH3+-HexUA-GlcNR, where HexUA probably is GlcUA, may be derived from stretches of the unmodified backbone containing a solitary GlcNH3+ residue (see SchemeFS2 A, top). The octasaccharide (8 in Fig. 1 F) had the same reaction patterns as the decasaccharide, and the hexasaccharide (6 in Fig. 1 F) resembled the tetrasaccharide (data not shown). Heparanase is expected to cleave HS at certain glucuronidic linkages (Scheme FS1, site 2; see also Ref. 19Sandbäck-Pikas D. Li J.-P. Vlodavsky I. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18770-18777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) located on either side of the highly modified regions (SchemeFS2 A, for review, see Ref. 20Bame K.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, CHO cell-derived heparanase may not require the 2-O-sulfate group on the HexUA (20Bame K.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, the site closest to the core protein (SchemeFS2 A) may not always be cleaved (8Ding K. Jönsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because the unmodified stretches generally are longer than the more modified ones, two types of fragments should be obtained (Scheme FS2 A, bottom half), i.e. longer ones (pool II), comprising the unmodified and less modified stretches and including the stubs still attached to the core protein as well as shorter ones (pool III) carrying the highly modified regions. Previous studies show (8Ding K. Jönsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that ECV cells express a surface-located, suramin-inhibited heparanase that degrades exogenously supplied, mature glypican PG into the above-mentioned products. Because we subsequently found that many CHO cell lines express more potent heparanase activity, these cells were used in most of the following experiments. To obtain sufficient amounts of material for further analysis, several batches of glypican PG were repeatedly incubated with the CHO cells, and the products were recovered and separated on Superose 6. One such example is shown in Fig. 2. [35S]Sulfate-labeled glypican PG obtained from BFA-treated ECV cells and purified via both gel-permeation and ion exchange chromatography (8Ding K. Jönsson M. Mani K. Sandgren S. Belting M. Fransson L.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3885-3894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was incubated with heparanase-containing CHO-K1 cells, and the products were separated by gel permeation chromatography (Fig. 2 A). Pool I consisted of undegraded and partially degraded PG. Pool II, which should consist of long HS-chain fragments and glypican core protein with truncated HS chains (see Scheme FS2 A, pool II), was passed over octyl-Sepharose. The unbound, alkali-resistant (data not shown) free HS-chain fragments were rechromatographed both before (Fig. 2 B) and after treatment with nitrite at pH 3.9 (Fig. 2 C). The results indicated the presence of internally located nitrite-sensitive sites in these fragments. Hence, the less modified stretches contain solitary GlcNH3+ residues (see SchemeFS2 A, pool II). The position of the GlcNH3+ residues relative to heparin-type repeats in this and other heparanase-released fragments was assessed in the experiments shown below. Because heparanase cleaves a glucuronidic bond, subsequent cleavage of a glucosaminidic bond by nitrous acid or heparin lyase would yield odd-numbered saccharide fragments (see Scheme FS1 if sites 2 and 4 were cleaved). To assess whether we could distinguish between odd- and even-numbered saccharides, HS-lyase digests of [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate-labeled HS chains, comprising a series of even-numbered saccharides, were chromatographed on Superdex peptide either directly (Fig. 3 A) or after subsequent removal of nonreducing terminal ΔHexUA residues to obtain odd-numbered saccharides (Fig. 3 B). The results showed that it might be possible to distinguish between these saccharide series, at least when they appear separately. The l"

One factor that has been previously shown to mediate hAR transactivation is the proto-oncoprotein c-Jun. The positive effect is a primary one, can be exerted by both endogenous and exogenous c-Jun, and requires multiple regions of c-Jun. However, the exact mechanism by which c-Jun exerts its enhancing function is unknown. In this study, we have used a mammalian two-hybrid system to ask if c-Jun influences the ligand-dependent amino- to carboxyl-terminal (N-to-C) interaction of hAR, which is thought to be responsible for the homodimerization of this receptor. Our results show that c-Jun enhances both hAR N-to-C terminal interaction and DNA binding in vitro. We have also tested a panel of c-Jun and c-Fos mutants for their activities on the N-to-C interaction, and the data demonstrate that the activities of these mutants parallel their activities on hAR transactivation. A mutation in the hAR activation function-2 (AF-2) abrogates N-to-C interaction, DNA binding, and transactivation, and these activities are not rescued by exogenous c-Jun. Interestingly, the p160 coactivator TIF2 can stimulate hAR N-to-C interaction, a finding consistent with the effect on hAR transactivation. These data strongly suggest that the hAR N-to-C interaction is the target of c-Jun action, and this activity requires a functional receptor AF-2.

Upon binding lipophilic ligands, nuclear receptors are activated to turn on (and sometimes turn off) the transcription of specific responsive genes, thereby regulating gene expression. In this way, these small hydrophobic ligands, which include steroid and thyroid hormones and vitamins A and D, exert their effects on many biological processes, including development, differentiation, and homeostasis. The receptors that mediate these effects include the retinoic acid receptor (RAR1), retinoid X receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, vitamin D receptor, the subfamily of steroid receptors (including the glucocorticoid receptor, progesterone receptor, androgen receptor (AR), and estrogen receptors), and numerous “orphan” receptors, ligands for which remain unidentified (6Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). AR is the nuclear receptor that mediates the biological actions of androgens. Androgens are found in two physiologically active forms, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and are involved in male sexual differentiation and development (7Wilson J.D. Griffin J.E. George F.W. Leshin M. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1981; 37: 1-39PubMed Google Scholar, 8Keller E.T. Ershler W.B. Chang C. Front. Biosci. 1996; 1: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Chang C. Kokontis J. Liao S. Science. 1988; 240: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). As a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, AR consists of multiple functionally distinct domains, including domains involved in DNA or ligand binding, dimerization, and transcriptional activation specifically found in activation functions-1 (AF-1) and -2 (AF-2) (10Kemppainen J.A. Lane M.V. Sar M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 968-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps unique among the nuclear receptors, AR and other steroid receptors require ligand binding for homodimerization, which itself is necessary for subsequent DNA binding and transcriptional activation (reviewed in Ref. 1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). This sequential order of events is responsible for androgen signaling within a cell, and disruption of any one step interferes with the signaling pathway. AR homodimerization has been reported by several laboratories to result from an intra- or inter-molecular interaction between the amino and carboxyl termini of the receptor (11Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12Langley E. Zhou Z.X. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1052-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This interaction was demonstrated using a mammalian two-hybrid system and provided evidence to Langley et al. (12Langley E. Zhou Z.X. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) suggesting that AR binds to DNA as an anti-parallel dimer. Subsequent studies further characterized the amino- to carboxyl-terminal (N-to-C) interaction and showed that naturally occurring mutations in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) found in androgen insensitivity syndromes do not affect ligand binding but disrupt the N-to-C interaction (11Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the N-to-C interaction may also facilitate ligand retention by the AR (14Zhou Z.X. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 605-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the AR amino and carboxyl termini has identified amino acids 3–36 and the activation function-2 (AF-2) core as being required for the N-to-C interaction (13Doesburg P.

Further dissection of AR regions involved in the N-to-C interaction has led to the identification of two sequences similar to but distinct from LXXLL core sequence that are known to directly interact with the nuclear receptor AF-2. These AR sequences are FQNLF (amino acids 23–27) and WHTLF (amino acids 433–437), which were shown to bind to the receptor's AF-2 and a region outside AF-2, respectively (16He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The AR AF-2 is not only the target of these amino-terminal regions but also provides a site of interaction for LXXLL-containing coactivators, including CREB-binding protein (CBP) (17Fronsdal K.

Shemshedini L. Endocrine. 2000; 13: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Indeed, the AR amino acids 503–555, which harbor an autonomous transactivation function, are both necessary and sufficient for the c-Jun-positive response (23Bubulya A. Zhou X.-F. Shen X.-Q. Fisher C.J. Shemshedini L. Endocrine. 2000; 13: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Earlier studies on the c-Jun enhancement of AR transactivation had shown that (i) the activity is independent of promoter- or cell-specific factors (24Bubulya A. Wise S.C. Shen X.-Q. Burmeister L.A.

Bubulya A. Shemshedini L. Endocrine. 1998; 9: 193-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All these results suggest an important and general effect by c-Jun on hAR-dependent transcription. To determine the mechanism of action of c-Jun on AR, we initiated the studies presented here. These studies demonstrate that c-Jun, like CBP and p160 coactivators, can mediate the ligand-dependent N-to-C interaction of AR. Furthermore, c-Jun can enhance AR DNA binding, an important finding because AR dimerization is necessary for sequence-specific DNA binding. The specificity of this effect on AR N-to-C interaction was confirmed by utilizing a series of c-Jun and c-Fos mutants. This positive activity of c-Jun in both AR dimerization and DNA binding required a functional AF-2, demonstrating that the AR AF-2 is essential for the activity of c-Jun and p160 coactivators, because it is required for the N-to-C interaction. Human forms of AR and c-Jun were all expressed from the mammalian expression plasmid pSG5 (28Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E.

To generate hAR(Δ504–555), complementary oligos 5′-CCTAAGACCTGCCTGATCTGTGGAGATGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCATCTCCACAGATCAGGCAGGTCTTAGGGTAC-3′ were annealed, creating a 5′-KpnI site and a 3′-HindIII site. This annealed fragment was inserted into hAR, which was digested with the same two enzymes. To make hAR(Δ358–555), hAR amino acids were PCR-amplified using the upstream oligo 5′-GATCGAGCTCCGGGACACTT-3′ and the downstream oligo 5′-GATCAGATCTAAGCTTCATCTCCACAGATCAGGCAGGTCTTGTCGCGACTCTGGTACGCAGC-3′. This PCR fragment was digested with SacI andBglII and inserted into hAR(AB)/pTL1, which was digested with the same enzymes. This new construct was subsequently digested with BamHI and HindIII and inserted into hARI, digested with the same enzymes. hAR(AB)/pTL1 was constructed by digesting hAR with BamHI and XhoI and inserting the restriction fragment into pTL1, digested with the same enzymes. To generate hAR(Δ804–918), hAR was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into the BglII andEcoRI sites of pTL2. To generate hAR(Δ504–555/Δ804–918), hAR(Δ504–555) was digested withBamHI and EcoRI and inserted into theBglII and EcoRI sites of pTL2. To generate hAR(Δ358–555/Δ804–918), hAR(Δ358–555) was digested withBamHI and EcoRI and inserted into theBglII and EcoRI sites of pTL2. To make hAR(E896P), hAR amino acids 556–918 were PCR-amplified using the upstream oligo 5′-GATCGAATTCATGAAGACCTGCCTGATCTGT-3′ and the downstream oligo 5′-GATCAGATCTCTCGAGTCACTGGGTGTGGAAATAGATGGGCTTGACTTTCCCAGAAAGGATCTTGGGCACTTGCACAGAGATGATGGGTGCCATCATTTC-3′. This PCR fragment, containing the mutated codon that is underlined, was digested with HindIII and BglII and inserted into hAR, which was digested with the same enzymes, and replaced the wild-type region (amino acids 556–918) in hAR with one that was mutated. To make GAL-hAR(DE), the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) was first PCR-amplified using the upstream oligo 5′-GATCGAATTCGATATCTAGAAGCTTCTATGAAGCTACTGTCT-3′ and the downstream oligo 5′-GATCAGATCTATTCAGTCAGGGCCCGAGCTCGGATCCGGT-3′ and inserted into pTL1, a derivative of pSG5, to make the plasmid pG4AB. Then, the hAR DE region was PCR-amplified using the upstream oligo 5′-GATCGGTACCCTCGAGTCTAGAACTCTGGGAGCCCGGAAG-3′ and the downstream oligo 5′-GATCGGATCCTCACTGGGTGTGGAAATA-3′ and inserted into pG4AB, yielding GAL-hAR(DE). GAL-hAR(DE/E896P) was in made the same way as GAL-hAR(DE), except that the template for PCR was hAR(E896P) instead of wild-type hAR. VP16-hAR(AB) was constructed by digesting the AB region out of hAR with EcoRI and XhoI and inserting into theEcoRI and SalI sites of pCMX-VP16-N (29Dhordain P. Albagli O. Lin R.J. Ansieau S. Quief S.

All of the above clones generated by PCR have been verified by DNA sequencing (available upon request). The reporter plasmids have the gene for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) driven by the MMTV or 17M-tk promoters. The AR-inducible reporter plasmid MMTV-CAT and the GAL4-inducible reporter 17M-tk-CAT have been previously described (25Shemshedini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1992; 10: 3839-3849Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was standardized by measuring the β-galactosidase activity, originating from the cotransfected plasmid pCH110. COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma Chemical Co.) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories). Cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (30Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Quirin-Stricker C. Bocquel M.T. Meyer M.E. Krozowski Z. Jeltsch J.M. Lerouge T. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). hAR was activated by the addition of 100 nm DHT. CAT assays were performed and standardized according to the measured β-galactosidase activity as previously described (30Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Quirin-Stricker C. Bocquel M.T. Meyer M.E. Krozowski Z. Jeltsch J.M. Lerouge T. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For all transfections, we used different amounts of expression plasmid, 1 μg of reporter plasmid (either MMTV-CAT or 17M-tk-CAT), 2 μg of pCH110, and enough pTL1 to bring the final plasmid amount to 15 μg per dish. CAT assay results were quantified by densitometric scanning (420 oe scanner, PDI, Inc.) of autoradiograms of at least three repeats for each transfection, and, thus, each value represents the average of three to four repetitions plus the standard deviation. To prepare cell extracts for Western blot analysis, transfected COS cells were boiled for 5–10 min in SDS sample buffer (63 mm Tris, pH 6.8; 20% glycerol; 2% SDS; 5% β-mercaptoethanol). The amount of extract used was standardized according to β-galactosidase activity. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose. After blocking with nonfat dry milk, the nitrocellulose blots were probed with either the anti-AR antibody PA1–111A (Affinity Bioreagents) or anti-c-Jun antibody KM-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. COS cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were treated with 100 nm DHT 24 h prior to harvesting. Cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and spun at 5000 rpm for 5 min. 10% of the cells was used to do a β-galactosidase assay for quantification of transfection efficiency. The remainder of the cells was resuspended in buffer I (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mm NaCl; 5 mm MgCl2) and incubated at 4 °C for 5 min. Sucrose (0.3 m) was then added, and cells were lysed with a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifuging lysed cells at 2500 rpm (600 × g) for 10 min. The nuclear pellet was washed once with buffer II (buffer I containing 0.3 msucrose). Then, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in buffer III (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8; 150 mm NaCl; 5 mm EDTA; 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors and incubated with shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysed nuclei were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant, constituting the nuclear extract, was saved. Gel mobility shift assays were performed with nuclear extracts containing the same amount of β-galactosidase activity. These reactions were performed in a final volume of 20 μl in DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8; 0.1 mm EDTA; 4 mm dithiothreitol), which also containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 100 mm KCl, and 150,000 cpm of32P-labeled probe (5′-GATCCAAAGTCAGAACACAGTGTTCTGATCAAAGA-3′), an androgen-response element. After the addition of an equal number of β-galactosidase units of nuclear extract, the reactions were gently vortexed and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. The samples were run on a 6% polyacrylamide gel for 1.5 h at room temperature, after which the gel was dried and exposed to autoradiography. To do antibody supershifts, 1 μl of either the anti-hAR antibody PA1–111A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the anti-Birch profilin antibody 4A6 (a kind gift of Martin Rothkegel) were added prior to addition of probe. As a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, hAR is a modular protein, consisting of an amino-terminal AB region, which contains AF-1, and a carboxyl-terminal E region, which harbors both the LBD and AF-2 (Fig.1). The AF-1 has been further divided into the functions AF-1a (amino acids 169–182) and AF-1b (amino acids 293–357) (31Jenster G. van der Korput H.A.G.M. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7341-7346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the hAR AB region and, specifically, amino acids 503–555 within this region are essential and sufficient for c-Jun enhancement of GAL-hAR(AB) transcriptional activity (23Bubulya A. Zhou X.-F. Shen X.-Q. Fisher C.J. Shemshedini L. Endocrine. 2000; 13: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To study the importance of these amino acids in the full-length receptor, hAR proteins lacking different parts of the AB region were generated and studied in transient transfection experiments in COS cells using the androgen-responsive reporter MMTV-CAT and the internal control pCH110 (24Bubulya A. Wise S.C. Shen X.-Q. Burmeister L.A. Shemshedini L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24583-24589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). When hAR(Δ504–555) was compared with wild-type hAR, the two proteins exhibited the same transcriptional activity. Surprisingly, the mutant protein also responded to cotransfected c-Jun as strongly as the wild-type counterpart, clearly demonstrating that, in the context of full-length protein, amino acids 504–555 are dispensable for c-Jun enhancement of hAR transactivation (Fig. 1 A). A larger deletion of the AB region, encompassing amino acids 358–555, which eliminates part of the AF-1b, greatly compromised hAR transcriptional activity, demonstrating the importance of the AF-1 (Fig. 1 A). However, this mutated hAR, hAR(Δ358–555), responded strongly to transfected c-Jun, further arguing that the carboxyl terminus of the hAR AB region is not required for c-Jun activity (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, truncation of amino acids 804–918 completely blocked hAR transactivation in either the absence or presence of c-Jun, suggesting that the carboxyl terminus of the full-length hAR is required for c-Jun activity (Fig.1 A). Note that the absence of activity in hAR(Δ804–918) is not due to the absence of protein expression (Fig. 1 B). Together, these data show that c-Jun requires the carboxyl terminus of the full-length hAR, but not a complete AB region, for its positive activity. Because amino acids 804–918 contain the hAR AF-2 (32Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), it is possible that hAR(Δ804–918) is unable to activate transcription due to the absence of the AF-2. To directly test this hypothesis, we generated a mutant of hAR with a single amino acid change in the AF-2 (E896P) (Fig.2 A) that has previously been demonstrated to disrupt AF-2 function in RAR (32Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). hAR(E896P) was transcriptionally silent, either in the absence or presence of transfected c-Jun, whereas wild-type hAR exhibited the expected strong activity (Fig. 2 C). As a control for this mutant's activity, we used TIF2, a coactivator that has previously been shown to require a functional AF-2 (15He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 20Berrevoets C.A. Doesburg P. Steketee K. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1172-1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, hAR(E896P) was unable to respond to transfected TIF2 (Fig. 2 D), the same as with c-Jun. To confirm that the lack of activity was not caused by a lack of expression of hAR(E896P), Western blot analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 B, hAR(E896P) was expressed almost as well as wild-type hAR. These results strongly suggest that c-Jun, like TIF2, requires a functional AF-2 to act as a coactivator in hAR-dependent transactivation. Previous work has demonstrated anin vivo interaction between the AB and E regions of AR (11Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

To determine whether c-Jun has the same effect on hAR, we established a mammalian two-hybrid system using the expression plasmids GAL-hAR(DE) and VP16-hAR(AB) (Fig.3 A) and the GAL4-responsive reporter plasmid 17M-tk-CAT (23Bubulya A. Zhou X.-F. Shen X.-Q. Fisher C.J. Shemshedini L. Endocrine. 2000; 13: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in transient transfection experiments in COS cells. Like the aforementioned coactivators, transfected c-Jun was indeed able to stimulate the ligand-dependent interaction between the amino and carboxyl termini of hAR (Fig.3 B). To analyze the specificity of this c-Jun effect, we utilized a series of c-Jun mutants previously tested for coactivation of hAR (26Wise S.C. Burmeister L.A. Zhou X.-F. Bubulya A. Oberfield J.L. Birrer M.J. Shemshedini L. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this earlier study (47Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), we showed that multiple regions of c-Jun are involved in mediating hAR transactivation, including the bZIP region and a portion of the amino-terminal activation functions. When these c-Jun mutants were tested for mediating hAR(DE)/hAR(AB) interaction, their activities matched what was seen for hAR transactivation (Fig. 3 C). Specifically, c-Jun mutant proteins defective in either bZIP function (A265 → D In265, Δ287–332, M14) or activation function (Δ1–245 and Δ146–221) are equally ineffective in supporting hAR transactivation or N-to-C interaction, whereas mutants M8, M9, Ala63/73, and Δ194–223 are able to stimulate both hAR activities (Fig. 3 C). These results strongly argue that c-Jun may be influencing hAR transcriptional activity by mediating its ability to form dimers via N-to-C interactions. The data in Fig. 2 show that a functional AF-2 is necessary for hAR transactivation in either the absence or presence of transfected c-Jun. Because previous work has shown that the AF-2 is required for hAR N-to-C interaction (11Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 13Doesburg P. Kuil C.W. Berrevoets C.A. Steketee K. Faber P.W. Mulder E. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J.

In addition to P3, the outer capsid shell also contains a receptor binding complex composed of proteins P2, P31, and P5, located on the 5-fold vertices (14Rydman P.S. Caldentey J. Butcher S.J.

An outline of the assembly pathway of these vertices has been recently delineated by genetic, biochemical, and electron microscopic methods (14Rydman P.S. Caldentey J. Butcher S.J. Fuller S.D.

A pentameric protein, P31, anchors the P5 trimer to the vertex (14Rydman P.S. Caldentey J. Butcher S.J. Fuller S.D. Rutten T. Bamford D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Caldentey J. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10566-10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The P5 trimer contains two domains separated by a collagen-like sequence (see Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain (P5N, residues 1–135) interacts with protein P31 and is necessary for P5 incorporation into virions (15Bamford J.K. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7781-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Caldentey J. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10566-10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain (P5C, residues 136–340) is necessary for trimerization and P2 binding (15Bamford J.K. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7781-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Caldentey J. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10566-10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based on a 38% sequence identity between P31 and P5N and the ability of P53 to dissociate P315, a model of the 3–5-fold symmetry adapter has been proposed (17Caldentey J. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10566-10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In this model, P5N domains associating with the remaining P31 molecules form the vertex base. The trimer of P5C constitutes the spike shaft and supports P2 binding (Fig. 1). All three proteins are essential for controlled DNA delivery. Upon binding to the receptor, P2 is considered to trigger conformational changes within the vertex complex that are transmitted to the internal membrane. The membrane then forms a tubular appendage thought to serve as a conduit for DNA delivery (16Grahn A.M. Caldentey J. Bamford J.K.H. Bamford D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6689-6696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of P2 the vertex complex becomes unstable, leading to premature release of the packaged DNA (16Grahn A.M. Caldentey J. Bamford J.K.H. Bamford D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6689-6696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggested that the vertex is in a metastable conformation stabilized by P2 and that the vertex disassembles upon receptor binding. Further structural investigations of the vertex complex by electron microscopy were precluded because of the symmetry mismatch between P31 (pentamer) and P5 (trimer), and P5 and P2 (monomer), respectively (14Rydman P.S. Caldentey J. Butcher S.J. Fuller S.D. Rutten T. Bamford D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although protein P2 has yielded diffracting crystals (18Xu L. Butcher S.J. Benson S.D. Bamford D.H. Burnett R.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the vertex complex is unlikely to yield to crystallization because of its size and flexibility. Because the vertex complex is essential for host recognition and controlled DNA delivery, it is important to unravel its quaternary structure. X-ray solution scattering is used here to obtain structural information about the arrangement of individual proteins within the complex. The shape of individual vertex proteins and models of their association within the vertex are presented, and some aspects of their interactions in vitro are investigated. The structure of the vertex is also compared with that of the adenovirus, and the implications for PRD1 assembly and DNA release are discussed. Protein P5 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells harboring plasmid pJB51 and purified as described earlier (17Caldentey J. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10566-10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purification yielded P53, which was further purified by size exclusion chromatography. P5C3 was prepared by digestion of P53 with collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum (Sigma). The digestion products were separated by size exclusion chromatography on a Hi-Load Superdex 200 26/60 gel filtration (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. Proteins P2 and P31 were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (14Rydman P.S. Caldentey J. Butcher S.J. Fuller S.D. Rutten T. Bamford D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Grahn A.M. Caldentey J. Bamford J.K.H. Bamford D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6689-6696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were concentrated to 10–15 mg/ml, and large aggregates were removed by filtration (0.2 μm pore size) and centrifugation (30 min, 95,000 rpm, A-100 rotor, Beckman Airfuge). If required, protein solutions were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column just before the small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS)1experiment. Sample homogeneity and purity was checked by dynamic light scattering and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (17Caldentey J. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10566-10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). SAXS data were obtained from proteins in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.0, unless indicated otherwise. A complex with an apparent stoichiometry P56:P31 was obtained during incubation of complexes P315 and P53 for 48 h at 4 °C, after which apparent equilibrium was reached. A nonameric complex (P53)3 was formed during incubation of P53 at 37 °C for 48 h. Because of their slow dissociation rates, these complexes remained in apparent equilibrium with the reactants for the duration of the SAXS experiment. To study complex formation between P5C3 and P2, the two proteins were mixed at 5 °C and incubated for 24 h. Volume fractions of complexes and reactants were determined by analytical size exclusion chromatography (300 × 10 mm Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl buffer, pH 7.0) using refractive index and absorption detectors. The synchrotron radiation x-ray scattering data were collected using standard procedures on the X33 camera (19Koch M.H.J. Bordas J. Nucl. Instrum.

Dauvergne F. Nucl. Instrum. Methods. 1982; 201: 223-224Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The beam was focused onto the detector placed at distances of 1.4, 2.5, and 4 m from the 120-μl sample cell. The covered range of momentum transfer was 0.1 < s < 5.5 nm−1 (s = 4πsin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ = 0.15 nm, the x-ray wavelength). The data were normalized to the intensity of the incident beam, corrected for the detector response, the scattering of the buffer was subtracted, and the difference curves were scaled for concentration using the program SAPOKO. 2D. I. Svergun and M. H. J. Koch, unpublished information. To check for radiation damage and aggregation during the SAXS experiment, the data were collected in 10 successive 1-min frames. The reduced data sets at low angles were extrapolated to zero concentration after standard procedures (23Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987: 68-73Google Scholar). The scattering patterns recorded at different sample-detector distances were merged, and the forward scatteringI(0), distance distribution functionsp(r), and radii of gyration R g were evaluated with the indirect transform package GNOM (24Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 25Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2925) Google Scholar). The maximum dimensions D max of the protein complexes P53, P5C3, P2, and P31 were estimated from the experimental data using the orthogonal expansion program ORTOGNOM (26Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 258-267Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The shapes of proteins P2, P53, and P5C3 were restored from the scattering patterns of monodisperse solution of these proteins using an ab initio shape determination method (27Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar) implemented in the program DAMMIN. A sphere of diameterD max is filled with a regular grid of points corresponding to a dense hexagonal packing of small spheres (dummy atoms) of radius r 0 ≪D max. The structure of the dummy atoms model is defined by a configuration vector X assigning an index to each atom (0 for solvent and 1 for solute particle). In keeping with the low resolution of the solution-scattering data, the method searches for a compact interconnected configuration X minimizing the discrepancy χ between the calculated and the experimental curves, χ2=1N−1∑jI(sj)−Iexp(sj)ς(sj)2Equation 1 where N is the number of experimental points, andI exp(s j) and ς(s j) are the experimental intensity and its S.D. measured at the momentum transfer s j, respectively, and I(s j) is the scattering intensity from the model. Starting from a random configuration, simulated annealing (28Kirkpatrick S. Gelatt C.D. Vecci M.P. Science. 1983; 220: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (30861) Google Scholar) is employed for the minimization. To remove the contribution from the scattering due to internal structure, a constant is subtracted from the experimental data to ensure that the intensity decays as s −4 following Porod's law (29Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar). The shapes of P2, P53, and P5C3 were reconstructed with dummy atoms of radius r 0 = 0.45, 0.325, and 0.25 nm, respectively. For P53 and P5C3, a 3-fold symmetry was assumed. The models of the pentameric protein P31 were obtained using twoab initio procedures. Because the current version of DAMMIN does not support 5-fold symmetry, the low resolution shape of P315 was restored without applying any symmetry restrictions with r 0 = 0.325 nm. A more detailed model has been constructed using a recently developed dummy residues (DR) method (30Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar) implemented in the program GASBOR. This program employs simulated annealing to build a model of the protein structure by finding a chain-like spatial distribution of DRs that fits the experimental scattering data (see Ref. 30Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar for details). The DR model of P315 was reconstructed assuming a 5-fold symmetry, with 123 residues/monomer corresponding to the primary sequence of the protein (7Bamford J.K.H. Hanninen A.L. Pakula T.M. Ojala P.M. Kalkkinen N. Frilander M. Bamford D.H. Virology. 1991; 183: 658-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Preparations of the complexes P56:P31 and (P53)3 did not yield monodisperse solutions, and the SAXS data were collected from mixtures of reactants and products. The experimental scattering intensityI exp(s) from a mixture ofK different components is written as, Iexp(s)=∑j=1Kvj×Ij(s)Equation 2 where ν j andI j (s) are the volume fraction and the scattering intensity from the j-th component, respectively. Given the scattering curves of the components, program OLIGOMER 3D. I. Svergun, V. V. Volkov, and A. Sokolova, unpublished information. finds the volume fractions by solving a system of linear equations to minimize the χ2 discrepancy (1Bamford D.H. Caldentey J. Bamford J.K.H. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) between the experimental and calculated scattering curves. The scattering intensities from theab initio low resolution models of complexes P53and P31 were computed using the program CRYSOL (31Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). The models of complexes (P53)2 and (P53)3 were constructed interactively from the low resolution models of P53 and P31 using the program MASSHA (32Konarev P.V. Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The complex P56:P31 was built from two P53 and one or two monomers of P31. The nonameric complex (P53)3 was constructed from three P53. The scattering intensities from these models were subsequently computed by CRYSOL. The values of the hydrodynamic radius R h were calculated from the low resolution models using the program HYDRO (33Garcı́a de la Torre J. Navarro S. López Martı́nez M.C. Dı́az F.G.

Biophys. 1981; 14: 81-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The bead sizes were 0.45, 0.25, 0.45, 0.19, 0.45, and 0.45 nm for complexes P53, P5C3, P2, P315, P56:P31, and (P53)3, respectively. The figures displaying the low resolution models of the protein complexes were prepared on an SGI Octane workstation using the program ASSA (35Kozin M.B. Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 811-815Crossref Google Scholar). The structural parameters of protein P2 computed from SAXS and hydrodynamic data are presented in Table I. According to the hydrodynamic data (17Caldentey J. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10566-10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), P2 is an elongated particle with an axial ratio of about 1:10. A low resolution model of this complex in Fig. 3,left column, was restored ab initio from the SAXS data using the program DAMMIN, and the fit to the experimental scattering data is displayed in Fig.2 A. The ab initio shape reveals an elongated, peanut-shaped particle with an axial ratio 1:7, consistent with both hydrodynamic (17Caldentey J. Tuma R. Bamford D.H.

Note that GASBOR takes into account the internal structure of the assembly and, thus, provides a fit of the whole scattering curve. On the other hand, the DAMMIN fit is limited to smaller range of s values because shape determination is performed in homogeneous approximation,e.g. contributions from internal inhomogeneities are effectively discarded (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 27Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). Therefore, DAMMIN fits effectively underestimate the experimental curves at higher s values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) According to analytical ultracentrifugation (14Rydman P.S. Caldentey J. Butcher S.J. Fuller S.D. Rutten T. Bamford D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), P31 is a pentamer with molecular mass = 68.7 kDa. The low resolution shape of P315 reconstructed ab initioby DAMMIN without symmetry restrictions is displayed in Fig.3, middle column, and the fit to the experimental scattering data is presented in Fig. 2 B,curve 2. A much more detailed model (Fig. 3, right column) is provided by the program GASBOR, which allowed, in contrast to DAMMIN, to impose a 5-fold symmetry and to fit the entire scattering pattern (the fit is presented in Fig. 2 B)curve 3). Earlier hydrodynamic measurements suggest that P315 is an elongated particle withD max and R h equal to 24 and 4.2 nm, respectively (17Caldentey J. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10566-10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results were in obvious contradiction with the two ab initio SAXS models in Fig. 3(middle and right columns), which indicate that P315 is a globular particle withD max and R h equal to 8.5 and 2.5 nm, respectively. To resolve this discrepancy, a new series of hydrodynamic experiments was performed yielding a valueR h = 3.1 nm and D max = 6.5 nm, which agreed with the SAXS model. It is conceivable that the samples used in the previous hydrodynamic analysis contained higher oligomers or aggregates 4R. Tuma and J. Caldentey, unpublished information. of P31. According to the biochemical data (17Caldentey J. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10566-10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) the smallest form of protein P5 is an elongated trimer (P53) constructed from three monomers associated via the C-terminal domain with low tendency to further oligomerization. Two constructs of the P5 trimer were studied, namely the full-length complex P53 and the C-terminal domain P5C3 obtained by collagenase cleavage of P53. Low resolution shapes of P5C3 and P53 (Fig.4) were restored using DAMMIN, and the corresponding fits to the experimental data are shown in Fig.2 A. The independently obtained model of P5C3 is very similar to one end of the P53 model, as illustrated by the superposition in Fig. 4, left column. This end of the P53 model was therefore tentatively assigned to the C terminus, although the orientation cannot be distinguished solely on the basis of the SAXS data. Based on such tentative domain assignment, the N-terminal domain assumes highly extended conformation. The values of D max and R h computed from the low resolution models of P5C3 and P53 using HYDRO are in a good agreement with hydrodynamic measurements in TableI. The complex P56:P31 was obtained by incubation of complexes P315 and P53. Such preparations of P56:P31 always contained an equilibrium mixture of all three constituents (P56:P31, P315, and P53). Because monodisperse solutions of P56:P31 were not available, its low resolution shape could not be determined directly from the scattering data. The models of the P56:P31 were constructed from two P53 and one or two P31 monomers. The P31 monomer was conveniently taken to be the asymmetric portion of the model of P315 obtained using the program GASBOR in the previous section. The actual shape does not have appreciable influence on the fitting because of the low volume fraction of P31 within the complex. To select a plausible arrangement of the two P53 in (P53)2, previous biochemical results were taken into account; the C-terminal domain of P5 is the trimerization domain, whereas the N-terminal domain is responsible for further oligomerization of P53 and its association with P31 (15Bamford J.K. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7781-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Caldentey J. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10566-10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additionally, preliminary results 5R. Tuma and J. H. K. Bamford, unpublished information. indicated that solutions of a recombinant N-terminal fragment always contain a mixture of monomers and dimers. These results suggest that oligomerization of P53 proceeds most likely via dimerization of the N-terminal domain. A set of models was generated in which two P53 trimers associated via their assigned N-terminal domains together with one or two P31 monomers. The models differed in the separation between the P53 molecules in the XY plane (see the orientation in Fig.6) and in the positions of the monomeric P31. Their scattering patterns were computed and processed using OLIGOMER to fit the experimental data (Fig. 5 A). Models containing only one monomeric P31 systematically fitted the experimental data better than those incorporating two P31 molecules. Although omitting P31 from the model did not appreciably affect the fit, chromatography indicated that stoichiometric amounts of P31 were present in the complex, and therefore, P31 was included in the modeling. The discrepancy and the volume fraction of the P56:P31 in the mixture as functions of the separation between the two complexes P53 are presented in Fig. 5, B and C, respectively.Figure 5A, experimental scattering curves (dots with error bars) and the corresponding fitted curves calculated using OLIGOMER (solid lines) from the mixtures containing P53:P31, P53, and P31 (1Bamford D.H.

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs),1 which are able to acetylate histone and non-histone proteins, are involved in a variety of essential cellular processes such as muscle-cell terminal differentiation. Muscle-cell terminal differentiation involves several families of transcription factors, including myogenic basic helix-loop-helices (MyoD, Myf-5, myogenin, and MRF-4) (1Buckingham M. Biochem. Soc.

It is of note that the p300965–1810 fragment has lost the main protein-protein interaction domains of p300. In particular, the regions of p300 previously shown to interact with MyoD, the CH3 domain (amino acids 1620–1891) (15Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal KIX domain (amino acids 379–654) (16Riou P. Bex F. Gazzolo L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10551-10560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), are truncated or altogether deleted in p300965–1810. Thus a possible explanation for the discrepancy between these two series of experiments might be that a physical contact between the HAT and its substrate is required for acetylation and that the interaction domains are critical for the reaction to take place. Here, we present the results of a direct test of this hypothesis, which show that acetylation of MyoD by p300 is linked to the ability of the two proteins to physically interact. Recombinant GST-PCAF and FLAG-tagged p300 and p300965–1810 were purified from bacteria and insect cells as described previously (12Polesskaya A. Duquet A. Naguibneva I. Weise C. Vervisch A. Bengal E. Hucho F. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34359-34364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). HAT activity was measured as described previously (17Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Robin P. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3869-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using either nucleosomes purified from HeLa cells or a peptide corresponding to the first 24 amino acids of histone H3. Bacterially produced recombinant MyoD was produced and acetylated as described previously (12Polesskaya A. Duquet A. Naguibneva I. Weise C. Vervisch A. Bengal E. Hucho F. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34359-34364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). 20 ng of recombinantEscherichia coli-produced MyoD protein was incubated with 50–100 ng of baculovirus-produced FLAG-p300 wild type or FLAG-p300965–1810 in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody (M-2, Sigma). Proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the presence of MyoD in the complexes was revealed by Western blot with anti-MyoD antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To determine whether p300 integrity is required for MyoD acetylation, we directly compared the two forms of p300 for their ability to acetylate MyoD. The histone acetyltransferase activities of the two proteins, as well as of PCAF, were first standardized based on their ability to acetylate histones, as measured by incorporation of14C from radiolabeled acetyl-CoA. We used as substrates either a synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 24 amino acids of histone H3 (17Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Robin P. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3869-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A) or nucleosomes prepared from HeLa cells (Fig. 1 B). Note that we purposely chose to use a concentration of the p300965–1810fragment that acetylates histone substrates with a significantly higher efficiency than the full-length p300 and PCAF proteins (about 3-fold higher). We next assayed the three HATs using MyoD as a substrate. In contrast to the results obtained with the histones, the p300965–1810 fragment did not induce detectable incorporation of 14C in MyoD (Fig. 1 C). As published previously (12Polesskaya A. Duquet A. Naguibneva I. Weise C. Vervisch A. Bengal E. Hucho F. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34359-34364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), PCAF and p300, when full-length, catalyzed the incorporation of 14C into MyoD to similar levels. These data demonstrate that MyoD acetylation by p300 requires more than just its HAT domain. The most likely explanation is that physical interaction between the enzyme and its substrate is required for efficient acetylation of the substrate. Indeed, the results of a co-immunoprecipitation assay indicated that although full-length p300 strongly interacts with MyoD in vitro, the p300965–1810 fragment does not (Fig.2). These results show a correlation between MyoD acetylation and physical interaction with MyoD. They demonstrate without ambiguity that p300 is in fact able to acetylate MyoD in vitro, and most importantly, they show that, in order to arrive at valid conclusions, full-length histone acetyltransferases must be used in in vitro assays. In light of this finding, and given that the widely used p300965–1810 fragment has lost the main protein-protein interaction domains of p300, some previously published data may need to be re-evaluated. We thank Vasia Ogryzko for providing the p300965–1810 construct, Reguina Groisman and Pat Nakatani for p300, and Linda L. Pritchard for helpful comments."

The HSAL gene complex was originally identified on the basis of DNA sequence homology to a region-specific homeotic gene (SAL) in Drosophila. This study reveals a novel, functional 5′ exon for HSAL2 and demonstrates that two distinct HSAL2 gene transcripts arise from two overlapping transcription units, resulting in proteins that differ by 25 amino acids. By utilizing functional luciferase reporter assays, two distinct promoters for HSAL2, P1 for the proximal promoter (upstream of exon 1) and P2 for the distal promoter (upstream of exon 1A), were identified.

Production of mRNA from P2 was demonstrably higher and was expressed by a greater number of tissues. In contradistinction,HSAL2 expression directed by P2 was undetectable in some malignant populations as opposed to their normal human counterparts, suggesting a potential role as a tumor suppressor gene.

HSAL2 is one of three related homeobox genes of theHSAL gene family (HSAL2 is also known asSALL2 (OMIM number 602219)). HSAL genes encode a group of putative transcription factors that have been isolated based on their homology to a Drosophila region-specific homeotic gene, SAL (1Kohlhase J. Schuh R. Dowe G.

SAL is an essential genetic component required for specification of the posterior head and anterior tail segments in Drosophila (2Jurgens G.

Each of these homologues is expressed during embryonic development as well as in certain adult tissues. In humans, HSAL1 is mutated in patients with Townes-Brocks syndrome with features including urogenital, limb, anal, and cardiac malformation (8Kohlhase J. Taschner P. Burfeind P. Pasche B. Newman B.

HSAL2 is expressed in a number of mice and human tissues and is considered as a potential tumor suppressor gene for ovarian cancer. The gene has been mapped to 14q11.1–13, which is a region associated with LOH in 49% of human ovarian cancers (10Bandera C.A. Takahashi H. Behbakht K. Liu P.C. LiVolsi V.A. Benjamin I. Morgan M.A. King S.A. Rubin S.C. Boyd J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 513-515PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, alterations in the expression of HSAL2 have been observed in human ovarian carcinoma. 1Dawei, Ma, and Benjamin, submitted for publication. In mouse, bothin vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate a specific interaction between HSAL2 and the large T antigen of polyoma virus (38Li D. Dower K. Ma Y. Benjamin T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). This interaction is critical for susceptibility to polyoma-induced neoplasia, including mammary tumors. WhenHSAL2 is transfected into the ovarian cancer cells, the tumor population exhibits a significant reduction in growth rate and colony formation in soft agar. Furthermore, mutations in theHSAL2 gene have been associated with ovarian cancer.HSAL3 has been mapped to chromosome 18q23, and it has been suggested that this isoform is involved in the phenotype of patients with 18q deletion syndrome characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, growth retardation, midface hypoplasia, hearing loss, and tapered fingers (7Kohlhase J.

SAL proteins belong to a group of C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors and are characterized by multiple domains distributed over the entire protein (11Kuhnlein R.P. Frommer G. Friedrich M.

The structural characteristics of SAL2 seen in vertebrates involve a C2H2 finger near the N terminus and a cluster of C2H2 motifs distributed over the remaining portion of the protein, considered essential for DNA binding. HSAL2 proteins have glutamate-, proline-, and alanine rich sequences, suggestive of transcriptional activator and repressor functions (1Kohlhase J. Schuh R. Dowe G. Kuhnlein R. Jackle H. Schroeder B.

The downstream target genes of the HSAL family remain to be identified. However, two important signaling pathways upstream ofSAL have been identified. In fish, SAL expression is regulated by hedgehog (Hh)2 activity (4Koster R. Stick R. Loosli F. Wittbrodt J. Development. 1997; 124: 3147-3156PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), a homologue of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), also acts as an upstream regulator of theDrosophila sal gene (12de Celis J.F. Barrio R. Kafatos F.C.

Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The Dpp and Hh signaling pathways are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom and are critical for embryonic pattern formation. Most of the genes in the Dpp and Hh pathways have been shown to play similarly essential roles in development (15Ingham P.W. Curr. Opin.

Importantly, a remarkable number of these genes in humans are either tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. For instance, homologues of the components of the Wingless and Dpp signaling pathways (PTC, APC, and MAD) are tumor suppressors, whereas homologues of CI and Wingless (GLI1 and WNT) are oncogenes in the human (17Hahn S.A.

Taken together, the HSAL gene family appears to be essential for normal embryonic development, and genetic alterations of the family members have been linked to human congenital defects and cancer. However, there is little known about the mechanism of HSAL gene regulation. Prior experimentation has suggested that theHSAL2 gene putatively possesses two alternative 5′ exons (exons 1 and 1A) (21Kohlhase J. Altmann M. Archangelo L. Dixkens C. Engel W. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To elucidate some of the mechanisms ofHSAL gene control, and to identify cis- and trans- acting regulatory elements/factors that direct the complex pattern of HSAL gene expression in normal human tissues as well as in human cancer, we have cloned and characterized the 5′-flanking region(s) of the HSAL2 gene. The results suggest that there are two promoters, P1 and P2, responsible for controlling the alternative usage of 5′ exons, leading to the production of two distinct mRNAs. P1 and P2 exhibited different tissue specificity and resulted in generation of HSAL2 isoforms differing at the N terminus. In addition, HSAL2 transcripts were undetectable or silent in some of eight well characterized human tumors. Our findings should facilitate the understanding of the transcriptional regulation of HSAL2 in embryonic development and human cancer. Cell lines 293 (derived from human embryonic kidney cells) and U2OS (derived from osteosarcoma cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. WT-1 expression constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Jonathan D. Licht and contained two isoforms of murine WT-1 cDNA constructs. The expression ofWT-1 constructs was directed by the RSV promoter (22Reddy J.C. Morris J.C. Wang J. English M.A. Haber D.A. Shi Y.

The D isoform is the same as the B isoform except for an additional 3 amino acids inserted between zinc fingers 3 and 4. WT-1 expression proteins were detectable from each construct by immunohistochemistry (22Reddy J.C. Morris J.C. Wang J. English M.A. Haber D.A. Shi Y. Licht J.D. J. Biol.

These procedures were performed using the avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase primer extension system (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from human fetal brain and kidney was used for extension with a 32P-end-labeled exon 1-specific primer (5′-GGATATTGGGATTGAGGGAGGCGATG-3′). The products were analyzed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Total RNA of specific human tissues (see under “Results”) was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), Ambion (Austin, TX), or from the Department of Pathology, Roger Williams Medical Center (Providence, RI) subsequent to pathologic diagnosis. RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed after annealing with 0.1 nm oligo(dT) for priming of cDNA synthesis in a 20-μl reaction using the SuperScript Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNAs for specific human tumors and selected tissues were obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). One common primer located in exon 2 was used as the 3′ downstream primer in combination with one or the other of two 5′ upstream primers specific for exon 1 and exon 1A, respectively. PCR amplification was constructed to ensure the product crossed over an intron. The primer sets were as follows: exon 2 common primer, N1 (5′-CGACCAGGAAATGCCCTGGAGACTCC-3′); exon 1-specific primer, N2 (5′-CCAACAGTTAATCTCGGACTGCGAAG-3′); and exon 1A-specific primer, N3 (5′-CCACAACCATGGCGCACGAATCCGAG-3′). PCR amplification was performed in 50-μl reaction volumes containing 5 μl of cDNA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In some experiments, 3 μCi of [32P]dCTP were added to each PCR sample. After initial denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min, amplification was performed under the following conditions: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 57 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C (exon 1-exon 2 primer pair); 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 64 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C (exon 1A-exon 2 primer pair); 1 min at 94 °C and 1.5 min at 72 °C (GAPDH primer pair). Amplification was performed within the linear range for the exon 1-exon 2 transcript and for the exon 1A-exon 2 transcript, as indicated in the figure legends. Amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was used to control for template loading. PCR products were electrophoretically separated on 2% agarose gels. Radioactive PCR products were electrophoretically separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and exposed to Biomax MR-2 (Kodak) autoradiography film. DNA sequencing was used to confirm amplification products. Screening of a human BAC library was performed in collaboration with the Research Genetics Institute (Huntsville, AL). Three positive clones were identified. The isolated clones were verified by direct nucleotide sequencing of the BAC DNA. Chromosomal localization was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization. DNA isolated from an HSAL2 BAC clone was labeled with digoxigenin and hybridized to human peripheral blood lymphocytes in metaphase. Signals were detected via rhodamine-conjugated avidin. Chromosomes were counterstained with 4,6-diamine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. The 5′-flanking region of exon 1A was amplified with primers 5′-CGCCATGGAAGCTTGTGGGGGAAGTGGAGGGCCAGGTGG-3′ and 5′-GGCCATGGCTCGAGGTGGTTTCAGCTCCCCCACCCACTG-3′ to generate a fragment from −3 to −2278 bp upstream of the first ATG, withHin dIII and Xho I sites at each end, respectively. After Hin dIII and Xho I digestion, this fragment was cloned into the promoter-less pGL-3 basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) at the Hin dIII and Xho I site to generate −2278-LUC. −429-LUC was generated by digesting −2278-LUC with Pst I and Xho I followed by blunt ending with T4 DNA polymerase and ligation overnight. −331-LUC and −214LUC were created in the same manner, except the parental −2278-LUC was digested with Xho I/Sac I and Xho I/Bgl II, respectively. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density of ∼1 × 105 cells/well. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Plasmid DNA for transient transfection was prepared using the Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen). To analyze theHSAL2 promoter constructs, 1 μg of HSAL2 promoter-reporter plasmid plus 0.2 μg of internal control β-galactosidase plasmid, CMV-β-gal (Life Technologies, Inc.), was used. For co-transfection experiments with WT-1, a total of 1.3 μg of plasmid DNA was used. The reaction contained 0.3 μg ofHSAL2 promoter-reporter plasmid and either 0.9 μg of PcDNA 3 vector DNA or 0.9 μg of WT-1 expression plasmid plus 0.2 of internal control of CMV-β-gal plasmid. The cells were extracted using 100 μl of luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) 48 h post-transfection. The β-galactosidase assay was performed with 10 μl of cell extract using the β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega) and the standard assay protocol provided by the manufacturer (except that 1 m Tris base was used as stopping buffer instead of sodium carbonate). Five microliters of extract were used for the luciferase assay using a Luciferase Assay kit (Promega), following the manufacturer’s instructions. After subtracting background, the luciferase activity (arbitrary units) was normalized to β-galactosidase activity (arbitrary units) for each sample. Given a high degree of homology between mouse and human cDNA for SAL2, primers were constructed to evaluate message production from the human HSAL2 gene. One common primer, located within exon 2, was used as the 3′ downstream primer (reverse) in combination with exon 1- or exon 1A-specific primers, as demonstrated in Fig. 1 A. RT-PCR was performed using cDNAs transcribed from fetal kidney and intestinal mRNAs. As shown in Fig. 1 B, a product encompassing sequences derived from exon 1A and exon 2 was amplified from the kidney and intestine when using the exon 1A primer in conjunction with the exon 2 primer. A product containing exon 1 and exon 2 sequences was seen when specific primers for exon 1 and exon 2 were applied. Sequencing of the amplified PCR products revealed that when primers for exon 1 and exon 2 were utilized, a product resulted that bypassed exon 1A. The PCR product using primers for exon 1A and exon 2 were devoid of exon 1 sequences. Sequence analysis of the amplified PCR products showed that consensus splice sites were used in the processing of exon 1-exon 2 and exon 1A-exon 2 mRNA transcripts (data not shown). Determination of deduced amino acid sequence reveals that the protein derived from exon 1-exon 2, as opposed exon 1A-exon 2, differed by up to 25 amino acids at the N terminus (Fig.1 C). The position of one of the HSAL2 transcription start site(s) was next determined using 5′ extension. Human fetal kidney and brain were chosen to be suitable tissues to provide mRNA because both of these tissues have been shown to strongly express HSAL2 (1Kohlhase J. Schuh R. Dowe G. Kuhnlein R. Jackle H. Schroeder B. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzchmar H. Kohler A. Muller U. Raab-Vetter M. Burkhardt E. Engel W. Stick R. Genomics. 1996; 38: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). By using a primer specific for exon 1A, one major transcriptional start site, 120 nucleotides upstream of the ATG codon (−120) was identified, as seen in Fig. 1 D. Three minor transcriptional start sites were also located at positions −125, −170, and −195 nucleotides (Fig. 1 D). The numerical identification of the transcriptional start sites was based upon the A of the ATG translational start site being given the number +1. To identify the promoter region(s) upstream of HSAL2, three BAC clones were isolated and found to contain the required full-lengthHSAL2 gene, as determined by direct nucleotide sequencing. To confirm further the specificity of the HSAL2 gene, DNA from the HSAL2 BAC clone was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP by nick translation and hybridized in situ to normal human chromosomes derived from the peripheral blood lymphocytes as substrate. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the BAC clone 2 containing HSAL2 localized to the proximal long arm of chromosome 14 (q11.1-q13) (Fig.2). Evaluation of the P2 promoter was first to be undertaken, given the relative abundance of the mRNA product controlled therefrom. Sequencing of the 5′-flanking region of exon 1A did not reveal classical TATA or CAAT boxes. However, this region was GC-rich and contained several GC boxes and potential binding sites for multiple general transcription factors including AP1, AP4, and Sp1 within 429 bp upstream of the major translation start site (Fig. 3 A). A data bank search using the Transfac transcription factor data base revealed several putative binding sites for regulatory transcription factors scattered within 2.3 kb upstream of the first ATG of exon 1A, including two sites for TGF-β/Smad, one site for Hox-1.3, and seven sites forWT-1 (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether this region has significant promoter activity, the 2.3-kb upstream region was cloned in front of a promoterless luciferase reporter (pGL3-Basic; Promega). Luciferase expression in transient transfection assays was next evaluated in the presence of a constant amount of the internal plasmid expressing β-galactosidase. In NIH-3T3 cells, P19 embryonic carcinoma cells, and 293 human kidney cells, luciferase activities were 6-, 23-, and 10-fold greater than the promoterless vector, respectively (Fig. 4 A).Figure 4Characterization of transcriptional activity of the HSAL2 P2 promoter.

The 5′-flanking region of HSAL2 exon 1A, from −3 to −2281 upstream from the first ATG codon, was used to drive the expression of a luciferase reporter in the HSAL-luc construct. Fold differences,i.e. relative luciferase activity, were calculated as arbitrary luciferase activity of HSAL-luc over that of the vector, pGL3 basic (Promega) without promoters. B, promoter activity of serial deletion constructs. Ordinate, luciferase constructs of HSAL2 P2 promoter regions −2281 to −3 (−2281-Luc), −429 to −3 (−429-Luc), −331 to −3 (−331-Luc), and −291 to −3 (−291-Luc). Abscissa, luciferase activity, corresponding to each deletion construct, was normalized to β-galactosidase activity and presented as a relative value compared with the pGL3 (Luc) control. The asterisk indicates that several deletion constructs of P2 were utilized in these experiments, as opposed to using only the intact P2 construct, as seen inA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the minimal DNA sequences required for HSAL2 promoter activity and to analyze DNA sequences important for the high level of HSAL2 transcription, transient transfection assays were further carried out on the 293 kidney cell line. This was performed using a series of promoterless luciferase reporter constructs containing up to 2.3 kb of 5′-flanking sequence surrounding the transcription start sites. The series of deleted promoter reporter constructs used in the transfections are shown in Fig. 4 B. The constructs were co-transfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector (pCMV gal), and luciferase activities were normalized in reference to the respective β-galactosidase activity. All five promoter constructs demonstrated functional activity in 293 cells, in contrast to the promoterless construct pGL3-basic that served as a control. The most significant luciferase activity observed was ∼17-fold greater than that found in pGL3-basic. The shortest promoter construct contained 219 bp upstream of the first ATG and demonstrated approximately an 8-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with that of the promoterless vector. As a result of the reporter gene and 5′ extension assays detailed above, a functional promoter located in the 5′-flanking region of exon 1A, 2.1 kb away from a start site for exon 1A-exon 2 mRNA, was demonstrated. In addition, our studies demonstrated the presence of an additional exon, exon 1, ∼11 kb upstream of exon 1A. Exon 1 contains a potential translation start site that, when spliced to exon 2, forms an open reading frame. As a result, exon 1A was absent from the exon 1-exon 2 transcript. These findings prompted an investigation into an alternative promoter, P1, for the exon 1-exon 2 mRNA. Evaluation of the 5′ region flanking exon 1 revealed known consensus sites for transcriptional regulatory elements including three sites for vitamin D receptor/retinoid X receptor, one site for WT-1, one site for PAX-3, and three sites for Hox-1.3 (Fig.5 A). To determine whether this region bears significant promoter activity, ∼2 kb of genomic DNA starting upstream of the translation start site for exon 1 was subcloned into a promoterless pGL3-Basic vector. Transient transfection was performed using the 293 renal cell line. P1 demonstrated a 4-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 5 B) compared with the control vector, pGL3-basic. The full-length P2 construct containing ∼2 kb upstream of the translation start site showed an 8-fold increase in luciferase activity under the same conditions. Sequence analysis of the two identified HSAL2 promoters revealed multiple potential binding sites for WT-1. Given the known repressive actions of WT-1, it was next evaluated whether these DNA-binding proteins altered transcription from the humanHSAL2 P1 and P2 promoters. For these studies, an osteosarcoma cell line, U2OS, was co-transfected with two distinctWT-1 constructs. The B isoform of WT-1 includes an N-terminal splice that codes for 17 additional amino acids. The D isoform of WT-1 is identical to the B isoform except for an additional 3-amino acid insertion between zinc fingers 3 and 4. TheHSAL2 P1 promoter was repressed 7–9-fold by co-transfection with a 3-fold molar excess of the WT-1 expression plasmids (Fig. 6 A). When a similar experiment was conducted utilizing the P2 promoter construct, the activity of the P2 promoter was repressed 4–10-fold (Fig.6 B). Removal of four of the five WT-1-binding sites from the P2 promoter resulted in decreased suppression in transfectants, as expected (Fig. 6 B). Transcriptional activities of the P1 and P2 promoters were then tested by RT-PCR using cDNAs prepared from various human cells and tissues. A fragment of the ubiquitous GAPDH gene cDNA was amplified as a control. As seen in Fig.7, the activity of the P2 promoter was apparently stronger than that of P1, because the P1 transcript required significant amplification and film exposure to be detected. The PCR product derived from the P2 promoter was found to be present in multiple tissues, although with varying levels of expression. The PCR product of the P1 promoter was substantially more restricted in its distribution, and its scarcity was confirmed by the degree of amplification needed for its detection. It should be noted that in addition to the tissues showing expression of the P1 transcript, as seen in Fig. 7, data shown in Fig. 1 reveal a P1-directed PCR product from both the kidney and small intestine. Also, prior experimentation has revealed significant expression of P1 from mouse embryonic tissue (21Kohlhase J. Altmann M. Archangelo L. Dixkens C. Engel W. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Expression of HSAL2 transcripts was then tested in eight characterized human tumors (TableI) to determine whether a disturbance ofHSAL2 regulation might be present in the neoplasms. The cDNAs were obtained from human tumors propagated in athymic nude mice as xenografts (CLONTECH). Unlike cell lines propagated in vitro, xenografts are regulated by interactions with the host organism in a similar environment to that where the tumor originated (24Gleave M.E. Hsieh J.T. Wu H.C. Hong S.J. Zhau H.E. Guthrie P.D. Chung L.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5300-5307PubMed Google Scholar). Each cDNA sample was carefully normalized to allow accurate assessments of relative abundance of target mRNAs (CLONTECH). Interestingly, theHSAL2 exon 1A-exon 2 transcript was not detectable in some lung carcinomas (two of two tested) and adenocarcinoma of the colon (one of two tested) and prostate (one of one tested) (Fig.8). The failure of expression in some of the tumors analyzed is in contradistinction to their normal human counterparts, where these tissues expressed HSAL2 P2 transcripts (data not shown). The expression of a tumor suppressor gene can be silenced by deletion or DNA methylation. Many tumors show a wide range"

Our results indicated that an essentially complete shutdown of transcription occurs upon temperature shift of this conditionally lethal mutant; 98% of mRNA transcript levels decrease at least 2-fold, 96% at least 4-fold. This data was supported by in vivo experiments that revealed a rapid and greater than 5-fold decline in steady state poly(A) RNA levels after the temperature shift. Expression of several individual genes, measured by Northern analysis, was also consistent with the whole genome expression profile. Finally we demonstrated that the loss of RNA polymerase II activity causes secondary effects on RNA polymerase I, but not RNA polymerase III, transcription. The transcription phenotype of the ΔRPB4 mutant closely mirrors that of the temperature-sensitive rpb1-1mutant frequently implemented as a tool to inactivate the RNA polymerase II in vivo. Therefore, the ΔRPB4 mutant can be used to easily design strains that enable the study of distinct post-transcriptional cellular processes in the absence of RNA polymerase II transcription.

RNA polymerase kilobase pair open reading frame RNA polymerase (RNAP)1II is a highly conserved 12-subunit enzyme that is a component of a large protein complex involved in the regulated synthesis of eukaryotic mRNA (1Lee T.I. Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 77-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 2Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Of the 12 yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeRNAP II subunits, designated RPB1–RPB12, five have counterparts in bacterial RNAP. RPB1 and RPB2 are orthologs of the β′ and β subunits, respectively. RPB3 and RPB11 are structurally and functionally related to the bacterial α subunit pair (3Tan Q. Linask K.L. Ebright R.H. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 339-348PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Maier-Davis B. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Edwards A.M. David P.R. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2000; 288: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and RPB6 is the ortholog of the ω subunit (5Minakhin L. Bhagat S. Brunning A. Campbell E.A. Darst S.A. Ebright R.H. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition to the functional parallels that exist between bacterial and eukaryotic RNAP II subunits, there is extensive functional similarity between subunits comprising the three classes of RNAP. All but one of the RNAP II subunits, RPB4, have some functional relationship to a corresponding subunit in RNAP I and RNAP III. Five of the subunits are also identical in RNAP I, II, and III. Six other RNAP II subunits are related in sequence to subunits in either or both RNAP I and RNAP III. Therefore, the relatively small RPB4 subunit (221 amino acids, 25 kDa) has a function exclusive to RNAP II. RPB4 interacts with RPB7, another small (171 amino acid, 19 kDa) essential subunit (6Woychik N.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This subunit pair can dissociate from the enzyme upon biochemical purification and deletion of the RPB4 gene from yeast cells results in diminished association of the RPB7 subunit with the enzyme. The purified RPB4·RPB7 subcomplex binds both single-stranded DNA and single-stranded RNA in vitro (7Orlicky S.M. Tran P.T. Sayre M.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10097-10102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A predicted oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding fold in RPB7 is crucial for both the nucleic acid binding and transcription activity of the subunit pair (7Orlicky S.M. Tran P.T. Sayre M.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10097-10102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the two functions are not absolutely linked since one RPB7 mutant causes a loss of transcription activity without affecting nucleic acid binding (7Orlicky S.M. Tran P.T. Sayre M.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10097-10102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). RPB4 and RPB7 are present at substoichiometric levels (∼0.5 molecules per RNAP). Therefore, the most homogenous preparations of RNAP II are obtained from ΔRPB4 cells and used as a source of the enzyme for most general structural studies. Comparison of a lower resolution structure of the entire 12-subunit enzyme to the high resolution structure of the enzyme obtained from ΔRPB4 cells revealed differences in conformation; the wild type enzyme favors the closed conformation, and the mutant enzyme favors the open conformation (8Asturias F.J. Meredith G.D. Poglitsch C.L. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Jensen G.J. Meredith G. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). RNAP II lacking the RPB4·RPB7 subcomplex forms a stable preinitiation complex with general transcription factors, and consequently, this subcomplex is required for a step following template commitment (7Orlicky S.M. Tran P.T. Sayre M.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10097-10102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To learn more about RPB4 function, we determined how gene expression was altered in its absence. Using whole genome expression analysis coupled with additional in vivo experiments, we demonstrate that the loss of RPB4 results in a rapid and global decline in RNAP II-mediated transcription. ΔRPB4 cells and a wild type counterpart that is genetically identical except at the mating type locus (WY4 (MATa) and N114 (MATα), respectively; Ref. 10Tan Q. Li X. Sadhale P.P. Miyao T. Woychik N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8124-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were grown in yeast peptone dextrose broth at 24 °C to an A 600of 0.48–0.55 and then shifted to 37 °C by adding an equal volume of yeast peptone dextrose broth warmed to 50 °C. At specific times after the shift to 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20 °C and then frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at −70 °C. Total RNA for microarray analysis was prepared by the glass bead method (11Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 117-119Google Scholar). Total RNA for Northern or slot blot analysis was prepared by the hot phenol procedure (12Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of total RNA were loaded into each lane of 1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde. RNA was transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and cross-linked with ultraviolet light using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Immobilized RNA was hybridized with an excess of32P-labeled DNA probe at 42 °C in hybridization solution (5× SSPE (0.75 m NaCl, 50 mmNaH2PO4, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 50% formamide, 1× Denhardts (0.2 mg/ml Ficoll 400, 0.2 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 0.1 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, 0.3% SDS) and then washed with a solution containing 2× SSPE and 0.2% SDS at 45 °C. Band intensities for these and the remaining experiments were visualized on x-ray film and quantified by a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). The gene fragments used as radioactive probes were as follows:ACT1, 1.4-kb HindIII/EcoRI;PGK1, 0.72-kb BamHI/EcoRI;PDA1, 0.97-kb NcoI/HindIII;TUB2, 0.25-kb HindIII/KpnI;RPL5, 0.7-kb EcoRV/HincII;RPS14A, 0.75-kb NsiI/StyI;RPS14B, 1.0-kb NsiI/SphI;RPL3, 0.75-kb BglII/XbaI; andRPL28, 1.2-kb SpeI/EcoRI. Ten micrograms of total RNA was hybridized with an excess of32P end-labeled RNAP I- or III-specific oligonucleotide probe at 55 °C for 12–16 h in 50 μl of hybridization solution (0.3 m NaCl, 38 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). Mineral oil was overlaid to prevent evaporation of the hybridization mixture. Newly synthesized RNAP I and III transcripts were measured using oligonucleotides complementary to the junction of mature and processed RNA species, tryptophan tRNA for RNAP III (Fig. 5 A and Ref. 13Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and 25 S rRNA precursor for RNAP I (Fig. 4 A). After hybridization, 450 μl of S1 nuclease digestion solution (0.3 m NaCl, 60 mm NaOAc, pH 4.5, 2 mm ZnOAc, 0.02% Triton X-100, 150 units of S1 nuclease) was combined with the 50 μl of hybridization mixture and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The S1 nuclease digestion reaction was stopped upon mixture with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The reaction products were ethanol-precipitated and separated using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea.Figure 4Quantification of RNAP I transcript levels. A, 25 S rRNA oligonucleotide sequence, components, and approximate annealing location. B, S1 analysis of total RNA harvested at the time points indicated using the probe shown in panel A. The probe-only control demonstrated that the S1 treatment was effective since the six-nucleotide tail was cleaved from digested samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To analyze poly(A) RNA, 20 μg of total RNA was immobilized onto nitrocellulose membranes using a slot blot template (Bio-Rad), cross-linked with ultraviolet light, and hybridized with an excess of 32P end-labeled (dT)30 at 37 °C in the same hybridization solution described for Northern analysis. The membrane was washed at 37 °C with 2× SSPE containing 0.1% SDS. mRNA was purified using the Oligotex mRNA Kit (Qiagen) from total RNA (1.5 mg of wild type with a 24 °C shift, 1.5 mg of ΔRPB4 with a 24 °C shift, and 1.5 mg of wild type with a 37 °C shift for 45 min or 2.0 mg of ΔRPB4 with a 37 °C shift for 45 min). A range of concentrations of five poly(A)-tagged Bacillus subtilis RNA controls (Lys, ATCC number 87482; Phe, ATCC number 87483; Thr, ATCC number 87484; Trp, ATCC number 87485; Dap, ATCC number 87486) were added to each total RNA sample before mRNA purification. Plasmid was first purified from each of the five strains and digested with NotI. The poly(A)-tagged RNA was then synthesized using the NotI-digested template and the Megascript T3 IVT kit (Ambion). The transcription products were purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Addition of these controls allows for normalization of mRNA levels to total RNA levels,i.e. they ensure that the levels of all mRNAs analyzed on an individual array are compared with a fixed amount of total RNA from each strain. The double-stranded cDNA was made from mRNA using a high pressure liquid chromatography-purified primer (GENSET Corp.) with a 5′ T7 RNAP promoter sequence (GGC CAG TGA ATT GTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG AGG CGG-(dT)24) and the Superscript Choice System for cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies, Inc.). Double-stranded cDNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. In vitro transcription of the double-stranded cDNA template by T7 RNAP to generate biotin-labeled cRNA was carried out with the RNA Transcript Labeling kit (Enzo). The labeled cRNA was purified with the Rneasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The amount of labeled cRNA was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm with the assumption that 1 OD of cRNA, like single-stranded RNA, corresponds to a concentration of 40 μg/ml. Forty micrograms of cRNA was sent to the Research Genetics Genome Service Group for Affymetrix GeneChip® Expression Analysis (Research Genetics) on first a GeneChip® Test3 Array followed by a GeneChip® Yeast Genome S98 Array (Affymetrix). The hybridization mixture was spiked with another set of biotin labeled controls (bioB, bioC, bioD, and cre) to be used as standards for determination of mRNA levels and for normalization of expression levels between samples if necessary. Gene expression data was first analyzed by Research Genetics using GeneChip® software. We refined this data by twice applying a maximum a posteriori normalization technique for Affymetrix data (developed by Alex Hartemink at MIT; see psrg.lcs.mit.edu/publications/Papers/normabs.htm). This normalization method does not rely on knowing the molar concentrations of the Lys, Phe, Thr, Trp, and Dap controls; however, the amount of control added must be consistent between arrays. Also, different controls are weighted in the calculation according to their consistency. Thus, probes that show great variation between chips are weighted less in determining the rescaling factors. This alternate normalization procedure revealed that the Thr and Lys probes were an ill fit, and the normalization was applied using only the Trp, Phe, and Dap probes. The variances for the remaining probes then decreased from the initial normalization incorporating all five poly(A)-taggedB. subtilis RNA controls, indicating a better fit. Relevant output was provided as Microsoft Excel spread sheets in mutant samples compared with the respective wild type control or graphed as in Fig.1. RPB4 is one of two nonessential subunits of RNAP II. S. cerevisiaecells lacking RPB4 (ΔRPB4) grow at moderate temperatures but not above 32 °C or below 12 °C (14Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, variability in the viable temperature range can occur in different strain backgrounds. We prepared mRNA from ΔRPB4 and wild type cells at the permissive temperature (24 °C) and after 45 min at the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C. Samples were processed as recommended by Affymetrix, and the final cRNA product from each strain was subjected to Affymetrix GeneChip® Expression Analysis using GeneChip® Yeast Genome S98 Arrays. This array contains probes for over 6400 established S. cerevisiae open reading frames (ORFs), putative ORFs, and sequences of interest such as those encoding Ty element proteins, 2-μ plasmids, or mitochondrial proteins. Grid format representation of the genome-wide expression profiles of the ΔRPB4 mutant compared with wild type at the permissive temperature revealed a greater than 2-fold decrease in the expression of 26% of transcripts represented on the Affymetrix GeneChip® (Fig. 1,A and C). This decrease covers a variety of transcripts with no unifying features. However, upon temperature shift, a drastic decline in mRNA abundance occurred. Expression of nearly all (98%) transcripts on the Affymetrix GeneChip®decreased by 2-fold or more, and 96% decreased by 4-fold or more (Fig.1, B and D). These results suggest that RNAP II in ΔRPB4 cells is essentially inactivated at 37 °C. Of the nominal percentage of transcripts whose level did not decrease by at least 2-fold, only ∼0.5% were elevated by 2-fold or more. Over half of these induced transcripts were hypothetical open reading frames. The remaining handful of genes encoded mating type-specific genes (which are differentially expressed from the wild type strain of opposite mating type), a heat shock transcription factor, enzymes involved in glycogen degradation, genes involved in DNA damage response, and a few other proteins involved in unrelated processes. These mRNAs may be vestiges of an early and rapid stress response (before the enzyme is fully inactivated) since ΔRPB4 cells are more sensitive to heat stress than wild type cells. However, because of the mating type difference, some of these apparently induced mRNAs may simply result from differential expression. To examine how quickly the enzyme is inactivated at 37 °C, as well as confirm the whole genome expression data, we analyzed RNA samples from wild type and ΔRPB4 cells harvested 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 240 min after temperature shift. Steady state mRNA levels were assessed upon hybridization of (dT)30to equivalent amounts of immobilized total RNA samples (Fig.2 A). Our results show that ΔRPB4 cells have 46% lower levels of mRNA transcripts at permissive temperature relative to wild type. Upon temperature shift, there was a substantial (>5-fold), rapid, and sustained further decrease in steady state poly(A) RNA levels in mutant cells (a brief and minor drop in transcript levels due to the cellular stress response to heat shock is also noted in wild type cells; Fig. 2 A). These results corroborate the array data and indicate that transcription by RNAP II is severely impaired 15 min after exposure of cells to 37 °C. We also studied the effect of ΔRPB4 on transcription of a number of individual genes after temperature shift using conventional Northern analysis (Fig. 3). We analyzed four genes with relatively stable mRNA transcripts (half-lives greater than 25 min) at normal growth temperatures (30 °C),ACT1 (actin), PDA1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase α subunit), PGK1 (3-phosphoglycerate kinase), andTUB2 (tubulin; Fig. 3 A). We also measured mRNA levels of five ribosomal protein genes, RPL3 (L3),RPL5 (L5), RPS14A (S14A), RPS14B(S14B), and RPL28 (L28; Fig. 3 B). As documented previously, ribosomal protein transcript levels transiently drop in wild type cells after heat shock (Fig. 3 B, WT 15 min lanes, and Ref. 15Li B. Nierras C.R. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5393-5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ribosomal protein transcripts in ΔRPB4 did not display the same expression pattern (Fig. 3 B, ΔRPB4 15 min lanes). Instead, transcript levels for all nine genes gradually diminished after the shift to 37 °C. Heat shock also resulted in a more prolonged, but transient, decrease in the levels of two of the four nonribosomal protein transcripts in wild type cells (Fig. 3 A,PDA1 and TUB2). In contrast, in the ΔRPB4 mutant ACT1, PDA1, PGK1, andTUB2 mRNAs gradually decayed. The variability in mRNA decay rates of transcripts shown paralleled the published transcript half-lives (e.g. 30 min for ACT1 versus 45 min for PGK1). Ribosomal protein mRNAs are acutely sensitive to environmental changes. In wild type cells, a shift to 37 °C leads to a rapid, but temporary, drop in RPL3, RPL8, and RPL30 mRNA levels (15Li B. Nierras C.R. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5393-5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This phenomenon appears to result from transient repression, not from a temporary increase in ribosomal protein mRNA decay. Expression profiles of the five ribosomal protein transcripts from ΔRPB4 cells compared with wild type cells shifted to 37 °C revealed that this striking drop early after heat stress does not always occur in the mutant (Fig. 3 C). Defective repression may account for the altered mutant profiles since transcription of genes required for the sudden, specific repression of ribosomal protein genes may already be hampered in mutant cells. After 30 min, when ribosomal protein transcript levels normally begin to rebound, the ΔRPB4 RNA polymerase is nearly fully inactivated, so transcript levels continue to spiral downward. The expression data for the nine genes shown in Fig. 3 is consistent with our whole genome profiles since the levels of all transcripts decreased by 2-fold or more at the 45-min time point. In total, these results unequivocally demonstrate that the lethality of RPB4 at high temperatures is due to the shutdown of global gene expression. The rapid loss of RNAP II activity has been shown to have secondary effects on transcription by other RNA polymerases (16Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and on the abundance of ribosomal protein transcripts after temperature shift (15Li B. Nierras C.R. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5393-5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To assess the ramifications of the loss of RNAP II activity on that of RNAP I and III, we measured the levels of newly synthesized tRNA (RNAP III) or rRNA (RNAP I) transcripts. tRNAs and rRNAs are extremely stable in comparison to mRNA transcripts (which have relatively short half-lives). Therefore, quantification of steady state levels of any given rRNA or tRNA is not an accurate barometer of changes in RNAP I or III activity. RNAP I transcript levels were measured using a 35 S rRNA precursor oligonucleotide that was complementary to the junction of the rapidly processed spacer between the 5.8 and 25 S rRNA transcript and 5′ end of the 25 S rRNA transcript (Fig.4 A). After annealing of the radioactively labeled oligonucleotide to RNA, the reactions were treated with S1 nuclease, and the products were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The activity of RNAP I goes down in the ΔRPB4 mutant, an effect also noted with two other mutants in either RPB1 or Srb4 that causes a rapid and comprehensive shutdown of RNAP II (Fig. 4 B; Refs. 16Thompson C.M.

This response is triggered by amino acid deprivation (indirectly in this case due to the severe reduction in expression of amino acid genes and of genes encoding components of amino acid synthetic pathways) that leads to reduced synthesis of ribosomal proteins and rRNA. However, unlike the bacterial stringent response, tRNA and most mRNA synthesis is unaffected when yeast cells engage the standard stringent response upon direct amino acid deprivation. For RNAP III, we used a tRNA oligonucleotide probe that is complementary to an intron-exon junction of a rapidly processed yeast tRNA (Fig. 5 A). Our studies followed the synthesis of tryptophan tRNA in mutant and wild type cells (13Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In this case, we found no decrease in the abundance of the newly synthesized tryptophan tRNA transcript (Fig. 5 B,tRNAW). Therefore, the ΔRPB4 mutant directly acts on RNAP II causing a decrease in RNAP I, but not RNAP III, activity. We have demonstrated that deletion of the S. cerevisiae RPB4 gene results in 1) enzyme inactivation at high temperature and 2) a decrease in transcription of a portion of genes at permissive temperature. This decrease in transcript levels is specifically associated with enzyme inactivation, not an increase in mRNA decay since the enzyme lacking RPB4 and RPB7 is severely deficient in gene-specific RNAP II activity in vitro (7Orlicky S.M.

Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This defect can be reversed in vitro by the addition of purified RNAP II (7Orlicky S.M. Tran P.T. Sayre M.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10097-10102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8124-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Structural studies of RNAP II purified from ΔRPB4 cells compared with the wild type enzyme also reveal that the portion of the enzyme that clamps DNA exists in a more open, less stable conformation (8Asturias F.J. Meredith G.D. Poglitsch C.L. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Jensen G.J. Meredith G. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Based on cumulative structural data (placing RPB4 and RPB7 downstream of the catalytic site in the center of the 25-Å cleft of the enzyme; Ref. 4Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Maier-Davis B. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Edwards A.M. David P.R. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2000; 288: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and biochemical data, Orlicky et al. (7Orlicky S.M. Tran P.T. Sayre M.H. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10097-10102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) speculate that the RPB4·RPB7 subcomplex functions in stabilization of the promoter complex before initiation and/or stabilization of the early transcription complex before promoter escape. Therefore, the temperature-dependent alterations in enzyme activity documented here and published previously may result from the complete (at 37 °C) or partial (at 24 °C) inability of RNAP II to form a stable association with the single-stranded DNA template or nascent RNA transcript. Our whole genome expression profiles showed that at permissive temperature 26% of transcripts decreased by at least 2-fold relative to wild type (of these, 4% decreased by 4-fold or more). Therefore, the defects in ΔRPB4 transcriptional activation seen at the permissive temperature recently reported by our laboratory and others (10Tan Q. Li X. Sadhale P.P. Miyao T. Woychik N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8124-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Pillai B. Sampath V. Sharma N. Sadhale P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30641-30647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) likely extend beyond activation since a relatively large percentage of transcripts are affected. This 26% decrease does not closely correlate with the data we obtained for the permissive temperature time points of total RNA probed with (dT)30(Fig. 2, O h), where we measured a 46% overall decrease in steady state mRNA levels recovered from ΔRPB4 cells before the temperature shift. This inconsistency is not surprising since each value was derived from different approaches. For example, expression of many genes may fall below normal levels but not reach the threshold 2-fold decrease required for inclusion in the whole genome expression data. Also, there may be inherent differences in mRNA levels at various phases of logarithmic phase growth. Transcription alterations in ΔRPB4 cells parallel those documented for the rpb1-1 mutant. This mutant contains a single G1437D amino acid change in conserved region H near the point where the carboxyl-terminal repeat domain of RPB1 emerges from the structure.rpb1-1 displays a rapid and virtually complete shutdown of mRNA synthesis upon a temperature shift to 37 °C (17Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar, 21Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).rpb1-1 is frequently used as either 1) a tool to study the ramifications of the absence of mRNA transcription on a variety of other cellular processes or 2) a tool to inhibit mRNA synthesis so that mRNA stability can be studied. Our data indicate that the effects of the RPB4 deletion mirror those of rpb1-1; each causes a rapid inactivation of RNAP II activity at 37 °C. In each mutant, this severe depletion of RNAP II activity results in a corresponding decrease in RNAP I activity but has no effect of RNAP III activity. Finally, as with rpb1-1, we observed that ribosomal protein mRNA levels in the ΔRPB4 mutant do not drop rapidly and recover after exposure to 37 °C but instead decay gradually (Fig. 3, B and C, and Ref. 15Li B. Nierras C.R. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5393-5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The production of a stable deletion of the chromosomal copy of RPB4 is a simple, one-step procedure (22Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). In contrast, creation of a chromosomal point mutation is more time-consuming (22Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Therefore, as proposed earlier (23Maillet I. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22586-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the ΔRPB4 mutant can be used in a straightforward method for creation of strains that enable heat inactivation of RNAP II in vivo. Also, the ΔRPB4 mutant can be used to study the effects of other mutations in RPB1 on post-transcriptional events (e.g. the effect of carboxyl-terminal repeat domain mutants on mRNA processing events). However, since approximately one-quarter of all genes show a decrease in expression by 2-fold or more in ΔRPB4 cells, care must be taken to determine that the particular process of interest is not perturbed at permissive temperature in the deletion background. Whole genome expression data for rpb1-1 cells at permissive temperature (either 24 °C or the normal permissive temperature of 30 °C) is not currently available. Of the hundreds of RNAP mutants studied to date, only two RNAP subunit mutants, a point mutation in RPB1 (rpb1-1) and now the ΔRPB4 mutant, are known to rapidly inactivate the enzyme at high temperatures. Select mutants in RNAP II holoenzyme components (Med2, Med6, Srb10, Srb4, and Srb5) have been subjected to whole genome expression analyses (17Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I.

Only the srb4-138 mutant causes a rapid and extensive decrease in transcript levels analogous torpb1-1 (16Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). In the srb4-138 point mutant, 93% of the 5361 genes scored (the number of genes whose expression decreased by 2-fold or more in rpb1-1) were down 2-fold or more (17Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G.

Although the decrease in gene expression in thesrb4-138 mutant is broad, it is not quite as comprehensive as the 98% decrease seen with the ΔRPB4 mutant. For many years, studies have focused almost exclusively on the defective heat stress responses noted in the absence of RPB4 (25Choder M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6358-6363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Sheffer A. Varon M. Choder M.

However, our data demonstrates that this defect represents only a portion of the total picture. Maillet et al. (23Maillet I. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22586-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) also found inconsistencies in the previously proposed links between ΔRPB4 cells and the stress response deficiencies. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of wild type versus ΔRPB4 proteins revealed a lack of induction of more than 50 heat shock proteins in the mutant at 38 °C, while other stresses were unaffected (23Maillet I. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22586-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The protein expression patterns in ΔRPB4 and rpb1-1 mutants were similar under 38 °C heat shock conditions, and the levels of three RNAP II transcripts, DED1, ACT1, andSTE2, decreased in the ΔRPB4 mutant (23Maillet I. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22586-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Consequently, Maillet et al. (23Maillet I. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22586-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) suggested that both rpb1-1and ΔRPB4 cells have a general effect on transcription at the nonpermissive temperature. Another laboratory had also found minimal effects on transcriptional activation upon cell wall stress or exposure to high salt (29Bourbonnais Y. Faucher N. Pallotta D. Larouche C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our results support the earlier studies and conclusively demonstrate that the transcriptional ramifications of the ΔRPB4 subunit are analogous to those of rpb1-1. The effects of the deletion of the RPB4 are global and are not limited to heat shock or other stress proteins. Therefore, this mutant can be used as an alternate, easier tool for creation of a heat-inactivatible RNAP II enzyme. Plasmids were kindly provided by T. Kinzy, J. Dinman, and K. Arndt.

The cells can be induced by retinoic acid to undergo endodermal differentiation. The retinoic acid-induced differentiation accompanies cell growth suppression, and thus, F9 cells are also often used as a model for analysis of retinoic acid biological activity. We have recently shown that MAPK activation and c-Fos expression are uncoupled in F9 cells upon retinoic acid-induced endodermal differentiation. The expression of the candidate tumor suppressor Disabled-2 is induced and correlates with cell growth suppression in F9 cells. We were not able to establish stable Disabled-2 expression by cDNA transfection in F9 cells without induction of spontaneous cell differentiation. Transient transfection of Dab2 by adenoviral vector nevertheless suppresses Elk-1 phosphorylation, c-Fos expression, and cell growth. In PA-1, another teratocarcinoma cell line of human origin that has no or very low levels of Disabled-2, retinoic acid fails to induce Disabled-2, correlating with a lack of growth suppression, although PA-1 is responsive to retinoic acid in morphological change. Transfection and expression of Disabled-2 in PA-1 cells mimic the effects of retinoic acid on growth suppression; the Disabled-2-expressing cells reach a much lower saturation density, and serum-stimulated c-Fos expression is greatly suppressed and disassociated from MAPK activation. Thus, Dab2 is one of the principal genes induced by retinoic acid involved in cell growth suppression, and expression of Dab2 alone is sufficient for uncoupling of MAPK activation and c-Fos expression. Resistance to retinoic acid regulation in PA-1 cells likely results from defects in retinoic acid up-regulation of Dab2 expression.

In vertebrates, retinoic acid plays a role in inducing cell lineage in early embryonic development, and defects in retinoic acid metabolism or exposure may result in abnormal development (9De Luca L.M.

Retinoic acid induces gene expression and differentiation in many cell types in culture and exhibits growth suppressive activity in a wide spectrum of tumor cells. Furthermore, retinoic acid has been used successfully to treat leukemia and has been explored for use in treating other malignancies (14Zhang D. Holmes W.F. Wu S. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. J. Cell.

In in vitro studies of cultured tumor cells, retinoic acid suppresses cyclin D induction and saturation cell density but does not affect log phase cell growth (17Wu S. Donigan A. Platsoucas C.D.

Endocrinol. 1998; 143: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One of the several possible mechanisms postulated for the effect of retinoic acid on cell growth inhibition is the suppression of AP-1 activity (19Soprano D.R. Chen L.X. Wu S. Donigan A. Borghaei R.C. Soprano K.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 577-584PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lin F. Xiao D. Kolluri S.K. Zhang X. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3271-3280PubMed Google Scholar), which is the target of activation of the Ras/MEK (kinase for MAPK or Erk)/MAPK pathway by many mitogens. Retinoic acid also induces the transforming growth factor-β pathway, another route for tumor/growth suppression in some systems (21Han G.R. Dohi D.F. Lee H.Y. Rajah R. Walsh G.L. Hong W. Cohen P. Kurie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13711-13716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The action of retinoic acid is mediated through nuclear receptors that in turn modulate gene expression (9De Luca L.M.

One of the remarkable changes in cell properties identified recently is that retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 cells accompanies the uncoupling of MAPK activation and c-Fos expression (24Smith E.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32094-32100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), although the mediators of this retinoic acid-induced alteration have not been identified. In addition, some tumor cells develop resistance to growth suppression by retinoic acid (25Early E. Dmitrovsky E. J. Investig. Med. 1995; 43: 337-344PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of retinoic acid receptors accounts for some cases, but other unidentified mechanisms must exist (19Soprano D.R. Chen L.X. Wu S. Donigan A. Borghaei R.C. Soprano K.J.

In this study using F9 (retinoic acid-sensitive) and PA-1 (retinoic acid-resistant) teratocarcinoma cell lines, we identified the candidate tumor suppressor Dab2 as a retinoic acid-inducible gene in F9 cells but not in PA-1 cells. Dab2 was found to mediate the retinoic acid effect on cell growth inhibition by suppressing c-Fos induction without altering MAPK activation. Transfection/expression of Dab2 is sufficient for cell growth suppression, suggesting that Dab2 is the major mediator of retinoic acid in cell growth suppression. Moreover, the failure or inability to induce Dab2 may be a mechanism for the resistance of tumor cells to retinoic acid in growth suppression. Retinoic acid (all-trans-, 9-cis-retinoic acid) and β-carotene were purchased from Sigma. Tissue culture supplies were obtained from Fisher. DMEM medium was purchased from Mediatech (Herndon, VA); fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Atlanta Biologicals (Atlanta, GA); TRIzol reagent, 100× antibiotic-antimycotic solution, LipofectAMINE, and serum-free Opti-MEM I medium were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; the ECL Super-Signal West Dura extended duration substrate immunodetection reagents were purchased from Pierce; Hybrisol I hybridization solution came from Intergen (Purchase, NY); positively charged nylon membranes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; [α-32P]dCTP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other general chemicals and supplies including Me2SO, ethanol, isopropanol, and agarose were from Sigma or Fisher and were reagent grade or higher. F9 mouse teratocarcinoma and PA-1 human teratocarcinoma cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The PA-1 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution. F9 cells were cultured on gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution. The plates were coated with an autoclaved 0.1% gelatin solution overnight at 4 °C, then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline before use. Retinoids were added to cells from a 1 mm stock solution in Me2SO. If it is not specifically stated, all-trans-retinoic acid was used. Control cultures contained an equal volume of Me2SO alone. Usually, retinoic acid was added 24 h after plating of cells. Cell growth was determined by either triplicate counting with a hemacytometer or measured using the MTT assay (Promega). The results of MTT assay agreed well with those from cell counting. Anti-Dab2 antibodies were characterized as previously described (2Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Anti-Dab2 (p96) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); anti-c-Fos came from Santa Cruz Technology; anti-actin came from Sigma; anti-Erk1/2 and anti-phospho-Erk1/2 came from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Immunoblotting was performed according to standard procedures, as described previously (5Fazili Z. Sun W. Mittelstaedt S. Cohen C. Xu X.X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3104-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 6Sheng Z. Sun W. Smith E. Cohen C. Sheng Z. Xu X.X.

After confirmation of antibody selectivity, in some cases two or more antibodies were used simultaneously in an incubation to detect various molecular weight proteins. Total RNA was isolated from cell monolayers according to the TRIzol method (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was separated on 1% agarose gel containing 7% formaldehyde and 20 mm MOPS buffer, transferred to positive-charged nylon membranes using 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) buffer, and fixed by baking. DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random prime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The hybridization and Northern blotting followed standard procedures as described previously (2Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Genomics. 2000; 70: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or murine Dab2 (2Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) cDNA was inserted into the pcDNA/zeo (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA) or pMT-CB6+ eukaryotic expression vectors. Plasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen Maxiprep columns. For transfection, 2 μg of Dab2 or vector plasmid DNA were mixed with 20 μl LipofectAMINE in 1 ml of Opti-MEM and added to PA-1 or F9 cells for 16 h. F9 cells were transfected with mouse Dab2 cDNA, and PA-1 cells were transfected with human Dab2 cDNA. The transfection medium was removed, and fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS was added. After 12 h, transfected cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 300 ng/ml zeomycin for selection of pcDNA/zeo vector or 400 μg/ml G418 for selection of pMT-CB6+ vector. This selection medium was changed every 2 days, and after 10–12 days cloning rings were used to isolate positive clones. Cultures were further expanded and examined for Dab2 expression by Western blotting. F9 cells were also transfected with metallothionein promoter-regulated mouse Dab2 construct in pMT-CB6+ vector, and green fluorescent protein in pMT-CB6+ vector was used as a control. To induce expression, 0.1 mm ZnSO4 was added to the medium for 24–72 h. Cell monolayers were released from plates with 0.25% trypsin, 0.1% EDTA and collected by centrifugation. The cells were then fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C, pelleted, and re-suspended in 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 4 °C. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry performed on a FACScan equipped with argon-ion laser and analyzed by Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). Replication-deficient adenovirus expressing Dab2 p96 or p67 spliced forms or β-galactosidase were produced, purified, and titrated as described previously (6Sheng Z. Sun W. Smith E. Cohen C. Sheng Z. Xu X.X. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For transfection of F9 or PA-1 cells, 100 multiplicity plaque-forming units of adenovirus were added to the cells in medium with low serum (1% FBS) for 4 h. The cells were then used for further experimental manipulation. Under these conditions, more than 90% of the F9 cells expressed the transfected cDNA, as estimated using adenovirus-expressing β-galactosidase. Dab2, a candidate tumor suppressor, is lost in a wide spectrum of tumor tissues and cultured carcinoma cells (5Fazili Z. Sun W. Mittelstaedt S. Cohen C. Xu X.X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3104-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To evaluate mechanisms for its loss, we examined potential factors that might affect Dab2 expression. Dab1, the human ortholog that is mainly expressed in brain, can be induced by retinoic acid in the embryonic P19 carcinoma cell line (29Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and by thyroid hormone (T3 and T4) (30Sheldon M. Nakajima K. Bernal J. Howell B.W. Curran T. Soriano E. Munoz A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6979-6993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus we investigated and found that Dab2 can also be induced by retinoic acid in the mouse embryonic teratocarcinoma F9 cell line, which is widely used as a model for studying effects of retinoic acid in gene transcription and cell differentiation. Another recent report also confirmed the ability of retinoic acid to induce Dab2 expression (31Cho S.Y. Cho S.Y. Lee S.H. Park S.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 30: 179-184Google Scholar). We found that retinoic acid induces expression of both of the two variably spliced forms of Dab2, p96 and p67 (2Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), in F9 cells. The effect is time (Fig. 1 A)- and dose-dependent (Fig. 1 B). High levels of Dab2 protein were induced after treatment with retinoic acid for 4 days, and as little as 10−8m retinoic acid stimulated Dab2 protein expression. Retinoic acid treatment caused greater induction of the p67 form of Dab2, which differs from the expression pattern of Dab2 isoforms found in other cells in which p96 is generally the major or only isoform (2Xu X.X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 5Fazili Z. Sun W. Mittelstaedt S. Cohen C. Xu X.X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3104-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The induction of Dab2 by retinoic acid occurs at the transcriptional level, because the Dab2 message RNA is induced in a similar magnitude as the protein (Fig. 1 C). Withdrawal of retinoic acid 4 days after induction did not reverse or decrease Dab2 protein levels (Fig. 1 D), and even a month after retinoic acid removal F9 cells continued to express Dab2 (not shown). These results correlate Dab2 expression with the irreversible endoderm differentiation of F9 cells by retinoic acid treatment. Among the retinoids tested, all-trans-retinoid acid is the most potent in the induction of Dab2 (Fig. 1 E). 9-cis-Retinoic acid can induce Dab2 expression in F9 cells, but the required dosage is about 100 times more than that of all-trans-retinoic acid, andN-(4-hydroxylphenyl)retinamide (fenretinide or 4-HPR) and β-carotene (vitamin A) have no detectable activity (Fig. 1 E). In the PA-1 teratocarcinoma cell line, however, retinoic acid treatment for 4 days did not induce Dab2 expression (Fig. 2 A). PA-1 cells were derived from a human ovarian germ cell tumor (32Zeuthen J. Norgaard J.O. Avner P. Fellous M. Wartiovaara J. Vaheri A. Rosen A. Giovanella B.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 25: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and are resistant to growth suppression by retinoic acid (19Soprano D.R. Chen L.X. Wu S. Donigan A. Borghaei R.C. Soprano K.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 577-584PubMed Google Scholar, 33Taylor D.D. Taylor C.G. Black P.H. Jiang C.G. Chou I.N.

Cancer. 1992; 51: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), in contrast to F9 cells. Longer duration of treatment with 1 μm retinoic acid for 2 weeks still failed to induce Dab2 expression in PA-1 cells (data not shown). The lack of Dab2 induction occurs at the transcriptional level, because no changes in DAB2 mRNA were observed (Fig. 2 B). RNA from ES2 cells, a Dab2-positive ovarian cancer cell line (5Fazili Z. Sun W. Mittelstaedt S. Cohen C. Xu X.X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3104-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. In parallel experiments, retinoic acid inhibited the growth of F9 cells in a time (Fig. 3 A)- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C) and also caused morphological changes of the cells in culture (Fig. 3 D). Suppression of cell growth correlated with the induction of Dab2 expression since both occurred at day 3 after treatment with retinoic acid. F9 cells treated with retinoic acid for 4 days were well separated and dispersed compared with non-treated cells, which appeared tightly packed and physically connected. In contrast, retinoic acid had no effect on PA-1 cell growth (Fig. 3, B and C), although a morphological change was seen, in agreement with previous reports (19Soprano D.R. Chen L.X. Wu S. Donigan A. Borghaei R.C. Soprano K.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 577-584PubMed Google Scholar, 33Taylor D.D. Taylor C.G. Black P.H. Jiang C.G. Chou I.N. Differentiation. 1990; 43: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 34Le-Ruppert K. Masters J.R. Knuechel R. Seegers S. Tainsky M.A. Hofstaedter F. Buettner R. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 51: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In PA-1 cells treated with 1 μmretinoic acid for 4 days (Fig. 3 E), cells appear to be less elongated and the nuclei more pronounced. Thus, retinoic acid induces morphological changes and cell growth suppression in F9 cells and induces morphological changes but no growth suppression in PA-1 cells. Resistance to retinoic acid-induced growth suppression, therefore, correlates with a lack of Dab2 induction. To examine the effect of Dab2 on cell growth and morphology, a Dab2 expression construct was transfected into both F9 and PA-1 cells. In F9 cells transfected with Dab2, only three G418-resistant colonies were selected compared with 64 resistant colonies of vector controls in parallel transfection. After expansion of the three Dab2-transfected clones, none were found to express the Dab2 protein as detected by Western blotting. We then transfected F9 cells with mouse Dab2 p96 construct under the control of the metallothionein promoter (pMT-CB6+ vector). In 48 clones selected for analysis, at least 6 clones appear to express the Dab2 p96 protein (Fig. 4 A). However, we have also observed that the ZnSO4-induced F9 cells undergo differentiation without retinoic acid; the cells also express the p67 form of Dab2 (although these were transfected with the p96 form of Dab2), and the cells also express GATA-4, GATA-6, collagen IV α2, and laminin, which are markers for differentiated endoderm cells. Thus, we conclude that it is not possible to obtain stable Dab2-expressing F9 cells without also inducing spontaneous retinoic acid-independent differentiation. However, we are able to transiently express Dab2 by adenoviral approach (Fig. 4 B) without inducing differentiation of the F9 cells, as judged by the lack of expression of the p67 spliced form of Dab2, GATA-4, and GATA-6. Dab2 expression by the adenoviral approach suppresses F9 cell growth (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that retinoic acid-induced Dab2 expression is responsible for the cell growth inhibitory activity of retinoic acid in F9 cells. There are undoubtedly many differences in the genetic background and properties of mouse F9 and human PA-1 teratocarcinoma cells, although both cell lines have some properties of embryonic stem cells. Although both are undifferentiated and multipotent, PA-1 cells synthesize collagen IV and laminin (32Zeuthen J. Norgaard J.O. Avner P. Fellous M. Wartiovaara J. Vaheri A. Rosen A. Giovanella B.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 25: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 33Taylor D.D. Taylor C.G. Black P.H. Jiang C.G. Chou I.N.

Cancer. 1992; 51: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), unlike F9 cells, which do not express collagen IV and laminin before retinoic acid-induced differentiation (26Faria T.N. Mendelsohn C. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26783-26788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). After transfection of PA-1 cells with a Dab2 expression construct, 16 colonies were selected compared with 54 colonies from vector-transfected controls. All of the Dab2-transfected colonies developed much more slowly (estimated to be 20-fold less based on cell number) than colonies from vector-transfected controls, as shown in Fig. 5 A for a typical example of a G418-selected colony. Under identical culture conditions, the Dab2-transfected cells appeared well separated from each other within a colony, whereas the vector-transfected control cells in a colony were aggregated and indistinguishable from parental cells. In an earlier passage with a cell number of about 1 × 105cells/colony, Dab2 expression was detected. Only the p96 form of Dab2 but not the p67 form was expressed, suggesting that Dab2 expression was the result of cDNA transfection and not spontaneous differentiation. However, as cultures were expanded, the morphological difference diminished, and Dab2 expression was gradually lost in most of the clones. For three colonies, Dab2 expression remained after several passages, and the morphological changes, although not as obvious as for the cells in earlier passages, were still apparent compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 5 B). Additionally, these Dab2-expressing cells exhibited a reduced growth rate compared with vector-transfected controls (Fig. 5 C). The ability to form colonies on agar plates was suppressed upon Dab2 expression (Fig. 5 D). Therefore, transfection experiments indicate that expression of Dab2 suppresses cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation and alters cell-cell adhesion. Moreover, these changes correlate well with alterations in the cell cycle. Under identical culture conditions as described above, the two transfected PA-1 clones with detectable Dab2 expression (clones 9 and 13) had an increase in the percentage of cells in G1 and a corresponding decrease of cells in S phase compared with vector-transfected or parental cells (Table I). Thus, Dab2 inhibits cell growth by suppressing G1 phase progression, which is similar to the effect of retinoic acid on the cell cycle (17Wu S. Donigan A. Platsoucas C.D. Jung W. Soprano D.R.

Whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 occurs in all cells, activation of Stat5 by IFN-γ is cell type-restricted. Here we investigated the mechanism of Stat5 activation by the IFN-γ receptor. In transfection assays both Stat5 isoforms, Stat5a and Stat5b, were phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to IFN-γ. Stat5 activation required the presence of tyrosine 420 (Tyr-420) in the murine IFNGR1 receptor chain, which also serves as the Stat1 binding site. Moreover, a peptide including Tyr-440, the Stat1 binding site of the human IFNGR1 chain, conferred the ability upon a synthetic receptor to activate Stat5. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) inhibited the activation of Stat5 by the IFN-γ receptor, and the Tyr-440-containing peptide stretch was sufficient for repression. SOCS3 expression had little effect on the activity of Jak kinases not associated with cytokine receptors. In IFN-γ-treated, Stat1-deficient fibroblasts Stat5 was inefficient in inducing transcription of a Stat-dependent reporter gene, suggesting it does not per se make a major contribution to the expression of IFN-γ-responsive genes.

Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). The IFN-γR is composed of two different chains, IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, that bind, respectively, the Jak1 and Jak2 tyrosine kinases (2Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar). Binding of IFN-γ to its receptor stimulates the activity of the Jak kinases, which phosphorylate Tyr-440 in the IFNGR1 receptor chain (3Farrar M.A. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

The phosphorylated tyrosine serves as a docking site for signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1), an SH2 domain-containing transcription factor. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor-associated Stat1 by the Jaks is followed by the translocation of the dimerized protein to the cell nucleus where it binds to GAS promoter sequences and induces the transcription of IFN-γ-responsive genes (7Decker T.

Stat3 or Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation has been reported to occur in a number of cell types upon treatment with IFN-γ (12Meinke A. Barahmand-pour F. Wöhrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Caldenhoven E. Buitenhuis M. van Dijk T.B. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the case of Stat5, preferential activation of only one of two Stat5 isoforms, Stat5a, was noted (12Meinke A. Barahmand-pour F. Wöhrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for Stat5 activation by the IFN-γR is not known, and there are at present no explanations for isoform selectivity or cell type specificity of its activation. Moreover, the biological implications of deploying Stat5 in response to IFN-γ are unclear. Mice with a targeted disruption of the Stat5a and/or Stat5b isoforms have not been analyzed for defects in IFN responses, and these investigations might be hampered by the fact that such animals develop defective T cell immunity that obscures any effects of Stat5 deficiency on the IFN-γ response (14Liu X.

For example, SOCS1 (or Jab) efficiently binds to the phosphorylated activation loop of Jaks and obstructs their ability to bind and phosphorylate substrates (21Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H.

By contrast, the ability of SOCS3 to inhibit Jaks directly is controversial (22Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A. Starr R. Zhang J.G. Baca M. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A.

However, IFN-γ is a pleiotropic cytokine exerting a plethora of effects on the activation, growth, and differentiation of cells (46Trinchieri G. Perussia B. Immunol.

Thus, one might argue that effects of Stat5 or Stat3 deficiency on the IFN-γ response are not readily overt because other cytokines compensate. Moreover, the absence of Stat3/5 in an IFN-γ response might cause only minor alterations that are hard to detect, particularly if analyzed against a background of more severe phenotypes caused by tissue-restricted Stat3 ablation (48Akira S.

Mutation of Tyr-420 strongly reduces Stat5 activation. Vice versa, addition of the Tyr-440-containing peptide to a synthetic receptor strongly stimulates the ability of that receptor to activate both Stat1 and Stat5. By contrast, the addition of the EpoR peptide containing Tyr-343, the major Stat5 binding site, specifically resulted in Stat5 but not Stat1 activation. Therefore, not all Stat5 binding sites are intrinsically promiscuous for Stat1 binding. On the other hand, receptor binding sites may be shared between Stats, as in the case of gp130, where Stat1 and Stat3 can bind to the same phosphorylated tyrosine (49Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar), or the interleukin-9 receptor, where a single tyrosine residue was shown to cause activation of Stats 1, 3, and 5 (50Demoulin J.B.

Some ability to activate Stat5 was retained by IFN-γ receptors containing the Y420F mutant of the IFNGR1 chain or by the ΔBR synthetic receptor without a Stat binding site. Our previous studies suggest this may be because of a direct interaction between the Jak kinase domain and Stat5 (51Barahmand-Pour F. Meinke A. Groner B. Decker T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12567-12575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Our studies further show that the IFN-γ receptor has no intrinsic ability to distinguish between the Stat5a and Stat5b isoforms. This possibility was suggested by our earlier finding in hematopoietic progenitor cells where IFN-γ treatment resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a but not of Stat5b despite expression of both proteins (12Meinke A. Barahmand-pour F. Wöhrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that Stat5 activation by the IFN-γR is determined by threshold levels of expression that may in some cells be exceeded by Stat5a but not Stat5b. Alternatively, ancillary proteins may form complexes with Stat5a in some cells and create increased affinity for the IFN-γR complex.Compared with Stat1, Stat5, activated by the IFN-γR, displayed very little ability to support transcription of a transfected reporter gene. Similar observations were made with Stat5 in the case of GM-CSF or Epo-treated cells (12Meinke A. Barahmand-pour F. Wöhrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1999; 98: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), but the protein clearly affects the generation of monocytes/macrophages in response to GM-CSF (35Kieslinger M. Woldman I. Moriggl R. Hofmann J. Marine J.C. Ihle J.N. Beug H. Decker T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 232-244PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with studies on its transactivation domain (54Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J. Kammer W. Heim M. Wissler M. Stocklin E. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3663-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), Stat5 may not per se be a potent transcription factor but, rather, may require interaction with other DNA-binding proteins to stimulate gene expression. Another important activity of Stat5 may lie in its ability to mediate gene repression. This assumption emerged from both studies in cultured cells (55Luo G. Yu-Lee L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26841-26849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the analysis of knock-out mice (16Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D. Wang D. Brown M. Bodner S. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), which suggested a role for Stat5 in suppressing the expression of the testosterone 15α-hydroxylase gene in male mice.SOCS3 inhibited both Stat1 and Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation by the synthetic Tyr-440 receptor with similar efficiency, suggesting that the mechanism of inhibition may be the same in both cases. In agreement with the results by others (22Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A. Starr R. Zhang J.G. Baca M. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that SOCS3 inhibition of Stat1 or Stat5 activation cannot be explained entirely by the effect of the protein on Jak kinases. The gp130 Jak binding site of the synthetic receptor was shown to associate with Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 (56Lutticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 57Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Ihle J.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic Jak2 and Tyk2 could not be efficiently inhibited by even high amounts of co-transfected SOCS3. Surprisingly, Jak1 was inhibited by low amounts of SOCS3, but inhibition was lost with increasing SOCS3 expression. We have no explanation for this dose effect, but comparison to the dose response of Stat inhibition by the complete synthetic receptor rules out the possibility that our results are entirely due to a direct interaction between SOCS3 and Jak1. We propose that Jak inhibition by SOCS3 might be more efficient when Jaks are associated with receptors. Possibly receptor chains stabilize the Jak-SOCS complex, as has been suggested for the interleukin-2 receptor β-chain (24Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and/or increase the ability of SOCS3 to inhibit Jaks (26Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Shouda T. Kitamura T. Dikic I. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29338-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Alternatively or additionally, SOCS3 might itself bind to the phosphorylated Tyr-440 of the synthetic receptor via its SH2 domain and compete for Stat binding. This mode of action has been suggested in the case of Epo receptor Tyr-401, which also associates with Stat5 (26Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Shouda T. Kitamura T. Dikic I. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29338-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and for the insulin receptor (27Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our studies show that promiscuity of a receptor binding site is the basis of Stat5 activation by IFN-γ and that this phosphorylated tyrosine suffices to mediate inhibition by SOCS3 in the case of both Stat1 and Stat5. We suggest that tissue-restricted Stat5 activation by the IFN-γR is determined by threshold levels of expression, but this assumption needs to be confirmed in future studies. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)1 is a cytokine with pleiotropic effects on both innate and adaptive immune responses. It activates macrophages for enhanced antibacterial performance and contributes to tumor surveillance and antiviral immunity (1Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). The IFN-γR is composed of two different chains, IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, that bind, respectively, the Jak1 and Jak2 tyrosine kinases (2Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar). Binding of IFN-γ to its receptor stimulates the activity of the Jak kinases, which phosphorylate Tyr-440 in the IFNGR1 receptor chain (3Farrar M.A. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 571-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 4Bach E.A. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 677-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosine serves as a docking site for signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1), an SH2 domain-containing transcription factor. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor-associated Stat1 by the Jaks is followed by the translocation of the dimerized protein to the cell nucleus where it binds to GAS promoter sequences and induces the transcription of IFN-γ-responsive genes (7Decker T. Kovarik P. Meinke A. J. Interferon Cytokine. Res. 1997; 17: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 8Decker T. Kovarik P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The essential character of Stat1 in the biology of IFN-γ was demonstrated by targeted disruption of its gene in mice, which resulted in severely compromised innate immunity and adverse effects on the regulation of Th cell generation and function (9Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J. Dighe A.S. Kaplan D.H. Riley J.K. Greenlund A.C. Campbell D. Carver Moore K. DuBois R.N. Clark R. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D.

Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ability of the IFN-γR to activate Stats is not restricted to Stat1. Stat3 or Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation has been reported to occur in a number of cell types upon treatment with IFN-γ (12Meinke A. Barahmand-pour F. Wöhrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Caldenhoven E. Buitenhuis M. van Dijk T.B. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the case of Stat5, preferential activation of only one of two Stat5 isoforms, Stat5a, was noted (12Meinke A. Barahmand-pour F. Wöhrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for Stat5 activation by the IFN-γR is not known, and there are at present no explanations for isoform selectivity or cell type specificity of its activation. Moreover, the biological implications of deploying Stat5 in response to IFN-γ are unclear. Mice with a targeted disruption of the Stat5a and/or Stat5b isoforms have not been analyzed for defects in IFN responses, and these investigations might be hampered by the fact that such animals develop defective T cell immunity that obscures any effects of Stat5 deficiency on the IFN-γ response (14Liu X.

The suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) genes are induced by activated Stats, and SOCS exert feedback inhibition on cytokine receptor signaling (reviewed in Refs. 18Hilton D.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1568-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Rothman P.

Immunol. 2000; 18: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Different members of the SOCS family appear to apply different modes of repressing Stat activation. For example, SOCS1 (or Jab) efficiently binds to the phosphorylated activation loop of Jaks and obstructs their ability to bind and phosphorylate substrates (21Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). By contrast, the ability of SOCS3 to inhibit Jaks directly is controversial (22Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A. Starr R. Zhang J.G. Baca M. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A.

It appears that SOCS3 is a more potent inhibitor when bound to a cytokine receptor chain either by competing for Stat binding or through an increased inhibitory activity on Jak activity (24Cohney S.J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 52Gouilleux F. Pallard C. Dusanter Fourt I. Wakao H. Haldosen L.A. Norstedt G. Levy D. Groner B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The exact contribution of Stat5 to the Epo response in vivo is still controversial (16Teglund S. McKay C.

Cell. 1999; 98: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), but the protein clearly affects the generation of monocytes/macrophages in response to GM-CSF (35Kieslinger M. Woldman I. Moriggl R. Hofmann J. Marine J.C. Ihle J.N. Beug H. Decker T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 232-244PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with studies on its transactivation domain (54Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J. Kammer W. Heim M. Wissler M. Stocklin E. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3663-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), Stat5 may not per se be a potent transcription factor but, rather, may require interaction with other DNA-binding proteins to stimulate gene expression. Another important activity of Stat5 may lie in its ability to mediate gene repression. This assumption emerged from both studies in cultured cells (55Luo G. Yu-Lee L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26841-26849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the analysis of knock-out mice (16Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D.

Cell. 1998; 93: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), which suggested a role for Stat5 in suppressing the expression of the testosterone 15α-hydroxylase gene in male mice.SOCS3 inhibited both Stat1 and Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation by the synthetic Tyr-440 receptor with similar efficiency, suggesting that the mechanism of inhibition may be the same in both cases. In agreement with the results by others (22Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Farley A. Starr R. Zhang J.G. Baca M. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that SOCS3 inhibition of Stat1 or Stat5 activation cannot be explained entirely by the effect of the protein on Jak kinases. The gp130 Jak binding site of the synthetic receptor was shown to associate with Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 (56Lutticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 57Stahl N. Boulton T.G.

Cytoplasmic Jak2 and Tyk2 could not be efficiently inhibited by even high amounts of co-transfected SOCS3. Surprisingly, Jak1 was inhibited by low amounts of SOCS3, but inhibition was lost with increasing SOCS3 expression. We have no explanation for this dose effect, but comparison to the dose response of Stat inhibition by the complete synthetic receptor rules out the possibility that our results are entirely due to a direct interaction between SOCS3 and Jak1. We propose that Jak inhibition by SOCS3 might be more efficient when Jaks are associated with receptors. Possibly receptor chains stabilize the Jak-SOCS complex, as has been suggested for the interleukin-2 receptor β-chain (24Cohney S.J. Sanden D. Cacalano N.A. Yoshimura A. Mui A. Migone T.S. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4980-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and/or increase the ability of SOCS3 to inhibit Jaks (26Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Shouda T. Kitamura T. Dikic I. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29338-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Alternatively or additionally, SOCS3 might itself bind to the phosphorylated Tyr-440 of the synthetic receptor via its SH2 domain and compete for Stat binding. This mode of action has been suggested in the case of Epo receptor Tyr-401, which also associates with Stat5 (26Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Shouda T. Kitamura T. Dikic I. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29338-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and for the insulin receptor (27Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Sawka-Verhelle D. Hilton D. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our studies show that promiscuity of a receptor binding site is the basis of Stat5 activation by IFN-γ and that this phosphorylated tyrosine suffices to mediate inhibition by SOCS3 in the case of both Stat1 and Stat5. We suggest that tissue-restricted Stat5 activation by the IFN-γR is determined by threshold levels of expression, but this assumption needs to be confirmed in future studies. The binding of cytokines to their receptors frequently causes the activation of several different Stats. Despite this, studies in gene-targeted mice suggest that only one of these mediates the predominant biological effects of the activating cytokine (11Levy D.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). IFN-γ causes tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and, in a cell-type-restricted manner, that of Stat3 and Stat5. Stat1 deficiency alone abolishes the major immunological functions of IFN-γ like the activation of macrophages or the regulation of the adaptive immune response (9Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J. Dighe A.S. Kaplan D.H. Riley J.K. Greenlund A.C. Campbell D. Carver Moore K. DuBois R.N. Clark R. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D.

Cell. 1996; 84: 443-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). However, IFN-γ is a pleiotropic cytokine exerting a plethora of effects on the activation, growth, and differentiation of cells (46Trinchieri G. Perussia B. Immunol. Today. 1985; 6: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar,47Nacy C.A. Meltzer M.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1991; 3: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Importantly, some of the biological effects of IFN-γ, like those on the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells, may be redundant with other cytokines, whereas others, like the activation of macrophages, are not. Thus, one might argue that effects of Stat5 or Stat3 deficiency on the IFN-γ response are not readily overt because other cytokines compensate. Moreover, the absence of Stat3/5 in an IFN-γ response might cause only minor alterations that are hard to detect, particularly if analyzed against a background of more severe phenotypes caused by tissue-restricted Stat3 ablation (48Akira S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2607-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) or Stat5a/b deficiency (16Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D. Wang D. Brown M. Bodner S.

In this paper we show that Stat5 activation by the IFN-γ receptor results from a promiscuity of the amino acids surrounding Tyr-420 and Tyr-440 of, respectively, the murine and human IFNGR1 chains for Stat1 and Stat5 association. Mutation of Tyr-420 strongly reduces Stat5 activation. Vice versa, addition of the Tyr-440-containing peptide to a synthetic receptor strongly stimulates the ability of that receptor to activate both Stat1 and Stat5. By contrast, the addition of the EpoR peptide containing Tyr-343, the major Stat5 binding site, specifically resulted in Stat5 but not Stat1 activation. Therefore, not all Stat5 binding sites are intrinsically promiscuous for Stat1 binding. On the other hand, receptor binding sites may be shared between Stats, as in the case of gp130, where Stat1 and Stat3 can bind to the same phosphorylated tyrosine (49Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar), or the interleukin-9 receptor, where a single tyrosine residue was shown to cause activation of Stats 1, 3, and 5 (50Demoulin J.B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. DeLestre B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Some ability to activate Stat5 was retained by IFN-γ receptors containing the Y420F mutant of the IFNGR1 chain or by the ΔBR synthetic receptor without a Stat binding site. Our previous studies suggest this may be because of a direct interaction between the Jak kinase domain and Stat5 (51Barahmand-Pour F. Meinke A. Groner B. Decker T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12567-12575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our studies further show that the IFN-γ receptor has no intrinsic ability to distinguish between the Stat5a and Stat5b isoforms. This possibility was suggested by our earlier finding in hematopoietic progenitor cells where IFN-γ treatment resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5a but not of Stat5b despite expression of both proteins (12Meinke A. Barahmand-pour F. Wöhrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that Stat5 activation by the IFN-γR is determined by threshold levels of expression that may in some cells be exceeded by Stat5a but not Stat5b. Alternatively, ancillary proteins may form complexes with Stat5a in some cells and create increased affinity for the IFN-γR complex. Compared with Stat1, Stat5, activated by the IFN-γR, displayed very little ability to support transcription of a transfected reporter gene.

We previously demonstrated that Notch1 and Notch2 molecules inhibit myeloid differentiation in a cytokine-specific manner and that the Notch cytokine response domain is necessary for this functional specificity. We have now investigated the putative role of phosphorylation in the activity of Notch in response to cytokine signals. Our results show that the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulation of 32D cells expressing the intracellular Notch2 protein induces phosphorylation at specific sites of this molecule, rendering the molecule inactive and permitting differentiation of these cells. In contrast, when cells are stimulated with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), intracellular notch2 is not phosphorylated at these residues and differentiation is inhibited. We also show that deletion of the Ser/Thr-rich region between amino acids 2067 and 2099 abrogates G-CSF-induced phosphorylation and results in a molecule that inhibits differentiation in response to either G-CSF or GM-CSF. Our results further indicate that Ser2078 is a critical residue for phosphorylation and modulation of Notch2 activity in the context of G-CSF-induced differentiation of 32D cells.

Development. 1996; 122: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the extent to which they have specific functions is a theme of current investigation. The Notch1 and 2 molecules are synthesized as single precursor proteins that are cleaved in the Golgi to become functional heterodimeric receptors present on the cell surface. Notch ligands are expressed on the surface of neighboring cells and also on the same cell as the receptor, with the relative dosage of receptor and ligand being an important determinant of Notch activity (6Heitzler P. Simpson P. Cell. 1991; 64: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The productive interaction of Notch receptor with ligand results in further proteolytic cleavage, with release and nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain of Notch (Notch-IC),1 which functions as a transcriptional regulator (reviewed in Ref. 7Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Truncated Notch molecules corresponding to Notch-IC (i.e. lacking the transmembrane and extracellular domains) behave as constitutively active molecules, and thus have been used extensively to study Notch function in many vertebrate and invertebrate systems (8Fortini M.E. Rebay I. Caron L.A. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nature. 1993; 365: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 9Struhl G. Fitzgerald K. Greenwald I.

Notch activity generally, but not exclusively, leads to the inhibition of a differentiating signal, thereby preserving progenitors that are capable of responding to subsequent signals and generating cell diversity.Despite the extraordinary conservation of Notch structural domains, several observations support the lack of complete functional redundancy. Inactivation of different Notch genes in mice has been very instructive in this regard; for instance,Notch1 and Notch2 null mice are embryonic lethals before day 11.5 (12Swiatek P.J.

Despite the emerging evidence implicating Notch as a key mediator in hematopoiesis, the precise role of the different Notch homologs in regulating specific hematopoietic cell fate decisions remains unclear. Within the lymphoid system, Notch1 and Notch2 are preferentially expressed in thymus and spleen, respectively (3Weinmaster G. Roberts V.J. Lemke G. Development. 1992; 116: 931-941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, T and B lymphocytes express both Notch1 and2, and in other hematopoietic cell types Notch1, 2, and 3 are frequently co-expressed, 2L. A. Milner, unpublished observations.2L. A. Milner, unpublished observations. suggesting that more than one Notch molecule may function simultaneously in a given cell.Recently it has been shown that Notch molecules are post-translationally modified by glycosylation (34Moloney D.J.

Lieber T. Young M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), adding further complexity to the regulation of Notch signaling. Glycosylation of Notch EGF repeats by fringe molecules is important in modulating Notch-ligand interactions (36Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 37Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) and it is likely to contribute to ligand binding specificity of the different Notch homologs (38Hicks C. Johnston S.H. diSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation is a widely used mechanism for regulating activity through signal transduction pathways. Recent reports have shown that a nuclear form of N1IC1 (Notch1-IC) is phosphorylated (39Redmond L. Oh S.R. Hicks C. Weinmaster G. Ghosh A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and that ligand binding to Notch2 induces hyperphosphorylation and nuclear translocation of this molecule (40Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both phosphorylation and nuclear translocation appear to be necessary for oncogenic transformation mediated by Notch (41Ronchini C. Capobianco A.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3914-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that phosphorylation may be an important factor in modulating intracellular signal transduction through the Notch pathway.Previously, we have reported that either expression of truncated Notch1 (N1ICΔOP) or ligand activation of the full-length Notch1 receptor inhibits G-CSF-induced differentiation of 32D myeloid progenitors (11Milner L.A. Bigas A. Kopan R. Brashem-Stein C. Bernstein I.D. Martin D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13014-13019Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 42Li L. Milner L.A. Deng Y. Iwata M. Banta A. Graf L. Marcovina S. Friedman C. Trask B.J. Hood L. Torok Storb B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, N1ICΔOP does not inhibit differentiation induced by GM-CSF; and conversely, truncated Notch2 (N2ICΔOP) does not affect G-CSF-induced differentiation, but inhibits differentiation in response to GM-CSF (42Li L. Milner L.A. Deng Y. Iwata M. Banta A. Graf L. Marcovina S. Friedman C. Trask B.J. Hood L. Torok Storb B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These latter studies also revealed that a specific region of the Notch molecule, designated the NCR (Notch cytokine response) region, confers this cytokine specificity. In the present study, we have investigated whether phosphorylation plays a role in regulating activity of the N2ICΔOP molecule. We find that N2ICΔOP is differentially phosphorylated in 32D cells exposed to G-CSF or GM-CSF. In the context of G-CSF stimulation, phosphorylation of N2ICΔOP correlates with its inability to inhibit differentiation. At least one of the N2ICΔOP residues phosphorylated in G-CSF-stimulated cells mapped to a serine/threonine-rich (STR) region within the NCR domain. Further characterization of this STR region included analyses of deletion mutants and N2ICΔOP molecules containing point mutations; these studies indicate that phosphorylation of Ser2078 is a significant factor in the regulation of Notch2 function in this system.DISCUSSIONThe Notch signaling pathway participates in many cell fate decisions during embryonic and adult tissue development (for reviews see Refs. 1Egan S.E. St Pierre B. Leow C.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 273-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Robey E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 47Milner L.A. Bigas A. Blood. 1999; 93: 2431-2448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of such a widely used pathway is complex and involves different mechanisms. Phosphorylation of the Notch molecule was first described in Drosophila (35Kidd S. Lieber T. Young M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and has more recently been reported in mammalian cells (39Redmond L. Oh S.R. Hicks C. Weinmaster G. Ghosh A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 40Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here we have presented evidence that phosphorylation is important in the regulation of Notch2 activity in the context of specific cytokine signals.Intracellular Notch1 and Notch2 have been shown to function as activated molecules in several systems. Although both homologs display similar biochemical activity when assayed in in vitrosystems (17Kato H. Sakai T. Tamura K. Minoguchi S. Shirayoshi Y. Hamada Y. Tsujimoto Y. Honjo T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 2–3: 221-224Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Ordentlich P. Lin A. Shen C.P. Blaumueller C. Matsuno K. Artavanis Tsakonas S. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2230-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), when overexpressed in hematopoietic cells they have been shown to exhibit functional specificity (25Bigas A. Martin D.I. Milner L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2324-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated that deletion of a STR region between amino acids 2067–2099 abrogates the cytokine-restricted activity of Notch2 on 32D myeloid differentiation. Within this region, we have determined that phosphorylation of the Ser2078 residue in the context of G-CSF stimulation is important in regulating N2ICΔOPactivity.Notch2 Function Is Regulated by PhosphorylationRegulation of Notch activity occurs at a variety of different levels during the protein lifespan. Prior to placement on the cell surface, the Notch protein undergoes proteolytic processing to generate a heterodimeric receptor (48Blaumueller C.M. Qi H. Zagouras P. Artavanis Tsakonas S. Cell. 1997; 90: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and glycosylation by fringe to modulate ligand binding specificity (38Hicks C. Johnston S.H. diSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Following ligand binding, Notch is cleaved by at least 2 different proteases, γ-secretase/presenilins (49Song W. Nadeau P. Yuan M. Yang X. Shen J. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6959-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 50Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D. Yuan M. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat.

Development. 1997; 124: 4769-4779PubMed Google Scholar, 52Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A. Israel A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), to release the intracellular domain. Finally, intracellular Notch is modified by phosphorylation in response to ligand binding (40Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and to differentiation signals (this report).It has been reported that phosphorylation of DrosophilaNotch is necessary for nuclear translocation and interaction with the transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) (35Kidd S. Lieber T. Young M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Several recent studies also support a role for phosphorylation in the regulation of subcellular localization and activity of intracellular Notch. For example, Notch-IC proteins have been found in the nucleus of dendritic cells in distinct phosphorylated forms (39Redmond L. Oh S.R. Hicks C. Weinmaster G. Ghosh A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In other reports, hyperphosphorylation of Notch has been associated with Notch activation, nuclear translocation, and transformation ability (41Ronchini C. Capobianco A.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3914-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Shimizu K. Chiba S. Hosoya N. Kumano K. Saito T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Hamada Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6913-6922Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We previously observed that N2ICΔOP molecule is able to inhibit differentiation when induced by GM-CSF but fails to block differentiation in the presence of G-CSF (25Bigas A. Martin D.I. Milner L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2324-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have found that N2ICΔOP is phosphorylated in 32D cells in IL3 or GM-CSF medium and increased phosphorylation of N2ICΔOP occurs when cells are incubated in G-CSF. Together these findings suggest the possibility that G-CSF induces specific phosphorylation of N2ICΔOP, thereby rendering the molecule inactive. By contrast, when cells are incubated with G-CSF, N1ICΔOP molecule decreased its phosphorylation suggesting that both molecules may be differentially regulated in response to the same cytokine.Our results show increased phosphorylation of at least three spots (A, B, and C) in the N2IC and N2ICΔOP after G-CSF stimulation. In all three mutants that are able to block G-CSF-induced differentiation peptide A is absent, thus strongly suggesting that Ser2078 is critical in regulating the Notch2 cytokine specific activity in 32D cells. The fact that peptide A is completely absent in the deletion mutant Δ2077–2081, the double point mutant S2078A/S2090A, and the S2078A single mutant suggests that this peptide includes Ser2078. When a theoretical trypsin digest map for N2ICΔOP is generated, the peptide containing Ser2078 is 29 amino acids long (Leu-Leu-Asp-Glu-Tyr-Asn-Val-Thr-Pro-Ser-Pro-Pro-Gly-Thr-Val-Leu-Thr-Ser2078-Ala-Leu-Ser-Pro-Val-Leu-Cys-Gly-Pro-Asn-Arg) and its predicted mobility coincides with the actual migration of peptide A. We cannot exclude that spots B and C are multiple phosphorylation states of the same peptide or partial digestions containing Ser2078 thus explaining their decreased intensity in the tryptic maps lacking peptide A. Moreover, we have shown that different mutant molecules that lack Ser2078 are able to inhibit G-CSF induced differentiation. These results strongly suggest that phosphorylation of this residue is crucial for regulating Notch2 cytokine specific activity in 32D cells. Of note, Ser2078 is unique to Notch2.We have focused on phosphopeptides A, B, and C in this study as these were the only peptides to reproducibly correlate with Notch2 function and cytokine stimulus. However, in individual experiments, different peptides showed variable differences in intensity following exposure to G-CSF or GM-CSF. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that phosphorylation of other residues in the N2ICΔOP molecule may also influence its activity. It also remains possible that other residues in addition to Ser2078 contribute to the appearance or disappearance of phosphopeptide A. It is worth noting that initial phosphorylation of Ser2078 may be required to establish target motifs for subsequent phosphorylation by CKI (-S(P)-A-L-S-) or GSK3 (-T-V-L-T-S(P)-A-L-S). In this sense and using one of the available proteomics data bases (PhophoBase v2.0; Center for Biological Sequence Analysis; www.cbs.dtu.dk), we searched for potential phosphorylation sites in the N2ICΔOP sequence. This search revealed consensus sequences for calmodulin kinase II, (CaMKII), casein kinase I (CKI), casein kinase II (CKII), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC). The specific kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Ser2078 remains to be determined and is a subject of current investigation. Molecular pathways that might directly link G-CSF signal transduction to phosphorylation of Notch2 are particularly intriguing. Many cytokines, including G-CSF and GM-CSF, activate kinase signaling cascades (53Suzuki K. Hino M. Hato F. Tatsumi N. Kitagawa S. Blood. 1999; 93: 341-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), some of which also interact with the Notch pathway. For example, interactions between the Notch and Ras/MAP kinase signaling pathways have been shown to result in reciprocal modulation of the two pathways: in some cases, Ras signaling is affected by Notch inhibition of MAP kinase activity (18Ordentlich P. Lin A. Shen C.P. Blaumueller C. Matsuno K. Artavanis Tsakonas S. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2230-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 54Ikeya T. Hayashi S.

Science. 2001; 291: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar); in others, Notch signaling is modulated by MAPK-induced phosphorylation of molecular components of the Notch pathway (reviewed in Ref. 1Egan S.E. St Pierre B. Leow C.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 273-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAPK consensus sequences are particularly ambiguous, but include a Thr/Ser residue followed by a Pro, which are also present in the STR of Notch1 and Notch2 (Fig. 1).A Role for Notch Homologs in Myeloid DifferentiationOver the past few years it has become clear that Notch signaling is involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis (reviewed in Ref. 47Milner L.A. Bigas A. Blood. 1999; 93: 2431-2448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although many details are still lacking, the influence of Notch1 at multiple differentiation branch points during lymphoid development has been well documented. For example, Notch1 first influences the development of cells along the T or B cell lineage (23Pui J.C. Allman D. Xu L. DeRocco S. Karnell F.G. Bakkour S. Lee J.Y. Kadesch T. Hardy R.R. Aster J.C.

However, a number of studies indicate that Notch signaling is involved in myelopoiesis, and provide clues as to specific functions. Expression of active (Notch-IC) molecules or ligand-induced activation of Notch in myeloid cell lines such as 32D (11Milner L.A. Bigas A. Kopan R. Brashem-Stein C. Bernstein I.D. Martin D.I. Proc.

However, in both invertebrate and mammalian systems, the effects of Notch have been shown to be both multifaceted and highly context-dependent. Thus, depending on the specific cell type and environmental signals, Notch activity may promote or inhibit differentiation, prevent or induce apoptosis (58Jehn B.M. Bielke W. Pear W.S. Osborne B.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 635-638PubMed Google Scholar, 59Ohishi K. Varnum-Finney B. Flowers D. Anasetti C. Myerson D. Bernstein I.D.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 277-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic unit of the oxidase is a membrane-associated heterodimer cytochrome composed of gp91phox and p22phox . Other oxidase components, such as p47phox and p67phox , are cytosolic but migrate to the membrane upon phagocyte stimulation and associate with the cytochrome to form a functional oxidase. The gp91phox , p47phox , and p67phox genes are transcriptionally silent until terminal myeloid differentiation and are then expressed until cell death. Absence of any of these proteins leads to chronic granulomatous disease (CGD),1 an immunodeficiency syndrome caused by the absence of a phagocyte respiratory burst (1Orkin S.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 277-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of gp91phox expression is complex. The −450 to +12-bp fragment of the gp91phox promoter is sufficient to direct tissue-specific but variegated transgene expression in a subset of mature phagocytes in transgenic mice (2Skalnik D.G.

However, elements 10–60 kb upstream of the transcription start site are additionally required to direct appropriate tissue-specific gene expression in the full spectrum of mature phagocytes (3Lien L.L. Lee Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, the −450 to +12-bp region of the gp91phox promoter directs interferon (IFN)-γ-induced expression of a linked reporter gene when stably introduced into myeloid cells (4Eklund E.A.

Lineage-restricted regulation of gp91phox expression requires the combinatorial interaction of multiple repressors and activators with the proximal promoter (Fig. 1).

Post-translational regulation of the DNA binding activity of CDP occurs during myeloid cell differentiation, as CDP protein 2D. Skalnik, unpublished observations.2D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12745-12750Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) persist in mature phagocytes that lack CDP DNA binding activity. Although the mechanism for post-translational regulation of CDP during myeloid cell development has not been established, others (9Coqueret O. Martin N. Berube G. Rabbat M. Litchfield D.W. Nepveu A.

A. 2000; 97: 7166-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that in vitro phosphorylation or acetylation of the DNA-binding domains of CDP inhibits DNA binding activity. Down-regulation of CDP DNA binding activity is necessary for induction of gp91phox expression, as constitutive overexpression of CDP prevents induction of gp91phox expression upon terminal differentiation of a myeloid cell line (8Lievens P.M.J. Donady J.J. Tufarelli C. Neufeld E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12745-12750Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, other lineage-restricted genes that encode the secondary granule proteins neutrophil collagenase, neutrophil gelatinase, and lactoferrin are also repressed under these conditions, suggesting that they are additional targets of CDP-mediated repression (12Khanna-Gupta A. Zibello T. Kolla S. Neufeld E.J. Beliner N. Blood. 1997; 90: 2784-2795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lawson N.D. Khanna-Gupta A. Berliner N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2517-2524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, down-regulation of CDP has also been observed in differentiated tissues that do not express gp91phox , such as kidney cells and myotubes (14Andres V. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Development. 1992; 116: 321-334PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vanden Heuvel G.B. Bodmer R. McConnell K.R. Nagami G.T. Igarashi P. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, modulation of CDP DNA binding activity is necessary but not sufficient to direct myeloid cell-specific expression of the gp91phox gene. The mechanism of CDP-mediated transcriptional repression includes blocking interaction between widely expressed transcriptional activators and the gp91phox promoter (Fig. 1). These activators include IFN regulatory factors (IRF)-1 and -2, the CCAAT box-binding factor CP1, and YY1 (5Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Andres V. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Development. 1992; 116: 321-334PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vanden Heuvel G.B. Bodmer R.

These mutations are clustered in the −55-bp region, and each ablates a binding site recognized by the Ets family members PU.1 and Elf-1 (18Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Suzuki S. Kumatori A. Haagen I.-A. Fujii Y. Sadat M.A. Jun H.L. Tsuji Y. Roos D. Nakamura M. Proc.

GATA-1 and GATA-2 also bind and transactivate the gp91phox promoter specifically in eosinophils (21Yang D. Suzuki S. Hao L.J. Fujii Y. Yamauchi A. Yamamoto M. Nakamura M. Kumatori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9425-9432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CDP-binding sites often co-localize with binding sites of the matrix attachment region (MAR)-binding protein SATB1. Examples include the T cell receptor β gene enhancer (22Chattopadhyay S. Whitehurst C.E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29838-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the mouse CD8agene upstream regulatory region (23Banan M. Rojas I.C.

Kobayashi R. Ross S.R. Dudley J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5275-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Unlike many other MAR-binding proteins, SATB1 is a cell type-specific protein and is predominantly expressed in T cells and thymocytes (24Liu J. Bramblett D. Zhu Q. Lozano M. Kobayashi R. Ross S.R.

A gene targeting study has recently shown that SATB1 coordinates temporal and spatial expression of a large number of genes during T cell differentiation (28Alvarez J.D. Yaui D.H. Niida H. Joh T. Loh D.Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 521-535PubMed Google Scholar). Both CDP and SATB1 contain cut repeat and homeodomain DNA-binding domains (26Dickinson L.A. Dickinson C.D.

SATB1 recognizes DNA sequences in which one strand consists of A, T, and C but not G nucleotides (ATC sequences) (25Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigmatsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Clustered ATC sequences exhibit a high propensity to unwind or base-unpair when placed under negative superhelical strain, and such regions are called base-unpairing regions (31Bode J. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L. Joh T. Klehr D. Mielke C. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Science. 1992; 255: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 32Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9551-9560Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Base-unpairing regions are typically found within MARs, and SATB1 binds in vivo to ATC sequence stretches at the bases of chromatin loop domains (33de Belle I. Cai S. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CDP, on the other hand, does not exhibit a DNA binding specificity to ATC sequences, per se. However, in vitro studies show that CDP preferentially binds to sequences containing the homeodomain-binding motif (ATTA) and CCAAT boxes (34Andres V. Chiara M.D. Mahdavi V. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that are often found within AT-rich regions of DNA such as MARs. Given the multiple CDP-binding sites within the gp91phox promoter, we examined whether SATB1 also binds to this promoter. SATB1 was found to interact with numerous elements within the −1542 to +12-bp gp91phox promoter. Similar to CDP, SATB1 DNA binding activity is abundant in immature myeloid cells but is down-regulated upon terminal phagocyte differentiation. We further demonstrate that the gp91phox promoter associates with the nuclear matrix fraction and that SATB1 represses gp91phox promoter activity. Plasmids containing the proximal human gp91phox promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene (35Nordeen S.K. BioTechnology. 1988; 6: 454-457Google Scholar) and a cytomegalovirus promoter-β-galactosidase plasmid have been described previously (7Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18203-18210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Various oligonucleotides were inserted upstream of the −102 to +12-bp gp91phox promoter fragment following digestion withBamHI and SalI (see below for nucleotide sequences). These include a SATB1-binding site derived from the gp91phox promoter (gp91phoxSATB1), a mutated version of the gp91phox promoter element that no longer binds SATB1 (gp91SATB1-mut), and an unrelated fragment of the gp91phox promoter (−624 to −579 bp) that fails to bind SATB1. The nucleotide sequence of each luciferase construct was determined. Plasmid DNA was isolated using Qiagen Maxiprep kits (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). All CDP-binding site oligonucleotides derived from the human gp91phox promoter are as described previously (5Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol.

Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). PLB-985, HEL, Jurkat, and K562 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% Fetal Clone III (bovine serum product, HyClone, Logan, UT), 0.2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). HeLa and COS-7 cells were grown using similarly supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media. PLB-985 cells were differentiated into monocyte/macrophages by treatment with 0.1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 48 h (5Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or differentiated into neutrophils by treatment with 0.5% dimethylformamide (Sigma) for 6 days. The degree of differentiation of PLB-985 cells was assessed by measuring respiratory burst activity using a nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) test. Briefly, 20 μl of cells in 1× PBS were incubated with 200 μl of a supersaturated solution of NBT with 0.1 nm PMA for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell cultures were considered NBT-positive when 80% of the cells were purple. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the SATB1 overexpression plasmid pECH-SATB1 (25Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigmatsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) or empty plasmid using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). One day after transfection, cells were harvested for isolation of whole cell extract as described (42Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Doppler W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 8: 1091-1102Google Scholar). HEL cells were transiently transfected as described (16Jacobsen B. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29984-29993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with 5 μg of luciferase test plasmid and 1 μg of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase vector to serve as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Sixteen hours after plating, cells were lysed using 1× lysis buffer (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI), and 20 μl of cell extract was assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI) per the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of β-galactosidase activity was performed as described (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). Each construct was transfected at least four times in duplicate using at least two independent plasmid preparations. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (44Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 11: 1475-1489Crossref Scopus (9149) Google Scholar) with slight modifications to inhibit protease activity as described (45Amrein P.C. Stossel T.P. Blood. 1980; 56: 442-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pelleted and washed with PBS. Cells were then treated with 2.7 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate. After vortexing and incubating on ice for 10 min, cells were washed three times with PBS. Soluble cell extracts and insoluble nuclear matrices were prepared as described (42Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Doppler W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 8: 1091-1102Google Scholar, 46Cockerill P.N. Garrard W.T. Cell. 1986; 44: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared by boiling pelleted cells in 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue. A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein that contains the DNA-binding domain of SATB1 (amino acid residues 346–763) was purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (26Dickinson L.A. Dickinson C.D. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11463-11470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotide probes for use in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were annealed and radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]ATP. Restriction fragment EMSA probes were fill-in labeled using Klenow enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [α-32P]dCTP. All EMSA probes were purified as described (17Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23445-23451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). EMSA with nuclear extracts was performed as described previously using 5 μg of nuclear extract, 2.3 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 15,000 cpm of probe in a 20-μl reaction volume (5Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera directed against SATB1 (25Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigmatsu T.

Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) were diluted 1:10, and 1 μl was added to the appropriate reaction. The binding reactions were incubated on ice for 20–30 min and then loaded onto a 0.5× TBE, 3.5% polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was performed at 25 mA. EMSA using recombinant SATB1 was performed as described previously (25Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigmatsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), using a GST fusion protein consisting of the 346–763-amino acid region of human SATB1 that contains both the MAR-binding domain and homeodomain (26Dickinson L.A. Dickinson C.D. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11463-11470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In vitro nuclear matrix binding assays were performed as described (46Cockerill P.N. Garrard W.T. Cell. 1986; 44: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The 0.2-kb EcoRI-PstI fragment containing a portion of the CD8a upstream regulatory MAR was used as a positive control (23Banan M. Rojas I.C. Lee W.-H. King H.L. Harriss J.V. Kobayashi R. Webb C.F. Gottlieb P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18440-18452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide corresponding to the CDP-α-binding element of the gp91phox promoter (−137 to −76 bp) was released from pUC19 by digestion with BamHI and used as the experimental probe. pUC19 linearized by digesting withBamHI was used as a negative control. All three DNA fragment probes, CD8a, CDP-α, and pUC19, were fill-in labeled with Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dCTP. The CDP-α and CD8a probes were gel-isolated, whereas the pUC19 probe was purified using an S-200 spin column per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, insoluble nuclear matrices were mixed with 30,000 cpm of each probe and the indicated mass of E. coli DNA in a total volume of 100 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Binding reactions were rocked at room temperature for 1 h and then nuclear matrices were pelleted and washed three times with binding buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of proteinase K solution (10 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 37 °C for 10–15 h. Reactions were extracted with phenol and chloroform and were ethanol-precipitated. The binding assay samples were then resuspended and subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. The −1542 to +12-bp fragment of the proximal gp91phox promoter was previously cloned into a growth hormone reporter gene vector (5Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Eklund E.A. Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2418-2429PubMed Google Scholar). DNA probes were isolated following two sets of successive restriction enzyme digestions. For the first set, the promoter/growth hormone plasmid was digested with BamHI and SalI, and the −1542 to +12-bp promoter fragment was recovered. Half of this DNA was digested with AseI, and the −1542 to −1421-bp fragment was recovered. The other half of the DNA was digested withHindIII, and the −137 to +12-bp fragment was isolated. For the second set of probes, the promoter/growth hormone plasmid was digested with HindIII, and the −1535 to −137-bp fragment was recovered. This fragment was digested with MaeIII, and the −207 to −137-, −439 to −207-, and −1206 to −1065-bp fragments were recovered. The −1065 to −439-bp fragment was further digested with BspLUII1, and the −624 to −439-bp fragment was purified. The −1065 to −624-bp fragment was digested withBanI and −1065 to −815- and −815 to −624-bp fragments were isolated. The −1536 to −1206-bp fragment was digested withAseI, and the −1421 to −1206-bp fragment was isolated. Whole cell extract was quantitated via the Bradford method (48Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar), using the Bio-Rad reagent (Bio-Rad). SDS loading dye was added to 100 μg of whole cell extract and boiled for 10 min. Electrophoresis was performed on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for 6–8 h at 25 mA at room temperature, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% dry milk) for 10–18 h at room temperature. Polyclonal rabbit anti-SATB1 serum and either antibody 1583 (25Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigmatsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) or a generous gift of Paul Gottlieb (University of Texas) were diluted 1/2000 in blocking buffer and incubated 10–18 h at room temperature with orbital shaking. The membrane was washed three times in wash buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20). Secondary α-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was diluted 1/20,000 in blocking buffer and incubated at room temperature for 8 h. Membranes were washed three times in wash buffer and subjected to chemiluminescent detection via the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Forty micrograms of total RNA was loaded onto a 1% formaldehyde gel and transferred to MagnaGraph nylon membrane (Micron Separations, Inc., Westborough, MA).

Previous studies identified three in vitro single-stranded type I element binding activities that were proposed to play distinct roles in replication control. Here we describe the cloning of one of these genes, TIF1, and we provide evidence for its association with type I elements in vivo. Furthermore, we show that TIF1 interacts (in vitro and in vivo) with pause site elements (PSE), which co-localize with replication initiation and fork arrest sites, and are shown to be essential. Thein vivo accessibility of PSE and type I elements to potassium permanganate suggests that origin regions are frequently unwound in native chromatin. TIF1 contains sequence similarity to theSolanum tuberosum single strand-specific transcription factor, p24, and a related Arabidopsis protein. Antisense inhibition studies suggest that TIF1 competes with other proteins for PSE and type I element binding. TIF1 displays a marked strand biasin vivo, discriminating between origin- and promoter-proximal type I elements. We propose that this bias selectively modulates the binding of a different subset of proteins to the respective regulatory elements.

Both the organization of the rDNA replicon and its regulation are complex. rDNA minichromosomes are formed during development of the transcriptionally active macronucleus. Site-specific chromosome fragmentation releases a 10.3-kb1 rDNA monomer that is converted into a 21-kb palindrome, and subsequently amplified ∼5,000-fold within a single S phase (reviewed in Ref. 1Kapler G.M. Dobbs D.L. Blackburn E.H. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 915-932Google Scholar). Once development is completed, rDNA replication is restricted to once per cell division in vegetatively growing progeny. Previous studies (2Zhang Z. MacAlpine D.M. Kapler G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6147-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) revealed that the rDNA minichromosome contains two distinct sites for the initiation of DNA replication. These origins localize to 430-bp tandemly duplicated segments in the 5′-nontranscribed spacer (5′-NTS) region, designated domains 1 and 2 (D1 and D2) (Fig.1). The 5′-NTS contains a precisely defined chromatin structure, consisting of positioned nucleosomes that bracket three nucleosome-free regions (3Palen T.E. Cech T.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 933-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The D1 and D2 replication origins are part of a single replicon composed of dispersed cis-acting regulatory determinants that localize to the nucleosome-free domains (4Larson D.D. Blackburn E.H. Yaeger P.C. Orias E. Cell. 1986; 47: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Gallagher R.C. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). rDNA gene amplification and vegetative replication initiate from the same replication origins (2Zhang Z. MacAlpine D.M. Kapler G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6147-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, cell cycle control must somehow be overridden to allow for the repeated firing of replication origins during gene amplification. Our current understanding of eukaryotic replicons comes largely from studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and T. thermophila, where genetic approaches have been developed for studying the replication of artificial (yeast, Tetrahymena) or natural (Tetrahymena) minichromosomes. Replicons in all three species are composed of multiple cis-acting determinants that act in concert to control initiation. The organization of cis-acting regulatory elements differs considerably between these species. The ARS1 replicon of S. cerevisiae, for example, encompasses a small DNA segment (<120 bp) that is flanked by positioned nucleosomes (7Lipford J.R. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 21-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The key cis-acting element, the 11-bp ARS element, functions as a binding site for a 6-polypeptide origin recognition complex, ORC (8Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Several adjacent sequence elements are required for origin activation, some of which interact with non-ORC proteins (9Marahrens Y. Stillman B. Science. 1992; 255: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). S. pombereplicons are more complex. They can span >1,000 bp, containing multiple reiterated and partially redundant overlapping binding sites for ORC (10Zhu J. Carlson D.L. Dubey D.D. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. Chromosoma. 1994; 103: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Dubey D.D. Kim S.M. Todorov I.T. Huberman J.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 467-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and enhancer elements that presumably interact with non-ORC proteins (12Kim, S.-M., Zhang, D.-Y., and Huberman, J. A. (2001) BMC Mol. Biol. 2:1.Google Scholar). Similarly, the Tetrahymena rDNA replicon spans >1,000 bp and contains dispersed, reiterated, and unique regulatory determinants (6Reischmann K.P. Zhang Z. Kapler G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Kapler G.M. Orias E. Blackburn E.H. Genetics. 1994; 137: 455-466PubMed Google Scholar). The less well defined replicons of higher eukaryotes typically span thousands of base pairs (14Delidakis C. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Kitsberg D. Selig S. Cedar H. Nature. 1993; 366: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 16Aladjem M.I. Groudine M.

Type I elements are phylogenetically conserved in tetrahymenid ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) (19Challoner P.B. Blackburn E.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6299-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). They regulate at least three chromosomal processes: replication initiation, elongation of replication forks, and rRNA gene transcription. Four type I elements reside in the T. thermophila rDNA 5′-nontranscribed spacer (5′-NTS). Two copies (IA and IB) co-localize with replication initiation sites (Fig. 1, Domains 1 and 2), whereas the promoter-proximal IC and ID elements do not. Type I elements are essential components of the basal rDNA replicon and are responsible for both gene amplification (20Orias E. Bradshaw A.D. Dev. Genet. 1992; 13: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and cell cycle-regulated vegetative replication (4Larson D.D. Blackburn E.H. Yaeger P.C. Orias E. Cell. 1986; 47: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Gallagher R.C. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3021-3033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Yaeger P.C. Orias E. Shaiu W.-L. Larson D.D. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition to controlling replication initiation, type I elements regulate the elongation of replication forks (22MacAlpine D.M. Zhang Z. Kapler G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Replication forks arrest transiently at specific sites in the 5′-nontranscribed spacer (5′-NTS) that coincide with phylogenetically conserved pause site elements (Fig. 1,PSE1–3). Type I element mutations ablate fork arrest at the adjacent PSE (22MacAlpine D.M. Zhang Z. Kapler G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, promoter-proximal type I elements are the only genetically defined components of the rRNA promoter (23Miyahara K. Hashimoto T. Higashinakagawa T. Pearlman R.E. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Pan W.-J. Gallagher R.C. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3372-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Sequences immediately downstream of type I elements are important for their recognition by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (25Saha S. Kapler G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mutations in these downstream sequences can confer different cellular phenotypes. For instance, a point mutation downstream of the promoter-proximal type ID element eliminates rRNA transcription (26Yu G.L. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas a similarly positioned mutation affects rDNA replication (5Gallagher R.C. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3021-3033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to genetically separate replication and transcription defects suggests that different trans-acting factors regulate these two processes. Three different type I element bindingfactors, TIF1–3, have been identified on the basis of their ability to bind to type I element sequences in vitro(27Mohammad M. Saha S. Kapler G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Because the DNA-binding subunits of the TIF1–3 complexes are distinct (TIF 1, 21.5 kDa; TIF2, 85 kDa; TIF3, 32 kDa), these activities appear to be biochemically unrelated. Furthermore, their differentially regulated expression profiles suggest that these activities compete for binding to type I elements in vivo. For example, extracts from non-replicating starved cells contain dramatically elevated levels of TIF3 (65 kDa) compared with extracts from asynchronous vegetative cells or cells undergoing rDNA gene amplification (27Mohammad M. Saha S. Kapler G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Concurrent with the onset of vegetative rDNA replication, TIF3 DNA binding activity is rapidly lost. 2M. Mohammad and G. M. Kapler, unpublished results.2M. Mohammad and G. M. Kapler, unpublished results. In contrast, DNA binding by TIF1 (native molecular mass 90 kDa) and TIF2 (native molecular mass 250 kDa) is elevated 3–4-fold in vegetative cells and cells undergoing rDNA gene amplification relative to starved (G0 arrested) cells (27Mohammad M. Saha S. Kapler G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The most extensively studied type I element binding activity, TIF1 (previously designated ssA-TIBF), is a homotetramer with a subunit molecular mass of 21 kDa (25Saha S. Kapler G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Umthun A.R. Hou Z. Sibenaller Z.A. Shiau W.-L. Dobbs D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4432-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Hou Z. Umthun A.R. Dobbs D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4583-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Purified TIF1 binds in a sequence-specific manner to single-stranded DNA corresponding to either the A-rich or T-rich strand of the type I elements, raising the possibility that it stabilizes replication origins in an unwound state (25Saha S. Kapler G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In vitro footprinting studies demonstrated that sequences immediately downstream of the type IB element modulate TIF1 binding. These downstream sequences are responsible for the different replication properties of B and C3 rDNA alleles (4Larson D.D. Blackburn E.H. Yaeger P.C. Orias E. Cell. 1986; 47: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Yaeger P.C. Orias E. Shaiu W.-L. Larson D.D. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22MacAlpine D.M. Zhang Z. Kapler G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We describe the isolation and characterization of the TIF1gene. We demonstrate that TIF1 binds to single-stranded type I elementsin vivo, as well as to an additional phylogenetically conserved sequence, the pause site element (PSE), that is shown here to be essential. TIF1 contains limited sequence similarity to a sequence-specific single-stranded DNA-binding protein in plants (30Desveaux D. Despres C. Joyeaux A. Subramaniam R. Brisson N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1477-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins may share structural features for target DNA recognition. Reverse genetic studies argue thatTetrahymena rDNA metabolism (replication initiation, replication elongation, and rRNA transcription) is regulated by multiple PSE and type I element binding proteins, some of which may have evolved overlapping, complementary functions. Our in vivo analysis of native chromatin suggests that TIF1 may modulate the binding of distinctive subsets of trans-acting factors to different cis-acting regulatory determinants. Extracts for the purification of TIF1 were prepared from T. thermophila strain CU428. Cultures were grown at 30 °C in 2% PPYS (2% proteose peptone, 0.2% yeast extract, 0.003% sequestrine) containing penicillin (250 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin (250 ng/ml) (31Orias E. Bruns P.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 13: 247-282Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Gel retardation assays were carried out as described previously (25Saha S. Kapler G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, oligonucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis prior to use. For standard binding and oligonucleotide competition studies, subsaturating amounts of affinity-purified TIF1 were incubated with 0.1 pmol of labeled oligonucleotide for 15 min on ice in 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 30 mm KCl, 12.5% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin. For competition assays, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the binding reaction. Oligonucleotide substrates included the C3 type IB element (ssA37; A-rich strand, 5′-GGCAAAAAAAAAAACAAAAATAGTAAACCTTCCGAAC), P3 pause site element (5′-AAAAAATGAATGAAAACTGAAAAATTTACAAGGGATTGAAAATTTTGGC), and the “nonspecific” coding region oligonucleotide 2220rc (25Saha S. Kapler G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). UV cross-linking studies were performed to assess the presence of the different type I element binding activities in antisense transformants. The 32P-5′-end-labeled C3 type IB element oligonucleotide (ssA37) used in these experiments contributes a mass of ∼12 kDa to DNA-protein complexes. Complexes were formed with crude S100 extracts using the gel shift conditions described above. Following UV cross-linking, covalent DNA-protein complexes were resolved by denaturing SDS-gel electrophoresis (27Mohammad M. Saha S. Kapler G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Protein molecular weight standards were used to estimate the mass of covalent cross-linked protein-DNA complexes. S100 extracts were prepared from strain CU428 as described (29Hou Z. Umthun A.R. Dobbs D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4583-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Approximately 60 ml of extract (protein concentration 8–10 mg/ml) were obtained from a 4-liter culture of cells grown to a density of 2 × 105/ml. The final yield of purified TIF1 protein was 4–6 μg. TIF1 was purified by sequential fractionation on conventional (Bio-Gel-HTP (Bio-Rad) and double-stranded DNA cellulose (Sigma)) and type I element oligonucleotide affinity resins as described previously (25Saha S. Kapler G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). TIF1 and TIF3 elute as overlapping peaks during stepwise sodium chloride elution (100–1400 mm NaCl) of the final oligonucleotide affinity column. Affinity-purified fractions containing just TIF1 were concentrated by filtration on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), prior to amino-terminal sequencing or subjecting to partial proteolysis with endo-Lys-C or endo-Glu-C. Proteolytic peptides were fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column. Intact TIF1 protein and purified proteolytic fragments were sequenced by Edman degradation on a Hewlett-Packard G1005A automated protein sequencer. The first part of theTIF1 gene was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR. mRNA was prepared with the Fast Track 2.0 mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) and subjected to cDNA synthesis with a peptide 4 (DFAEKD) reverse complement primer (5′-TCYTTYTCIGCRAARTC) and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). 40 cycles of PCR amplification were subsequently performed with Taqpolymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using the degenerate peptide 4 reverse complement primer in combination with a peptide 1 (GETVFSATP) primer (5′-GGIGARACIGTITTYTCIGCIACICC). To compensate for the lowTm of these primers, annealing and extension steps were performed for 1 min at 40 °C and 4 min at 50 °C, respectively. 3′-RACE and 5′-RACE were carried out with non-degenerate primers. For 3′-RACE, cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were performed with a 3′-anchor primer containing the sequence 5′-GAGGATCCGGGTACCA(T)17. The gene-specific primer for 3′-RACE contained the sequence 5′-GGATGGTAAGCTTTAGCCTCTTAC. 5′-RACE was performed using the 5′-RACE System version 2.0 (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNA for 5′-RACE was made using the gene-specific primer 5′-CATGGAATAACTTCAGTGAGCATGCATC. Nested PCR amplification was performed using the gene-specific primer 5′-TACTGTTATATAGTCGTTTTTAACTCC in combination with the 5′-RACE Abridged Anchor primer provided by the manufacturer. All PCR products were cloned into the SmaI site of pUC118 and sequenced. For antisense inhibition studies of the TIF1 gene, two selected TIF1 gene fragments were cloned in both orientations into the variable loop of the 26 S ribosomal RNA gene of the antisense ribosome vector p5318DN (32Sweeney R. Fan Q. Yao M.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8518-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Duplex synthetic oligonucleotides containing the relevant region of the gene, NotI adapters, and a diagnostic internalSalI site were ligated into p5318DN. Insert orientation was verified by sequencing. The 5′-non-coding antisense oligonucleotides are as follows: antisense 1 (As-1; S-1 corresponds to the reverse complement sequence), 5′-GGCCGCAAACATTATCTTAGCTAATTATGTATTGATTAAATTTTATATTTTAATTCAAATTATGATGTCGACGC-3′; antisense 2 (As-2; S-2 corresponds to the reverse complement sequence), 5′-GGCCGCTCCTTTGAAATACGAAAACATT- ATCTTAGCTAATTATGTATTGATTAAATTTTATATTTTAATGTCG- ACGC-3′. For all transformation studies, plasmids were introduced into matings between Tetrahymena strains CU427 and CU428 by conjugant electroporation (33Gaertig J. Gorovsky M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9196-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These C3-rDNA plasmids confer resistance to the antibiotic paromomycin and undergo excision and rearrangement to generate palindromic rDNA minichromosomes. For antisense inhibition studies, stable transformants were passaged continuously to allow for the replacement of endogenous BrDNA with plasmid-derived C3 rDNA minichromosomes. Following propagation of antisense and sense transformants for >80 fissions,HinfI-digested genomic DNA was analyzed for the presence of endogenous macronuclear B rDNA and plasmid-derivedC3 rDNA by Southern blot analysis with the 5′-end-labeled probe 5348UP (5′-CCTTTTGATCTGGATTGCTGCCC). The percentage of stable transformants relative to wild-type controls was calculated following selection with paromomycin. Deletion of the PSE3 region was achieved by PCR amplification of regions that flank the PSE3 site and cloning into a pBluescript vector as described previously (6Reischmann K.P. Zhang Z. Kapler G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The resulting 5′-NTS derivative lacks the entire 52-bp tripartite PSE3 element (positions 1055–1106) (22MacAlpine D.M. Zhang Z. Kapler G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The spacing of flanking elements was maintained by replacing the deleted segment with a fragment of comparable length and AT richness. APstI site present in the replaced segment was used to reinsert an intact PSE3 element into the deletion derivative, restoring the PSE3 sequence in its original orientation but altering the spacing and composition of flanking DNA due to the presence of aPstI site and additional nucleotides. The 5′-NTS region of the rDNA rearrangement vector AN101 was replaced with that of the PSE3 deletion mutant or PSE3 reinsertion mutant by digestion withKpnI and MluI. AN101 is a derivative of Tt947-01 (34Yao M.-C. Yao C.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1092-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in which a SalI fragment containing the micronuclear rDNA region was subcloned into pBluescript. Rearrangement vectors containing a copy of the wild-type C3 rDNA 5′-NTS (AN101), PSE3 deletion, or PSE3 reinsertion were transformed intoTetrahymena, and paromomycin-resistant transformants were selected as described previously (6Reischmann K.P. Zhang Z. Kapler G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Replication intermediates from vegetatively growingTetrahymena were enriched on BND-cellulose and examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described previously (2Zhang Z. MacAlpine D.M. Kapler G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6147-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) to assay replication initiation and fork pausing in the 5′-NTS. Southern blot analysis was performed with the 1.9-kb BamHI fragment from the plasmid pUC1x1.9, which encompasses the entire 5′-NTS. For the purpose of in vivo footprinting, cultures were grown to a cell density of 2 × 105 cells/ml and synchronized at the G1/S boundary by starvation for 16 h in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and refeeding with 1% PPYS for 105 min. Harvested cells were washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), and treated with 0.5 mm potassium permanganate at 20 °C for 20 min. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were subsequently washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, and DNA was isolated as described previously (3Palen T.E. Cech T.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 933-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Permanganate-reactive sites were identified following 25 cycles of primer extension with Taq polymerase (35Sasse-Dwight S. Grala J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 146-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 500,000–750,000 cpm of 5′-end-labeled primers were used per reaction. Reaction products were alcohol-precipitated and analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide, 8m urea gels. The gels were exposed 48–72 h. Oligonucleotides were as follows: 1012DN (5′-CAGGATGCGTATATCATTTTT) for analysis of footprints on the lower (antisense) strand in the pause site 2 (P2)/type IB element region; B-34UP (5′-CACGAAGTCTCAAAAGTTG) for upper strand analysis of the P2 region; 1369UP (5′-GTGGCTTCACACAAAATCTAAGCG) for upper strand analysis of the type IB region; 1665DN (5′-GCTCTAAATTAAATTAGACTTAGTG) for lower strand analysis of the pause site P3/type IC/type ID region; and 1948UP (5′-TCTTACTGAAGCTCAAATCGAGCTG) for upper strand analysis of the P3/type IC/type ID region. Previous genetic studies demonstrated that type I elements regulate two replication-based processes, initiation and elongation of replication forks (4Larson D.D. Blackburn E.H. Yaeger P.C. Orias E. Cell. 1986; 47: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Reischmann K.P. Zhang Z. Kapler G.M.

Reischmann K.P. Kapler G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4635-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), co-localization with the physical sites for replication fork arrest (22MacAlpine D.M. Zhang Z. Kapler G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and juxtaposition to nucleosome/non-nucleosomes borders at replication origins (2Zhang Z. MacAlpine D.M. Kapler G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6147-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) suggested similar functional roles. Furthermore, the physical proximity of type I and PSEs raised the possibility that proteins bound to these different elements might physically interact. Previous studies identified three in vitro type I element binding activities, TIF1–3 (27Mohammad M. Saha S. Kapler G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 843-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As an initial step toward studying PSE-binding proteins, gel shift analysis was performed with crude S100 extracts and a radiolabeled single-stranded PSE3 oligonucleotide. Three stable gel shift complexes were detected, two of which co-migrated with type I element gel shift complexes that are mediated by the TIF1 protein (Fig. 2 A) (25Saha S. Kapler G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To address whether the upper two PSE complexes were mediated by TIF1, TIF1 was directly assayed for PSE binding, following purification to homogeneity by conventional and sequence-specific oligonucleotide affinity chromatography (Fig. 2 B). Experiments with a radiolabeled type IB element oligonucleotide and cold PSE competitor demonstrate that TIF1 binds to PSEs (Fig. 2 C, left panel,crude S100 extract; right panel, purified TIF1 protein). TIF1 displayed a greater affinity for the PSE than for the type I element, both in studies with crude extracts and purified TIF1 protein. This result was confirmed using the radiolabeled PSE3 oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 3 and 5). Thus, TIF1 binds to a known replication determinant, the type I element, and to an additional phylogenetically conserved sequence, the pause site element. Affinity-purified TIF1 (Fig. 2 B) was obtained in amounts sufficient for peptide microsequencing. In addition to the amino terminus, peptide sequence information was obtained for four internal fragments following limited proteolysis with endo-Lys-C or endo-Glu-C (Fig.3 A, underlined segments). These sequenced segments were used to design primers for reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of the TIF1 cDNA. Due to the high degree of codon degeneracy in the amino-terminal peptide and high A + T content of the corresponding degenerate primers, TIF1-specific PCR products were not obtained using amino-terminal primers in combination with reverse complement primers from any of the four internal peptide sequences. However, a single 490-bp PCR product was obtained with the peptide 1 forward and peptide 4 reverse complement primers (data not shown). The predicted amino acid sequence of the cloned PCR product includes perfect matches to peptides 2 and 3, indicating that this product encompasses the majority of the TIF1 coding region. The remainder of the TIF1 cDNA was obtained by 5′- and 3′-RACE using non-degenerate primers (data not shown). The amino terminus of purified TIF1 protein lacks the first 23 amino acids of the TIF1 open reading frame, raising the possibility that TIF1 is post-translationally modified in vivo. The TIF1gene predicts a protein mass of 21.5 kDa, which is in agreement with data obtained by mass spectrometry for purified TIF1 protein. 3L. Dangott"

Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 2Carrillo N. Vallejos R.H. Barber J. The Light Reactions. Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 527-560Google Scholar). In chloroplasts and in vegetative cells of cyanobacteria, they catalyze the reversible electron transfer between two molecules of ferredoxin and a single molecule of a pyridine nucleotide (1Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The photosynthetic electron transport process reduces ferredoxin at the level of photosystem I, and then FNR transfers electrons from the reduced iron–sulfur protein to NADP+. This process concludes with the formation of the NADPH necessary for CO2 fixation and other biosynthetic pathways (1Arakaki A.K. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). FNRs are also able to mediate oxido-reduction of the FMN-containing flavodoxins, which are synthesized in bacteria either constitutively or under iron deficit conditions as replacement of ferredoxins (3Martinez-Julvez M. Medina M. Gomez-Moreno C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). FNRs also take part of other non-photosynthetic processes such as nitrogen fixation (4Jungermann K. Kirchniawy H. Katz N. Thauer R.K. FEBS Lett. 1974; 43: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 5Sancho J. Peleato M.L. Gomez-Moreno C. Edmondson D.E. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1997; 249: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of more than ten FNRs from different sources have been determined, displaying all the same structural features, which constitute a prototype for a large family of flavoenzymes. They consist of two different domains; one involved in the binding of the prosthetic group FAD and the other responsible for binding of NADP+ (8Karplus P.A. Bruns C.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The prosthetic group is attached to the reductase NH2-terminal domain, which extends up to residue 147 (numbered as in pea FNR), whereas the sequence comprising residues 148–308 contains the NADP+ binding site (9Bruns C.M. Karplus P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 10Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Each domain is a compact structure that provides for binding the bulk of its respective dinucleotide, although both cofactors also interact with some residues from the other domain. FAD is bound outside of an anti-parallel β-barrel, which makes up the core of its binding domain. Of note, two tyrosine residues lie close to each side of the isoalloxazine. The residue Tyr-308 in pea FNR, which is stacked near parallel to the re-face of the flavin, is completely conserved among all members of the FNR family and present in several members of the flavodoxin family. Recently, we have succeeded in obtaining the structures of productive NADP+ and NADPH complexes with pea FNR (10Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This structure reveals the productive binding mode of NADP+ to the catalytic site, in which the nicotinamide ring lies against the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring in an angle of ∼30°. These results indicate that the nicotinamide ring should displace Tyr-308 for productive binding to the enzyme, as it was previously suggested (11Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The other side of the flavin, the si-face, is buried into the protein structure and facing Tyr-89. The aromatic side chain of this residue makes an angle of 54° with the isoalloxazine (10Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Moreover, Tyr-89 participates in an intricate net of interactions that involves other amino acids and the prosthetic group itself (see Fig. 1below). The aromatic moiety of the tyrosine interacts through π-π stacking directly with the isoalloxazine ring, meanwhile the hydroxyl group makes a hydrogen bond with the 4′-ribityl hydroxyl group of FAD. The latter hydroxyl group is also in contact with Lys-110 through a water molecule (H2O 1003). Lys-110 also makes a hydrogen bond with the C2 oxygen of the isoalloxazine and through its Nζ with the NMN phosphate of NADP+ (see Fig. 1, Ref. 10Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This interaction was inferred by chemical modification and mutagenesis analysis (12Aliverti A. Lubberstedt T. Zanetti G. Herrmann R.G. Curti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17760-17763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Aliverti A. Gadda G. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Homology with the tyrosine 89 residue was found in all members of the FNR superfamily (8Karplus P.A. Bruns C.M. J. Bioenerg.

Ramaswamy S. Niviere V. Fontecave M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In many other flavoproteins, an aromatic residue is also found stacked on thesi-face of FAD (16Djordjevic S. Pace C.P. Stankovich M.T. Kim J.J.

Proteins. 1997; 27: 601-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or FMN (Table I). Therefore, it is evident that aromatic amino acids stacked on the flavinsi-face may play an important role on the structure and/or function of these enzymes. By way of illustration, replacement of the homologous highly conserved Tyr-44 in monoamine oxidase B by non-aromatic amino acids strongly affects the initial FAD binding and the catalytic activity of the enzyme (21Zhou B.P. Lewis D.A. Kwan S.W. Kirksey T.J. Abell C.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9526-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In flavodoxin, mutation of the invariantly flanked aromatic amino acid of the si-face of the cofactor destabilized the apoflavodoxin·FMN complex in all redox states analyzed (22Lostao A. Gomez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, substantial experimental data indicate that the above-mentioned aromatic side chain modulates the oxidation-reduction potentials of the semiquinone/hydroquinone pair (22Lostao A.

Open table in a new tab Despite the amount of structural and functional information on FNRs that has been obtained in the past years, the role of the tyrosine interacting with the si-face of the flavin has remained uncertain. Previous studies have replaced the homologous Tyr-95 of spinach FNR by phenylalanine, observing changes essentially inkcat values of the mutant enzyme respect to the wild type form (25Aliverti A. Pandini V.E. Sternieri F.A. Corrado M.E. Karplus P.A. Zanetti G. Mathhis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht2001: 653-656Google Scholar). In this study, we have performed ab initio molecular orbital calculations to analyze the geometry of the Tyr-89 and the flavin. We also describe the results obtained by introducing site-directed mutations of Tyr-89. Substitutions (Tyr to Phe, Trp, Ser, or Gly) were selected to investigate the aromatic and hydrogen bonding interactions of the mutated residue with FAD. Structural and functional features of purified mutants proteins were analyzed. We observed that aromaticity on residue 89 was essential for FAD binding and proper folding of the protein. Our results suggest that hydrogen bonding through the Tyr-89 hydroxyl group is responsible for the correct positioning of FAD and the substrate NADP+. All crystal structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank, Rutgers (26Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E.

Figures were rendered with RasMol v2.6 (R. Sayle, 1994, Greenford, Middlesex, UK). Ab initio molecular theory calculations were carried out at the Restricted Hartree Fock theory level, using a 3–21G** basis set (27Feller D. Davidson E.R. Rev. Comp.

When expressed by transformed Escherichia coli cells, the β-galactosidase portion of the fusion product is cleaved by bacterial proteases to yield a mature FNR form with a single additional amino acid at the NH2 terminus (28Ceccarelli E.A. Viale A.M. Krapp A.R. Carrillo N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14283-14287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In pGF205, the FNR coding sequence is linked in-frame to the 3′-end of the Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene in vector pGEX-3X (30Smith D.B. Johnson K.S.

Mutant versions of pea ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis following the procedure described by Kunkelet al. (31Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar), using single-stranded plasmid DNA prepared in the ung − dut − host CJ236 E. coli strain (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) in combination with the following oligonucleotides: gagattgtGGtcaattgcAagca (Y89W), gagattgtTCtcaattgcAagca (Y89F), gagattgtCTtcaattgcAagca (Y89S), and gagattgGGttcaattgcAagca (Y89G).

Briefly, bacterial cleared lysates obtained from 10 liters of culture medium were applied to a 1.5- × 25-cm glutathione-agarose column (sulfur linkage, Sigma Chemical Co.). Then, the fusion products were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione. Following cleavage with restriction factor Xa (Promega), the reductases were purified to apparent homogeneity using a second passage through glutathione-agarose. Finally, proteins were purified using a DEAE-Macroprep column (2.5 × 50 cm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (buffer A). The column was extensively washed with the same buffer, and bound FNR was eluted using a linear gradient from 0 to 0.4 m NaCl in buffer A. The FNR fractions eluting near 275 mm NaCl were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and were concentrated by a DEAE-Macroprep column (0.5 × 10 cm, Bio-Rad, equilibrated in buffer A) eluted with 300 mm NaCl in buffer A. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gels were either stained for protein with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or subjected to electroblotting and immunoreaction (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Resistance of soluble purified FNRs to protease was determined as described previously (35Gadda G. Aliverti A. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. J. Biol.

Reactions were incubated for the times stated at 25 °C, stopped by the addition of 10 mmEDTA on ice, and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer prior to electrophoresis. Absorption spectra recordings were performed on a Gilford Response spectrophotometer. Extinction coefficients of the FNR forms were determined by releasing the FAD from the protein by treatment with 0.2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate and quantifying the flavin spectrophotometrically (36Aliverti A.

Difference spectra and dissociation constants of the FNR complexes with NADP+ were determined as previously described (37Piubelli L. Aliverti A. Arakaki A.K. Carrillo N. Ceccarelli E.A. Karplus P.A. Zanetti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10472-10476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using FNR samples in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. Immediately before the measurements, samples were filtered through a Biogel PGD-6 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to eliminate free FAD. FNR-dependent diaphorase was determined by published methods (38Zanetti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 445: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Following addition of the FNR sample, the reactions were monitored spectrophotometrically following ferricyanide reduction at 420 nm (420 = 1 mm−1.cm−1). For the determination of kinetic parameters, steady-state kinetic were carried out at several different concentrations of NADPH, at a fixed saturating concentration (1 mm) of potassium ferricyanide, and the data were fitted to the theoretical curves using Sigmaplot software (Jandel Scientific). We have surveyed the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank for the geometries of aromatic amino acids facing thesi-face of the flavin in high resolution flavoprotein structures. Among them, 25% contain an aromatic residue near the flavin. Moreover, we observed that in FNR-like flavoproteins the tyrosine near the si-face of the flavin is completely conserved and always interacting in an edge-to-face position (TableI, Fig.1 for pea FNR), which has been proved to be a favorable orientation among interacting aromatic molecules (39Lombard M. Fontecave M. Touati D. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 115-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The C ring of the flavin is always involved in the interaction, and the angle formed with the tyrosine phenol varies from 54 to 68 degrees, with the exception of phthalate dioxygenase reductase, in which Tyr-57 is in a near perpendicular position (88 degrees). The examination of non-FNR-like flavoproteins shows more freedom than in FNR-like proteins with respect to the aromatic amino acid facing the flavin and the isoalloxazine ring involved in the interaction. However, the tyrosine is still the more frequent interacting partner (13 out of the 20 available structures, Table I). It is worth noting that, in the case of flavodoxin, the aromatic moiety is in a near parallel stack (Table I). We decided to further analyze the geometric preferences of the above-mentioned interaction using model molecules and ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/3–21G level. Our aim was to investigate whether the tyrosine and the flavin are interacting in energetically favorable arrangement, contributing to the stability of the holoprotein and the binding of the prosthetic group. We have simplified our system using lumiflavin, which is widely accepted as a model compound for flavin (40Zheng Y.J. Ornstein R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9402-9408Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and phenol as the R group of tyrosine. The perturbation of the aromatic charge distribution introduced by substituting a hydrogen atom of benzene for the aliphatic side chain of phenylalanine is negligible (41Hunter C.A. Singh J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Thus, it may be assumed that the isolated phenol ring can be used for the calculations performed. The relative stability of the flavin-tyrosine system in different conformations was evaluated using the same set of molecules where only the angles or distances among them were varied. Fig.2 A shows the arrangement of the lumiflavin and phenol with the geometry found between flavin and Tyr-89 in the crystal structures of pea FNR. Different arrangements were constructed where the phenol was rotated in defined steps on the Cγ–Cζ axis, keeping constant the orientation of the phenol hydroxyl group and the distance between the aromatic rings centroids (see Fig. 2 A). Thus, a set of arrangements between the two molecules with α between −90 and 90 degrees was used to calculate potential energy. Fig. 2 B shows the potential energy values obtained for each arrangement (for each α) plotted against α. A plateau was observed between angles 55° and 73°, with a minimum at 63° (−2.08 kcal/mol). The experimental geometry measured for α in pea FNR was 54° (−2.02 kcal/mol; open circle in Fig.2 B), which is close to the global energy minimum detected. It is worth mentioning that in the range 55–73° the variation observed is only 0.06 kcal/mol. It may be inferred that the position of Tyr-89 in pea FNR is mainly governed by the energetic minimum of the pairwise interaction between the phenol ring and the flavin. We have performed the same set of calculations mentioned above adding a phenol confronting the other side of the lumiflavin, in an equivalent position to that found for the naturally occurring Tyr-308 in pea FNR. In the latter case, we did not observed significant changes in the values obtained for the interaction of the flavin and the si-side phenol (not shown). This conclusion is also supported by the fact that the mutated enzyme in which the Tyr-308 was replaced by Ser does not display considerable changes in the orientation and distance of Tyr-89 with respect to the flavin (Table I). Energetically favorable non-bonded aromatic interaction occurs at phenyl ring centroid separations >3.4 and <7 Å (42McGaughey G.B. Gagne M. Rappe A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15458-15463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). We decided to analyze the influence of the distance in the phenol-lumiflavin potential energy. Fig. 2 C shows how the estimated potential energy of the pair phenol-lumiflavin varies as a function of orientation and distance of the pair under study. The x-axis is the angle of rotation of the phenol about its Cγ–Cζ axis, and the y-axis represents the distance from the centroids of the facing aromatic rings (d in Fig. 2 A). Thewhite zones represent non-attractive geometry-distance arrangements, meanwhile, the increasing gray indicates favored interactions. Geometries observed for pea FNR is represented on Fig. 2 C with a star symbol. All FNR-like proteins displayed geometries for the si-face tyrosine phenol and the flavin that fell near or into the island with the more negative free energy value, with the exception of bacterial ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase from Azotobacter vinelandii. In the case of the phthalate dioxygenase reductase, in which Tyr-57 is in a near perpendicular position, the change is compensated with an approximation of the centroids, thus maintaining the more favorable geometry. To further investigate the function of Tyr-89, four mutant cDNAs of FNR were successfully constructed and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Base replacements resulted in FNRs enzymes with a single change at Tyr-89. In two of the mutants, the phenol ring of Tyr-89 was replaced by an indole (Y89W) or by a benzene ring (Y89F), thus maintaining an aromatic residue. Mutation Y89S changes the phenolic side chain into a primary alcohol, which eliminates the aromatic ring but keeps a free hydroxyl group at the carboxyl end, and the Y89G mutant, which only leaves a hydrogen atom as an R group. Expression of the FNR mutants as soluble cytosolic proteins in E. coli using the pUC-derived expression vector pCV105 (see “Experimental Procedures” (28Ceccarelli E.A. Viale A.M. Krapp A.R.

Furthermore, the catalytic domain of Btk is inactive, in contrast to the catalytic domain of the prototypical Src tyrosine kinase that retains full catalytic ability.

These non-receptor tyrosine kinases are distinguished by their unique possession of pleckstrin homology (PH) and Tec homology (TH) domains, in addition to Src homology (SH) 3, SH2, and catalytic domains commonly found in other families of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. These kinases are found in a variety of cells and tissues and play essential and diverse regulatory roles in various physiological processes such as growth, differentiation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal reorganization, and cell motility. These versatile functions of the Btk family tyrosine kinases may reflect their ability to participate in signaling by antigen receptors, cytokine receptors, G protein-coupled receptors, growth factor receptors, and integrins. Defects in Btk are responsible for X-chromosome linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in humans (4Vetrie D. Vorechovsky I. Sideras P. Holland J. Davies A. Flinter F. Hammarstrom L. Kinnon C. Levinsky R.

Patients are prone to bacterial infections as a result of having less than 1% of the normal number of mature B cells in the periphery and very low levels of immunoglobulin (2Satterthwaite A.B. Witte O.N. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 175: 120-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surveys of XLA patients revealed mutations in all structural domains of Btk proteins including the Btk family-unique PHTH module (8Vihinen M. Kwan S.P. Lester T. Ochs H.D. Resnick I. Valiaho J. Conley M.E. Smith C.I. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To understand why these mutations would manifest the observed disease phenotype, we need to understand the basic properties of Btk enzyme and the roles of its various domains, in addition to the regulation of Btk by various signaling receptors. Because the Btk family tyrosine kinases distinguish themselves from other non-receptor tyrosine kinases by their PH and TH domains, we have compared the enzymatic properties of full-length Btk and a deletion mutant Btk without the PHTH module (BtkΔPHTH). We have found that the basal catalytic activities of Btk and BtkΔPHTH are not substantially different. However, Btk and BtkΔPHTH have vastly different abilities to recognize protein substrates. Full-length Btk, PHTH-deleted Btk, and the catalytic domain of Btk were purified from Sf9 cells. The detailed purification protocols will be published elsewhere. Briefly, the DNA fragments encoding the full-length (amino acids 1–659) or the PHTH-deletion mutant (amino acids 212–659) or the catalytic domain (amino acids 384–659) of Btk were subcloned into pFastBak1 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). After obtaining the recombinant baculoviruses harboring pFastBak1-Btk, pFastBak1-BtkΔPHTH, or pFastBak1-Btk-cat, Sf9 cells were infected and harvested after 60 h. Btk, BtkΔPHTH, and Btk-cat were purified by chromatography, and the purification was monitored by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting with anti-Btk antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Kinase assay was performed as described previously (9Bence K. Ma W. Kozasa T. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Jiang Y. Ma W. Wan Y. Kozasa T.

Purified Btk or BtkΔPHTH kinase (10 nm) in Btk kinase buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm ATP) was combined with 70 μm Btk substrate peptide. 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was added, and the mixture (total, 20 μl) was incubated at 30 °C for 8 min. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer. After heating at 90 °C for 5 min, the substrate peptide was separated on 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, dried, and autoradiographed. In some experiments, Vav (amino acid residues from 170–375 of mouse Vav) or GST-CDB3 was used as substrate. Purification of these recombinant proteins has been described previously (11Wan Y. Bence K.

Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Enzyme kinetic activity was measured with a coupled spectrophotometric assay (13Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this assay, the production of ADP was coupled to the oxidation of NADH measured as a reduction in absorbance at 340 nm. Reactions contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.28 mm NADH, 89 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 124 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 60 nm Btk, and progress curves were monitored by absorbance at 340 nm in a spectrophotometer. When Km (pep) was determined, [ATP] was fixed at 500 μm. WhenKm (ATP) was determined, the concentration of the peptide substrate was fixed at 100 μm. Initial rates were measured, and the kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the rates. Km and Vmax were determined by fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten equation.kcat was calculated asVmax/[E] (14Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Mutations in the PH and TH domains of Btk have been identified in patients (8Vihinen M. Kwan S.P. Lester T. Ochs H.D. Resnick I. Valiaho J. Conley M.E. Smith C.I. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A); however, it is not clear how these mutations manifest the observed phenotype. Some of the mutations in the PH domain occurred in residues known to be involved in inositol phosphate binding. There were two large deletion mutants in Btk that caused XLA: one involves parts of both the PH and TH domains, and another is within the SH3 domain (8Vihinen M. Kwan S.P. Lester T. Ochs H.D. Resnick I. Valiaho J. Conley M.E. Smith C.I. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To understand the possible causal relationship between mutation and disease with the PH and TH deletion, it is essential to understand the role of the PHTH module in Btk function. A NMR structure of the proline-rich region (within the TH domain) and the SH3 domain of Itk/Tsk (a member of the Btk family of kinases) showed an intramolecular interaction between these two domains (15Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Furthermore, crystal structures of c-Src and Hck revealed that an intramolecular interaction involving its SH3 domain has a major role in keeping Src family tyrosine kinases at a down-regulated state (16Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar, 17Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 18Williams J.C. Weijland A. Gonfloni S. Thompson A. Courtneidge S.A. Superti-Furga G. Wierenga R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This led to an assumption that Btk family tyrosine kinases might use a similar intramolecular interaction to suppress Btk activity. Therefore, we first compared the enzymatic properties of the full-length Btk and BtkΔPHTH (Fig. 1). Both Btk and BtkΔPHTH were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1,A and B). When a small substrate peptide derived from the autophosphorylation site (Tyr-223) of Btk within its SH3 domain (19Park H. Wahl M.I. Afar D.E. Turck C.W. Rawlings D.J. Tam C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Immunity. 1996; 4: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) was used, we found that the basal catalytic activities of Btk and BtkΔPHTH were not substantially different (Fig.1 C). Thus, deletion of the PHTH module had no effect on the kinase activity of Btk. We next investigated the enzymatic kinetic parameters of Btk and BtkΔPHTH. We found that BtkΔPHTH and Btk have similarkcat values (TableI). With the peptide substrate and ATP-Mg2+, Btk has a Km of ∼60 μm for the peptide substrate and a Km of ∼250 μm for ATP-Mg2+ (Table I). TheVmax is ∼6 μm/min, and thekcat is ∼100/min. BtkΔPHTH has aKm of ∼22 μm for the peptide substrate and a Km of ∼350 μm for ATP-Mg2+ (Table I). BtkΔPHTH and Btk have similarkcat values (Table I). In comparison with down-regulated c-Src tyrosine kinase, Btk seems to have a lowerKm for small peptide substrates (∼60 μm) than c-Src (∼370 μm), a higherKm for ATP-Mg2+ than c-Src (∼55 μm), and a ∼10-fold higher catalytic rate (14Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Btk has a higher basal activity than down-regulated c-Src and that Btk and down-regulated c-Src may possibly have different structural configurations between their active sites and activation loops. The above-mentioned enzymatic kinetic data suggest that deletion of the PHTH module did not change the intrinsic catalytic ability of Btk.Table IKinetic parameters of Btk and BtkΔPHTHKm (pep)Km (ATP)Vmaxkcat(μm)(μm)(μm/min)(min−1 )Btk59 ± 12245 ± 556.2 ± 1.2103 ± 20BtkΔPHTH22 ± 5347 ± 706.9 ± 1.4115 ± 23 Open table in a new tab Based on cellular studies, a Btk activation mechanism has been proposed: Src family tyrosine kinases could phosphorylate Tyr-551 at the activation loop of Btk, increase Btk kinase activity, and lead to the autophosphorylation of Tyr-223 within the SH3 domain of Btk (Fig. 2 A) (19Park H. Wahl M.I. Afar D.E. Turck C.W. Rawlings D.J. Tam C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N.

Science. 1996; 271: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In this model, Src phosphorylation of Tyr-551 is prerequired for Btk activation. However, this proposal has not been tested with purified Btk. Therefore, we examined the possible effect of the deletion of the PHTH module on the ability of Btk to autophosphorylate. Using antibodies specific for Btk phosphorylated at Tyr-223 or at Tyr-551 (21Wahl M.I. Fluckiger A.C. Kato R.M. Park H. Witte O.N. Rawlings D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11526-11533Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we investigated the autophosphorylation of purified Btk and BtkΔPHTH. As shown in Fig. 2, both Btk and BtkΔPHTH can autophosphorylate Tyr-223 and Tyr-551 in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2,B−D, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that both Tyr-223 and Tyr-551 residues can be autophosphorylation sites. We noticed that before incubation with ATP, some purified Btk but not BtkΔPHTH is phosphorylated at Tyr-223 but not Tyr-551, indicating that Tyr-223 might indeed be the primary (or first) autophosphorylation site (Fig. 2, B−D, lanes 1 and 2). Furthermore, Src did not significantly increase the phosphorylation of Tyr-223 or Tyr-551 beyond the autophosphorylation levels (Fig. 2, B−D, lanes 5 and 6). Nevertheless, the ability of Btk to autophosphorylate the Tyr-551 residue at the activation loop is similar to c-Src autophosphorylating Tyr-416 at its own activation loop. This suggests that, similar to Tyr-416 in c-Src, autophosphorylation of Tyr-551 in Btk may correlate with its increased kinase activity by promoting a change in conformation of the activation loop. These autophosphorylation data suggest that, similar to c-Src, factors other than Src tyrosine kinase (such as G proteins) can increase the catalytic activity of Btk and demonstrate that deletion of the PHTH module had no effect on the autophosphorylation of Tyr-223 and Tyr-551 by Btk. Remarkably, we observed that Btk and BtkΔPHTH have strikingly different abilities to recognize protein substrates. Btk has been shown to act upstream of Vav, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho family small G proteins (22Machide M. Mano H. Todokoro K. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 619-625PubMed Google Scholar). When a fragment (residues 170–375) of Vav encompassing the catalytic Dbl homology domain was used as substrate (12Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), it was efficiently phosphorylated by Btk (Fig.3 A, lane 1). On the other hand, BtkΔPHTH was much less efficient in phosphorylating Vav (Fig.3 A, lane 2). We have also studied the phosphorylation of another protein substrate, GST-CDB3, a GST fusion protein with the cytoplasmic domain of Band 3 protein that has been used as a conventional substrate for Btk kinase assays (10Jiang Y. Ma W. Wan Y. Kozasa T. Hattori S. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 11Wan Y. Bence K. Hata A. Kurosaki T. Veillette A. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17209-17215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Again, Btk, but not BtkΔPHTH, efficiently phosphorylated GST-CDB3 (Fig.3 B). Furthermore, Btk, but not BtkΔPHTH, could phosphorylate purified proteins such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and type V adenylyl cyclase (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the PHTH module is critical for protein substrate recognition by Btk and suggest a possible role in the development of the disease phenotype. One possible mechanism to explain why Btk but not BtkΔPHTH could phosphorylate Vav is that the PHTH module contributes to protein substrate binding. To test this, we have examined the interaction of the PHTH module with Vav (Fig. 4). We found that, in addition to the catalytic domain, the PH domain and the PHTH module could also interact with Vav (Fig. 4). Thus, the association of Vav with the catalytic domain alone is not sufficient for Vav phosphorylation. This additional contact with the PH domain might enhance or stabilize the interaction of Vav with Btk and allow Vav to be phosphorylated by Btk. Alternatively, the presence of the PHTH module changes the conformation of the catalytic site of Btk to be suitable to phosphorylate larger protein substrates. Many recombinant catalytic domains of protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases, such as insulin receptor kinase, Src, Fps, and SHP-1, are essentially fully catalytically active on peptide as well as protein substrates (23Wei L. Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8122-8130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). One exception is the catalytic domain of tyrosine kinase Csk, which is catalytically inactive even though its crystal structure is very similar to that of c-Src (26Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11147-11155Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Lamers M.B. Antson A.A. Hubbard R.E. Scott R.K. Williams D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We have investigated the catalytic activity of the catalytic domain of Btk. We found that the catalytic domain of Btk (Btk-cat) could not phosphorylate the peptide or protein substrates, whereas the catalytic domain of c-Src (Src-cat) could (Fig. 5,A and B). The Btk catalytic domain also could not autophosphorylate at Tyr-551 in its activation loop (data not shown). These data suggest that Btk might have different intramolecular interactions and regulations compared with many other protein kinases and phosphatases and that the Btk catalytic domain relies on other modules such as the PHTH or the SH3SH2 to recognize substrates or to modulate the accessibility to substrates. Defects in Btk are responsible for XLA in patients. The Btk family of tyrosine kinases is the only tyrosine kinase family to possess a PHTH module. The PH domain of Btk provides a binding site for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, the lipid product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (28Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6241-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Some PH domain residues mutated in XLA patients (such as R28C) are within the inositol binding region, indicating the importance of the inositol binding and the consequent membrane localization. The TH domain is composed of the N-terminal Btk motif (BM) followed by two proline-rich regions in tandem in Btk. This TH domain has only been found in members of Btk family kinases thus far. The PHTH module has been shown to be important for interaction with Vav, protein kinase C isoforms, G proteins Gβγ and Gα12, F-actin, tyrosine kinase FAK, phosphotyrosine phosphatase PTPD1, transcriptional factors Stat 3 and BP-135/TFII-I, and substrate BCR downstream signaling 1 (BRDG1) (1Qiu Y. Kung H.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 2Satterthwaite A.B. Witte O.N. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 175: 120-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yang W.C. Collette Y. Nunes J.A. Olive D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 373-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Some of these interactions caused modulation of the Btk kinase activity. It had been proposed that the PHTH module could form intramolecular interactions with other parts of Btk family kinases, leading to suppression of its kinase activity (15Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 29Ma Y.C. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12197-12201Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Possible disruption of these intramolecular interactions by other factors might increase the kinase activity. However, we found that the basal catalytic activity of Btk and BtkΔPHTH was not substantially different. It is possible that the PHTH module could relay the binding of other factors to the catalytic domains allosterically. Alternatively, some of these activators might have more than one interaction site on Btk. A third possibility, although there is no evidence for it at the present time, is that there is an unidentified mechanism (or modification) involving the PHTH module that keeps Btk down-regulated in cells that is absent in purified Btk and BtkΔPHTH. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that the PHTH module is important in protein substrate recognition by Btk (Fig. 6). It is striking that deletion of the PHTH module abolished the phosphorylation of protein substrates but not the phosphorylation of small peptides. Therefore, the PHTH module plays versatile roles in protein-protein or protein-membrane interactions controlling the function of Btk. It is interesting to note that Drosophilaexpress both the full-length Btk protein and the PH/BM module-deleted Btk protein from the same gene through alternative RNA splicing (30Baba K. Takeshita A. Majima K. Ueda R. Kondo S. Juni N. Yamamoto D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4405-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Loss of function of both Btk and BtkΔPHBM caused oocyte undergrowth and embryonic death. On the other hand, the mutantfickle P fly expresses only BtkΔPHBM and shows defective male genital formation and reduced adult-stage life span, indicating the physiological importance of the PH/TH module. We have shown that purified Btk and BtkΔPHTH are capable of autophosphorylating the Tyr-223 and Tyr-551 residues. The ability of Btk to autophosphorylate the Tyr-551 residue at the activation loop is similar to c-Src autophosphorylating Tyr-416 at its own activation loop. This suggests that autophosphorylation of Tyr-551 in Btk may correlate with its regulated kinase activity. Indeed, phosphorylation of Tyr-551 by Src family kinases was proposed to increase Btk kinase activity (20Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S. Kato R.M. Fluckiger A.C. Witte O.N. Kinet J.P. Science. 1996; 271: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Although mutation of Tyr-223 had no direct effect on the kinase activity of Btk, phosphorylation of Tyr-223 could affect the interaction of Btk with other proteins (1Qiu Y. Kung H.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These autophosphorylation data suggest that, similar to c-Src, factors other than tyrosine kinases can increase the catalytic activity of Btk because Btk is able to autophosphorylate the Tyr-551 residue at the activation loop. In comparison with the down-regulated c-Src tyrosine kinase, Btk seems to have a different structural domain organization. Although both Btk and c-Src have similar linear organization of the SH3-SH2 catalytic domains, they respond very differently to some peptide activators. A phosphotyrosine-containing peptide, which is an SH2-binding peptide, increased the kinase activity of c-Src (31Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) but had no significant effect on the activity of Btk or BtkΔPHTH. 2W. E. Lowry, J. Huang, and X.-Y. Huang, unpublished data. A proline-rich peptide, which is an SH3-binding peptide, also enhanced the kinase activity of c-Src (31Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) but had no significant effect on the activity of Btk or BtkΔPHTH.2 These may imply that the interdomain organization is different in c-Src and Btk. Recently, an x-ray crystal structure of the catalytic domain of Btk in its unphosphorylated state was determined (32Mao C. Zhou M. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41435-41443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our enzymological data are consistent with the crystal structural data. Due to the inactive conformation of the critical helix αC in the N-terminal lobe, the catalytic domain alone is not active (32Mao C. Zhou M. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41435-41443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The structures of the activation loops of Btk and down-regulated Src kinases are markedly different. The activation loop in Btk adopts a unique conformation. Unlike Src, the peptide substrate binding site is not occluded by other portions of the catalytic domain of Btk; this might explain why Btk has a lower Km for small peptide substrates than c-Src (Table I). The apparent higher Km for ATP-Mg2+ by Btk than down-regulated Src is consistent with the failure of binding of Btk to the ATP affinity column.2Given the difference in catalytic activity of BtkΔPHTH and Btk-cat, the SH3 and/or SH2 domains presumably have a major effect on the configuration of the active site of Btk. It was further proposed that Btk has a unique activation mechanism (32Mao C. Zhou M. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41435-41443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr-551 could lead to Btk activation by triggering an exchange of hydrogen-bonded pairs from Glu-445/Arg-544 to Glu-445/Lys-430 and subsequent rotation of helix αC within the N-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain (32Mao C. Zhou M. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41435-41443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recognition of upstream modulators and downstream substrates and subcellular localization of protein tyrosine kinases are essential components of their biological function. Unlike enzymes involved in metabolism, tyrosine kinases appear to have diverse upstream regulators as well as multiple downstream substrates. Metabolic networks are generally very stable and resilient because most molecules in the metabolic pathways are thought to be sparsely connected. On the other hand, signaling networks are generally more dynamic and plastic and prone to modulation. Although the active site of the catalytic domain of these protein tyrosine kinases may have some degree of substrate specificity, these tyrosine kinases use their multimodular domains, such as the PHTH module, the SH3 domain, or the SH2 domain, to interact with regulators and/or substrates in the context of specific signaling processes and the cellular environment.

Open table in a new tab To explore the relationship between protein folding in PYP and signaling state formation during the photocycle, we have studied the kinetics of protein folding in PYP. Recently, we demonstrated that refolding of PYP from the fully denatured state containing acis chromophore involves the pB photocycle intermediate as an on-pathway folding intermediate (19Lee B.-C. Pandit A. Croonquist P.A. Hoff W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9062-9067Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the folding pathway in PYP can be studied both by conventional stopped-flow techniques and by photoexcitation. Here we extend this novel approach for studying protein folding to the transitions between native PYP and its acid-denatured state pBtrans (also called pBdark) in rapid mixing pH jump experiments. PYP was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (9Xie A. Hoff W.D. Kroon A.R. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14671-14678Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PYP was used at a concentration of 8 μmfor absorbance measurements and 2 μm for fluorescence spectroscopy. Steady state equilibrium measurements of the PYP absorbance spectrum at different pH values and temperatures were performed using a Cary 300 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) equipped with a Cary 1 × 1 Peltier element. The kinetics of the last photocycle step were recorded at 446 and 340 nm at different pH values (in the same buffer as the stopped-flow experiments; see below) after 20 s illumination with broadband blue actinic light using the Cary 300 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) or a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Intrinsic aromatic and chromophore fluorescence from PYP was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrometer both in steady state experiments at pH 2.0 and in kinetic experiments on the photocycle at pH 3.9. Fluorescence excitation was at 280 nm for intrinsic aromatic fluorescence, 350 nm for chromophore fluorescence from the acid-denatured state, and 440 nm for chromophore fluorescence from the pGtrans state. The fluorescence emission spectrum of the pB photocycle intermediate at pH 3.9 was reconstructed from each kinetic trace at different wavelengths by fitting the data as a monoexponential decay, and extrapolation tot = 0, i.e. immediately after the actinic illumination. Stopped-flow absorbance spectroscopy for pH jump experiments on PYP unfolding and refolding was performed using an SX-18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics) with a volumetric ratio of 1:1. For unfolding transitions to low pH, yielding pBtrans, PYP in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.3) and 50 mm KCl was mixed rapidly with a buffer solution of 50 mm citrate, 50 mm KCl, and different concentrations of HCl or KOH. For refolding transitions, PYP was first denatured at pH 2.4 or 2.0 in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 25 mm citrate, and 10 or 20 mm HCl, and subsequently refolded by rapid mixing with solutions containing different concentrations of KOH, to yield final pH values from pH 3.2 to 7.6. To investigate the effect of the pCA isomerization state on the refolding process, acid-denatured PYP at pH 2.0 in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 25 mmcitrate, and 20 mm HCl was exposed to UV-A light from a Cuda I-150 light source for 4 min to photoisomerize the pCA fromtrans to cis, yielding pBcis. This PYP solution was mixed with solutions containing different concentrations of KOH. Stopped-flow absorbance traces at 445 and 340 nm were recorded at least four times, averaged, and analyzed using the SX-18MV software. The refolding jump experiments from pBcisto a final pH value of 7.6 were also performed at different temperatures to allow the thermodynamic analysis of this folding transition. The equilibrium absorbance data on the acid denaturation of PYP were described as a two-state transition using Equation 1, where the equilibrium constant KD/Nis defined by 10n(pK − pH); Abs is the observed absorbance at 446 or 340 nm; andan , bn , andau , bu are the parameters for the sloping base lines to describe the pH dependence of native and acid-denatured PYP. pK and n are the pH at the transition midpoint and the number of protons taken up in the unfolding transition, respectively. Abs=[(an+bnpH)+(ad+bdpH)10n(pK−pH)]/(1+10n(pK−pH))Eq. 1 The rate constants for the unfolding and refolding reactions observed by stopped flow absorbance spectroscopy were analyzed as follows. First, the data were fit as a monoexponential process. The resulting rate constants (kobs) in the protein folding reactions are the sum of the protein refolding rate (kf) and unfolding rate (ku) (kobs =ku + kf), with the ratio of kf to ku determined by the equilibrium constant KD/N(KD/N =ku/kf). Combining these two equations, ku and kfcan be obtained from KD/N andkobs. The resulting equations link the equilibrium and kinetic data, providing a quantitative test of the two-state nature of the transition.kf=kobs/(1+KD/N)Eq. 2 ku=KD/Nkobs/(1+KD/N)Eq. 3 The pH dependence of the kinetics of protein unfolding and refolding is caused by the uptake or release of protons upon reaching the transition state. In general, the pH dependence of the refolding kinetics can be described by the following equation, where a change in pH of δpH causes a change in the folding rate δlogkf (22Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar, 23Tan Y.-J. Oliveberg M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol.

Two different phenomenological descriptions of the pH dependence of δlogkf/δpH were used: (i) a linear dependence, in which the ΔQ‡-D does not depend on pH (Equation 5); and (ii) a phenomenological description, in which deviations from linearity are described by an additional quadratic term (Equation 6).logkf=y0+a[pH]Eq. 5 logkf=y0+a[pH]+b[pH]2Eq. 6 The temperature dependence of the rate constants kfor folding and photocycle transitions was described using activation changes in enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity ΔH #, ΔS #, and ΔCp# at an arbitrarily chosen reference temperature of 298 K (Equation 7).lnK#=ΔS298K#/R−ΔH298K#/RT−(ΔCp#/R)/(1−298/T+ln(298/T)),Eq. 7 withK#=kh/kBT T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin, his Plank's constant, and kB is Boltzmann's constant. Equilibrium thermal denaturation curves for pBtrans and pBcis at pH 2.0 were analyzed using Equation 8 as an equilibrium between the native and the unfolded state and two sloping base lines. The temperature dependence for the free energy for unfolding ΔGu(T) was described as Equation 9, where Tm is the temperature at the transition midpoint.Abs=[(an+bnT)+(ad+bdT)eΔGu(T)/RT]/(1+eΔGu(T)/RT)Eq. 8 ΔGu(T)=ΔH(Tm)(1−T/Tm)−ΔCp[(Tm−T)+Tln(T/Tm))Eq. 9 At low pH the initial pGtrans state of PYP is converted to the blue-shifted, partially unfolded 2B.-C. Lee, P. A. Croonquist, and W. D. Hoff, unpublished results. pBtransstate with an apparent pKa of 2.8 (24Meyer T.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1997; 1322: 151-162Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 C). This acid denaturation process involves the protonation of the pCA chromophore, resulting in the blue-shift of the absorbance spectrum of PYP from 446 to 350 nm. We studied the kinetics of the transitions between pGtrans and pBtrans as determined in pH jump experiments using stopped-flow absorbance spectroscopy. Because of the large difference in absorbance maximum, these transitions can be sensitively monitored at both 350 and 445 nm. At 25 °C the transitions between pGtrans and pBtrans were beyond the time resolution (2 ms) of the rapid mixing device (Fig. 1 A) in the pH range 2.0 to 7.5. By performing the pH jump experiments at 5 °C, the kinetics were slowed down sufficiently to allow the accurate determination of the rate constant for the transitions between pGtrans and pBtrans in a wide pH range (Fig.1 B, filled circles). At all pH values the signals could be described as a monoexponential transition. The logarithm of the refolding rate (kf) and unfolding rate (ku) show a linear pH dependence, with slopes of 0.30 and 0.85, respectively. This indicates that the value of the relevant changes in charge ΔQ‡-D and ΔQ‡-N(see Equation 4) are independent of pH in the range 1.7 to 7.5. The rates of unfolding and refolding were found to be identical at pH 2.8, which is the midpoint transition in equilibrium pH titrations (Fig.1 C). Equilibrium titrations at 5 °C were essentially identical to those performed at 25 °C (25Hoff W.D. Van Stokkum I.H.M. Gural J. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1322: 151-162Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with a pKa of 2.8 and an n value of 1.15 (see Equation 1). Thus, the sum of the slopes of the pH dependence observed for the unfolding and refolding transitions is equal to number of protons taken up during the transition as found in the equilibrium data. The monoexponential behavior and good correspondence between equilibrium and kinetic data (using Equations 2 and 3) indicate that the transition between pGtrans to pBtrans can be described as a two-state process. To directly study the effect of the isomerization state of the pCA chromophore on the kinetics of refolding from the acid-denatured state to the native pGtrans state, pBtrans was illuminated with UV-A light at pH 2.0 to generate pBcis. The formation of pBcis could be monitored by a small but characteristic red-shift in the absorbance spectrum of the acid-denatured state (data not shown), as the absorbance maximum of pBtrans is at 350 nm, and that of pBcis at 355 nm (25Hoff W.D. Van Stokkum I.H.M. Gural J. Hellingwerf K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1322: 151-162Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both species are fully stable at low pH. The formation of pBcis had a strong effect on the protein refolding kinetics; strongly biexponential behavior was observed. The very fast phase of ∼50% could be attributed to refolding from pBtrans. The remaining 50% of the signal displayed dramatically decelerated folding kinetics, caused by refolding from pBcis (Fig. 1 A). Apparently, the UV-A illumination resulted in the formation of a stable mixture of equally populated pBtrans and pBcis states. The pH dependence of the kinetics for refolding from pBcis to pGtrans was determined, revealing that isomerization of pCA to its cis isomer decelerated the kinetics of refolding by 3–5 orders of magnitude (Fig. 1 B, open circles at 25 °C and open squaresat 5 °C). The deceleration of refolding is attributed to the energy barrier caused by the cis to trans isomerization of the pCA that needs to occur for refolding from pBcis. For free pCA the energy barrier for thermal isomerization has been estimated to be 125 kJ/mol (see Ref. 18Craven C.J. Derix N.M. Hendriks J. Boelens R. Hellingwerf K.J. Kaptein R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14392-14399Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This experiment demonstrates how the energy surface for protein refolding can be experimentally modified by the introduction of a specific chemical process into the energy landscape for folding. The pH dependence of the logarithm of refolding rates for pBcis significantly deviates from linear behavior both at 25 and 5 °C (Fig. 1 B). This reveals that, for pBcis, the value of ΔQ‡-D is pH-dependent, in contrast to the situation found for pBtrans. The change in ΔQ‡-D for pBcis refolding as a function of pH was estimated by analysis of the data using a phenomenological quadratic equation (Equation 6). This analysis revealed that the number of protons ΔQ‡-D released by pBcis upon reaching the transition state decreases from ∼1 to ∼0 in the pH range from 3.2 to 7.5. The interpretation of these observations is discussed below. The deceleration of PYP refolding by isomerization of the pCA to thecis conformation is analogous to the effect of isomerization of the imide bond of Pro residues (26Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Because such Pro isomerization events occur with a significant energy barrier (85 kJ/mol), they can be rate-limiting for protein folding, as we found for pCA isomerization during PYP folding. However, the pCA isomerization effect exhibits two attractive features not found for Pro isomerization; (i) the extent of pCA isomerization in unfolded PYP is under direct experimental control (photoisomerization), and (ii) pCA isomerization is a central part of the functional cycle of PYP. We directly tested the relationship between the protein refolding reaction from pBcis to pGtrans, as observed by stopped-flow absorbance spectroscopy, and the pB to pGtrans photocycle transition, as observed after photoexcitation of PYP. To this end, the kinetics of the last PYP photocycle transition were measured by time-resolved absorbance spectroscopy as a function of pH. These measurements showed that the photocycle kinetics are exactly mimicked by those found for the protein refolding process at all pH values in the range 3.2–7.5 (Fig.1 B, closed diamonds at 25 °C andclosed triangles at 5 °C). This observation indicates a high level of structural similarity between the equilibrium denatured state pBcis and the kinetic photocycle intermediate pB. To further test the identity of the pBcis to pGtrans protein refolding process and the pB to pGtrans photocycle transition, the temperature dependence values of the kinetics of both transitions were compared. The temperature dependence of the kinetics observed in rapid mixing experiments was found to be essentially identical to that reported previously (15Van Brederode M.E. Hoff W.D. Van Stokkum I.H.M. Groot M.L. Hellingwerf K.J. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 365-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) for the pB to pGtrans photocycle transition (Fig. 2). Both reveal a strongly curved temperature dependence that can be accurately described (Equation 7) by the occurrence of an activation change in heat capacity (TableII). These results demonstrate that the pB to pGtrans photocycle transition is a protein refolding process from an acid-denatured state to the native state.Table IIActivation thermodynamic parameters of the folding transition from pBcis to pGtrans and the photocycle last step from pB to pGtrans at 298 K, pH 7.6ΔS #ΔH #ΔCp#J/mol · KkJ/molkJ/mol · KpBcis ↔ pG−18713.5−2.49pB ↔ pG2-aValues taken from Ref. 15.−1969.2−2.732-a Values taken from Ref. 15Van Brederode M.E.

Open table in a new tab The strong deceleration of the folding kinetics by the cischromophore described above has an important biological consequence. The pB state is considered to be the signal generating intermediate in the PYP photocycle. Only the pB state containing a cischromophore has a physiologically relevant lifetime of hundreds of milliseconds. The lifetime observed for pB containing atrans chromophore is less than 1 ms under physiological conditions, which would be very inefficient for photochemical signal transduction. To further investigate the structure of pBtrans, pBcis, pB, and pGtrans, we studied and compared the aromatic fluorescence signals from these four species. Excitation of pGtrans at 280 nm (pH 7.0) elicits a fluorescence emission peak at 330 nm (Fig.3 A, spectrum 1), consistent with the 5 Tyr residues and single Trp side chain in PYP. In the pBtrans state at pH 2.0, the amplitude of this peak is reduced by ∼39% and the emission maximum is shifted from 330 to 350 nm (Fig. 3 A, spectrum 2). In addition to this aromatic fluorescence band, the spectra of pGtrans and pBtrans both display a second emission band of lower intensity, at 495 and 435 nm, respectively. These bands are caused by fluorescence emission from the pCA chromophore. The pCA in the pGtrans state is known to have an emission maximum at 495 nm (27Meyer T.E. Tollin G. Causgrove T.P. Cheng P. Blankenship R.E. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 988-991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 C,spectrum 13). To confirm that the emission band at 435 nm is caused by pCA, the emission spectrum of this species was measured upon excitation of the chromophore at 350 nm, and was indeed found to be at 435 nm (Fig. 3 C, spectrum 9). This reveals fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the aromatic amino acids to the pCA chromophore. The FRET pCA emission band in pBtrans is a factor of 7.5 stronger that that in pGtrans, presumably because of the increased spectral overlap between the emission from the aromatic amino acids and the absorbance of the pCA chromophore in pBtrans. The fluorescence emission spectra of pBcis were obtained by performing fluorescence spectroscopy on a mixture containing 50% pBtrans and 50% pBcis, obtained as described above (Fig. 3, A (spectrum 3) and C (spectrum 10)). The data were then corrected for the contribution of the 50% pBtrans to yield the pure spectrum of pBcis at pH 2.0 (Fig. 3, A (spectrum 4) for aromatic fluorescence and C (spectrum 11) for chromophore fluorescence). The intensity of fluorescence emission from the aromatic amino acids is increased a factor of 2.0 by thetrans to cis isomerization of the pCA in the acid-denatured state of PYP, whereas the FRET emission band at 435 nm is completely lost in pBcis. The chromophore fluorescence from the pCA in pBcis is strongly quenched: fluorescence excitation at 350 nm does not yield an emission band at 435 nm, in contrast with pBtrans (Fig. 3 C,spectrum 11). In summary, the pBcisstate exhibits fluorescence properties quite different from pBtrans: (i) increased fluorescence of aromatic residues, (ii) strong quenching of pCA fluorescence, and, possibly because of this, (iii) no emission band by FRET from aromatic side chains to the pCA chromophore. This indicates that pCA trans tocis photoisomerization results in structural changes in the acid-denatured state of PYP. The three fluorescence characteristics that clearly distinguish pBtrans from pBcis were used to compare the structure of the kinetic pB photocycle intermediate with that of the equilibrium species pBcis. The fluorescence emission properties of the pB photocycle intermediate were reconstructed from kinetic measurements at pH 3.9 during the pB to pGtransphotocycle transition, observed after switching off actinic illumination. Under the conditions used, essentially all PYP was converted to pB, and changes in fluorescence emission during relaxation to pG were determined. Both the aromatic (Fig. 3 B,closed circles) and chromophore (Fig.3 C, closed circles,spectrum 12) fluorescence properties of the kinetic photocycle species pB are highly similar to those of the equilibrium acid-denatured species pBcis, indicating that these two states of PYP have a very similar structure. To further investigate the effect of pCA isomerization on the acid-denatured state of PYP, the thermal stability of pBtrans and pBcis were determined. Thermal denaturation of pBtrans to the fully unfolded state resulted in a shift in absorbance maximum from 350 to 338 nm, and an increase in extinction coefficient at the absorbance maximum by 23% (Fig. 4). This shift occurred in a single, cooperative unfolding transition with a midpoint temperature of 42 °C. Conversion of 50% of the pBtrans population to pBcis by UV-A illumination of the sample had a marked effect on the thermal denaturation curve. In this case, two thermal transitions were observed: one at 42 °C, corresponding to pBtrans, and a second at 72 °C, corresponding to the thermal denaturation of pBcis (Fig. 4, closed squares). These data show that the trans tocis isomerization of the pCA chromophore significantly increases the thermal stability of the acid-denatured state (TableIII). Quantitative analysis (using Equations 8 and 9) of the denaturation curve of pBcis was complicated by the fact that, even at 100 °C, the thermal denaturation of this state was not complete, but indicates that pCA isomerization stabilizes the acid-denatured state of PYP by ∼16 kJ/mol.Table IIIThermal stability of pBtrans and pBcis at pH 2.0, 298 KΔGuTmkJ/molpBtrans6.9315pBcis a16.5345 b29.4353 Average23.0349The data for pBcis thermal denaturation (see Fig.4 A) did not show a plateau, complicating their analysis. The data were analyzed using two sloping baselines for the native and denatured state (a), and with one sloping baseline for the native state and a fixed value for the thermally denatured state at 95 °C (b). Open table in a new tab The data for pBcis thermal denaturation (see Fig.4 A) did not show a plateau, complicating their analysis. The data were analyzed using two sloping baselines for the native and denatured state (a), and with one sloping baseline for the native state and a fixed value for the thermally denatured state at 95 °C (b). The native conformation of PYP has a strong energetic preference for the trans chromophore. Our results show that for the acid-denatured state the opposite is true: the cisconformation is energetically favored. However, when the pG state is acidified, it is partially unfolded to pBtrans, not pBcis. This demonstrates that acid denaturation of PYP is under kinetic control (Fig. 4 B); because of the higher activation barrier for the formation of pBcis, the acid-denatured state containing trans pCA is accumulated at low pH. Kinetic control was previously proposed by the Agard group (28Baker D. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar,29Baker D. Agard D.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7505-7509Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) for protein refolding. Here, we report that, upon acidification, native PYP is converted to the local free energy minimum of the pBtrans state, even though the pBcis state has a significantly lower free energy. The results on the pH dependence of the kinetics for the formation of pGtrans from the three blue-shifted states studied here result in the following challenge: which model can describe (i) the pH-independent non-integer slopes in the presence oftrans-pCA and (ii) the transition from linear to nonlinear pH dependence upon chromophore isomerization? This question is corroborated by a re-analysis that we performed of the published pH dependence of the pB to pG photocycle transition of a set of seven PYP mutants (30Genick U.K. Devanathan S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13478-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) on a log-log scale, as we did for wild-type PYP (Fig. 5). Two groups of mutant PYPs could be classified according to the pH-dependent profile of refolding kinetics. The E46Q, M100A, R52A and T50V mutants show a nonlinear pH dependence, as does the wild type (Fig. 5 A). The E46D, E46A, and Y42F mutants exhibit a linear pH dependence in the pH ranges studied (Fig.5 B). Apparently, not only chromophore photoisomerization, but also these side-directed mutations shift the pH dependence of the barrier for the pB to pG transition from nonlinear to linear. In addition, the pH dependence of the pB to pG transition in the E46D, E46A, and Y42F mutants is characterized by fractional ΔQ ‡ values (see Fig. 5 B). We examined if the position of Tyr42, Glu46, Thr50, Arg52, and Met100 in the x-ray structure of PYP (35Borgstahl G.E.O. Williams D.R. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6278-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) provides further insights into the pH dependence of the photocycle kinetics. All of these residues contribute to the first shell of atoms surrounding the pCA chromophore (see Fig. 2 of Ref. 12Xie A. Kelemen L. Hendriks J. White B.J. Hellingwerf K.J. Hoff W.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1510-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The phenolic group of Tyr42 and the acidic side chain of Glu46 are directly hydrogen-bonded to the phenolate oxygen of the pCA chromophore, whereas the side chain of Thr50 is hydrogen-bonded to that of Tyr42. The guanidino group of Arg52 and the sulfur atom of Met100 are placed immediately adjacent to the pCA. Interestingly, only mutants that disrupt the active site hydrogen bonds between the chromophore and Glu46 and Tyr42result in a linear pH dependence. Previously, the pH dependence of the kinetics of the pB to pGtrans photocycle transition was described using equations developed for the pH dependence of enzyme catalysis, in which the pH dependence of the reaction is caused by equilibrium changes in the protonation state of groups with specific pKa values (30Genick U.K. Devanathan S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13478-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this description a log-linear pH dependence of the kinetics is interpreted as the titration of a functionally important group with a pKa outside the studied pH range. This results in a slope of 1 for low pH values and −1 for high pH values. Fractional values for the slope are difficult to understand based on such a model. Thus, the fractional values of ΔQ ‡, observed both for the folding kinetics of pBtrans of native PYP and for the photocycle kinetics of the E46D, E46A, and Y42F mutants, provide an important clue to the origin of the pH dependence of the kinetics. Because we found that the pBcis to pGtrans transition is a protein refolding event, we investigated an alternative interpretation, based on the analysis developed to describe the dependence of the kinetics of protein folding on denaturant concentration (chevron analysis). We propose that the fractional ΔQ ‡ values for the transitions between pGtrans and pBtranscan be described in analogy with the analysis of a denaturant chevron plot for a two-state transition, with m ‡values for unfolding and refolding that are independent of denaturant concentration. The effect of denaturant concentration on the kinetic of folding provides information on solvent-exposed surface area upon transition state formation. Analogously, the effect of pH reveals changes in charge ΔQ ‡ that are required to reach the folding transition state and provides a measure of the electrostatic interactions in the transition state (22Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar, 23Tan Y.-J. Oliveberg M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 36Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1970; 24: 1-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 37Oliveberg M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2726-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this proposal the transfer of protons between the solvent and the protein occurs only partially during the formation of the transition state for pBtrans refolding. The pH independence of the ΔQ ‡ values for pBtrans then indicates that the position of the transition state does not depend on pH, with ∼25% (0.30/(0.30 + 0.85)) of the native electrostatic interactions formed in the transition state for refolding. The most straight forward candidate of the major contribution to the observed ΔQ ‡ values is the pCA chromophore, because the deprotonation of this buried group is an essential step in the formation of the native state. The curved pH dependence for the kinetics of the pB to pGtrans transition correspond to a curved chevron plot, which has been found for a range of proteins. Such curved denaturant chevron plots can be caused by two different phenomena: (i) the involvement of a folding intermediate (38Parker M.J. Marqusee S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 1195-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 39Parker M.J. Spencer J. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or (ii) movement of the transition state in a two-state transition (40Otzen D.E. Kristensen O. Proctor M. Oliveberg M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6499-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We propose a transition state movement to explain the nonlinear pH chevron plot of pBcis. First, this proposal is in line with the absence of indications for intermediates in the pB to pG photocycle transition or pH jump experiments. Second, this model can describe the observed curved pH dependence of the kinetics: a pH-induced transition state movement involves a change in the apparent ΔQ‡-D. This change in ΔQ‡-D for refolding from pBcismay reflect the titration behavior of a specific group or may be caused by the pH-induced shift from one barrier to a second barrier. We prefer the latter interpretation, based on the following reasoning. For refolding from pBtrans, the chromophore deprotonation event is likely to result in the linear pH dependence of refolding. The refolding process from pBcis involves an additional process: thermal pCA re-isomerization. This is expected to give rise to an additional energy barrier on the folding landscape of pBcis. In this proposal, a transition state movement occurs from a pH-dependent pCA deprotonation barrier to a pH-independent pCA isomerization barrier (Fig.6 B). The pCA deprotonation then results in a log-linear pH dependence, as observed for pBtrans, whereas the kinetics of pCA isomerization do not depend on pH. A shift between these two barriers results in the observed curved pH dependence. In the case of the mutants with a perturbed hydrogen bond network around the pCA chromophore, the pCA deprotonation process may well be strongly decelerated. This would prevent the isomerization step from becoming the dominant barrier in the studied pH range, resulting in the observed pH-independent slope. An attractive aspect of this analysis of the pH dependence of the PYP photocycle kinetics, is that it offers a tool to disentangle the multiple molecular events that occur during the pB to pG photocycle transition. A striking feature of the results reported here is that the kinetics of protein refolding for the acid-denatured state of PYP containing cis pCA is exactly same as that of the photocycle step from pB to pGtrans over a wide pH (Fig.1 B) and temperature (Fig. 2) range. Therefore, the final step in the PYP photocycle corresponds to a protein refolding reaction, implying a direct link between transient protein unfolding and photosensory signal transduction (Fig. 6 A)."
