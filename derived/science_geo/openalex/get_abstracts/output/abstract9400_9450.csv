https://openalex.org/W1548712478,"The binding of rat liver glucocorticoid.receptor complexes to DNA-cellulose and nuclei has been studied after activation of the complexes by heating. Subsequent exposure to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate or pyridoxal markedly inhibited this binding. In one system 0.75 mM pyridoxal 5'-phosphate or 6.5 mM pyridoxal gave 50% inhibition. Pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine did not inhibit significantly. The inhibition by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is competitive with respect to DNA suggesting that its effect is directly on the DNA binding site of the activated receptor. The inhibition of DNA-cellulose binding by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate can be reversed by treatment with dithiothreitol or by gel filtration, but not if the modified receptor is first reduced using sodium borohydride. These results suggest that pyridoxal 5'-phosphate acts by forming a Schiff base of an epsilon-NH2 of a lysine which may be 1 residue appearing on the surface of the steroid.receptor complex upon activation. However, since pretreatment of the DNA-cellulose with the intercalating drug ethidium bormide also inhibits activated receptor binding, we conclude that the binding of the receptor involves more than electrostatic interactions between receptor positive charges and DNA phosphate groups."
https://openalex.org/W1598021011,"Abstract 31P NMR studies with Cd(II) and Zn(II) chelates of adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATPgammaS) and the Cd(II) chelate of adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) (ATPbetaS) indicate that these metal ions chelate to the sulfur atom of the thiophosphate group. Since Mg(II) chelates to oxygen of the thiophosphate group of diastereoisomer is equivalent to the configuration of the Cd(II) chelate of the opposite diastereoisomer. As a consequence, an inversion of the stereospecificity is observed when Cd(II) is substituted for Mg(II) in the phosphoryl transfer reactions catalyzed by yeast hexokinase and rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase. When Co(II) is the activating ion for yeast hexokinase with ATPbetaS as substrate, no stereospecificity is observed. Since the absolute configuration for the diastereoisomer of Co(III)(NH3)4ATP which is the active substrate for yeast hexokinase has been established by Cornelius and Cleland (Cornelius, R. D., and Cleland, W. W. (1978) Biochemistry, in press), the absolute stereochemistry of the Mg(II) complex of the B isomer of ATPbetaS is now established by its stereospecificity in the hexokinase reaction."

https://openalex.org/W181242228,"Homogeneous preparations of the glutathione transferases from rat liver have been tested for their ability to catalyze a number of diverse nucleophilic reactions of GSH. Although disulfide interchange with GSSG or L-cystine, and cis-trans isomerization of maleic acid, are clearly promoted by thiols in solution, the reactions were not catalyzed by the glutathione transferases. In contrast, certain more hydrophobic analogs of these compounds were found to serve as substrates. The transferases also catalyze the glutathione-dependent release of p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl trimethylacetate. These observations are consistent with the formulation that catalysis may result from close juxtaposition of sufficiently electrophilic, nonpolar compounds with GSH on the enzyme surface."
https://openalex.org/W1521587124,"The uphill transport of D-glucose in renal brush border membrane vesicles was correlated with the Na+ electrochemical gradient. Each component of the electrochemical potential, the membrane potential (outside positive) or the Na+ chemical gradient, when assayed independently, supported the concentrative uptake of the sugar. When the two components were combined, the rates of D-glucose uptake were additive. Accumulation of D-glucose as a function of various Na+ gradients, in the absence of a membrane potential, suggests a 1:1 stoichiometry between sugar and Na+ uptake. These findings are consistent with the role of ionic gradients in energizing uphill solute transport."

https://openalex.org/W1671715243,"Recently, using molecular hybridization techniques with albumin [3H]cDNA, we have determined that in normally fed rats 98% of total liver polyribosomal albumin mRNA sequences are found in membrane-bound polyribosomes (Yap, S. H., Strair, R. K., and Shafritz, D. A. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 74, 5397-5401). We now observe that a 24- to 30-h withdrawal of food leads to major changes in the amount and subcellular distribution of albumin mRNA molecules. The total amount of cytoplasmic albumin mRNA per liver and concentration of albumin mRNA per unit of membrane-bound polyribosomal RNA are decreased. However, the proportion of albumin mRNA present in the postribosomal supernatant fraction increases dramatically in a short term fast, so that it now represent 60% of total cytoplasmic albumin mRNA sequences. Most of the albumin mRNA sequences in the postribosomal supernatant fraction sediment between 30 S and 50 S. These findings suggest that albumin mRNA is probably stored in the messenger ribonucleoprotein fraction during the fasting state."
https://openalex.org/W1480387979,"25-Hydroxycholesterol treatment of the aortic smooth muscle cell inhibited the incorporation of acetate but not mevalonate into dolichol and cholesterol by 91 and 82%, respectively, and diminished the synthesis from glucose of cholesterol, dolichylpyrophosphoryl oligosaccharide, and dolichol-dependent glycoproteins. The dolichol-bound oligosaccharide unit contained approximately 10 Man/2 Glc/2 GlcNAc residues and appeared to be a precursor to protein-bound saccharide units which contained on the average 8 Man/1 Glc/2 GlcNAc residues. Mevalonate was found to protect the cells against the effect 25-hydroxycholesterol and to restore normal cellular synthesis of dolichyl saccharides and glycoproteins. It is suggested that hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase may function as a rate-controlling enzyme in the biosynthesis of not only sterols but also dolichols, and may as a result regulate the assembly of certain cellular glycoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W1541566020,"A novel enzyme involved in the post-transcriptional modification of the 5'-end of mRNA has been partially purified from HeLa cells. Termed an S-adenosyl-L-methionine:RNA(2'-O-methyladenosine-N4)-methyltransferase, the enzyme specifically catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the N6 position of a 2'-O-methyladenosine residue located within the 5'-end of mRNA. The dimethylated nucleoside, N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine, is formed as indicated by the following reaction in which m7G(5')pppAm- represents the capped and methylated 5'-end of mRNA: AdoMet + m7G(5')pppAm- leads to AdoHcy + m7G(5')pppm6A7- Greatest activity is obtained with RNA acceptors ending in m7G(5')pppAm-; less activity is found with RNA ending in m7G(5')pppA-; and barely detectable and no activity is found with RNA ending in G(5')pppA- and ppA-, respectively. Furthermore, no activity is found with oligonucleotides such as m7G(5')pppA, m7G(5')pppAm, and m7G(5')pppAmpN indicating that a longer polymer is required. It can be concluded from the substrate specificity of the enzyme that the formation of N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine follows the biosynthesis of molecules containing m7G(5')pppAm-N-. The molecular weight of the methyltransferase, as determined by sedimentation in sucrose gradients, is approximately 65,000."

https://openalex.org/W1583545851,"Mouse L cell interferon induced by Newcastle disease virus was purified by a combination of salt precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and affinity chromatography using anti-interferon anti-body. The preparation was labeled with 125I at a later step of purification, which served as an index of protein concentration. Two main species of interferon molecules differing in molecular weight were separated from each other, and the final preparations obtained were shown to be essentially pure by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence as well as in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The highest specific activities obtained were 2.6 X 10(9) and 7.3 X 10(8) international units/mg of protein (determined by 125I radioactivity) for the 40,000- and 24,000-dalton species, respectively. The preparations at different steps of purification, including those of the highest purity, were tested for the anti-cell growth activity. Their activities were found to be indistinguishable from each other when compared at the same antiviral doses, indicating that the anti-cell growth activity is carried by the interferon molecules themselves."
https://openalex.org/W1585300938,The primary structure of the membrane bound segment of amphipathic bovine liver microsomal cytochrome b5 has been determined. This 43 residue nonpolar polypeptide is present at the COOH terminus of cytochrome b5. The sequence was obtained by automated sequence analysis and carboxypeptidase digestions. The sequence obtained is: Ile-Thr-Lys-Pro-Ser-Glu-Ser-Ile-Ile-Thr-Ile-Asp-Ser-Asn-Pro-Ser-Trp-Trp-Thr-Asn-Trp-Leu-Ile-Pro-Ala-Ile-Ser-Ala-Leu-Phe-Val-Ala-Leu-Ile-Tyr-His-Leu-Tyr-Thr-Ser-Glu-Asn. Conformational analysis using predictive algorithms is presented along with circular dichroism data on the peptide bound to phospholipid vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W1576246070,"Actomyosin was purified from human blood platelets and used to form threads via extrusion. A sensitive tensiometer was employed to measure isometric tension and velocity of isotonic shortening of the threads in the presence of MgATP. Using fully phosphorylated myosin, we obtained values for maximum isometric tension (Po) and maximum velocity of contraction (V max) that were similar to those reported for threads composed of skeletal muscle actomyosin. Po was found to be directly proportional to the level of phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton myosin light chain. We also studied the effect of phosphorylation on superprecipitation of platelet actomyosin. Fully phosphorylated myosin produced rapid clearing and superprecipitation, while myosin with a low level of bound phosphate underwent rapid clearing but did not superprecipitate. We have concluded from these results that: 1) the interaction between platelet actin and myosin produces tension and motion that is similar to that produced by skeletal muscle actin and myosin and 2) phosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton myosin light chain in important in controlling the production of force by platelet actin and myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1583070874,"Interferon was produced from a clonal human fibroblastoid line. This cell line was derived from an established fibroblastoid culture treated with ethylmethane sulfonate and is capable of producing higher amounts human interferon than primary human fibroblast cultures. The interferon produced from this cell line was purified by concanavalin A and phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography followed by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified interferon was then labeled with [125I]-iodine, with [3H]5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-chloride and with sodium [3H]borohydride after periodate oxidation. An appreciable amount of biological activity was retained after both tritium labelings but not after iodination. When subjected to electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate all three radioactive interferon preparations comigrated with the purified interferon preparation as a single protein component with a molecular weight of 19,000. Both purified and radioactive preparations were also shown to migrate with the antiviral activity in polyacrylamide gels in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The specific activity of purified interferon preparations ranged from 2 X 10(8) to 10 X 10(8) units/mg of protein."

https://openalex.org/W1600935985,"The physiological roles of the transsulfuration and direct sulfhydration pathways in Chlorella sorokiniana growing under steady state photoautotrophic conditions with limiting sulfate were studied by following the patterns of assimilation of 35SO4(2-) into sulfur amino acids. The labeling patterns expected of each pathway were defined by means of models based on the rates of net synthesis of the terminal pools of GSH, protein cysteine, and protein methionine. The labeling patterns observed are entirely consistent with the transsulfuration pathway and inconsistent with the direct sulfhydration pathway. By analysis of the amounts of radioactivity present in key intermediates at labeling times as short as 1 s, it was demonstrated that direct sulfhydration makes no detectable contribution to homocysteine biosynthesis, and if operative contributes no more than approximately 3% of the total homocysteine biosynthesized. From the combined determinations of the initial rates of labeling and net rates of synthesis of the various sulfur amino acids, a tentative working model is presented that summarizes our best current estimates of the major fluxes of sulfur in the experimental system. The labeling data further showed that soluble cysteine consists of at least two pools. One pool, termed rapidly turning over cysteine comprises less than 1% of the total soluble cysteine, and is the precursor of GSH, protein cysteine, and, almost certainly, cystathionine. The other pool, slowly turning over cysteine, appears to be in equilibrium with rapidly turning over cysteine, but not to be further metabolized."
https://openalex.org/W1496556313,"The change in the distribution of the phosphate species containing 0 to 4 18O oxygens per Pi was investigated during medium Pi equilibrium HOH exchange catalyzed by myosin subfragment 1. At 25 degrees C, a Pi molecule once bound loses an average of 3.9 of its original 4 oxygens prior to release which means that at least 100 reversals of the exchange reaction must have occurred. At 0 degrees C, only 3.4 of the 4 oxygens are lost prior to release indicating an average of 17 reversals. Distribution patterns are consistent with equivalent participation in the exchange reactions of all 4 oxygens of bound Pi. The intermediate exchange of Pi oxygens during hydrolysis of 18O-labeled ATP by myosin has also been investigated. The distribution of the product Pi species shows that there is an ATPase component in myosin preparations which hydrolyzes ATP without intermediate exchange. Presence of this component, which is likely a contaminating ATPase, provides a simple explanation of the apparent nonequivalence of phosphate oxygens which has been observed. When correction is made for this contaminant, characteristics of the myosin intermediate Pi equilibrium HOH exchange are similar to those of myosin subfragment 1 medium exchange, and intermediate exchange data are in much closer agreement with other kinetic measurements."
https://openalex.org/W1645527871,"In porcine pancreatic secretion procarboxypeptidase A exists in two states: as a monomer and as a binary complex of a type hitherto not observed in the pancreatic secretions of other species. This complex is shown to contain 1 molecule of procarboxypeptidase A and 1 molecule of a proteolytic zymogen we have designated as zymogen E. The two subunits of the complex have been separated by gel filtration in a denaturing solvent and the products used for compositional and NH2-terminal sequence analysis. We also fractionated the mixture obtained on activation of the binary complex and isolated homogenous preparations of porcine carboxypeptidase A and the diisopropylphosphoryl derivative of the enzyme formed from zymogen E. Zymogen E has an Mr of about 26,000 and on activation produces an enzyme of essentially the same Mr with properties very similar to those of human pancreatic protease E. It catalyzes the esterolysis of acetyl-L-alanyl-L-analyl-L-alanine methyl ester, but is inert towards acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester and is readily inactivated by diisopropylophosphorofluoridate. Zymogen E has an amino acid composition different from those of porcine chymotrypsinogen A, B, or C. Its NH2-terminal sequence shows homology with the NH2-terminal sequence of lungfish proelastase A; yet, like human protease E, porcine protease E has relatively very low activity on intact elastin."

https://openalex.org/W1498716787,"We have previously described three different cytochalasin B binding sites in human erythrocyte membranes, a D-glucose-sensitive site (Site I), a cytochalasin E-sensitive site (Site II), and a site (Site III) insensitive to both D-glucose and cytochalasin E. Ligand bindings to each of these sites were considered to be independent (Jung, C., and Rampal, A. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 5456-5463). However, we have obtained subsequently the following evidence which indicated that an interaction occurs between Sites II and III, and this modulates sensitivity of Site III to the sugar. The displacement of cytochalasin E greatly exceeds the sum of their independent displacements. This ghosts extracted with EDTA or 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride at low ionic strength lack Site II activity but retain Site I and III activities, and both of these activities are displaceable by D-glucose alone. This indicated that the removal of Site II from the membrane confers glucose sensitivity to Site III. These observations are consistent with a model that Sites II and III in the membrane exist in a close association through which unliganded Site II maintains the glucose insensitivity of Site III, and once site II is liganded or removed by extraction this association is disrupted and Site III becomes glucose-sensitive. The ghosts extracted with Triton X-100 retain a cytochalasin B binding activity similar to that of site II (Kd = 1.8 X 10(-7) M, cytochalasin E-sensitive, glucose-insensitive), whereas a binding activity similar to that of Site I (Kd = 4 X 10(-7) M, cytochalasin E-insensitive, glucose-sensitive) is recovered in the Triton extract. A cytochalasin B binding activity similar to that of Site II is solubilized by EDTA at low ionic strength."
https://openalex.org/W1849076927,"The level of cross-linking between the polypeptide chains of the collagen molecules in bovine tendons of different ages has been assessed by measuring quantitatively through densitometry the changes in the ratios of individual cyanogen bromide peptides separated on polyacrylamide gels. An increase in the number of cross-links in mature, as compared to young, tendons correlates with a depletion in the proportion of the free, COOH-terminal peptides alpha1-CB6 and alpha2-CB3,5 and with an increase in a broad distribution of peptides moving slowly in the gels: these peptides are not seen in digests of acid-soluble collagen. Some of these peptides which are presumably cross-linked migrate more slowly than beta components and collagen alpha chains and are apparently of a higher molecular weight. No increase in cross-linked peptides is detectable beyond the age of maturation; this analysis refutes, at least in this tissue, the common presumption that progressive cross-linking occurs in collagen through an animal's lifetime."
https://openalex.org/W150624595,"Crystalline complexes of cytoplasmic aspartate aminotransferase of pig heart with the substrates L-glutamate and L-aspartate, and with other amino acids, have been prepared and polarized light absorption spectra have been measured. Striking differences in the directions of polarization of the absorption bands are seen. A complete half-transamination of pyridoxal phosphate to pyridoxamine phosphate by aspartate or by cysteine sulfinate can be demonstrated in the crystal as can the accumulation of a quinonoid intermediate with erythro-beta-hydroxyaspartate. X-ray diffraction studies show that the crystals with erythro-beta-hydroxyaspartate and alpha-methylaspartate are isomorphous with those of both alpha and beta subforms of the native enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1601740504,"The nucleotide sequence of ribosomal 5 S RNA from a halophilic bacterium, Halobacterium cutirubrum, grown in 4 M sodium chloride is U-U-A-A-G-G-C-G-G-C-C-A-U-A-G-C-G-G-U-G-G-G-G-U-U-A-C-U-C-C-C-G-U-A-C-C-C-A-U-C-C-C-G-A-A-C-A-C-G-G-A-A-G-A-U-A-A-G-C-C-C-G-C-C-U-G-C-G-U-U-C-C-G-G-U-C-A-G-U-A-C-U-G-G-A-G-U-G-C-G-A-G-C-C-U-C-U-G-G-G-A-A-A-U-C-C-G-G-U-U-C-G-C-C-G-C-C-U-A-C-U. This nucleotide sequence is the longest prokaryotic 5 S rRNA to be reported and unlike other 5 S species does not contain a terminal mononucleoside diphosphate residue at its 5'-end. When compared to other 5 S rRNA's, the sequence homology is greatest (about 68%) with Bacillus subtilis; there is a lower but similar degree of homology (about 58%) with either Escherichia coli or human 5 S RNA. The comparisons further indicate that among 5 S RNA's, eleven of the nucleotide residues are unique to H. cutirubrum. Estimates of the secondary structure of the H. cutirubrum 5 S RNA molecule contain one additional stable hairpin loop which is not found in other 5 S rRNA species; this unusual structure is probably an adaptation to the high salt environment within H. cutirubrum cells."
https://openalex.org/W1598127149,"The turnover properties of murine beta-glucuronidase in several tissues and at two subcellular sites have been determined by monitoring the radioactivity present in immunoprecipitated enzyme at a number of time points following the in vivo administration of a single radiolabeled protein precursor (either L-[3,4(-3H)]leucine or or NaH14CO3). In all experiments a considerable period of time was required for the attainment of maximum specific radioactivity in glucuronidase. Similar labeling kinetics was found when [3H]leucine incorporation was monitored in immunoprecipitated murine liver delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase. Half-life estimates of 2 to 3 days were obtained for glucuronidases of liver, kidney, and spleen. In most strains of inbred mice, it is known that approximately 60% of total liver glucuronidase activity resides in lysosomes, while 40% is within the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (Ganschow, R. E. and Paigen, K. (1968) Genetics 59, 335-349). These two subcellular forms of glucuronidase turn over at similar rates. Furthermore, the bulk of glucuronidase in the endoplasmic reticulum does not serve as precursor to lysosomal glucuronidase."
https://openalex.org/W1535369123,"We have investigated the action and substrate specificity of phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) purified from cobra venom (Naja naja naja) toward intact and Triton-solubilized human erythrocytes, toward ghost membranes, and toward extracted ghost lipids in mixed micelles with Triton X-100. We have found that: (i) phospholipids in the outer surface of intact erythrocytes are extremely poor substrates for the phospholipase, (ii) phospholipids in ghost erythrocyte membranes and in Triton-solubilized erythrocytes are suitable substrates for the enzyme, (iii) in these latter systems which contain a mixture of lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine is preferentially hydrolyzed, whereas in model studies on individual phospholipid species in mixed micelles with Triton, phosphatidylcholine is the preferred substrate of the enzyme, and (iv) the preferential hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamine is also observed for extracted ghost lipid mixtures in mixed micelles. These results demonstrate a dependence of phospholipase A2 activity on the ghosting procedure and a dependence of substrate specificity on the presence of other lipids. The relevance of these findings to the interpretation of membrane lipid asymmetry studies utilizing phospholipases is considered in detail."
https://openalex.org/W2041384300,"A tentative amino acid sequence of the beta-subunit of equine follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was derived from the sequences of tryptic, thermolytic as well as peptic, subtilisin, and chymotryptic peptides. Equine FSH-beta is analogous to human FSH-beta except six amino acid substitutions at positions 12, 16, 21, 62, 108, and 114. The amino acid sequence suggests that the hormone-specific beta-subunits of FSH are similar at the interspecies level, whereas the amino acid sequences of the hormone nonspecific alpha-subunits show variations."

These compounds each comprise about 0.03% of the dry weight of the encysted embryos and are related chemically to guanosine 5'-triphospho-5'-guanosine and guanosine 5'-tetraphospho-5'-guanosine which have been shown previously to be major constituents of the nucleotide pool of Artemia cysts. These new dinucleotides were purified from perchloric acid extracts of dormant cysts by ion exchange column chromatography and identified by means of chemical, spectrophotometric, and enzymatic analyses compared to commercially available compounds. The possible role of these new compounds in nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism in Artemia embryos is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1529286533,"Bovine neurophysin-I (bNP-I) is the first neurophysin protein which contains histidine and possesses an acidic COOH-terminal segment for which the complete amino acid sequence is presented: NH2-Ala-Val-Leu-Asp-Leu-Asp-Val-Arg-Thr-Cys-Leu-Pro-Cys-Gly-Pro-Gly-Gly-Lys-Gly-Arg-Cys-Phe-Gly-Pro-Ser-Ile-Cys-Cys-Gly-Asp-Glu-Leu-Gly-Cys-Phe-Val-Gly-Thr-Ala-Glu-Ala-Leu-Arg- Cys-Gln-Glu-Glu-Asn-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Ser-Pro-Cys-Gln-SerGly-Gln-Lys-Pro-Cys-Gly-Ser- Gly-Gly-Arg-Cys-Ala-Ala-Ala-Gly-Ile-Cys-Cys-Ser-Pro-Asp-Gly-Cys-His-Glu-Asp-Pro-Ala-Cys-Asp-Pro-Glu-Ala-Ala-Phe-Ser-Leu-COOH. Determination of the structure was greatly facilitated by new procedures used for the isolation of bNP-I and of its tryptic peptide fragments. bNP-I isolated from freshly frozen bovine posterior pituitaries is composed of 93 residues, but some preparations contain neurophysin protein with NH2- and COOH-terminal truncated sequences. bNP-I differs from bovine neurophysin-II, the second major neurophysin of cow, in 20 residue positions, and several of the differences cannot be accounted for by single nucleotide replacements in the genes coding for these two neurophysin proteins. The results reported in this study support our earlier hypothesis that neurophysin-gene duplication preceded species divergence."

Migration properties and relative staining intensities of the four H1 histone proteins in testis support the following conclusions. 1. Two testis-specific forms become the major H1 components at some stage of spermatogenesis. 2. During this stage they assume structural and functional role analogous to those of their two somatic counterparts. We have also detected a new testis-specific protein containing cysteine."
https://openalex.org/W1487929377,"Abstract Adenylate cyclase from purified beef thyroid membranes has been solubilized by the use of Triton N-101 after preactivation with guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)-triphosphate. The soluble activity passed a 0.22- micron filter, was not sedimented at 100,000 X g for 2 h, and behaved like aldolase in sucrose density gradients and on Sepharose 6B. From comparison of the sedimentation in D2O and H2O the partial specific volume was found to be like that of globular proteins (0.75 +/- 0.006), hence little detergent appeared to be bound to the enzyme. The sedimentation coefficient was 7.4 +/- 0.15, the Stokes radius 45 A, and the molecular weight 159,000. Prestimulation by thyrotropin did not survive solubilization. The stimulation produced by guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate persisted as did the more active state resulting from pretreatment with both this nucleotide plus thyrotropin. Thyrotropin did not stimulate the solubilized enzyme. The Km for ATP, thermal stability, and inhibition by Ca2+ were identical for the membrane-bound and soluble enzyme, while the pH optimum was increased 0.5 unit in the latter. Polyanions and phenothiazines inhibited both preparations equally, whereas only membranes responded to stimulation by polylysine and ribonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1581705633,"1-Carnitine was administered to fed rats and the changes in plasma beta-hydroxybutrate concentration and liver acid-insoluble acylcarnitine content were assessed. One hour following injection of carnitine in doses greater than 1 mumol/100 g of body weight there was a dose-dependent increase in liver acid-insoluble acylcarnitine content to levels comparable to those seen in fasting. These increased levels were maintained for a least 2 h following injection. During the period following carnitine administration there was no increase in ketogenesis as evidenced by plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. Since acid-insoluble acylcarnitines represent the product of carnitine palmitoyltransferase A, the results are interpreted as contradictory to the theory that this enzyme is rate-limiting and regulatory for ketogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1584089270,"A unique soluble lipoprotein has been isolated from aqueous lysates of bovine adrenal medulla chromaffin granules by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and gel filtration. Chloroform/methanol extracts of this complex contain sphingomyelin, lecithin, and cholesterol. Gel filtration in aqueous media indicate an approximate molecular weight of 900,000 for the complex. Incubation with sodium dodecyl sulfate causes dissociation to a low molecular weight polypeptide; prolonged treatment with guanidine HCl does not promote dissociation at all. Amino acid analysis revealed a high content of hydrophobic amino acids. Analysis of the tryptic fingerprint indicates that a single type of polypeptide chain is present. The complex appears to contain approximately five copies of polypeptide per aggregate."
https://openalex.org/W1531376935,"Abstract Dansylaziridine-labeled troponin C (TnCDANZ) undergoes a greater than 2-fold fluorescence enhancement with Ca2+ binding to the Ca2+-specific regulatory sites of troponin C. Hence, TnCDANZ serves as a very good indicator of Ca2+ in the range of 3.0 to 70 micron. Ca2+ uptake and release by sarcoplasmic reticulum can be easily and accurately monitored by the fluorescence changes in TnCDANZ. In this manner, we can monitor directly the removal of Ca2+ from troponin C by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Thus, this reaction represents a useful analogue ot the Ca2+ on-off process in muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1599925521,"An RNA(2'-O-methyladenosine-N6)-methyltransferase isolated from HeLa cells was used to convert the ends of vaccinia virus mRNAs containing m7G(5')pppAm-to m7G(5')pppm6Am-. Under competitive conditions, there was no preferential binding of mRNAs containing m6Am residues within the capped ends relative to those containing Am either to wheat germ ribosomes at 70 mM potassium acetate or to reticulocyte ribosomes at 120 mM potassium acetate. Only at high concentrations of potassium acetate (200 mM) and at near-saturating mRNA concentrations, was a slight enrichment of mRNAs containing m6Am over those containing Am detected on reticulocyte ribosomes. It appears that unlike methylation of the N7 position of the terminal guanosine, methylation at the N6 position of the penultimate adenosine of mRNA has, at most, a small effect on binding to ribosomes under present in vitro conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1514310680,"Hydrocortisone stimulated the catabolism of prelabeled fatty acyls in mouse L fibroblasts supplemented with exogenous fatty acid. Both oxidation to 14CO2 and release as free fatty acid from prelabeled lipids increased up to 20-fold under the described experimental conditions. The stimulating effect of hydrocortisone was observed even at concentrations as low as 1 microgram/ml. Neither the hormone nor exogenous fatty acid alone had a significant effect on endogenous fatty acyl catabolism. The activity of a cellular pH 6.5 lipase was unaffected by exogenous fatty acid, slightly increased by hydrocortisone, but increased 2-fold when both supplements were present. It is suggested that since exogenous fatty acids shunt phospholipid acyls to triglycerides, the latter induce the formation of more pH 6.5 lipase. Hydrocortisone is either needed for this induction to occur, or activates the newly formed enzyme. The lipase acts on the triglycerides to liberate free fatty acids that are then oxidized to 14CO2 or lost into the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1580364810,"NaCl, and the salt concen- tration then gradually lowered by gradient dialysis, elution of the histone-Sepharose with increasing NaCl concentration reveals the presence of several peaks of bound radioactivity which are not observed with con- trol columns (blank Sepharose or cytochrome c linked to Sepharose). Columns of histone H2B bind more la- beled nonhistones than do columns of histone Hl and the radioactive proteins are eluted at higher salt con- centrations. A given peak, rechromatographed on the same histone column, is eluted at the same NaCl con- centration originally required for elution. However, when rechromatographed on another type of histone column, the same peak is eluted at an NaCl concentra- tion different from that required for the original elu- tion. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel elec- trophoresis and autoradiography of the radioactive peaks eluted from the histone columns shows a number of highly radioactive proteins, some binding to both histone columns, and others binding preferentially to either histone H2B or Hl. These experiments therefore suggest that some nonhistone proteins, particularly the phosphorylated ones, bind to histones in a selective fashion. Both histone and nonhistone chromatin proteins are thought to be involved in regulating chromatin structure and function. The histones function mainly by packing DNA into compact structures known as v bodies or nucleosomes (l-3). This complexing of DNA with histones generally renders the DNA inefficient as a template for RNA synthesis (4). The"
https://openalex.org/W1517885958,"After incubating peripheral blood of various anemic individuals with [methyl-3H]methionine, 5'-terminal cap structures and the sequential methylation of human globin mRNAs were determined. Human alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs have the same methylated nucleotides at their 5' ends as the alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs of mouse and rabbit: m7G(5')ppp(5')[m6Am/Am]pCmp. The order of methyl group addition to human globin mRNA is also similar to that of mouse globin mRNA in that methylation of the 5'-terminal guanosine and the ribose of adenosine occurs earlier than that of the base of adenosine and the ribose of cytidine. Thus, both the cap structures and the order of methylation are conserved in the globin mRNAs of these species, suggesting that variation in the structure of the 5' terminus of globin mRNAs may alter the function of these molecules."
