https://openalex.org/W1595587942,"We describe methods for the complete analysis of cellular nucleotides from as few as 10(6) 32Pi-labeled cells in a simple 2-day experiment. Nucleotides are extracted with acid, neutralized, and resolved by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose. In the first dimension the nucleotides are separated based on the negative charge of their phosphate groups (i.e. cyclic, mono-, di, and triphosphates) and in the second dimension on their content of nucleobases (i.e. Ura, Cyt, Thy, Gua, and Ade). Because the separation is logical, one can predict the chromatographic migration of most nucleotides. By running standards we have determined the chromatographic location of over 90 biologically important nucleotides, nucleotide derivatives, and modified nucleotides from tRNA. We also developed a set of enzymatic and chemical methods to be used in conjunction with the chromatographic separations for verifying the identity of nucleotides and characterizing novel nucleotides. In this paper we use these methods to analyze and inventory the nucleotide content of Salmonella typhimurium in balanced log phase growth. Other potential uses of the method are also described."

An overall purification of 1950-fold was achieved. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol revealed three glycine receptor-associated polypeptides of Mr = 48,000, 58,000, and 93,000. [3H]Strychnine was incorporated irreversibly into the Mr = 48,000 polypeptide upon UV-illumination. The dissociation constant (KD) of [3H]strychnine binding to the purified glycine receptor was 9.3 +/- 0.6 nM. The glycine receptor agonists glycine, beta-alanine, and taurine inhibited the binding of [3H]strychnine to the purified receptor. Gel filtration and sedimentation in sucrose/H2O and sucrose/D2O gradients gave a Stokes radius of 7.7 nm, a partial specific volume of 0.780 +/- 0.005 ml/g and a sedimentation coefficient s20,w of 8.2 +/- 0.2 S for the purified glycine receptor. From these data, a molecular weight of 246,000 +/- 6,000 was calculated for the glycine receptor protein."

https://openalex.org/W1483050234,"The amino acid sequence of the Escherichia coli catabolite gene activator protein has been fit into a 2.9-A resolution electron density map. Each subunit of the dimer consists of two structurally distinct domains. The larger NH2-terminal domain is seen to bind cyclic AMP and forms all of the contacts between the subunits. The cyclic AMP is completely buried between the interior of the beta roll structure of the large domain and a long alpha helix; it makes important hydrogen-bonding interactions with residues from both subunits. The guanidinium group of a buried Arg makes an internal salt link with the phosphate of cyclic AMP. The 6-amino group of adenine interacts simultaneously with both subunits. This interaction with both subunits and the fact that cyclic GMP and cyclic IMP do not activate catabolite gene activator protein suggest that the binding of cyclic AMP may alter the relative orientation of the two subunits, which in turn would change the structure of a DNA binding site that is presumed to span the two smaller domains. The distribution and nature of side chains in the small domain do not rule out the possibility that catabolite gene activator protein binds to left-handed B-DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1498549327,"HeLa cells were found to have a single class of non-interacting receptors specific for transferrin. Both apotransferrin and diferric transferrin competed equally with 125I-diferric transferrin for receptor binding. Transferrin binding was temperature-dependent and reversible. Binding of transferrin to cells exhibited a KD of 27 nM with a maximum binding capacity of 1.8-3.7 x 10(6) molecules/cell. Cells grown in the presence of diferric transferrin or in the presence of ferric ammonium citrate exhibited a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in 125I-diferric transferrin binding. The decrease in binding activity reflected a reduction in receptor number rather than an alteration in ligand receptor affinity. Growth of cells in saturating concentrations of apotransferrin did not cause a decrease in receptor number. When iron-treated cells were removed to media free of ferric ammonium citrate, the receptor number returned to control values by 40 h. When receptors were removed with trypsin, cells grown and maintained in ferric ammonium citrate-supplemented media demonstrated a rate of receptor reappearance 47% that of control cells grown in ferric ammonium citrate-free media. Cells grown in media supplemented with diferric transferrin or ferric ammonium citrate exhibited an increase in cytosolic iron content. The transferrin receptor number returned to normal after cells were removed to unsupplemented media, despite persistent elevation of cytosolic iron content. Increased iron content did not appear to be the sole factor determining receptor number."
https://openalex.org/W1499579222,"Aldosterone stimulates transepithelial Na+ transport in the toad bladder, and thyroid hormone antagonizes this mineralocorticoid action. In the present study, we assessed the influence of these two hormones on the biosynthesis of (Na+,K+)ATPase, the major driving force of Na+ transport. Rates of enzyme synthesis were estimated by immunoprecipitation with monospecific alpha (96,000 daltons) and beta (60,000 daltons) subunit antibodies. After a 30-min pulse of intact tissue with [35S]methionine, the anti-alpha-serum recognized the 96,000-dalton alpha subunit and the anti-beta-serum, a 42,000-dalton protein, in total cell extracts. The biosynthesis rates of both these proteins were increased 2.8- and 2.4-fold respectively, over controls by 80 nM aldosterone after 18 h of hormone treatment. The hormonal effect was not apparent up to 3 h of incubation and was dose dependent between 0.2 and 20 nM aldosterone. The hormonal induction was antagonized by spironolactone (500-fold excess) but not by amiloride. The action of aldosterone thus seems to be a receptor-mediated process and a primary event independent of the Na+ permeability of the apical membrane. Thyroid hormone, on the other hand, had no effect on either basal or aldosterone-stimulated synthesis rates of both enzyme proteins. The results demonstrate a direct effect of aldosterone on gene expression of the (Na+,K+)-ATPase. Ultimately, this phenomenon could be linked to the late mineralocorticoid action of this hormone. On the other hand, thyroid hormone, in contrast to the situation in mammals, does not stimulate de novo enzyme synthesis in amphibia. Neither can the antimineralocorticoid action of thyroid hormone in the toad bladder be explained by an inhibition of the (Na+,K+)-ATPase synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1584694243,"The Mr = 160,000 epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in A431 cells is partially cleaved during membrane isolation to a Mr = 145,000 polypeptide containing both EGF binding and phosphate acceptor sites. We show that the proteolytic degradation of the EGF receptor depends upon the presence of Ca2+ in the medium used to scrape the cells from the substratum. Only the high molecular weight form of the receptor is detected in membranes prepared in the absence of Ca2+. Ca2+-dependent proteolysis occurs rapidly (t1/2 approximately 5 min) following cell scraping. Proteolysis results in a decrease in EGF-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor while retaining EGF binding capacity. In addition, membranes containing the uncleaved form of the receptor reveal a substantial increase in EGF-dependent phosphorylation of proteins with Mr approximately 80, 89, and 185 X 10(3). In the presence of Ca2+, addition of iodoacetic acid to the scraping medium strongly inhibits receptor fragmentation, whereas other inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and pepstatin) have no effect. The results implicate a role for a Ca2+-dependent, SH-sensitive protease in EGF receptor degradation. Prevention of proteolysis yields membrane preparations with highly active EGF-dependent kinase system."
https://openalex.org/W1612683899,"Cerulenin, an antibiotic that inhibits de novo fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, effectively inhibited the formation and release of virus particles from chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with Sindbis or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). When added for 1 h at 3 h postinfection, the antibiotic blocked VSV particle production by 80 to 90% and inhibited incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid into the VSV glycoprotein by an equivalent amount. The effect of this antibiotic on virus protein and RNA biosynthesis was significantly less than that on fatty acid acylation. Nonacylated virus glycoproteins accumulated inside and on the surface of cerulenin-treated cells. These data indicate that fatty acid acylation is not essential for intracellular transport of these membrane proteins, but it may have an important role in the interaction of glycoproteins with membranes during virus assembly and budding."
https://openalex.org/W1562698404,"Chick skeletal muscle cells in culture have an amiloride-sensitive Na+-transporting system that has the following properties. Na+ uptake is dependent on the extracellular Na+ concentration. The Km value for Na+ is 25 mM and remains constant between pH 7.5 and 8.5. The maximal rate of Na+ transport is higher at alkaline pH. An ionizable group with a pK of 7.6 is essential for the system to be functional. The activity of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ uptake system is controlled by internal Na+ and H+ concentrations. Amiloride inhibition of Na+ uptake is competitively antagonized by increasing Na+ concentration. The dissociation constant for amiloride is 5 microM in Na+-free conditions and is constant between pH 7.5 and 8.5. The Km value for Na+ found from competition experiments is 13 mM. The amiloride-sensitive Na+ influx occurs in parallel with an amiloride-sensitive H+ efflux. This H+ efflux is stimulated by increasing external Na+ concentrations, the Km for Na+ being 15 mM. It is inhibited by amiloride with the same concentration dependence as Na+ influx."
https://openalex.org/W1554188317,"The subcellular site of the further processing (NH2-terminal acetylation and COOH-terminal proteolysis) of beta-endorphin-sized molecules in the rat intermediate pituitary has been studied. Rat intermediate pituitary primary cultures that had been incubated in radioactively labeled amino acids were homogenized and the secretory granule fraction was separated from the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus fraction. The labeled beta-endorphin-sized molecules in each subcellular fraction were analyzed by immunoprecipitation, gel filtration chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography. A large percentage of the labeled beta-endorphin-sized molecules became NH2 terminally acetylated after becoming associated with the secretory granule fraction; most of the further COOH-terminal proteolytic processing of alpha-N-acetyl-beta-endorphin(1-31) to form alpha-N-acetyl-beta-endorphin(1-27) and alpha-N-acetyl-beta-endorphin(1-26) also occurred when the labeled beta-endorphin-sized molecules were associated with the secretory granule fraction. The acetylation of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha MSH)-sized molecules was also investigated in rat intermediate pituitary primary cell cultures by immunoprecipitation, gel filtration chromatography, and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Pulse-chase labeling experiments showed that newly synthesized molecules co-migrating with adrenocorticotropic hormone ((ACTH)(1-13)NH2) were converted first to molecules similar to alpha MSH (alpha-N-acetyl-ACTH(1-13)NH2) and then to molecules similar to alpha-N,O-diacetyl-alpha MSH. These results demonstrate that the enzyme activity(s) responsible for the NH2-terminal acetylation of beta-endorphin alpha MSH-sized molecules is located in the secretory granules of the rat intermediate pituitary."
https://openalex.org/W1481582055,"The precursor proteins to the subunits of ubiquinol:cytochrome c reductase (cytochrome bc1 complex) of Neurospora crassa were synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate. These precursors were immunoprecipitated with antibodies prepared against the individual subunits and compared to the mature subunits immunoprecipitated or isolated from mitochondria. Most subunits were synthesized as precursors with larger apparent molecular weights (subunits I, 51,500 versus 50,000; subunit II, 47,500 versus 45,000; subunit IV (cytochrome c1), 38,000 versus 31,000; subunit V (Fe-S protein), 28,000 versus 25,000; subunit VII, 12,000 versus 11,500; subunit VIII, 11,600 versus 11,200). Subunit VI (14,000) was synthesized with the same apparent molecular weight. The post-translational transfer of subunits I, IV, V, and VII was studied in an in vitro system employing reticulocyte lysate and isolated mitochondria. The transfer and proteolytic processing of these precursors was found to be dependent on the mitochondrial membrane potential. In the transfer of cytochrome c1, the proteolytic processing appears to take place in two separate steps via an intermediate both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, the intermediate form accumulated when cells were kept at 8 degrees C and was chased into mature cytochrome c1 at 25 degrees C. Both processing steps were energy-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1586449790,"The glycoprotein hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), contains both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide chains linked to its beta-subunit. Using the human choriocarcinoma cell line, BeWo, we have examined the temporal relationship between N- and O-glycosylation of hCG and the subsequent processing of both types of oligosaccharide chains. The results indicate that, as observed in related cell lines, mature, completely glycosylated forms of the subunits of hCG cannot be detected intracellularly in BeWo cells during pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine. To more directly study the temporal relationship between N- and O-glycosylation of hCG in BeWo cells, 14C-amino acids and [3H]glucosamine (which also serves as a precursor to N-acetylgalactosamine) were used to label hCG. The results of these studies are consistent with a model for the N- and O-glycosylation of hCG in which 1) N-glycosylation of hCG occurs co-translationally or very shortly after translation, and 2) the addition of O-linked GalNAc residues to the polypeptide and the addition of peripheral GlcNAc residues to the N-linked oligosaccharide chains occur just prior to secretion, presumably in the Golgi complex."
https://openalex.org/W1507505402,"We have evaluated the B to Z conformational transitions in supercoiled recombinant plasmids containing different lengths of (dC-dG) described in the preceding paper. The sodium chloride-induced right- to left-handed transition in a small segment of the plasmids caused a relaxation of (-) supercoils which was monitored by electrophoretic mobility changes of individual topoisomers on agarose gels containing NaCl at concentrations up to 5.0 M. The number of supercoils relaxed was proportional to the length of the (dC-dG) segment in the plasmid in good agreement with theoretical values. A short B/Z junction region (less than 5 base pairs) was inferred. The stability of the Z conformation in (dC-dG) segments of the plasmids had a strong length dependency; shorter lengths were less stable. Ten base pairs of (dC-dG) was insufficient to allow a Z conformation under the conditions studied. Supercoiling imparts a substantial favorable free energy to the Z conformation, reducing the NaCl concentration necessary to cause the transition. The relationship of supercoiling with the NaCl concentration necessary to cause a B leads to Z transition suggests that supercoiling alone is sufficient to stabilize the Z conformation at physiological salt concentrations. These results support the notion that left-handed DNA has an important biological role."
https://openalex.org/W1591230411,"A study of the phosphorylated sites on the regulatory subunit of type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase is described. The site of autophosphorylation, previously reported (Takio, K., Walsh, K. A., Neurath, H., Smith, S. B., Krebs, E. G., and Titani, K. (1980) FEBS Lett. 114, 83-88), is found to contain the only residue phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit. Endogenous protein-bound phosphate, present at a second site, is observed in the NH2-terminal region of purified type II regulatory subunit. A serine residue in this same domain of type II regulatory subunit is shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase II. The stoichiometry of phosphate incorporation by casein kinase II indicates a single site of phosphorylation that is equivalent to the site containing the endogenous phosphate. The apparent Km and Vmax of casein kinase II for the phosphorylation of purified type II regulatory subunit containing 0.55 molar equivalents of endogenous phosphate are 36 microM and 3.5 mumol/min/mg, respectively. Phosphatase treatment of type II regulatory subunit decreased the determined Km to 13 microM but does not change the Vmax consistent with the suggestion that casein kinase II is phosphorylating a site partially occupied by endogenous phosphate. Comparison of peptide maps of type II regulatory subunit phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase II with in vivo modified type II regulatory subunit indicates that the site modified in vitro is also phosphorylated in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W50777552,"K+ efflux from respiring mitochondria via the K+/H+ exchanger is inhibited by quinine. In contrast, swelling in fresh mitochondria suspended in Na+ acetate, reflecting activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger, is unaffected by quinine. Swelling studies were also carried out in K+ and Na+ acetate in mitochondria loaded with tetraethylammonium and depleted of Mg2+ and K+. From the effects of pH and quinine on this preparation, we conclude that there are two distinct electroneutral pathways for monovalent cations. The Na+/H+ exchanger is highly specific for Na+ over K+ and is neither regulated by Mg2+ ions nor inhibited by quinine. The K+/H+ exchanger transports both Na+ and K+ and is regulated by Mg2+ ions and inhibited by quinine."
https://openalex.org/W1791397710,"Recombinant pBR322 derivatives were constructed containing tracts of (dC-dG) sequences which are 58, 32, 26, and 10 base pairs (bp) in length in conjunction with a 95-bp fragment containing the Escherichia coli lac operator-promoter. The biological properties of these plasmids were unusual since deletions in the (dC-dG) regions, but not in the pBR322 nor the lac segments, were frequently observed; segments of (dC-dG) longer than approximately 50 bp were not stable but suffered deletions. Segments of approximately 30 bp or shorter were stable in most cases. The (dC-dG) tracts seemed to enhance recA-mediated recombination when they were of suitable length and were cloned into certain sites in the recombinants. Also the (dC-dG)-containing plasmids were less supercoiled (by 6-12 turns) than expected, relative to control plasmids, after isolation from E. coli hosts. These recombinant plasmids were used in the following paper to evaluate the properties of segments containing the unorthodox left-handed conformations."
https://openalex.org/W1555766295,"Five independently derived variants of a herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) strain were plaque purified from a virus population passaged in 1 mM phosphonoformic acid (PFA). The DNA polymerase induced by the parent and PFA-resistant viruses were purified and characterized. No differences were observed among the enzymes with respect to their chromatographic properties, specific activities, or polypeptides resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The variant enzymes exhibited levels of PFA resistance which ranged from 15- to 25-fold. Resistance to PFA was always associated with a similar degree of resistance to its congener phosphonoacetic acid, but cross-resistance to beta-phenylphosphonoacetic acid was only seen with two of the five variant enzymes. PFA and pyrophosphate were mutually competitive in PPi exchange reactions, but in DNA synthetic reactions the levels of resistance to PFA and PPi were not equal. The apparent affinities of the enzymes for Mg2+ did parallel their affinities for PFA. Km values of dNTPs were about 2-fold higher than the parent virus enzyme for all of the variant enzymes except one which was 4-fold higher. The processivity of polymerization was apparently unaffected by the enzyme changes related to PFA resistance although one variant enzyme had a lower value. Resistance among the variant enzymes to the triphosphates of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine and 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine was directly related to the level of resistance to PFA. The data presented here indicated that (i) PFA resistance may result from several types of active site alterations, since the PFA-resistant enzymes were of three kinetically distinct types. Also, additional enzyme alterations, probably unrelated to PFA resistance, were detected in one enzyme. (ii) PFA and PPi possess some different binding determinants within the active center of herpes simplex virus type I DNA polymerase. (iii) PFA and the triphosphates of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine and 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine may have a common ultimate inhibitory mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1566105461,"We have purified phosphomannosyl-enzyme receptors from bovine liver on an affinity column composed of glycoproteins isolated from Dictyostelium discoideum secretions. Binding of human fibroblast beta-hexosaminidase B to receptors reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine liposomes was 1) specifically inhibited by mannose 6-phosphate, but not mannose 1-phosphate or glucose 6-phosphate, and 2) had properties similar to the previously reported binding of enzyme to receptors on cell surfaces and isolated membranes. In order to determine the structural features of the phosphomannosyl recognition marker required for receptor recognition, we covalently coupled purified receptor to an agarose gel bead support for affinity chromatography of phosphorylated, high mannose-type oligosaccharides isolated from fibroblast secretions radiolabeled with [2-3H]mannose. Neutral oligosaccharides and oligosaccharides containing one or two phosphates in phosphodiester linkage were not retained by the receptor column. By contrast, oligosaccharides bearing one phosphomonoester moiety were retarded on the column; those bearing two phosphomonoesters were bound to the column and were eluted with 10 mM mannose 6-phosphate. The binding of the oligosaccharides to the immobilized receptor correlates with their ability to be pinocytosed by fibroblasts and shows that the preferred recognition marker for the phosphomannosyl-enzyme receptor is a high mannose-type oligosaccharide chain bearing two uncovered phosphomannosyl groups."

Mutations at two other loci, cyc2 and cyc3, that are unlinked to either of the structural genes, specifically reduce the levels of both iso-cytochromes c; cyc2 mutations can also cause complete deficiencies. Researchers have explored the possibility that the CYC2 and CYC3 loci code for maturation functions involved in the biosynthesis of cytochrome c. Researchers propose that the CYC3 locus codes for a heme attachment activity. Evidence is presented indicating that the CYC2 gene product may be a protein which facilitates apo-cytochrome c transport across the outer mitochondrial membrane or enhances the heme attachment activity. It is unknown why apo-iso-1-cytochrome c does not accumulate in mutants that allow accumulation of apo-iso-2-cytochrome c."

https://openalex.org/W1602836872,"Exposure of the alpha-adrenergic receptor of the human platelet to agonist prior to solubilization stabilizes a receptor complex of the alpha-adrenergic receptor with the GTP-binding protein(s) which modulates receptor affinity for agonists (Smith, S. K., and Limbird, L. E. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 4026-4030). The soluble alpha-adrenergic receptor is characterized by retention of sensitivity to GTP and a faster rate of sedimentation in sucrose gradients than antagonist-occupied or unoccupied receptors. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether the alpha-adrenergic receptor, which is coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, contains the same GTP-binding protein that is involved in activation of adenylate cyclase. The GTP-binding protein that is coupled to activation of adenylate cyclase was labeled with [32P]ADP-ribose using cholera toxin. Incorporation of [32]ADP-ribose into a Mr = 42,000 peptide in human platelet membranes was paralleled by an enhancement of GTP-sensitive catalytic activity in the membranes. However, cholera toxin treatment did not modify alpha-receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase or interaction of the alpha-receptor with agonist agents. Moreover, sucrose gradient centrifugation revealed that the [32P]ADP-ribosylated Mr = 42,000 subunit of the stimulatory GTP-binding protein did not appear to associate with the agonist-alpha-receptor complex. These data suggest that the GTP-binding protein that mediates GTP activation of adenylate cyclase in the human platelet membrane is distinct from the GTP-binding protein that modulates alpha-adrenergic receptor affinity for agonist agents and which associates with the receptor in the presence of agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1551394521,"Parotid gland acinar cells, prepared from 12- and 24-month-old rats, show decreased physiological responsiveness to alpha-adrenergic stimulation in vitro compared to cells from 3-month-old rats. K+ efflux, an index of water and electrolyte secretion, was approximately 35% lower with 12- and 24-month-old parotid cells. No loss of alpha-adrenergic receptors, their binding affinity for specific alpha-adrenergic ligands, or their relative subtype distribution, accompanied the diminished exocrine function. Conversely, a significant reduction in alpha-adrenergic-mediated phospholipid turnover in, and 45Ca2+ efflux from, parotid cells of older rats was observed. These changes in phospholipid metabolism and Ca2+ flux were parallel to changes seen in K+ efflux as judged by dose-response studies. When the alpha-adrenergic receptor was by-passed by using the Ca2+-ionophore A-23187 to elicit K+ efflux, young and old parotid cells were equally responsive. In aggregate the findings suggest that parotid gland cells from older rats display an altered alpha-adrenergic signal transduction mechanism at a site between the receptor and phospholipid turnover/Ca2+ mobilization."

The total number of amino acid residues is 241, giving a molecular weight of 27,924 including the heme group. The NH2- and COOH-terminal residues are serine and lysine, respectively. One characteristic of the protein is that cytochrome c1 contains 43.6% hydrophobic residues and the polarity is estimated to be 41.1%. No clear homology was found between cytochrome c1 and other membranous proteins such as cytochrome b5 or the subunits of cytochrome oxidase for which sequences have been reported. Cytochrome c1 is predicted to have a high content of alpha-helix (46%). Partial sequence studies were also carried out on cytochrome c1 preparations obtained by different procedures and showed that there is no difference among the sequences of various preparations of cytochrome c1. The presence of a hydrophobic cluster near the COOH-terminal region indicates that the COOH-terminal region of cytochrome C1 associates with, or is buried in, the phospholipid bilayer of the mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1552059862,"After energy depletion by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation or inhibitors of electron transport, primary cultures of carcinogen-induced rat mammary tumors have a 2- to 20-fold increase in the number of cell surface prolactin receptors. When energy-depleted cells were treated with 0.15 M NaCl plus 50 mM glycine pH 3, for 1 min at 4 degrees C, 75% of the specific surface-bound 125I-labeled ovine prolactin was removed, but prolactin and its receptor were not destroyed. Using this technique, we found that receptor-bound prolactin can be internalized (becomes resistant to pH 3.0 treatment) and then degraded. The internalization of occupied receptors required energy, was completed 30-60 min before degradation, and was independent of protein synthesis. Hormone degradation (t1/2, 42 min) but not uptake was prevented by NH4Cl or lysosomotropic amines. In the presence of cycloheximide, receptors were lost (t1/2, 62 min) unless such loss was prevented by KCN. After unoccupied receptors were activated by energy depletion, surface receptors were lost when inhibitor was removed and glucose was added. Thus, both occupied and unoccupied prolactin receptors are constantly removed from the cell surface via an energy-dependent uptake mechanism. If the receptor levels are first increased by energy depletion (with or without bound ligand) or if protein synthesis is inhibited, there is a net loss of surface binding sites. Since the receptors reappeared with 15 h after cycloheximide removal, some of the receptors probably are recycled under normal steady state conditions."
https://openalex.org/W132933741,"I have found that mammalian cytochrome oxidase catalyzes the peroxidatic oxidation of ferrocytochrome c under strictly anaerobic conditions.

These values were quite similar to the corresponding values of 6.4 microM and 1.9 X 10(6) M-1 s-1 determined for the intrinsic oxidase activity. The rate of the peroxidatic oxidation showed a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, and the apparent Km value ws 0.18 mM. Cyanide and azide at 0.1 mM inhibited the peroxidase activity by 100 and 98%, respectively, whereas, under carbon monoxide at 750 mm Hg, 10% of the activity still remained.

From the alkaline hemochrome spectra, we found two heme c and two heme d moieties per molecule. EPR and Mossbauer data provide further evidence for a 1:l heme c to heme d ratio. In the oxidized form, both hemes are low spin ferric (S = 1/2) and yield characteristic EPR and Mossbauer spectra. The d heme exhibits EPR resonances at g = 2.50, 2.43, and 1.70 similar to those reported for chlorin di-imidazole complexes. The c heme exhibits an EPR resonance at g 3.60 suggesting a nitrogenous sixth ligand. The Mossbauer parameters, AEQ = (2.22 +: 0.02) mm/s and 6 = (0.22 2 0.02) mm/s for the c heme and aE, = (1.66 +: 0.02) mm/s and 6 = (0.20 & 0.02) mm/s for the d heme, are typical for low spin ferric complexes. The low temperature Mossbauer spectra have been evaluated in the spin Hamiltonian formalism. It was found that the ligand field model commonly used to describe low spin ferric hemes does not account properly for the observed magnetic hyperfine interactions of the heme d iron. In the reduced form, both hemes are in the ferrous states. The observed Mossbauer parameters are AE, = (1.14 & 0.04) mm/s, S = (0.45 rt 0.04) mm/s for the c heme and A& = (2.24 & 0.04) mm/s, 6 = (0.97 2 0.04) mm/s for the d heme. This observation demonstrates that, upon reduetion, the c heme remains low spin (S = 0) and the d heme becomes high spin (S = 2)."
https://openalex.org/W1517670533,"Specific enkephalin binding was found in a rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12 (subclone h), when cultured in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF; 50 ng/ml). Specific binding of [3H][D-Ala2]Met-enkephalinamide was saturable with a KD=2.4 nM and Bmax = 866 fmol/mg of protein. The binding was displaced completely by morphine and naloxone at a concentration of 10(-4) and 10(-6) M, respectively. beta-Endorphin and dynorphin [1-13] also displaced the binding; KI = 9.6 and 81.6 nM, respectively. Enkephalin binding in PC12h cells cultured in the absence of NGF was very low. Binding was dramatically increased when cultured in the presence of NGF for 7 to 10 days. The enkephalin binding was induced by NGF in the cells cultured in a hormone-supplemented serum-free medium. In contrast, epidermal growth factor was of two orders lower potency, and insulin had no effect on the expression of enkephalin binding sites. Since the differentiation effects of NGF on PC12h cells are though to offer a model system to investigate the effect of NGH on neurons, the present observations may suggest a physiological role for NGF in the induction and maintenance of specific opiate receptors during development of the autonomic nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1490494056,"23,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 was isolated from vitamin D-toxic pig plasma by sequential chromatography through two gravity columns and three high performance liquid chromatography systems. Two of the high performance liquid chromatography systems separated the R and S diastereomers of 23,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and demonstrated that the metabolite has the 23S configuration. Ultraviolet absorbance and mass spectroscopy of the pure metabolite and mass spectroscopy of its trisilylated derivative confirmed the structural assignment. 23S,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3, 23R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 25S,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and 25R,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were assessed for their ability to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone in vitamin D2-toxic rats. On 23S,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, of the naturally occurring compounds, was able to increase the plasma lactone concentration. This metabolite was a more efficient precursor than 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, suggesting that 23S-hydroxylation is a rate-limiting step in 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone formation. 23S,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 was not detected in 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-dosed rats, indicating that the former is rapidly metabolized. Nephrectomized rats had a diminished but significant ability to synthesize 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone from 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Nephrectomy did not affect synthesis of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone from 23S,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. These results demonstrate that vitamin D3 23S-hydroxylase(s) are also located extrarenally and that extrarenal tissues are quantitatively important to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1578221357,"A homogeneous preparation of endo-oligopeptidase A from rabbit brain cleaves luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (less than Glu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH2) at the Tyr-Gly bond only after the removal of Gly-NH2 from the COOH-terminal position of the molecule. The influence of the carboxyl terminus on hydrolysis by brain endo-oligopeptidases was studied using bradykinin as a model substrate. The substitution of the carboxyl group of bradykinin by the amide reduces by 2.5-fold the rate of Phe-Ser bond hydrolysis by endo-oligopeptidase A but has no effect on the rate of hydrolysis of the Pro-Phe bond by endo-oligopeptidase B. On the other hand, the deletion of Phe-Arg from the COOH-terminal portion of bradykinin makes the peptide resistant to hydrolysis by endo-oligopeptidase A whereas it increases by 5-fold the rate of hydrolysis of the Pro-Gly bond by endo-oligopeptidase B."
https://openalex.org/W2154274785,"Electron spin echo envelope spectroscopy was used to probe the two metal binding sites of Cu(II)-conalbumin. The echo envelope spectrum of Cu(II)-conalbumin-oxalate, with metal ion at either one or both of the binding sites, contains lines arising from the interaction of the electron spin of Cu(II) with bound imidazole, demonstrating histidine ligation to the metal ion. The 13C superhyperfine interaction of bound [13C]oxalate, obtained from the ratio of the electron spin echo envelopes of Cu(II)-conalbumin-[13C]oxalate to that of Cu(II)-conalbumin-[12C]oxalate, is about twice the free precession frequency and indicates a contact interaction between 13C and Cu(II). This study indicates that oxalate is directly coordinated to the metal ion. Over the pH range 7.0 to 10.0, where Cu(II)-conalbumin binds carbonate as an associated anion, the echo envelope spectrum indicates that at least one imidazole ligand is coordinated to Cu(II). Below pH 6.0 and above pH 11.0, imidazole coordination is not observed."
https://openalex.org/W1530716139,"Five mol of lysine per mol of bacteriorhodopsin were modified with methylacetimidate. This treatment did not inactivate bacteriorhodopsin but prevented all lysines from subsequent reaction with diazotized sulfanilic acid. This reaction predominantly modified tyrosine 64 and light-induced proton translocation was abolished. Reduction of the mono(p-azobenzene sulfonic acid) tyrosine 64 to the corresponding 3-amino derivative with sodium dithionite led to complete reactivation of the proton translocation activity of bacteriorhodopsin. The relative location of tyrosines 26 and 64 and the COOH terminus on the two surfaces of the purple membrane was determined by incorporation into phospholipid vesicles, subsequent modification, and proteolytic treatment. The results obtained support the models proposed by Engelmann et al. (Engelman, D. M., Henderson, R. McLauchlan, A. D., and Wallace, B. A. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 2023-2027) and by Ovchinnikov et al. (Ovchinnikov, Yu. A., Abdulaev, N. G., Feigina M. Yu., Kiselev A. V., and Lobanov, N. A. (1979) FEBS Lett. 100, 219-224). Tyrosine 64 is located on the extracellular side of the membrane, whereas tyrosine 26 and the COOH terminus are located on the cytoplasmic side. Because specific nitration of tyrosine 26 also leads to inactivation of bacteriorhodopsin (Lemke, H. D., and Oesterhelt, D. (1981) Eur. J. Biochem. 115, 595-604), the results obtained demonstrate that amino acid residues located on both surfaces of the purple membrane are involved in proton translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1561238948,"Cytochrome c553 is a photosynthetic electron transport protein found in algae and cyanobacteria. We have purified cytochromes c553 from five cyanobacteria and studied the structures of the ferrocytochromes by 1H NMR spectroscopy at 360 and 470 MHz. Using standard NMR techniques and by comparing the amino acid sequences of four cytochromes c553 with their 1H NMR spectra, we have assigned in the spectrum of the Aphanizomenon flos-aquae protein 18 resonances to specific amino acid residues and 12 resonances to specific heme protons. Steady state and truncated driven nuclear Overhauser enhancement experiments indicate that a tyrosine and methionine are located near pyrrole ring IV of the heme and that a phenylalanine ring is near the heme alpha-mesoproton. The general folding of the cytochrome c553 protein backbone appears to resemble that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c551, but the chirality of the cytochrome c553 axial methine sulfur is R, the same as that of horse heart cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1544224241,"Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) is glycosylated and proteolytically cleaved to produce a number of smaller peptide hormones including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and endorphin in mammalian pituitary and the mouse pituitary cell line AtT-20/D16v. When glycosylation of POMC is inhibited in AtT-20 cells with the drug tunicamycin, a 26,000-dalton protein appears in place of the glycosylated 29,000- and 32,000-dalton forms of POMC. The 26,000-dalton form found in tunicamycin-treated cells has the same [35S]methionine tryptic peptides as 29,000- and 32,000-dalton POMC, indicating that the decrease in apparent mass is most likely due to loss of carbohydrate and not to changes in the peptide backbone. The 4,500-dalton form of alpha(1-39)ACTH and the 3,000- and 11,000-dalton forms of endorphin are all present in tunicamycin-treated cells. The glycosylated form of alpha(1-39)ACTH, however, is missing and the glycosylated ACTH intermediates are replaced by unglycosylated ACTH intermediates. Pulse-chase studies demonstrate that the 26,000-dalton unglycosylated POMC is the precursor of the smaller ACTH and endorphin molecules in tunicamycin-treated cells. Furthermore, all of the forms of ACTH and endorphin found in tunicamycin-treated cells are secreted. Thus, it appears that glycosylation is not an essential step for correct cleavage or secretion of POMC or its products."
https://openalex.org/W1598583077,"Two kinetic components with distinct difference spectra occur during reduction of cytochrome c oxidase by ruthenium hexamine. They are attributed to reduction of heme a (fast phase) and heme a3 (slow phase) (Scott, R. A., and Gray, H. B. (1980) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 102, 3219-3774). Two spectra seen during oxidation of cytochrome c oxidase by molecular oxygen have also been attributed to oxidation of hemes a3 and a (Greenwood, C., and Gibson, Q. H. (1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 1782-1787). We now report that spectra for the reductive and oxidative reactions obtained with the same preparations and the same apparatus under similar conditions are significantly different. The reactions appear to populate different reaction intermediates. Reconstitution into phospholipid vesicles does not affect these two spectra significantly. During turnover, the chief intermediates are those of the reductive pathway (Scott and Gray type intermediates). Reduction of heme a3 occurs approximately 70 times faster after turnover than the reduction of the resting enzyme. This is probably a dramatic pulsing effect (Wilson, M. T., Peterson, J., Antonini, E., Brunori, M., Colosimo, A., and Wyman, J. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 7115-7118)."
https://openalex.org/W1550287933,"Purified pyruvate oxidase requires a divalent metal cation for enzymatic activity. The function of the divalent metal cation was studied for unactivated, dodecyl sulfate-activated, and phosphatidylglycerol-activated oxidase. Assays performed in the presence of Mg2+, CA2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Cr3+ in each of four different buffers, phosphate, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, imidazole, and citrate, indicate that any of these metal cations will fulfill the pyruvate oxidase requirement. Extensive steady state kinetics data were obtained with both Mg2+ and Mn2+. All the data are consistent with the proposition that the only role of the metal is to bind to the cofactor thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) and that it is the Me2+-TPP complex which is the true cofactor. Values of the Mg2+ and Mn2+ dissociation constants with TPP were determined by EPR spectroscopy and these data were used to calculate the Michaelis constant for the Me2+-TPP complexes. The results show that the Michaelis constants for the Me2+-TPP complexes are independent of the metal cation in the complex. Fluorescence quenching experiments show that the Michaelis constant is equal to the dissociation constant of the Mn2+-TPP complex with the enzyme. It was also shown that Mn2+ will only bind to the enzyme in the presence of TPP and that one Mn2+ binds per subunit. Steady state kinetics experiments with Mn2+ were more complicated than those obtained with Mg2+ because of the formation of an abortive Mn2+-pyruvate complex. Both EPR and steady state kinetics data indicated complex formation with a dissociation constant of about 70 mM."

Results in infected cells indicate Pr-dUrd 1) is taken up and phosphorylated to mono-, di-, and triphosphates; 2) is incorporated into DNA; 3) preferentially inhibits synthesis of viral DNA; 4) blocks re-initiation of viral DNA synthesis even after removal of the nucleoside from the culture; and 5) exerts these effects early in the course of infection (before 6 h postinfection). Pr-dUrd was not phosphorylated in uninfected cells, and had little or no effect on apparent cellular DNA synthesis in infected or uninfected cells. Present evidence suggests one possible antiviral event could be the lethal effect of Pr-dUrd after incorporation into viral DNA by alteration of DNA template-directed functions such as replication."

Incubation of high molecular weight and low molecular weight preparations of calf thymus terminal transferase with the catalytic subunit of beef cardiac muscle cAMP-dependent protein kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP result in phosphorylation of the 58,000-dalton form of the enzyme and no other lower molecular weight terminal peptides. These results, taken with our earlier results on tissue proteolysis of terminal transferase to lower molecular weight, active forms (Chang, L. M. S., Plevani, P., and Bollum, F. J. (1982) J. Biol.

Under the conditions used (0.33% subtilisin, w/w, pH 7.4), the product formed from the oxidase was relatively stable to further digestion. Cytochrome oxidase activity was assayed at intervals during proteolysis by following the rate of oxidation of Pseudomonas ferrocytochrome c-551 by the enzyme in the presence of oxygen. The activity increased to a plateau that was more than two times the value for an untreated control. These observations suggest that clipping a small peptide from Pseudomonas cytochrome oxidase either facilitates the rate-limiting electron transfer between the intraprotein heme c and heme d1, enhances the interaction of the enzyme with ferrocytochrome c-551, or both."
