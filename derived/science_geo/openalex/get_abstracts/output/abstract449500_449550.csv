H3K4me3 is a prominent histone mark that is associated with active genes and promotes transcription through interactions with effector proteins that include initiation factor TFIID. We demonstrate that H3K4me3-TAF3 interactions direct global TFIID recruitment to active genes, some of which are p53 targets. Further analyses show that (1) H3K4me3 enhances p53-dependent transcription by stimulating preinitiation complex (PIC) formation; (2) H3K4me3, through TAF3 interactions, can act either independently or cooperatively with the TATA box to direct PIC formation and transcription; and (3) H3K4me3-TAF3/TFIID interactions regulate gene-selective functions of p53 in response to genotoxic stress. Our findings indicate a mechanism by which H3K4me3 directs PIC assembly for the rapid induction of specific p53 target genes.

H3K4me3 is a histone mark associated with promoters and early-transcribed regions of active genes (Bernstein et al., 2005Bernstein B.E. Kamal M. Lindblad-Toh K. Bekiranov S. Bailey D.K. Huebert D.J.

Whereas studies in yeast indicate that H3K4me3 is a consequence of transcription, studies in metazoans favor more causal roles in transcription for this mark (reviewed in Vermeulen and Timmers, 2010Vermeulen M. Timmers H.T. Grasping trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4.Epigenomics. 2010; 2: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the functions of H3K4me3 in initiation versus early elongation are not well established. However, in support of a function at initiation, a seminal study has demonstrated an interaction of H3K4me3 with the TAF3 subunit of TFIID (Vermeulen et al., 2007Vermeulen M. Mulder K.W. Denissov S. Pijnappel W.W. van Schaik F.M. Varier R.A. Baltissen M.P. Stunnenberg H.G. Mann M. Timmers H.T.

TFIID is a general initiation factor (GTF) that, through core promoter recognition, plays a key role in preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly. TFIID is comprised of the TATA-binding polypeptide (TBP) and ∼14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that interact with transcriptional activators, core promoter elements, and other GTFs (Burley and Roeder, 1996Burley S.K.

Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and these interactions have been suggested to be important specifically for TATA-less promoters (Vermeulen et al., 2007Vermeulen M. Mulder K.W. Denissov S. Pijnappel W.W. van Schaik F.M. Varier R.A. Baltissen M.P. Stunnenberg H.G. Mann M. Timmers H.T.

However, this interesting possibility has not been tested and, importantly, there is no corresponding information on either global or gene-specific functions of H3K4me3-TAF3 interactions or on their underlying mechanism of action. Following a global analysis of H3K4me3-TAF3 interactions, we focus on possible gene-specific effects of these interactions in the regulation of gene expression by the tumor suppressor p53. As a transcriptional activator, p53 strikes a balance between cell-cycle arrest and programmed cell death through the differential activation of cognate genes (reviewed in Vousden and Prives, 2009Vousden K.H. Prives C. Blinded by the light: the growing complexity of p53.Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar). The kinetics of p53 target gene activation vary, ranging from a rapid induction of cell-cycle control genes to a delayed induction of proapoptotic genes (Zhao et al., 2000Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Analysis of p53-regulated gene expression patterns using oligonucleotide arrays.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that regulate the distinct transcription programs remain to be fully elucidated. A potential role for H3K4me3 in p53-mediated gene activation is supported by a DNA damage-enhanced accumulation of H3K4me3 at the GADD45A promoter (An and Roeder, 2004An W. Roeder R.G. Reconstitution and transcriptional analysis of chromatin in vitro.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 377: 460-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Also, ubiquitylated H2B, which directly stimulates hSET1-dependent H3K4 di- and trimethylation (Shilatifard, 2006Shilatifard A. Chromatin modifications by methylation and ubiquitination: implications in the regulation of gene expression.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), accumulates at the p21 promoter in response to DNA damage (Kim et al., 2009Kim J. Guermah M. McGinty R.K. Lee J.S. Tang Z. Milne T.A. Shilatifard A. Muir T.W. Roeder R.G. RAD6-mediated transcription-coupled H2B ubiquitylation directly stimulates H3K4 methylation in human cells.Cell. 2009; 137: 459-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). However, the downstream mechanisms underlying H3K4me3 function in p53-dependent activation remain to be determined. Here, we show that H3K4me3, through interactions with TAF3, directs global TFIID recruitment. In subsequent biochemical and cell-based analyses of p53 function, we show that H3K4me3-TAF3/TFIID interactions both enhance p53-dependent transcription by directly stimulating PIC formation and facilitate selective gene activation by p53 in response to DNA damage. To investigate a role for H3K4me3 in the genome-wide recruitment of TAF3, we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to examine the distribution of TAF3, RNAPII, and H3K4me3 in human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells (Bunz et al., 1998Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Requirement for p53 and p21 to sustain G2 arrest after DNA damage.Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar). Stringent TAF3 binding peaks (n = 11,765, p < 1 × 10−5, false discovery rate <5%) were identified with TAF3 bound at 46% of protein-coding gene promoters. Heat maps (Figure 1A) and composite profiles (Figure S1A available online) demonstrate a significant colocalization of the peak binding sites for TAF3 and RNAPII with the peak sites of H3K4me3 enrichment on active promoters. The vast majority (98%) of the TAF3-occupied regions were marked with significant H3K4me3 levels, and conversely, TAF3 was bound at most (81%) H3K4me3-enriched regions (Figure 1B). There also exists a genome-wide overlap in the length and height of the H3K4me3 and TAF3 peaks (Figure S1B). Thus, our ChIP-seq results establish a strong correlation between TAF3 binding sites and sites of H3K4me3 enrichment across the genome.Figure S1ChIP-Seq Analysis Showing the Distribution of TAF3, RNAPII, and H3K4me3, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Composite TAF3 (top), RNAPII (middle), and H3K4me3 (bottom) distribution profiles within 2 kb of the TSSs.

USA. 2010; 107: 3135-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) to determine the direct contribution of H3K4me3 to TAF3/TFIID recruitment. We compared the genome-wide distribution of wild-type (WT) TAF3 to the TAF3 M880A plant homeo domain (PHD) point mutant, which disrupts TAF3 binding to H3K4me3 (van Ingen et al., 2008van Ingen H. van Schaik F.M.

Selective anchoring of TFIID to nucleosomes by trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4.Cell. 2007; 131: 58-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Consistent with our ChIP-seq data, our HIT-seq analyses showed a strong correlation of TAF3 HIT-seq peaks with RNAPII recruitment and active gene expression (Figure 1C, TAF3 WT), a significant overlap of TAF3 binding sites with sites of H3K4me3 enrichment (Figures 1C and 1D), and a strong correlation in the sizes of the H3K4me3 and TAF3 peaks (Figure 1C). In comparison to their WT counterparts, full-length M880A TAF3 and the isolated M880A TAF3 PHD finger showed moderately reduced (31%) and more substantially reduced (94%) binding, respectively, to the transcription start site (TSS) region of the promoter (Figure 1D). This difference likely reflects the incorporation of mutant TAF3, but not the mutant TAF3 PHD finger, into TFIID and passive recruitment of TFIID through alternate recruitment mechanisms. These data suggest that H3K4me3-TAF3/TFIID interactions broadly contribute to TAF3 promoter occupancy. However, the magnitude of the decrease in TAF3 binding caused by the loss of H3K4me3 interactions varies at individual promoters (Figure 1C), which suggests that some promoters are more dependent on H3K4me3-TAF3/TFIID interactions for TFIID recruitment. To investigate the differential requirement for H3K4me3-TAF3/TFIID interactions at individual promoters, we used the TAF3 HIT-seq data to compare the binding of WT and mutant TAF3 near the TSSs of genes that were sorted into groups of 100 based on expression level (Figure 1E). The largest HIT-seq peaks for both intact TAF3 and the isolated PHD finger, as well as the greatest differences between the binding of the WT and M880A mutant TAF3 proteins and the corresponding WT and mutant PHD fingers, were identified at highly expressed genes (Figure 1E). Gene ontology enrichment (GO) analysis revealed that the TAF3 binding sites identified by HIT-seq were significantly enriched at genes involved in cell-cycle control and transcriptional regulation (data not shown). These findings suggest that direct interaction of TAF3 with H3K4me3 facilitates global TFIID recruitment/stabilization at the promoters of actively transcribed genes. Given the propensity for PHD-dependent binding of TAF3/TFIID to cell-cycle control genes, we focused on p53-dependent transcription. We employed a cell-free transcription system (Figure 2A; Figure S2B; An and Roeder, 2004An W. Roeder R.G. Reconstitution and transcriptional analysis of chromatin in vitro.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 377: 460-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to determine how H3K4me3 and H3K4me3-TAF3/TFIID interactions affect transcription initiation. Chromatin was assembled by recombinant factors (Figure S2A) using a pG5ML template (Figure S2C) and reconstituted histone octamers containing either unmodified H3 or the H3K4me3 analog H3Kc4me3 (Figure S2D). Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion showed that both templates are chromatinized equivalently (Figure 2B). Robust transcription from the unmodified template was dependent upon p53 and p300 (Figure 2C, lanes 1–4). In contrast, the H3Kc4me3-modified template showed a significant level of p53-dependent transcription in the absence of p300 (lane 6), likely due to endogenous cofactors in the nuclear extract (NE). This activity was further enhanced (∼7-fold) by ectopic p300 to yield an absolute level of transcription ∼4-fold higher than observed with the unmodified template (lane 8 versus lane 4), and this increase was observed over a range of chromatin assembly conditions (Figure S2E). Importantly, H3Kc4me3 contributed more significantly than H3Kc4me1 and H3Kc4me2 to stimulation of p53-dependent transcription (Figure S2F). These results demonstrate a direct effect of H3K4me3 on p53-dependent transcription.Figure S2Analysis of Purified Factors and Conditions Used for In Vitro Chromatin Assembly, Transcription, and ChIP Assays, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) Analysis of chromatin assembly factors NAP1, TOPO1, ACF1, and ISWI (A) and of p53 and p300 by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining (B).(C) Schematic of the pG5ML template consisting of five p53 binding sites adjacent to the AdML promoter.(D) Analysis of reconstituted histone octamers by Coomassie and immunoblot.(E) Chromatin assembly conditions established by titrating the amount of histone octamer while keeping the pG5ML template concentration unchanged.(F) Relative transcription levels from chromatin assembled with unmodified H3 (me0), H3Kc4me1 (me1), H3Kc4me2 (me2), or H3Kc4me3 (me3).

B2 RNA binds directly to RNA polymerase II to repress transcript synthesis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 822-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To determine whether H3K4me3 enhances transcription by stimulating PIC formation, in vitro ChIP was performed using a purified system (Figure 2D; Figures S2G and S2H). Chromatin was incubated with or without p53, acetylated by p300, digested with MNase, and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against p53, H3, H3K4me3, TAF3, RNAPII, and TBP. The precipitated DNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using primer sets (Figure 2E) that scan both a promoter region (A), containing p53 binding sites, and a distal vector region (B). On the unmodified template, there was selective binding of p53 and selective p53-enhanced binding of TBP, TAF3 (TFIID), and RNAPII to the promoter region (Figure 2F). On the H3Kc4me3 template, we observed (1) comparable p53 binding to the promoter region, (2) a broad distribution of H3Kc4me3 across the template (A and B), and (3) a p53-dependent binding of TFIID and RNAPII to the promoter region. In the presence of p53, the H3Kc4me3 template showed a significant increase in promoter-assembled TFIID and RNAPII relative to the unmodified template (Figure 2F). This H3Kc4me3-dependent increase was detected exclusively at the promoter, despite the uniform distribution of H3Kc4me3—indicative of the importance of the TATA box and promoter-bound p53 in contributing to TFIID stabilization at the promoter. The lack of an effect of H3Kc4me3 on p53 binding also indicates that enhanced TFIID/RNAPII recruitment is not due to an H3Kc4me3-mediated stabilization of p53. Notably, TFIID showed comparable binding to H3 peptides with natural K4me3 versus the Kc4me3 analog (Figure S2I). Together, these results establish a role for H3K4me3 in directing enhanced PIC formation/stabilization. To further investigate the impact of H3K4me3 on the rate of PIC formation and initiation, kinetic transcription analyses were performed with addition of sarkosyl at various times during PIC formation (Figure 2G). Whereas chromatin assembled with H3Kc4me3 supported the assembly of sarkosyl-resistant PICs as early as 30 min (Figure 2H, lane 9), unmodified chromatin was significantly less efficient in assembling a functional PIC, even after 2 hr (lanes 1–5) and despite the fact that this template shows the same sensitivity to sarkosyl (Figure S2J) and directs efficient transcription in the absence of sarkosyl (Figure 2H, lane 6). Because sarkosyl restricts transcription to a single round, a comparison of transcription with and without sarkosyl reveals that once formed, PICs bound to chromatin assembled with H3Kc4me3 or unmodified H3 undergo almost the same number of rounds of transcription (∼7, lane 12 versus lane 11, versus ∼5, lane 6 versus lane 5, respectively). These data are consistent with the in vitro ChIP results that show enhanced TFIID/RNAPII recruitment at the promoter of chromatin templates assembled with H3Kc4me3 versus unmodified H3 (Figure 2F). Also consistent with the sarkosyl results, B2 RNAs (Espinoza et al., 2004Espinoza C.A. Allen T.A. Hieb A.R. Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. B2 RNA binds directly to RNA polymerase II to repress transcript synthesis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 822-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) had little to no effect on transcription from chromatin assembled with H3Kc4me3 as early as 30 min following NTP addition (Figure S2K, lane 9). By comparison, transcription from unmodified chromatin was inhibited in the presence of B2 RNA at all time points (Figure S2K, lanes 1–5). Taken together, these results establish a direct link between an increase in the rate of PIC formation and the stimulation of transcription by H3K4me3. To elucidate the significance of H3K4me3 with respect to TATA-TBP/TFIID interactions, we assessed p53-dependent transcription on chromatin assembled with unmodified H3 or H3Kc4me3 and containing a wild-type (TATAA) or a mutated TATA box (TATGG). Transcription from the unmodified template was reduced 2.5-fold by the TATA mutation (Figure 3A, lane 4 versus lane 2). The enhanced transcription from H3Kc4me3-modified templates also was reduced 2.5-fold by the mutant TATA (Figure 3A, lane 8 versus lane 6), although the residual signal was nonetheless comparable to the signal from chromatin assembled with unmodified H3 and a wild-type TATA (Figure 3A, lane 8 versus lane 2). This indicates that H3K4me3 can partially compensate for the mutant TATA in mediating transcription. Chromatin containing both H3Kc4me3 and a wild-type TATA supported a significantly higher transcription level (Figure 3A, lane 6) than did chromatin that contained only H3Kc4me3 (Figure 3A, lane 8) or a wild-type TATA (Figure 3A, lane 2), which strongly suggests that the TATA box and H3K4me3 cooperate to enhance transcription. To further investigate the role of H3K4me3 with respect to TFIID/TBP-TATA interactions, in vitro ChIP was performed. Mutation of the TATA box caused a significant decrease in TAF3/TFIID and RNAPII binding to both unmodified and H3Kc4me3 templates (Figure 3B). However, the levels of TAF3/TFIID and RNAPII bound to H3Kc4me3-modified chromatin containing a mutant TATA were equal to, or greater than, the levels bound to unmodified chromatin with a wild-type TATA (Figure 3B), showing that H3K4me3 can compensate for the mutant TATA in facilitating GTF/RNAPII recruitment. In addition, the amount of TFIID/RNAPII recruited to chromatin containing both H3Kc4me3 and a wild-type TATA was higher than that recruited to chromatin containing either H3Kc4me3 or a wild-type TATA (Figure 3B). These results parallel the transcription data (Figure 3A) and show that H3K4me3 can support a significant level of PIC assembly and transcription initiation in the presence of a mutant TATA box and that H3K4me3 can cooperate with TATA to enhance PIC assembly and transcription. To determine whether TAF3/TFIID-H3K4me3 interactions mediate the effects of H3K4me3 on p53-dependent transcription, we purified TAF3/TFIID complexes (Figure 4A; Figures S3A and S3B) containing either wild-type or M880A mutant TAF3. As predicted, the WT, but not the mutant, TAF3/TFIID complex binds selectively to K4 trimethylated H3 peptides relative to unmodified H3 peptides (Figure 4B). To assess the transcription activities of the TAF3/TFIID complexes, we immunodepleted endogenous TFIID from HeLa NE (Figure S3C, ΔIID). ΔIID NE was unable to support transcription from naked DNA (Figures S3E and S3F, lanes 3 and 4) or chromatin (Figures 4C and 4D, lanes 3 and 4), whereas mock-depleted NE supported transcription from naked DNA (data not shown) and chromatin (Figure S3D) to levels comparable to those observed with control NE. To examine the rescue potential of the TAF3/TFIID complexes, equivalent amounts of each complex were examined on chromatin containing a wild-type TATA. Both the WT and mutant TAF3/TFIID complexes are equally efficient in restoring transcription to levels comparable to control NE, both on naked DNA (Figure S3E, lanes 6–9 and 11–14 versus lane 2) and on chromatin assembled with unmodified H3 or H3Kc4me3 (Figure 4C, lanes 6–9 and 11–14 versus lane 2).Figure S3Functional Analysis of the TAF3-Containing TFIID Complexes on DNA Templates In Vitro, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Purification scheme for TAF3/TFIID complexes isolated from 293 cells that stably express FLAG-tagged wild-type TAF3 (f-TAF3 WT) or the PHD point mutant (f-TAF3 M880A).(B) Immunoblot analyses of the TAF3/TFIID complexes with the indicated antibodies.(C) Immunoblot analyses of TFIID-depleted nuclear extracts (ΔIID NE) as compared to control (con) and mock (IgG)-depleted nuclear extract.(D) ΔIID NE was unable to support transcription whereas mock-depleted NE support"
https://openalex.org/W2110488158,"Period determination in the mammalian circadian clock involves the turnover rate of the repressors CRY and PER. We show that CRY ubiquitination engages two competing E3 ligase complexes that either lengthen or shorten circadian period in mice. Cloning of a short-period circadian mutant, Past-time, revealed a glycine to glutamate missense mutation in Fbxl21, an F-box protein gene that is a paralog of Fbxl3 that targets the CRY proteins for degradation. While loss of function of FBXL3 leads to period lengthening, mutation of Fbxl21 causes period shortening. FBXL21 forms an SCF E3 ligase complex that slowly degrades CRY in the cytoplasm but antagonizes the stronger E3 ligase activity of FBXL3 in the nucleus. FBXL21 plays a dual role: protecting CRY from FBXL3 degradation in the nucleus and promoting CRY degradation within the cytoplasm. Thus, the balance and cellular compartmentalization of competing E3 ligases for CRY determine circadian period of the clock in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2020879271,"In the mammalian circadian clockwork, CRY1 and CRY2 repressor proteins are regulated by posttranslational modifications for temporally coordinated transcription of clock genes. Previous studies revealed that FBXL3, an F-box-type E3 ligase, ubiquitinates CRYs and mediates their degradation. Here, we found that FBXL21 also ubiquitinates CRYs but counteracts FBXL3. Fbxl21(-/-) mice exhibited normal periodicity of wheel-running rhythms with compromised organization of daily activities, while an extremely long-period phenotype of Fbxl3(-/-) mice was attenuated in Fbxl3/Fbxl21 double-knockout mice. The double knockout destabilized the behavioral rhythms progressively and sometimes elicited arrhythmicity. Surprisingly, FBXL21 stabilized CRYs and antagonized the destabilizing action by FBXL3. Predominantly cytosolic distribution of FBXL21 contrasts with nuclear localization of FBXL3. These results emphasize the physiological importance of antagonizing actions between FBXL21 and FBXL3 on CRYs, and their combined actions at different subcellular locations stabilize oscillation of the circadian clock."
https://openalex.org/W2046285899,"Medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric malignant brain tumor. Although current therapies improve survival, these regimens are highly toxic and are associated with significant morbidity.

Moreover, high expression of PlGF receptor neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) correlates with poor overall survival in patients. We demonstrate that PlGF and Nrp1 are required for the growth and spread of medulloblastoma: PlGF/Nrp1 blockade results in direct antitumor effects in vivo, resulting in medulloblastoma regression, decreased metastasis, and increased mouse survival. We reveal that PlGF is produced in the cerebellar stroma via tumor-derived Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and show that PlGF acts through Nrp1—and not vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1—to promote tumor cell survival.

Ohgaki H. Wiestler O.D. Cavenee W.K. World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System. IARC Press, Lyon2007Google Scholar). The standard of care includes initial surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Despite high survival rates with current regimens, patients encounter devastating morbidity, including decline in cognition and intellect (Fouladi et al., 2005Fouladi M. Gilger E. Kocak M. Wallace D. Buchanan G. Reeves C. Robbins N. Merchant T. Kun L.E. Khan R. et al.Intellectual and functional outcome of children 3 years old or younger who have CNS malignancies.J. Clin.

Tucker M.A. Second cancers after medulloblastoma: population-based results from the United States and Sweden.Cancer Causes Control. 1997; 8: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapies that reduce the significant morbidity associated with current treatments. Medulloblastomas can be classified into at least four distinct molecular groups, suggesting the possibility of developing targeted therapies directed against key drivers (Northcott et al., 2012Northcott P.A. Jones D.T. Kool M. Robinson G.W. Gilbertson R.J. Cho Y.J. Pomeroy S.L. Korshunov A. Lichter P. Taylor M.D. Pfister S.M. Medulloblastomics: the end of the beginning.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 818-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). For example, therapy targeting Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, a driver of one genetic subset of medulloblastomas, showed promising results initially (Rudin et al., 2009Rudin C.M. Hann C.L. Laterra J. Yauch R.L. Callahan C.A. Fu L. Holcomb T. Stinson J. Gould S.E. Coleman B. et al.Treatment of medulloblastoma with hedgehog pathway inhibitor GDC-0449.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). However, tumors rapidly developed resistance mutations (Yauch et al., 2009Yauch R.L. Dijkgraaf G.J. Alicke B. Januario T.

Tang T. et al.Smoothened mutation confers resistance to a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor in medulloblastoma.Science. 2009; 326: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), thus emphasizing the importance of alternative targeted treatment strategies. Targeting tumor-stroma interactions could provide an alternative targeting strategy, given the critical role of the tumor microenvironment in cancer progression and greater genetic stability of the stromal compartment (Carmeliet and Jain, 2011Carmeliet P.

Placental growth factor (PlGF) is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and is involved in bone marrow-derived cell activation, endothelial stimulation, pathologic angiogenesis, and wound healing (Carmeliet et al., 2001Carmeliet P.

Whereas in some models, PlGF promotes tumor growth (Schmidt et al., 2011Schmidt T. Kharabi Masouleh B. Loges S. Cauwenberghs S. Fraisl P. Maes C. Jonckx B. De Keersmaecker K. Kleppe M.

PlGF is mitogenic and proangiogenic (Ziche et al., 1997Ziche M. Maglione D. Ribatti D. Morbidelli L. Lago C.T. Battisti M. Paoletti I. Barra A. Tucci M. Parise G. et al.Placenta growth factor-1 is chemotactic, mitogenic, and angiogenic.Laboratory Investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology. 1997; 76: 517-531PubMed Google Scholar), and blockade of PlGF has resulted in antiangiogenic and antitumor effects in some models (Fischer et al., 2007Fischer C.

Wu X. Yao J. Yang S. Crawford Y. McCutcheon K. Tan C. Kolumam G. Vernes J.M. Eastham-Anderson J. et al.PlGF blockade does not inhibit angiogenesis during primary tumor growth.Cell. 2010; 141: 166-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1), the only known tyrosine kinase receptor for PlGF, was shown to be required for certain tumors that respond to anti-PlGF therapy (Yao et al., 2011Yao J. Wu X. Zhuang G. Kasman I.M. Vogt T. Phan V. Shibuya M. Ferrara N. Bais C. Expression of a functional VEGFR-1 in tumor cells is a major determinant of anti-PlGF antibodies efficacy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 11590-11595Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, direct inhibition of VEGFR1 activity did not explain anti-PlGF effects in other models (Casanovas et al., 2005Casanovas O. Hicklin D.J. Bergers G. Hanahan D.

Duda D.G. Fukumura D. Jain R.K. VEGFR1-activity-independent metastasis formation.Nature. 2009; 461: E4Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting an alternative signaling mechanism for PlGF independent of VEGFR1. Because PlGF is dispensable during development, we proposed anti-PlGF as a therapeutic approach for pediatric tumors (Jain and Xu, 2007Jain R.K. Xu L. alphaPlGF: a new kid on the antiangiogenesis block.Cell. 2007; 131: 443-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that PlGF is necessary for medulloblastoma growth, irrespective of genetic background. We found that PlGF is produced by the cerebellar stroma in response to Shh ligand secreted by tumor cells. We also found that in medulloblastoma, PlGF signaling via Nrp1 and not VEGFR1 directly conveys prosurvival signals and that Nrp1 expression correlated with poor overall survival. Together with the reported minimal side effects of anti-PlGF blockade (Fischer et al., 2007Fischer C. Jonckx B. Mazzone M. Zacchigna S. Loges S. Pattarini L. Chorianopoulos E. Liesenborghs L. Koch M. De Mol M. et al.Anti-PlGF inhibits growth of VEGF(R)-inhibitor-resistant tumors without affecting healthy vessels.Cell. 2007; 131: 463-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar; Lassen et al., 2012Lassen U.

Cancer. 2012; 106: 678-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), these findings identify PlGF and Nrp1 as potential targets for therapy of pediatric medulloblastoma. By immunohistochemistry (IHC), we found that PlGF is expressed in a variety of brain tumors of children and adults, including medulloblastoma, ependymoma, atypical teratoid, rhabdoid tumor, and glioblastoma (Figures 1A and 1C). We compared expression of angiogenic and vascular remodeling factors in pediatric medulloblastomas (n = 5) against normal pediatric cerebella (n = 2; 3 and 5 years of age) and normal adult cerebella (n = 4; all >60 years of age). We found a marked overexpression of PlGF (14-fold) and Nrp1 (11-fold) in tumor tissues. VEGF receptors were either slightly upregulated (VEGFR2/KDR; 2-fold) or modestly downregulated (VEGFR1/FLT1; 2.6-fold) (Figure 1B; Table S1 available online). The patterns of gene expression in medulloblastoma and immature brain were quite similar, suggesting that factors active during cerebellar development may also be activated in pediatric brain tumors. We analyzed 32 clinical samples of different medulloblastoma subtypes by IHC. Of these tumors, ∼90% (29 in 32) diffusely expressed PlGF (Figures 1C and 1D) across all World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes (Louis et al., 2007Louis D.N. Ohgaki H. Wiestler O.D. Cavenee W.K. World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System. IARC Press, Lyon2007Google Scholar) and all main molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma, with the lowest expression in the Wnt group (Figure 1D). Although both PlGF receptors were expressed, Nrp1 expression was more striking than VEGFR1 (Figures 1C and S1A). Analysis of publicly available copy number data (Tumorscape, Broad Institute) showed ∼13% of medulloblastomas with gains of the chromosomal region containing PlGF (Figure S1B), suggesting one direct genetic mechanism of PlGF upregulation. Taken together, our data show that PlGF is present in the majority of human medulloblastomas and is not associated with any particular subtype. Mice with D283-MED and D341-MED human medulloblastoma xenografts exhibited clinical symptoms (CS) in a period of 3 to 4 weeks from implantation and showed a similar profile to clinical samples (Figures 1C and S1C). Using the same classification methods (Taylor et al., 2012Taylor M.D. Northcott P.A. Korshunov A. Remke M. Cho Y.J. Clifford S.C. Eberhart C.G. Parsons D.W. Rutkowski S. Gajjar A. et al.Molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma: the current consensus.Acta Neuropathol. 2012; 123: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar), D341-MED were classified as Group 3 and D283-MED as Group 4 medulloblastoma, respectively (Figure 1D). These tumors grew rapidly and spread along the spinal cord via cerebrospinal fluid (Figure 2A), closely resembling the clinical behavior of human medulloblastoma. We treated established tumors with TB403, a dual blocking antibody for human and murine PlGF from Roche (Nielsen and Sengeløv, 2012Nielsen D.L. Sengeløv L. Inhibition of placenta growth factor with TB-403: a novel antiangiogenic cancer therapy.Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2012; 12: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). TB403 (αPlGF [R]) treatment led to inhibition of primary tumor growth and spinal metastasis (Figures 2A, 2B, and S1D). Anti-PlGF-treated mice survived significantly longer both in the D283-MED (p < 0.0001, 60% no CS) and D341-MED (p < 0.0001, 70% no CS) models (Figure 2C). We also tested the effects of another dual anti-human/murine anti-PlGF antibody (Ab), C9.V2 from Genentech (Bais et al., 2010Bais C. Wu X. Yao J. Yang S. Crawford Y. McCutcheon K. Tan C. Kolumam G. Vernes J.M. Eastham-Anderson J. et al.PlGF blockade does not inhibit angiogenesis during primary tumor growth.Cell. 2010; 141: 166-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). C9.V2 (αPlGF [G])-treated D283-MED-bearing mice showed a significant survival increase (Figure 2C) and a delay in tumor growth, although not tumor regression (Figure S1E). We next evaluated the effect of anti-PlGF blockade in Smo/Smo transgenic mice (Hatton et al., 2008Hatton B.A. Villavicencio E.H. Tsuchiya K.D. Pritchard J.I. Ditzler S. Pullar B. Hansen S. Knoblaugh S.E. Lee D. Eberhart C.G. et al.The Smo/Smo model: hedgehog-induced medulloblastoma with 90% incidence and leptomeningeal spread.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1768-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis of medulloblastomas from Smo/Smo mice—representative of the Shh subgroup of tumors—showed expression of PlGF and Nrp1 (Figure 1C). When Smo/Smo mice reached 6–8 weeks of age, we treated with the murine specific anti-PlGF antibody 5D11D4 (Fischer et al., 2007Fischer C. Jonckx B. Mazzone M. Zacchigna S. Loges S. Pattarini L. Chorianopoulos E. Liesenborghs L. Koch M. De Mol M. et al.Anti-PlGF inhibits growth of VEGF(R)-inhibitor-resistant tumors without affecting healthy vessels.Cell. 2007; 131: 463-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) or C9.V2 for 3 weeks. Anti-PlGF-treated mice had significantly smaller tumors and less body weight loss (body weight 29.4 g versus 23.1 g, p = 0.0044) and did not show a hunched posture seen in control-treated mice (Figures 2D and 2E). Furthermore, PlGF levels in Smo/Smo mice with established medulloblastoma were dramatically increased compared to wild-type mice (Figure S1F). Together, these data indicate that PlGF contributes to the progression of medulloblastoma and can be targeted by a number of different anti-PlGF antibodies. We found that circulating murine (m)PlGF levels were highest in younger mice and that the medulloblastoma growth was enhanced in younger mice (Figures S1G and S1H). Further, growth of untreated D283-MED tumors was accompanied by a significant increase in tumor-derived human (h)PlGF in the cerebellum and in the blood (Figure 3A). The levels of stromal murine PlGF (mPlGF) also increased with time and, by 5 weeks, contributed to about 80% of the total blood PlGF concentration (mPlGF = 15 pg/ml; human PlGF [hPlGF] = 3 pg/ml). Implantation of D283-MED with hPlGF silenced (Figures S1I and S1J) resulted in significant delays in tumor growth and spinal cord spread and increased survival (Figures 3B and 3D). These tumors also induced substantially lower levels of host stromal mPlGF secretion (Figure 3A). Thus, initial production of hPlGF by the tumor cells appeared critical for the initial growth of the tumors and stimulation of stromal mPlGF production. Re-expression of PlGF2 in a PlGF small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-3′ UTR construct in D283-MED cells (Figure S1I) rescued rapid tumor growth and short survival phenotype (Figures 3B and 3D). To determine the importance of stromal PlGF, we blocked mPlGF with 5D11D4 either starting at day one after tumor implantation (prevention) or starting at day 21 when tumors produced CS (intervention). Mice treated from day one had significantly lower tumor burden, no spinal spread, and increased average overall survival (p < 0.0001) (Figure 3C), similar to mice with tumors that had genetically silenced PlGF (62.5% no CS in both PlGF-inhibited groups, Figure 3D). Mice treated from day 21 showed significant reduction in the size of primary tumors and in the average number of spinal metastases per mouse (2.0 versus 5.0, p < 0.001) (Figure 3E) and prolonged survival (p < 0.0001, 60% no CS) (Figures 3C and 3D). There was a small additional effect of TB403 (which blocks both hPlGF and mPlGF) compared to 5D11D4 (which only blocks mPlGF) (Figure S1K). We then implanted Smo/Smo medulloblastoma tumors in the cerebellum of syngeneic plgf−/− mice. We found a significantly lower tumor take rate, delayed growth, and increased survival in the plgf−/− mice compared to the wild-type controls (2/10 versus 11/11; Figures 4A and S2A). Overall, our results indicate that medulloblastoma tumor cells secrete PlGF but that a substantial proportion of PlGF is derived from the stroma and medulloblastoma growth requires stromal PlGF. We investigated stromal production of PlGF and examined the role of Shh, a key driver of tumorigenesis in medulloblastoma. Tumor-derived Shh ligands were shown to sustain tumorigenesis by signaling activation in the stromal compartment (Walter et al., 2010Walter K. Omura N. Hong S.M. Griffith M. Vincent A. Borges M. Goggins M. Overexpression of smoothened activates the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts.Clin. Cancer Res. 2010; 16: 1781-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). D283-MED and D341-MED medulloblastoma models secreted Shh ligands (Figure S2B), despite absence of genetic changes in Shh pathway. For stroma, we isolated cerebellar glial and external granule layer cells, neither of which produced a significant amount of basal Shh or PlGF (Figures 4B, 4C, and S2C). Stimulation with Shh induced a dose-dependent secretion of PlGF by granule cells but had no detectable effect on glial cells (Figure 4B). Stimulation of Wnt pathway, which is also involved in normal cerebellum development (Pei et al., 2012Pei Y. Brun S.N. Markant S.L. Lento W. Gibson P. Taketo M.M. Giovannini M. Gilbertson R.J. Wechsler-Reya R.J. WNT signaling increases proliferation and impairs differentiation of stem cells in the developing cerebellum.Development. 2012; 139: 1724-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), by Wnt-3a or Wnt-7a proteins did not induce PlGF secretion (Figure S2D). Medulloblastoma cells were unresponsive to Shh stimuli, perhaps due to high basal levels of endogenous PlGF in vitro (Figure S2E). In cocultures of isolated mouse granule cells and D341-MED cells, the secreted levels of Shh increased in a time-dependent manner and correlated with increased secretion of mPlGF (Figure 4C). Treatment with the Shh inhibitor cyclopamine led to a significant decrease in circulating mPlGF levels in mice bearing D283-MED (Figure 4D). In addition, we found that medulloblastoma-bearing mice treated with anti-mPlGF therapy had increased circulating hPlGF (Figure 4E), whereas tumors decreased in size (Figure 3C). These tumors also showed upregulated expression of Shh and its effector Gli1 (Figure 4F). Collectively, these data suggest that medulloblastoma co-opts the stroma to produce PlGF through paracrine Shh signaling, possibly through activation of Gli1. Furthermore, the tumor responds to a dramatic drop in stromal PlGF levels by secreting Shh, upregulating Gli1, and increasing tumor cell production of PlGF as a compensatory mechanism (Figures 3A and 4E). We downregulated Shh with shRNA in tumor cells (D283-shSHH tumors) and showed significant growth delay and significant increase in survival (p < 0.001, Figures 4G and 4H). PlGF regulates the angiogenic switch, and anti-PlGF therapy can inhibit angiogenesis in some tumor models (Fischer et al., 2007Fischer C. Jonckx B. Mazzone M. Zacchigna S. Loges S. Pattarini L.

We analyzed changes in TAMs in medulloblastoma after PlGF blockade. Medulloblastomas had a very small number of TAMs at baseline, and anti-PlGF therapy did not significantly change the TAM recruitment or polarization (Figure S3B). Thus, the effects of anti-PlGF therapy on angiogenesis and TAMs are unlikely to mediate the dramatic tumor reduction measured by optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) (Figures 5C and 5D). We next sought to determine whether PlGF has direct effects on medulloblastoma cells. We stimulated D283-MED and D341-MED cells with recombinant hPlGF (rhPlGF) and Smo/Smo medulloblastoma cells isolated from transgenic mice with recombinant mPlGF and evaluated the activation of canonical survival pathways. Stimulation with PlGF induced marked phosphorylation of the prosurvival/progrowth factor ERK1/2 in all medulloblastoma lines as well as activation of PI3K/Akt in the Smo/Smo cells (Figures 6A, S4A, and S4B). We used the MEK inhibitor U0126 to block ERK activation and to test whether maintenance of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is essential for medulloblastoma viability. We found that treatment with U0126 induced a rapid decrease in medulloblastoma cell viability (Figure S4C).Figure S4Role of PlGF/Nrp1/MAPK Signaling in Viability of Medulloblastoma, Related to Figure 6Show full caption(A) Quantification of western blot band intensity for PlGF stimulation and anti-PlGF and anti-Nrp1 inhibition on pErk1/2 and pAkt in medulloblastoma cells.(B) Phosphorylation of Erk1/2 after PlGF stimulation is also observed in D283 shPlGF cells.

https://openalex.org/W1967904525,"Endosomal protein trafficking is an essential cellular process that is deregulated in several diseases and targeted by pathogens. Here, we describe a role for ubiquitination in this process. We find that the E3 RING ubiquitin ligase, MAGE-L2-TRIM27, localizes to endosomes through interactions with the retromer complex. Knockdown of MAGE-L2-TRIM27 or the Ube2O E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme significantly impaired retromer-mediated transport. We further demonstrate that MAGE-L2-TRIM27 ubiquitin ligase activity is required for nucleation of endosomal F-actin by the WASH regulatory complex, a known regulator of retromer-mediated transport. Mechanistic studies showed that MAGE-L2-TRIM27 facilitates K63-linked ubiquitination of WASH K220. Significantly, disruption of WASH ubiquitination impaired endosomal F-actin nucleation and retromer-dependent transport. These findings provide a cellular and molecular function for MAGE-L2-TRIM27 in retrograde transport, including an unappreciated role of K63-linked ubiquitination and identification of an activating signal of the WASH regulatory complex."

Data from rare male patients suggest symptom onset and severity can be influenced by the location of the mutation, with amino acids 270 and 273 marking the difference between neonatal encephalopathy and death, on the one hand, and survival with deficits on the other. We therefore generated two mouse models expressing either MeCP2-R270X or MeCP2-G273X. The mice developed phenotypes at strikingly different rates and showed differential ATRX nuclear localization within the nervous system, over time, coinciding with phenotypic progression. We discovered that MeCP2 contains three AT-hook-like domains over a stretch of 250 amino acids, like HMGA DNA-bending proteins; one conserved AT-hook is disrupted in MeCP2-R270X, lending further support to the notion that one of MeCP2’s key functions is to alter chromatin structure."

The rare groups of bacteria that lack a wall (e.g., mycoplasma) have probably lost the structure retrospectively. Therefore, the wall was probably present in the last common ancestor of the bacteria, perhaps in the earliest forms of cellular life. Many genes required to make the precursors for cell wall synthesis and assemble them into the meshwork of the growing wall are normally essential for cell viability. This explains why the wall is also such an important target for antibiotics, such as β-lactams and glycopeptides. In light of the pivotal importance of the wall, it is intriguing that many bacteria are capable of switching into a wall-deficient, or “L-form,” state (Allan et al., 2009Allan E.J. Hoischen C. Gumpert J. Bacterial L-forms.Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2009; 68: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Most classically described L-forms were identified as antibiotic-resistant or persistent organisms isolated in association with a wide range of infectious diseases (Domingue and Woody, 1997Domingue Sr., G.J. Woody H.B. Bacterial persistence and expression of disease.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 320-344PubMed Google Scholar). Under laboratory conditions, the production of stable L-forms usually requires the inhibition of cell wall synthesis with appropriate antibiotics and long-term passage on osmotically supportive medium to prevent cell lysis (Allan, 1991Allan E.J. Induction and cultivation of a stable L-form of Bacillus subtilis.J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1991; 70: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar; Leaver et al., 2009Leaver M. Domínguez-Cuevas P. Coxhead J.M. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Life without a wall or division machine in Bacillus subtilis.Nature. 2009; 457: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It has long been known that one or more genetic changes from their parent strain are needed for the formation and/or proliferation of stable L-forms (Allan et al., 2009Allan E.J. Hoischen C. Gumpert J. Bacterial L-forms.Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2009; 68: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although mutations acquired by L-forms of several organisms have recently been identified by genome sequencing (Briers et al., 2012aBriers Y. Staubli T. Schmid M.C. Wagner M. Schuppler M.

Lett. 2006; 258: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), precisely how they contribute to the L-form state remains poorly understood. The L-form transition results in dramatic changes in cell physiology and morphology because wall synthesis represents a major drain on cellular resources and the wall is essential in determining cell shape. However, the most dramatic change in cell function recognized so far lies in the mode of L-form proliferation. Almost all bacterial cells use a tubulin homolog, FtsZ, to organize a highly ordered ring structure at the site of cell division. This “Z-ring” then recruits about ten other essential division factors, which together drive invagination of a division septum, infill this with new PG, and then organize the orderly separation of the daughter cells (Adams and Errington, 2009Adams D.W. Errington J. Bacterial cell division: assembly, maintenance and disassembly of the Z ring.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar; Margolin, 2005Margolin W. FtsZ and the division of prokaryotic cells and organelles.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 862-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Remarkably, in L-forms, at least in the model system we have developed, this intricate division machinery becomes completely dispensable (Leaver et al., 2009Leaver M. Domínguez-Cuevas P. Coxhead J.M. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Life without a wall or division machine in Bacillus subtilis.Nature. 2009; 457: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the finding that L-forms divide not by the precise FtsZ-ring constriction mechanism but by a range of rather poorly regulated shape perturbations, including blebbing, tabulation, and vesiculation (Dell’Era et al., 2009Dell’Era S. Buchrieser C. Couvé E. Schnell B. Briers Y. Schuppler M. Loessner M.J. Listeria monocytogenes L-forms respond to cell wall deficiency by modifying gene expression and the mode of division.Mol.

We recently developed a tractable system for studying the cell biology and genetics of L-forms in Bacillus subtilis (Domínguez-Cuevas et al., 2012Domínguez-Cuevas P. Mercier R. Leaver M. Kawai Y. Errington J. The rod to L-form transition of Bacillus subtilis is limited by a requirement for the protoplast to escape from the cell wall sacculus.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 83: 52-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and used this system to look for genes required specifically for L-form growth (Mercier et al., 2012Mercier R. Domínguez-Cuevas P. Errington J. Crucial role for membrane fluidity in proliferation of primitive cells.Cell Rep. 2012; 1: 417-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We found no evidence for involvement of cytoskeletal proteins in L-form proliferation but instead identified the synthesis of certain branched chain fatty acids as being critical for a late step in separation of progeny cells (scission), suggesting that the precise biophysical properties of the membrane have a crucial role in the proliferation of L-forms. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms driving cell division and proliferation of B. subtilis L-forms by isolating and studying the effects of mutations that allow cells to proliferate in the L-form state. We find that the key change lies in production of excess membrane by overactivation of the fatty acid synthetic system. This is sufficient to induce shape modulations that progress to scission of progeny cells. Furthermore, artificially increasing the surface area in protoplasts of wild-type cells generates spontaneous L-form-like shape changes and division. Our results suggest that the division of L-forms is likely due simply to an imbalance between membrane surface area and cellular volume. The findings accord with previous theoretical and in vitro studies of membrane vesicle reproduction aimed at understanding the possible replicative mechanisms of primitive cells (Bozic and Svetina, 2007Bozic B.

Coupled growth and division of model protocell membranes.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 5705-5713Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We previously showed that repression of the PG precursor pathway using a repressible Pxyl-murE-B construct, together with a single point mutation of the ispA gene encoding a polyisoprenoid synthase, results in L-form growth of B. subtilis 168 (Leaver et al., 2009Leaver M. Domínguez-Cuevas P. Coxhead J.M. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Life without a wall or division machine in Bacillus subtilis.Nature. 2009; 457: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, complementation of the ispA mutation prevented L-form growth in a similar strain (Figure S1A available online). We also built a strain with Pxyl-murE-B and a repressible allele of ispA and showed that this strain also grew well in the L-form state when both promoters were repressed (Figure S1B). Investigations of L-form phenotypes are complicated by several factors: (1) the heterogeneity of the population in terms of cell shape and size; (2) strong selection for compensating mutations that enhance the growth rate or cell stability; and (3) requirement for “escape” mutations that facilitate the emergence of L-forms from a population of rods (Domínguez-Cuevas et al., 2012Domínguez-Cuevas P. Mercier R. Leaver M. Kawai Y. Errington J. The rod to L-form transition of Bacillus subtilis is limited by a requirement for the protoplast to escape from the cell wall sacculus.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 83: 52-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To help assess the effects of the different mutations (e.g., repressible ispA and Pxyl-murE-B) on L-form growth, we developed a protocol in which cells of a defined genotype were grown in the rod state, then converted to protoplasts by stripping the cell wall with lysozyme and cultured in our standard L-form medium. The medium contains an osmoprotectant (sucrose) and an inhibitor of cell division (benzamide; Adams et al., 2011Adams D.W. Wu L.J. Czaplewski L.G. Errington J. Multiple effects of benzamide antibiotics on FtsZ function.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 80: 68-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that efficiently kills rods, but not L-forms. For reasons that are not understood, reversion of protoplasts or L-forms to the walled state (regeneration) occurs at a very low frequency, even if they are capable of synthesizing wall material. Benzamide is added to prevent the rare regenerated rods, which grow much more rapidly than L-forms, from overrunning the cultures. Figure 1A (and Movie S1A) shows the transition from protoplasts to proliferating L-forms for strain LR2 (ispA Pxyl-murE-B). In contrast, wild-type cells or ispA mutant cells showed only a slow increase in size over many hours (Figure 1B; Movie S1B). Remarkably, even though they showed very little growth and no detectable division, the cells remained intact for many days under these conditions (data not shown). In contrast, after a limited amount of growth, the Pxyl-murE-B protoplasts frequently initiated L-form-like pulsating shape changes but the cells then lysed. Figure 1C shows a detailed time lapse (from Movie S1C) of a small group of cells over a period of 395 min in L-form medium. Hashes point to the remains of cells that had undergone lysis at some point after the preceding frame. Arrowheads point to these cells in previous frames during which they exhibited L-form-like shape changes. An asterisk highlights one cell that successfully produced at least one smaller progeny cell (Figure 1C, 395 min). It was evident from these and similar time lapses that these cells are capable of initiating L-form-like shape perturbations and occasionally producing progeny cells, but they do not undergo prolonged proliferative increase because the shape changes are almost always a prelude to cell lysis.Figure 1Effects of ispA and murE-B Mutations on L-Form GrowthShow full caption(A–C) Strains LR2 (ispA Pxyl-murE-B; A), 168CA (wild-type; B), and Bs115 (Pxyl-murE-B; C) were grown in the walled state then converted to protoplasts, incubated in L-form-supporting medium (NB/MSM, no xylose) with benzamide (FtsZ inhibitor), and observed by time-lapse phase contrast microscopy.

See also Figure S1 and Movie S1. In work to be presented elsewhere, we show that the ispA mutation can be substituted by mutations in many genes on different metabolic pathways, albeit generally giving less rapid culture growth than ispA (Y.K., R.M., and J.E., unpublished data). We do not yet understand the role of this mutational pathway, although it presumably works at least in part to prevent the cell lysis described for the Pxyl-murE-B construct and thereby increase the frequency of successful cell division events. In the remainder of this paper, we focus on the Pxyl-murE-B effect. In the original experiments of Leaver et al., 2009Leaver M. Domínguez-Cuevas P. Coxhead J.M. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Life without a wall or division machine in Bacillus subtilis.Nature. 2009; 457: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, we used the Pxyl-murE-B construct to repress PG precursor synthesis so as to provide an efficient means of converting cells to a wall-deficient state from which growing L-form variants could be isolated. However, the experiments illustrated in Figure 2 show that repression of PG synthesis is required continuously for the efficient growth of L-form cells (in the presence of a lysis-suppressing mutation, in this case, ispA). As shown in Figure 2A, repression of the murE-B operon allowed vigorous L-form growth, whereas growth was abolished in the presence of inducer. Figure 2B shows that repression of two other genes in the PG precursor pathway, murC or dal, also allowed L-form growth. We wished to test whether inhibition of PG precursor synthesis together with an ispA (or equivalent) mutation was the only way to generate efficient L-form growth. We took advantage of an improved selection regimen (see Experimental Procedures) to attempt to isolate L-form mutants in a single step, starting from wild-type cells. We succeeded in isolating one such mutant. Genome sequencing revealed that the mutation responsible was an 18 kbp deletion. This deletion removed the murC gene, together with 17 other coding regions (Figure 2C). We reconstructed the 18 kbp deletion in the presence of an isopropylthio-β-galactoside (IPTG)-inducible ectopic copy of murC on a plasmid (strain RM121) and showed that murC is the only essential gene in the deletion (Figure 2D). We then confirmed the ability of this strain to grow as an L-form (Figure 2E). Although we have not fully analyzed this mutant in detail, we assume that deletion of murC blocks the PG precursor pathway in a manner similar to depleting MurE-B and that one or more of the nearby deleted genes operates like an ispA mutation. Thus, L-form growth under the conditions we use probably requires at least two mutations, and it appeared important that a least one of the mutations blocks the PG precursor pathway. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the PG precursor effect, we attempted to isolate L-form-promoting mutations that do not affect the PG precursor pathway. Because mutations blocking this pathway, such as deletion of murC, prevent L-forms from reverting to the walled state, we screened for L-form variants that retained the ability to grow as rods (see Experimental Procedures). We started with cells containing an ispA mutation to eliminate the need for two mutational events. Revertable mutants were rare but, as shown in Figure 3, we isolated one such mutant, which was able to grow in the walled state, irrespective of the presence or absence of the ispA mutation (Figure 3C), and which grew in the L-form state, in the presence of the ispA mutation (Figure 3B and 3D; Movie S2). Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the mutant strain RM84 had a single point mutation (accDA∗) (Figure 3A) in the 5′UTR of the operon containing the genes accD and accA, which together encode the carboxyltransferase subunit of acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (Cronan and Waldrop, 2002Cronan Jr., J.E. Waldrop G.L. Multi-subunit acetyl-CoA carboxylases.Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 407-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Because the mutation lay in an inverted repeat just upstream of the accDA coding region, it is possible that it works by altering the rate of AccDA synthesis. We tested this possibility by making an accA-his fusion gene. Figure 3E shows that the concentration of AccA-His was substantially raised in the presence of the accDA∗ mutation (lane 4) and that this was not affected by presence or absence of an ispA mutation (lanes 2 and 3). As expected, no signal was seen in the absence of the his tag (lane 1). FtsZ was used as an internal control, and its concentration was not affected by any of the mutations (Figure 3E). To test whether overexpression of AccDA was responsible for the L-form growth phenotype, we constructed a strain carrying an extra copy of accDA under the control of xylose-inducible promoter (Pxyl) at the ectopic amyE locus. We then tested the ability of various protoplasts to grow in L-form medium. As shown in Figure 3F, accDA overexpression did indeed induce L-form proliferation in the presence of ispA mutation. Figure 3G shows that the rate of growth was dependent on the level of induction of the ectopic copy of accDA. In addition, in cells overexpressing AccDA in a wild-type background, time-lapse microscopy revealed shape changes and lysis similar to those observed following PG precursor gene repression (Movie S3). In the presence of the ispA mutation, the process of L-form proliferation was also similar to that observed for repression of PG precursor synthesis (Figures 3H and 3I) (Leaver et al., 2009Leaver M.

These results demonstrated that accDA overexpression supports L-form growth in much the same way as inhibition of PG precursor synthesis. Control experiments showed that L-form growth was not promoted by overexpression of either gene separately or by overexpression of the accBC operon, encoding the biotin carboxylase subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (data not shown). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, comprising biotin carboxylase (AccBC) and carboxyltransferase (AccDA), carries out the first committed step of fatty acid synthesis: the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA (Cronan and Waldrop, 2002Cronan Jr., J.E. Waldrop G.L. Multi-subunit acetyl-CoA carboxylases.Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 407-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In bacteria, fatty acids are synthesized by a repeated cycle of reactions catalyzed by the fatty acid synthase type II enzyme (FAS II) system (Figure 4A) (Rock and Cronan, 1996Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Escherichia coli as a model for the regulation of dissociable (type II) fatty acid biosynthesis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The first enzyme in the pathway, FabD, converts malonyl-CoA to malonyl-ACP, the key substrate for the initiation and elongation cycles (Figure 4A) (Rock and Cronan, 1996Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Escherichia coli as a model for the regulation of dissociable (type II) fatty acid biosynthesis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The later steps of the FAS II cycle are carried out by proteins, almost all of which are transcriptionally regulated by the FapR repressor in B. subtilis (Figure 4A) (Schujman et al., 2003Schujman G.E.

Cell. 2003; 4: 663-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Binding of malonyl-CoA to FapR prevents binding of FapR to its target sequences, thereby inducing expression of the fapR regulon (Schujman et al., 2003Schujman G.E. Paoletti L.

Therefore, malonyl-CoA is not only an essential molecular intermediate in the FAS II system but it also plays a key role as a signaling molecule regulating FapR activity to control the synthesis of FAS II components. It seemed possible that overproduction of AccDA might increase the intracellular levels of malonyl-CoA, which would in turn increase the expression of FAS II genes via relief of FapR repression. To test this possibility, we first examined the effect of AccDA overproduction on expression of the FapR regulon using quantitative PCR (qPCR). As shown in Figure 4B, the expression of various genes in the FapR regulon (but notably not plsY, an example of a downstream gene not regulated by FapR) was significantly induced by the overproduction of AccDA. To further investigate the role of FapR, we made a Pxyl-fapR fusion placed at the amyE locus. Xylose-induced ectopic expression of fapR strongly inhibited cell viability (normal walled cells), presumably due to the repression of FAS II components (Figure 4C, left). However, when AccDA was simultaneously overproduced (via an IPTG-inducible construct), the lethality was suppressed (Figure 4C, middle), consistent with increased malonyl-CoA levels relieving the FapR repression. We then made a fapR point mutant encoding a protein, FapRR106A, with greatly decreased affinity for malonyl-CoA but normal DNA binding activity (Schujman et al., 2006Schujman G.E. Guerin M. Buschiazzo A. Schaeffer F. Llarrull L.I. Reh G. Vila A.J. Alzari P.M. de Mendoza D. Structural basis of lipid biosynthesis regulation in Gram-positive bacteria.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4074-4083Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Synthesis of FapRR106A inhibited cell viability similarly to wild-type FapR, but in this case the growth defect was not suppressed by AccDA overproduction (Figure 4C, right). These results were consistent with the notion that overproduction of AccDA results in increased levels of malonyl-CoA and that this in turn leads to enhanced FAS II activity via the lifting of FapR repression. To test whether overexpression of the fapR regulon was the reason why the overproduction of AccDA promoted L-form growth, we examined the effects of a deletion of fapR on protoplast growth. Figure 4D shows that various genes in the fapR regulon (but not plsY) were, as expected, highly induced in the ΔfapR mutant. However, this did not allow protoplasts to grow as L-forms, either in the presence or absence of an ispA mutation (Figure 4E). In contrast, L-form growth occurred normally and independent of fapR status in cells overproducing AccDA (Figure 4E). During the course of above experiments, we found that the ectopic overexpression of AccDA (amyE::Pxyl-accDA) that supported L-form growth was lethal in the walled state in both wild-type and ispA mutant backgrounds (Figures 4F and S2A). In liquid medium, lethality was manifested by culture lysis in the late exponential or early stationary phase (Figures S2B and S2C). These phenotypic effects were again specific for AccDA overproduction and were not seen in the cells overexpressing AccA, AccD, or AccBC (Figure S2D). We wondered whether the lytic phenotype and potentially also the L-form growth capability might be due to excessive fatty acid and/or membrane lipid synthesis. If so, both phenotypes should be dependent on activity of the various FAS II enzymes. We inserted an IPTG-dependent promoter in front of several genes encoding FAS II enzymes. As shown in Figures 4G and S2E, at low levels of IPTG all three constructs supported growth in the walled state on plates, despite the normally lethal effects of AccDA overproduction, presumably due to the reduction in fatty acid synthesis. Indeed, suppression was obtained for the plsX and fabD constructs even at saturating levels of IPTG (data not shown), suggesting that high levels of their protein products are required for the lethal effect. In the case of the fabHA construct, suppression of lethality was only seen in the fully repressed (no-IPTG) state. Note that the plsX and fabD strains failed to grow at zero IPTG because fatty acid synthesis is of course an essential process in all cells. In contrast, fabHA repression was not lethal because it is partially redundant to the fabHB gene (Choi et al., 2000Choi K.H. Heath R.J. Rock C.O. beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III (FabH) is a determining factor in branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In a complementary experiment, we took advantage of the antibiotic cerulenin, which is a specific inhibitor of FabF (Figure 4A) (Moche et al., 1999Moche M. Schneider G. Edwards P. Dehesh K. Lindqvist Y. Structure of the complex between the antibiotic cerulenin and its target, beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6031-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure S2F, the growth inhibition of walled cells caused by overproduction of AccDA was rescued in the presence of sub-MIC levels of cerulenin, which did not affect growth of the wild-type strain. We then examined the effects of FAS II enzyme repression or inhibition on L-form growth promoted by overproduction of AccDA or inhibition of PG precursor synthesis. Importantly, the same levels of IPTG that s"

At present, it is unclear how these opposing signals are transduced to and discriminated by the nucleus. In this study, we demonstrate that Jacob is a protein messenger that encodes the origin of synaptic versus extrasynaptic NMDAR signals and delivers them to the nucleus. Exclusively synaptic, but not extrasynaptic, NMDAR activation induces phosphorylation of Jacob at serine-180 by ERK1/2. Long-distance trafficking of Jacob from synaptic, but not extrasynaptic, sites depends on ERK activity, and association with fragments of the intermediate filament α-internexin hinders dephosphorylation of the Jacob/ERK complex during nuclear transit. In the nucleus, the phosphorylation state of Jacob determines whether it induces cell death or promotes cell survival and enhances synaptic plasticity."

SRP-independent translocation in yeast is as prevalent as targeting through SRP The C′-terminal GPI-anchoring sequence is an ER-targeting motif Several cytosolic Hsp40s chaperone preinserted GPI-anchored proteins The GET pathway targets GPI-anchored proteins to the ER In eukaryotes, the initial biogenesis of secreted and endomembrane proteins takes place at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to which these proteins are directed via their hydrophobic ER-targeting sequences (Cross et al., 2009Cross B.C.S.

Protein translocation across the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum and bacterial plasma membranes.Nature. 2007; 450: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). To date, two types of eukaryotic ER-targeting sequences have been characterized: N′-terminal cleavable signal sequences (SS) and transmembrane (TM) domains that act as signal anchors. These determinants are recognized by cytosolic machineries that enable subsequent translocation into the ER, while preventing these substrates from folding or aggregating within the cytosol. The first eukaryotic ER-targeting pathway identified was the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its ER-bound receptor (Rapoport, 2007Rapoport T.A. Protein translocation across the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum and bacterial plasma membranes.Nature. 2007; 450: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). This essential pathway, which binds hydrophobic ER-targeting sequences and mediates cotranslational translocation, has since been studied in great detail and to atomic resolution (Egea et al., 2005Egea P.F.

Molecular mechanism of co-translational protein targeting by the signal recognition particle.Traffic. 2011; 12: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, some secretory pathway proteins cannot use the SRP-dependent pathway. This can be due to physical restraints that prevent the ER-targeting sequence from binding to the SRP before translation has terminated. For example, an alternate pathway is required for the ER targeting and insertion of tail-anchored (TA) proteins and short secretory proteins that cannot recruit the SRP cotranslationally (Borgese et al., 2003Borgese N. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. The tale of tail-anchored proteins: coming from the cytosol and looking for a membrane.J.

During the past 5 years, one alternate targeting mechanism has been characterized for these proteins and is termed the GET pathway in yeast or the TRC40 pathway in mammals (Jonikas et al., 2009Jonikas M.C.

Additionally, some secretory pathway proteins fail to engage the SRP because they bear an insufficiently hydrophobic ER-targeting sequence (Lee and Bernstein, 2001Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. The targeting pathway of Escherichia coli presecretory and integral membrane proteins is specified by the hydrophobicity of the targeting signal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 3471-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar; Ng et al., 1996Ng D.T.W. Brown J.D. Walter P. Signal sequences specify the targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The cytosolic factors mediating this form of SRP-independent translocation have remained poorly characterized (Cross et al., 2009Cross B.C.S. Sinning I. Luirink J. High S. Delivering proteins for export from the cytosol.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, the membranal machinery mediating the translocation of these proteins has been elucidated and includes the canonical translocon, together with auxillary factors (Rapoport, 2007Rapoport T.A. Protein translocation across the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum and bacterial plasma membranes.Nature. 2007; 450: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The SRP-independent translocon is a tetrameric complex, which, in yeast, comprises the essential Sec62 and Sec63 and the nonessential Sec66 and Sec72 (Feldheim and Schekman, 1994Feldheim D. Schekman R. Sec72p contributes to the selective recognition of signal peptides by the secretory polypeptide translocation complex.J.

Sec63p and Kar2p are required for the translocation of SRP-dependent precursors into the yeast endoplasmic reticulum in vivo.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This SRP-independent translocon enlists the lumenal chaperone BiP/Kar2 to “ratchet” its substrates into the ER (Matlack et al., 1999Matlack K.E.S. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T.A.

Most studies of the SRP-dependent and -independent pathways have focused on a small and well-defined group of model proteins. Due to this lack of systematic data, the fraction of the secretome that utilizes each pathway remains unknown. To date, the signals guiding SRP-independent targeting and the cytosolic protein network that recognizes SRP-independent substrates prior to their translocation into the ER lumen have only been partially elucidated (Becker et al., 1996Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Functional interaction of cytosolic hsp70 and a DnaJ-related protein, Ydj1p, in protein translocation in vivo.Mol. Cell.

A subfamily of stress proteins facilitates translocation of secretory and mitochondrial precursor polypeptides.Nature. 1988; 332: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Moreover, no ER-targeting pathway has been described for these substrates. To address these questions, we focused on one of the most extensively researched eukaryotic secretion systems—that of the baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We systematically categorized the translocation mechanisms of the S. cerevisiae secretome and further characterized the cytoplasmic effectors of SRP-independent translocation. Through hydropathy-based analysis to identify proteins that would not engage the SRP, we could show that a substantial number of proteins are predicted to use this pathway for ER entry in yeast. Further analysis of one family of SRP-independent substrates, glycosylphopatidylinostol (GPI)-anchored proteins, demonstrated that their C′-terminal anchor sequence plays a previously uncharacterized role in ER targeting. Finally, we identified the cytoplasmic protein network that recognizes, chaperones, and targets this SRP-independent protein family to the ER. This analysis sets the foundations for more a detailed understanding of this central cellular pathway. Recent studies have suggested that SRP-independent translocation is more prominent than previously appreciated (Johnson et al., 2012Johnson N. Vilardi F. Lang S. Leznicki P. Zimmermann R. High S. TRC40 can deliver short secretory proteins to the Sec61 translocon.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 3612-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; Lakkaraju et al., 2012Lakkaraju A.K. Thankappan R.

A calmodulin-dependent translocation pathway for small secretory proteins.Cell. 2011; 147: 1576-1588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, even in the well-studied secretory pathway of yeast, the scope of SRP-independent translocation remains unknown. It has been demonstrated that, in yeast, the less hydrophobic the N′-terminal ER-targeting sequence is, both in terms of overall length and hydrophobicity, the more likely it is to be overlooked by the SRP (Ng et al., 1996Ng D.T.W. Brown J.D. Walter P. Signal sequences specify the targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to implement these findings to systematically identify the repertoire of SRP-independent proteins in the yeast secretome. First, we compiled a list of all yeast proteins that are predicted to be translocated into the ER (Figure 1A, left, and Table S1 available online). We then analyzed the first 60 amino acids (aa) of these 1,145 proteins for hydrophobic features that have been shown to modulate SRP binding (Figure 1A, middle) (Hatsuzawa et al., 1997Hatsuzawa K. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. The hydrophobic region of signal peptides is a determinant for SRP recognition and protein translocation across the ER membrane.J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, each protein’s maximum hydropathy was plotted over a window of either 9, 11, or 19 aa using the Kyte-Doolittle scale, and the length of the hydrophobic stretch was analyzed by the Phobius algorithm (Käll et al., 2004Käll L. Krogh A. Sonnhammer E.L. A combined transmembrane topology and signal peptide prediction method.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). By combining both of these parameters, we generated a compound hydropathy score for the majority of the yeast secretome (Figure 1A, right, and Table S1), excluding 32.8% of the secretome that does not contain significant hydropathy within its N′-terminal 60 aa. To ascertain that the compound hydropathy score correlates with the ability of an ER-targeting sequence to bind to the SRP, we analyzed the hydropathy score of the handful of empirically validated translocation substrates (Ng et al., 1996Ng D.T.W. Brown J.D. Walter P. Signal sequences specify the targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Reassuringly, substrates that are known to be SRP independent generated low compound hydropathy scores, whereas those that are either partially or completely reliant on the SRP bear median or high compound scores, respectively (Table S1). Because the compound scores generated for all maximum hydropathy windows show significant correlation (Figure S1A), we chose to continue our analysis on the compound score with a window size of 9 aa, as recent structural work on an archeal SRP in complex with an ER-targeting sequence exhibited a binding interface of this length (Janda et al., 2010Janda C.Y.

The correlation coefficient (R) is displayed for each comparison. All compound hydropathy scores generated for a given protein display significant correlation. (B) The distribution of the compound hydropathy scores generated with a window size of 9, 11 and 19 aa are shown. Interestingly, the compound hydropathy scores that we obtained were not distributed unimodaly (p value 0.0196), as might be expected from targeting sequences that have evolved to mediate two different translocational pathways (Figures 1A, right, and S1B). Two subpopulations were evident, representing targeting sequences with either a low score (median = 30.6, SD = 7.6) or a high score (median = 58.9, SD = 12.2). In light of this distribution, we predicted that the population bearing a compound hydropathy score below 40 would be SRP-independent substrates (Figure 1A, right). Following this criteria, we found that 333 proteins, or 43.3% of the analyzed yeast secretome, would most likely be SRP-independent substrates, whereas 436 proteins, making up 56.7% of the analyzed secretome, would engage the SRP either occasionally or consistently during their translation (Figure 1B and Table S1). It should be emphasized that SRP independence is predicted solely on the hydropathy of the first 60 aa for each protein and that highly hydrophobic segments that occur more C′-terminally could engage the SRP as translation continues. Thus, we further identified a high-confidence SRP-independent group of 173 proteins that have a compound hydropathy score below 40 and are not predicted to contain other highly hydrophobic domains, which could override their N′-terminal translocation preference (Table S2). It has previously been suggested that the various ER insertion pathways might have adapted to better translocate specific subsets of the secretome. Therefore, we examined whether the predicted translocational groups shared unique structural characteristics (Figure 1B). We found that the predicted SRP-independent protein group, not constrained to the high-confidence SRP-independent substrates, is enriched for proteins that contain cleavable signal sequences (p value 3.16 × 10−71). Many of these substrates also harbor a C′-terminal GPI-anchoring site (2.47 × 10−16), which undergoes cleavage and anchoring within the ER. Conversely, the SRP-dependent substrate group is comprised mostly of TM-bearing proteins (3.3 × 10−49). Indeed, a cleavable SS is less hydrophobic than a TM domain, explaining its lack of dependence on the SRP machinery. These striking correlations suggest that a protein’s translocation route is not random but rather that proteins with similar attributes utilize a specific insertional pathway. Furthermore, these findings put forth a model (Figure 1B) whereby the yeast SRP binds highly hydrophobic sequences such as signal anchor TM domains, as does the bacterial SRP (Huber et al., 2005Huber D. Boyd D. Xia Y. Olma M.H. Gerstein M. Beckwith J. Use of thioredoxin as a reporter to identify a subset of Escherichia coli signal sequences that promote signal recognition particle-dependent translocation.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2983-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, although some SSs were predicted to engage the SRP, most were not and might rather bind to a different set of chaperoning and ER-targeting proteins. These hydropathy-based predictions uncovered an entire repertoire of SRP-independent substrates that have never been studied before. We therefore decided to verify the predictions by looking at the in vivo translocation dependence of predicted SRP-independent substrates. To this end, we selected high-confidence SRP-independent substrates that could be visualized with a C′-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion and picked the 83 relevant strains from the GFP library (Huh et al., 2003Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O’Shea E.K. Global analysis of protein localization in budding yeast.Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar) (Table S2). These strains were then deleted for the nonessential SEC72 gene, which encodes for a component of the SRP-independent translocon (Rapoport, 2007Rapoport T.A. Protein translocation across the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum and bacterial plasma membranes.Nature. 2007; 450: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the deletion of SEC72 does not completely halt SRP-independent translocation (Feldheim and Schekman, 1994Feldheim D. Schekman R. Sec72p contributes to the selective recognition of signal peptides by the secretory polypeptide translocation complex.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). By imaging the wild-type (WT) and Δsec72 strains, we could verify 38 substrates that are mislocalized in the absence of Sec72, representing 46% of the tested strains that most likely undergo the severest cases of translocational attenuation (representative strains in Figure 1C; Table S2). In contrast, the localization of more than 100 GFP-tagged predicted SRP-dependent proteins was not altered in the absence of Sec72 (representative strains in Figure 1C; Table S3). These results suggest that our hydropathy-based analysis can indeed reveal whether a protein utilizes the SRP-independent pathway for ER targeting. The predicted SRP-independent protein group was enriched for the GPI-anchored protein family. The GPI-anchored proteins undergo a posttranslational glycan-lipid modification in the ER and are estimated to make up 10%–20% of eukaryotic cell-surface proteins (Orlean and Menon, 2007Orlean P. Menon A.K. Thematic review series: lipid posttranslational modifications. GPI anchoring of protein in yeast and mammalian cells, or: how we learned to stop worrying and love glycophospholipids.J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 993-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In our analysis, all but one of the 57 putative family members displayed low compound hydropathy scores (Table S1 and, by additional methods, Figure S2). We could verify this prediction for all 13 C′-terminally GFP-tagged GPI-anchored proteins that were tested (Table S2). As C′-terminal GFP tagging masks the C′-terminal GPI anchor sequence, it might alter the translocation dependency of GPI-anchored proteins. Therefore, we analyzed the translocational preference of two fluorescently tagged GPI-anchored proteins (Figure 2A), Gas1 and Cwp2, which maintain their correct SS and GPI anchor sequence organization (Castillon et al., 2009Castillon G.A.

Indeed, the localization of these GPI fusion proteins was only affected by mutations in the translocon (sec61-DAmP) or SRP-independent complex (sec62-DAmP and Δsec72). Kar2, which is known to utilize both pathways (Ng et al., 1996Ng D.T.W. Brown J.D. Walter P. Signal sequences specify the targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), was also mislocalized in an SRP mutant (sec65-1). The foci imaged in the absence of the SRP-independent translocation do indeed represent a preinserted aggregated form of these proteins as indicated by their running size on an SDS-PAGE gel and colocalization with inclusion markers (Figures S3A and S3B). We also ensured that dependence on the SRP-independent machinery was not an artifact of the fluorescent tagging, as endogenous GPI-anchored proteins demonstrate the same translocational dependence (Figure S3C and S3D).Figure S3In the Absence of the SRP-Independent Pathway, GPI-Anchored Proteins Aggregate in the Cytosol, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) RFP-Gas1 was analyzed on various backgrounds by Western blot with αRFP.

To further ascertain that the dependence of GPI-anchored proteins on the SRP-independent pathway is a family-wide phenomenon in vivo, we fused the SS of five verified GPI-anchored proteins to GFP. We assayed the ER insertion of these fusion proteins by following GFP secretion into the medium (Figure 2B) in either WT cells or cells that are defective in the SRP-dependent or independent insertion pathways (sec65-1 and Δsec72, respectively). Whereas WT and sec65-1 (at the restrictive temperature) cells secrete the various SS-GFP fusion proteins into the media, the secretion of all five was attenuated in Δsec72. In contrast, Kar2 secretion into the media is weakened, but not abolished, in both the sec65-1and Δsec72 mutants (Figure 2B, right). These results imply that the SS-GFP constructs—and ergo their representative GPI-anchored proteins—fail to enter the secretory pathway in the absence of SRP-independent translocation. Every GPI-anchored protein that we have studied has shown the same reliance on SRP-independent translocation. Moreover, all GPI-anchored proteins have a similar ER-targeting domain. These two facts strongly support the notion that, in yeast, this entire protein family requires SRP-independent translocation for ER entry. More generally, these findings indicate that the SS is usually linked to SRP-independent translocation in yeast. Although GPI-anchored proteins carry an N′-terminal SS, they also contain a C′-terminal GPI anchor sequence, which tags them for a posttranslational modification with a glycolipid anchor in the ER lumen (Orlean and Menon, 2007Orlean P.

Transplantation of cultivated corneal endothelial cells (CECs) has been researched to repair endothelial dysfunction in animal models, though the in vitro expansion of human CECs (HCECs) is a pivotal practical issue. In this study we established an optimum condition for the cultivation of HCECs. When exposed to culture conditions, both primate and human CECs showed two distinct phenotypes: contact-inhibited polygonal monolayer and fibroblastic phenotypes. The use of SB431542, a selective inhibitor of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) receptor, counteracted the fibroblastic phenotypes to the normal contact-inhibited monolayer, and these polygonal cells maintained endothelial physiological functions. Expression of ZO-1 and Na+/K+-ATPase maintained their subcellular localization at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, expression of type I collagen and fibronectin was greatly reduced. This present study may prove to be the substantial protocol to provide the efficient in vitro expansion of HCECs with an inhibitor to the TGF-β receptor, and may ultimately provide clinicians with a new therapeutic modality in regenerative medicine for the treatment of corneal endothelial dysfunctions."
https://openalex.org/W2000961563,"Although somatic cell reprogramming to generate inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is associated with profound epigenetic changes, the roles and mechanisms of epigenetic factors in this process remain poorly understood. Here, we identify Jmjd3 as a potent negative regulator of reprogramming. Jmjd3-deficient MEFs produced significantly more iPSC colonies than did wild-type cells, whereas ectopic expression of Jmjd3 markedly inhibited reprogramming. We show that the inhibitory effects of Jmjd3 are produced through both histone demethylase-dependent and -independent pathways. The latter pathway involves Jmjd3 targeting of PHF20 for ubiquitination and degradation via recruitment of an E3 ligase, Trim26. Importantly, PHF20-deficient MEFs could not be converted to fully reprogrammed iPSCs, even with knockdown of Jmjd3, Ink4a, or p21, indicating that PHF20 is required for reprogramming. Our findings demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, a previously unrecognized role of Jmjd3 in cellular reprogramming and provide molecular insight into the mechanisms by which the Jmjd3-PHF20 axis controls this process."

It is unclear what functional role NPCs play in establishing or maintaining these distinct chromatin domains. We report that the yeast NPC protein Nup170p interacts with regions of the genome that contain ribosomal protein and subtelomeric genes, where it functions in nucleosome positioning and as a repressor of transcription. We show that the role of Nup170p in subtelomeric gene silencing is linked to its association with the RSC chromatin-remodeling complex and the silencing factor Sir4p, and that the binding of Nup170p and Sir4p to subtelomeric chromatin is cooperative and necessary for the association of telomeres with the nuclear envelope. Our results establish the NPC as an active participant in silencing and the formation of peripheral heterochromatin."

This study used functional neuroimaging to investigate whole-brain functional connectivity in adolescents diagnosed with internet addiction. Based on neurobiological changes seen in other addiction related disorders, it was predicted that connectivity disruptions in adolescents with internet addiction would be most prominent in cortico-striatal circuitry. Methods Participants were 12 adolescents diagnosed with internet addiction and 11 healthy comparison subjects. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were acquired, and group differences in brain functional connectivity were analyzed using the network-based statistic. We also analyzed network topology, testing for between-group differences in key graph-based network measures. Results Adolescents with internet addiction showed reduced functional connectivity spanning a distributed network. The majority of impaired connections involved cortico-subcortical circuits (∼24% with prefrontal and ∼27% with parietal cortex). Bilateral putamen was the most extensively involved subcortical brain region. No between-group difference was observed in network topological measures, including the clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, or the small-worldness ratio. Conclusions Internet addiction is associated with a widespread and significant decrease of functional connectivity in cortico-striatal circuits, in the absence of global changes in brain functional network topology."
https://openalex.org/W2006720325,"Immunoproteasomes are alternative forms of proteasomes that have an enhanced ability to generate antigenic peptides. Recently, Seifert and colleagues reported surprising observations concerning the functions of immunoproteasomes and cellular responses to interferon-γ: (1) that immunoproteasomes degrade ubiquitinated proteins faster than the constitutive proteasomes, (2) that polyubiquitin conjugates accumulate after interferon-γ treatment but then are preferentially degraded by immunoproteasomes, and (3) that immunoproteasome deficiency causes the formation of inclusions and more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In contrast, we find that polyubiquitin conjugates do not transiently accumulate following IFNγ-treatment and that immunoproteasomes do not prevent the formation of intracellular inclusions or protect against EAE. Furthermore, purified 26S constitutive and immunoproteasomes bind ubiquitin conjugates similarly and degrade them at similar rates. We conclude that, although immunoproteasomes can increase the generation of peptides appropriate for MHC class I presentation, they do not degrade ubiquitinated proteins more efficiently than constitutive particles."

https://openalex.org/W2088107344,"Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with increased production of Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a protein that modulates inflammation and clearance of glucose adducts. We used Lean and Diet-induced Obese (DIO) WT and Gal-3 KO mice to investigate the role of Gal-3 in modulation of adiposity, glucose metabolism and inflammation. Deficiency of Gal-3 lead to age-dependent development of excess adiposity and systemic inflammation, as indicated by elevated production of acute-phase proteins, number of circulating pro-inflammatory Ly6C(high) monocytes and development of neutrophilia, microcytic anemia and thrombocytosis in 20-week-old Lean and DIO male Gal-3 KO mice. This was associated with impaired fasting glucose, heightened response to a glucose tolerance test and reduced adipose tissue expression of adiponectin, Gal-12, ATGL and PPARγ, in the presence of maintained insulin sensitivity and hepatic expression of gluconeogenic enzymes in 20-week-old Gal-3 KO mice compared to their diet-matched WT controls. Expression of PGC-1α and FGF-21 in the liver of Lean Gal-3 KO mice was comparable to that observed in DIO animals. Impaired fasting glucose and altered responsiveness to a glucose load preceded development of excess adiposity and systemic inflammation, as demonstrated in 12-week-old Gal-3 KO mice. Finally, a role for the microflora in mediating the fasting hyperglycemia, but not the excessive response to a glucose load, of 12-week-old Gal-3 KO mice was demonstrated by administration of antibiotics. In conclusion, Gal-3 is an important modulator of glucose metabolism, adiposity and inflammation."

However, there have been very few studies addressing this issue in Cameroon. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis in HIV/AIDS patients in Dschang -Cameroon. Stool and blood specimens from HIV/AIDS patients and control group were screened respectively for intestinal parasites and for HIV antibodies. Intestinal parasites were identified using direct microscopy, formalin-ether concentration and Ziehl Neelsen methods. Out of 396 participants recruited among patients consulting at hospital, 42 (10.6%) were HIV positive, thirty of them treatment naïve. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites was 14.64%. Out of 42 HIV/AIDS patients, 59.5% (25/42) were infected with intestinal parasites, while only 9.32% (33/354) of the HIV negative patients were infected with intestinal parasites. The parasites detected in our study population included Crystosporidium parvum (2.53%), Entamoeba histolytica (7.52%), Entamoeba coli (4.04%), Giardia lamblia (0.25%), Trichuris trichura (0.25%), Strongyloides stercoralis (0.25%) and Taenia spp. (0.25%). In the HIV infected group, Crystosporidium parvum (19.04%), Entamoeba histolytica (19.04%), Entamoeba coli (21.42%), Giardia lamblia (2.38%), Strongyloides stercoralis (0.25%) and Taenia spp. (0.25%) were found. Crystosporidium parvum was found to be significantly higher in HIV/AIDS patients than in controls (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the HIV status and the quality of water were the major risk factors for intestinal parasitosis. Routine examinations of stool samples for parasites would significantly benefit the HIV patients by contributing in reducing morbidity and improving the efficiency of antiretroviral treatment. Even after the introduction of free anti-retroviral drugs, opportunistic intestinal infections are still a threat. HIV patients should be screened routinely for intestinal parasites and treated for their overall well being."
https://openalex.org/W2134393172,"Metazoan evolution involves increasing protein domain complexity, but how this relates to control of biological decisions remains uncertain. The Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RasGEF) Sos1 and its adaptor Grb2 are multidomain proteins that couple fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling to activation of the Ras-Erk pathway during mammalian development and drive embryonic stem cells toward the primitive endoderm (PrE) lineage. We show that the ability of Sos1/Grb2 to appropriately regulate pluripotency and differentiation factors and to initiate PrE development requires collective binding of multiple Sos1/Grb2 domains to their protein and phospholipid ligands. This provides a cooperative system that only allows lineage commitment when all ligand-binding domains are occupied. Furthermore, our results indicate that the interaction domains of Sos1 and Grb2 have evolved so as to bind ligands not with maximal strength but with specificities and affinities that maintain cooperativity. This optimized system ensures that PrE lineage commitment occurs in a timely and selective manner during embryogenesis."

Several methods are used to measure telomere length, the choice of which usually depends on the type and size of sample to be assayed, as well as cost and throughput considerations. The goal of this study was to investigate the factors that may influence the reliability of qPCR-based relative telomere length measurements in whole blood. Day to day intra-individual variability, types of blood anticoagulant, sample storage conditions, processing and site of blood draw were investigated. Two qPCR-based methods to measure telomere length (monoplex vs. multiplex) were also investigated and showed a strong correlation between them. Freezing and thawing of the blood and storage of the blood at 4°C for up to 4 days did not affect telomere length values. Telomere lengths in dried blood spots were significantly higher than both whole blood and peripheral mononuclear blood cells, and were highly correlated with both. We found that telomere length measurements were significantly higher in dried blood spots collected directly from fingertip prick compared to dried blood spots prepared with anticoagulated whole blood collected from the finger, and non-blotted whole blood taken from both finger and arm venipuncture. This suggests that DNA from cells blotted on paper is not equivalent to that collected from venipuncture whole blood, and caution should be taken when comparing between blood sample types."

The associations of total dietary calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and phosphorus (P) with menarcheal age were also examined.This prospective study was conducted on 134 pre-pubertal girls, aged 4-12 years at baseline, who participated in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS), and were followed for a median of 6.5 years. Dietary intakes were determined at initiation of the study using two non-consecutive 24-h dietary recalls and the age of menarche was documented during the follow-up. Logistic regression was used to calculate the risk of reaching menarche ≤ 12 years according to pre-pubertal levels of dairy or mineral intakes.The risk of earlier menarche was higher in girls with higher intakes of milk [OR: 2.28 (95% CI: 1.03-5.05)], Ca [OR: 3.20 (95%CI: 1.39-7.42)], Mg [OR: 2.43 (95% CI: 1.12-5.27)] and P [OR: 3.37 (95 % CI: 1.44-7.87) after controlling for energy and protein intake, interval between the age at study initiation and the age of menarche, and maternal age at menarche (Model 1). Girls in the middle tertile of cheese intakes had a lower risk of reaching menarche ≤ 12 years than those in the lowest tertile after controlling for covariates in model 1. These associations remained significant after further adjustment of BMI Z-score at baseline. The relationship of Ca, Mg, and P with menarche remained after further adjustment for height Z-score at baseline, whereas the association between milk and cheese intakes became non-significant.Pre-pubertal intake of milk, but not cheese and yogurt, may hasten age at menarche."

This study aimed to test whether MT and iTBS can interact with each other to produce additive changes in motor cortical physiology. We hypothesized that potential interaction between MT and iTBS would be dependent on BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, which is known to affect neuroplasticity in the human motor cortex. Eighty two healthy volunteers were genotyped for BDNF polymorphism. Thirty subjects were assigned for MT alone, 23 for iTBS alone, and 29 for MT + iTBS paradigms. TMS indices for cortical excitability and motor map areas were measured prior to and after each paradigm. MT alone significantly increased the motor cortical excitability and expanded the motor map areas. The iTBS alone paradigm also enhanced excitability and increased the motor map areas to a slightly greater extent than MT alone. A combination of MT and iTBS resulted in the largest increases in the cortical excitability, and the representational motor map expansion of MT + iTBS was significantly greater than MT or iTBS alone only in Val/Val genotype. As a result, the additive interaction between MT and iTBS was highly dependent on BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. Our results may have clinical relevance in designing rehabilitative strategies that combine therapeutic cortical stimulation and physical exercise for patients with motor disabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2059531289,"Members of the large G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) clan are implicated in many physiological and disease processes, making them important therapeutic drug targets. In the present study, we follow up on results of a pilot study suggesting a functional relationship between glucocorticoid (GC)-induced ocular hypertension and GPR158, one of three orphan members of the GPCR Family C. GC treatment increases levels of GPR158 mRNA and protein through transcriptional mechanisms, in cultured trabecular meshwork (TBM) cells derived from the eye's aqueous outflow pathway. Like treatment with GCs, transient overexpression of GPR158 stimulates cell proliferation, while siRNA knockdown of endogenous GPR158 has the opposite effect. Both endogenous and overexpressed GPR158 show an unusual subcellular localization pattern, being found almost entirely in the nucleus. However, when cells are treated with inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, GPR158 is shifted to the plasma membrane. Mutation of a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the 8th helix also shifts GPR158 out of the nucleus, but in this case the protein is found in vesicles localized in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that newly synthesized GPR158 first traffics to the plasma membrane, where it rapidly undergoes endocytosis and translocation to the nucleus. Significantly, mutation of the NLS abrogates GPR158-mediated enhancement of cell proliferation, indicating a functional requirement for nuclear localization. GPR158 overexpression upregulates levels of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1, but mutation of the NLS reverses this. Overexpression of GPR158 enhances the barrier function of a TBM cell monolayer, which is associated with an increase in the levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin, similar to reported studies on GC treatment. Regulated paracellular permeability controls aqueous outflow facility in vivo. Since GCs stimulate GPR158 expression, the result is consistent with a role for elevation of GPR158 expression in GC-induced ocular hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1984610351,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant primary tumor of the central nervous system originating in glial cells. GBM results in more years of life lost than any other cancer type. Low levels of Notch receptor expression correlates with prolonged survival in various high grade gliomas independent of other markers. Different downstream pathways of Notch receptors have been identified. We tested if the Notch/Deltex pathway, which is distinct from the canonical, CSL-mediated pathway, has a role in GBM. We show that the alternative or non-canonical Notch pathway functioning through Deltex1 (DTX1) mediates key features of glioblastoma cell aggressiveness. For example, DTX1 activates the RTK/PI3K/PKB and the MAPK/ERK mitotic pathways and induces anti-apoptotic Mcl-1. The clonogenic and growth potential of established glioma cells correlated with DTX1 levels. Microarray gene expression analysis further identified a DTX1-specific, MAML1-independent transcriptional program - including microRNA-21- which is functionally linked to the changes in tumor cell aggressiveness. Over-expression of DTX1 increased cell migration and invasion correlating to ERK activation, miR-21 levels and endogenous Notch levels. In contrast to high and intermediate expressors, patients with low DTX1 levels have a more favorable prognosis. The alternative Notch pathway via DTX1 appears to be an oncogenic factor in glioblastoma and these findings offer new potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W1992225782,"The marsupial genus Macropus includes three subgenera, the familiar large grazing kangaroos and wallaroos of M. (Macropus) and M. (Osphranter), as well as the smaller mixed grazing/browsing wallabies of M. (Notamacropus). A recent study of five concatenated nuclear genes recommended subsuming the predominantly browsing Wallabia bicolor (swamp wallaby) into Macropus. To further examine this proposal we sequenced partial mitochondrial genomes for kangaroos and wallabies. These sequences strongly favour the morphological placement of W. bicolor as sister to Macropus, although place M. irma (black-gloved wallaby) within M. (Osphranter) rather than as expected, with M. (Notamacropus). Species tree estimation from separately analysed mitochondrial and nuclear genes favours retaining Macropus and Wallabia as separate genera. A simulation study finds that incomplete lineage sorting among nuclear genes is a plausible explanation for incongruence with the mitochondrial placement of W. bicolor, while mitochondrial introgression from a wallaroo into M. irma is the deepest such event identified in marsupials. Similar such coalescent simulations for interpreting gene tree conflicts will increase in both relevance and statistical power as species-level phylogenetics enters the genomic age. Ecological considerations in turn, hint at a role for selection in accelerating the fixation of introgressed or incompletely sorted loci. More generally the inclusion of the mitochondrial sequences substantially enhanced phylogenetic resolution. However, we caution that the evolutionary dynamics that enhance mitochondria as speciation indicators in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting may also render them especially susceptible to introgression."
https://openalex.org/W2087565169,"Congenital portosystemic shunts are developmental anomalies of the splanchnic vascular system that cause portal blood to bypass the liver. Large-breed dogs are predisposed for intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (IHPSS) and small-breed dogs for extrahepatic portosystemic shunts (EHPSS). While the phenotype resulting from portal bypass of the liver of the two types of shunt is identical, the genotype and molecular pathways involved are probably different. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the pathways involved in the different types of portosystemic shunting. Microarray analysis of mRNA expression in liver tissue from dogs with EHPSS and IHPSS revealed that the expression of 26 genes was altered in either IHPSS or EHPSS samples compared with that in liver samples from control dogs. Quantitative real-time PCR of these genes in 14 IHPSS, 17 EHPSS, and 8 control liver samples revealed a significant differential expression of ACBP, CCBL1, GPC3, HAMP, PALLD, VCAM1, and WEE1. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting confirmed an increased expression of VCAM1 in IHPSS but its absence in EHPSS, an increased WEE1 expression in IHPSS but not in EHPSS, and a decreased expression of CCBL1 in both shunt types. Regarding their physiologic functions, these findings may indicate a causative role for VCAM1 in IHPSS and WEE1 for IHPSS. CCBL1 could be an interesting candidate to study not yet elucidated aspects in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2090235292,"Sciatic nerve (SN) transection-induced apoptosis of dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGN) is one factor determining the efficacy of peripheral axonal regeneration and the return of sensation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that caspase-2 (CASP2) orchestrates apoptosis of axotomised DRGN both in vivo and in vitro by disrupting the local neurotrophic supply to DRGN. We observed significantly elevated levels of cleaved CASP2 (C-CASP2), compared to cleaved caspase-3 (C-CASP3), within TUNEL+DRGN and DRG glia (satellite and Schwann cells) after SN transection. A serum withdrawal cell culture model, which induced 40% apoptotic death in DRGN and 60% in glia, was used to model DRGN loss after neurotrophic factor withdrawal. Elevated C-CASP2 and TUNEL were observed in both DRGN and DRG glia, with C-CASP2 localisation shifting from the cytosol to the nucleus, a required step for induction of direct CASP2-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated downregulation of CASP2 protected 50% of DRGN from apoptosis after serum withdrawal, while downregulation of CASP3 had no effect on DRGN or DRG glia survival. We conclude that CASP2 orchestrates the death of SN-axotomised DRGN directly and also indirectly through loss of DRG glia and their local neurotrophic factor support. Accordingly, inhibiting CASP2 expression is a potential therapy for improving both the SN regeneration response and peripheral sensory recovery."
https://openalex.org/W1982776555,"Sociality and particularly advanced forms of sociality such as cooperative breeding (living in permanent groups with reproductive division of labour) is relatively rare among vertebrates. A suggested constraint on the evolution of sociality is the elevated transmission rate of parasites between group members. Despite such apparent costs, sociality has evolved independently in a number of vertebrate taxa including humans. However, how the costs of parasitism are overcome in such cases remains uncertain. We evaluated the potential role of parasites in the evolution of sociality in a member of the African mole-rats, the only mammal family that exhibits the entire range of social systems from solitary to eusocial. Here we show that resting metabolic rates decrease whilst daily energy expenditure and energy stores (i.e. body fat) increase with group size in social Natal mole rats (Cryptomys hottentotus natalensis). Critically, larger groups also had reduced parasite abundance and infested individuals only showed measurable increases in energy metabolism at high parasite abundance. Thus, in some circumstances, sociality appears to provide energetic benefits that may be diverted into parasite defence. This mechanism is likely to be self-reinforcing and an important factor in the evolution of sociality."
https://openalex.org/W2035842815,"Background Environmental challenges might affect the maternal organism and indirectly affect the later ontogeny of the progeny. We investigated the cross-generation impact of a moderate heat challenge in chickens. We hypothesized that a warm temperature–within the thermotolerance range- would affect the hormonal environment provided to embryos by mothers, and in turn, affect the morphology and behavioral phenotype of offspring. Methodology/Principal Findings Laying hens were raised under a standard thermal condition at 21°C (controls) or 30°C (experimental) for 5 consecutive weeks. A significant increase was observed in the internal temperature of hens exposed to the warm treatment; however plasma corticosterone levels remained unaffected. The laying rate was not affected, but experimental hens laid lighter eggs than the controls during the treatment. As expected, the maternal thermal environment affected yolk hormone contents. Eggs laid by the experimental hens showed significantly higher concentrations of yolk progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol. All chicks were raised under standard thermal conditions. The quality of hatchlings, growth, feeding behavior and emotional reactivity of chicks were analyzed. Offspring of experimental hens (C30 chicks) were lighter but obtained better morphological quality scores at hatching than the controls (C21 chicks). C30 chicks expressed lesser distress calls when exposed to a novel food. Unlike C21 chicks, C30 chicks expressed no preference for energetic food. Conclusion/Significance Our findings suggest that moderate heat challenge triggers maternal effects and modulate the developmental trajectory of offspring in a way that may be adaptive. This suggests that the impact of heat challenges on captive or wild populations might have a cross-generation effect."
https://openalex.org/W2029074840,"A total of 290 tree-ring samples, collected from six sites in the West Qinling Mountains of China, were used to develop six new standard tree-ring chronologies. In addition, 73 proxy records were assembled in collaboration with Chinese and international scholars, from 27 publically available proxy records and 40 tree-ring chronologies that are not available in public datasets. These records were used to reconstruct annual mean temperature variability in the West Qinling Mountains over the past 500 years (AD 1500–1995), using a modified point-by-point regression (hybrid PPR) method. The results demonstrate that the hybrid PPR method successfully integrates the temperature signals from different types of proxies, and that the method preserves a high degree of low-frequency variability. The reconstruction shows greater temperature variability in the West Qinling Mountains than has been found in previous studies. Our temperature reconstruction for this region shows: 1) five distinct cold periods, at approximately AD 1520–1535, AD 1560–1575, AD 1610–1620, AD 1850–1875 and AD 1965–1985, and four warm periods, at approximately AD 1645–1660, AD 1705–1725, AD 1785–1795 and AD 1920–1945; 2) that in this region, the 20th century was not the warmest period of the past 500 years; and 3) that a dominant and persistent oscillation of ca. 64 years is significantly identified in the 1640–1790 period."
https://openalex.org/W2053730557,"Background Intratumoral hemorrhage is a frequent occurrence in renal cell carcinoma and is an indicator of tumor subtype. We hypothesize that susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is sensitive to hemorrhage in renal cell carcinoma and can give a more diagnostic image when compared to conventional imaging techniques. Materials and Methods A retrospective review of 32 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma was evaluated. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 22 out of 32 patients also underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan. Hemorrhage was classified into 3 different categories according to shape and distribution. Histopathology was obtained from all masses by radical nephrectomy. The ability to detect the presence of hemorrhage using CT, non-contrast conventional MRI and SWI was evaluated, and the patterns of hemorrhage were compared. Results Using pathologic results as the gold standard, the sensitivities of non-contrast conventional MRI, SWI and CT in detecting hemorrhage in clear cell renal cell carcinoma were 65.6%, 100% and 22.7%, respectively. Accuracy of non-contrast conventional MRI and SWI in evaluating hemorrhagic patterns were 31.3% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion These results demonstrate that SWI can better reveal hemorrhage and characterize the pattern more accurately than either non-contrast conventional MRI or CT. This suggests that SWI is the technique of choice for detecting hemorrhagic lesions in patients with renal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2115643170,"Lung development occurs under relative hypoxia and the most important oxygen-sensitive response pathway is driven by Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIF). HIFs are heterodimeric transcription factors of an oxygen-sensitive subunit, HIFα, and a constitutively expressed subunit, HIF1β. HIF1α and HIF2α, encoded by two separate genes, contribute to the activation of hypoxia inducible genes. A third HIFα gene, HIF3α, is subject to alternative promoter usage and splicing, leading to three major isoforms, HIF3α, NEPAS and IPAS. HIF3α gene products add to the complexity of the hypoxia response as they function as dominant negative inhibitors (IPAS) or weak transcriptional activators (HIF3α/NEPAS). Previously, we and others have shown the importance of the Hif1α and Hif2α factors in lung development, and here we investigated the role of Hif3α during pulmonary development. Therefore, HIF3α was conditionally expressed in airway epithelial cells during gestation and although HIF3α transgenic mice were born alive and appeared normal, their lungs showed clear abnormalities, including a post-pseudoglandular branching defect and a decreased number of alveoli. The HIF3α expressing lungs displayed reduced numbers of Clara cells, alveolar epithelial type I and type II cells. As a result of HIF3α expression, the level of Hif2α was reduced, but that of Hif1α was not affected. Two regulatory genes, Rarβ, involved in alveologenesis, and Foxp2, a transcriptional repressor of the Clara cell specific Ccsp gene, were significantly upregulated in the HIF3α expressing lungs. In addition, aberrant basal cells were observed distally as determined by the expression of Sox2 and p63. We show that Hif3α binds a conserved HRE site in the Sox2 promoter and weakly transactivated a reporter construct containing the Sox2 promoter region. Moreover, Hif3α affected the expression of genes not typically involved in the hypoxia response, providing evidence for a novel function of Hif3α beyond the hypoxia response."
https://openalex.org/W2133024885,"We have previously shown that co-transplantation of islets and Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) improves islet graft function and revascularisation, which was associated with the maintenance of normal islet morphology. The aim of the current study was to determine whether maintaining islet morphology in the absence of additional islet-helper cells would improve transplantation outcome in diabetic mice. Islets were isolated from C57BL/6 mice. Recipient streptozotocin-diabetic C57BL/6 mice were transplanted with a minimal mass of 150 islets as a single pellet or islets that were either manually dispersed or dispersed within a matrigel plug beneath the kidney capsule. Blood glucose concentrations were monitored for one month. Islet graft morphology and vascularisation were analysed by histology. Islets dispersed either alone or within matrigel plugs maintained near normal morphology, in contrast to pelleted islets, where individual islets fused to form large endocrine aggregates. The vascularisation of manually dispersed islets and islets dispersed within matrigel plugs was increased relative to respective control pelleted islet grafts. After one month 1/6 mice transplanted with pelleted islets cured compared to 5/6 mice transplanted with manually dispersed islets. The curative capacity of islets dispersed in matrigel was also better than that of pelleted islets (5/8 islet-matrigel implanted mice vs. 1/7 mice transplanted with pelleted islets cured by one month). Therefore, this study demonstrates that the maintenance of islet morphology is associated with improved graft function and revascularisation in diabetic mice."
https://openalex.org/W2005260673,"Background Lamins are structural proteins that are the major determinants of nuclear architecture and play important roles in various nuclear functions including gene regulation and cell differentiation. Mutations in the human lamin A gene cause a spectrum of genetic diseases that affect specific tissues. Most available mouse models for laminopathies recapitulate disease symptoms for muscle diseases and progerias. However, loss of human lamin A/C also has highly deleterious effects on fetal development. Hence it is important to understand the impact of lamin A/C expression levels on embryonic differentiation pathways. Methodology and Principal Findings We have investigated the differentiation potential of mouse embryonic stem cells containing reduced levels of lamin A/C by detailed lineage analysis of embryoid bodies derived from these cells by in vitro culture. We initially carried out a targeted disruption of one allele of the mouse lamin A/C gene (Lmna). Undifferentiated wild-type and Lmna+/− embryonic stem cells showed similar expression of pluripotency markers and cell cycle profiles. Upon spontaneous differentiation into embryoid bodies, markers for visceral endoderm such as α-fetoprotein were highly upregulated in haploinsufficient cells. However, neuronal markers such as β-III tubulin and nestin were downregulated. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in the commitment of Lmna+/− cells into the myogenic lineage, but no discernible effects on cardiac, adipocyte or osteocyte lineages. In the next series of experiments, we derived embryonic stem cell clones expressing lamin A/C short hairpin RNA and examined their differentiation potential. These cells expressed pluripotency markers and, upon differentiation, the expression of lineage-specific markers was altered as observed with Lmna+/− embryonic stem cells. Conclusions We have observed significant effects on embryonic stem cell differentiation to visceral endoderm, neuronal and myogenic lineages upon depletion of lamin A/C. Hence our results implicate lamin A/C level as an important determinant of lineage-specific differentiation during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2075150929,"In contrast to the conventional model of hospital-treated and government directly observed treatment (DOT) for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patient care, the Taiwan MDR-TB Consortium (TMTC) was launched in May 2007 with the collaboration of five medical care groups that have provided both care and DOT. This study aimed to determine whether the TMTC provided a better care model for MDR-TB patients than the conventional model.A total of 651 pulmonary MDR-TB patients that were diagnosed nation-wide from January 2000-August 2008 were enrolled. Of those, 290 (45%) MDR-TB patients whose initial sputum sample was taken in January 2007 or later were classified as patients in the TMTC era. All others were classified as patients in the pre-TMTC era. The treatment success rate at 36 months was better in the TMTC era group (82%) than in the pre-TMTC era group (61%) (p<0.001). With multiple logistic regressions, diagnosis in the TMTC era (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-4.2) was an independent predictor of a higher treatment success rate at 36 months. With the time-dependent proportional hazards method, a higher treatment success rate was still observed in the TMTC era group compared to the pre-TMTC era group (adjusted hazard ratio 6.3, 95% CI 4.2-9.5).The improved treatment success observed in the TMTC era compared to the pre-TMTC era is encouraging. The detailed TMTC components that contribute the most to the improved outcome will need confirmation in follow-up studies with large numbers of MDR-TB patients."
https://openalex.org/W2014341831,"Phenotypic plasticity can increase tolerance to heterogeneous environments but the elevations and slopes of reaction norms are often population specific. Disruption of locally adapted reaction norms through outcrossing can lower individual viability. Here, we sampled five genetically distinct populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) from within a river network, crossed them in a full-factorial design, and challenged the embryos with the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas fluorescens. By virtue of our design, we were able to disentangle effects of genetic crossing distance from sire and dam effects on early life-history traits. While pathogen infection did not increase mortality, it was associated with delayed hatching of smaller larvae with reduced yolk sac reserves. We found no evidence of a relationship between genetic distance (W, FST) and the expression of early-life history traits. Moreover, hybrids did not differ in phenotypic means or reaction norms in comparison to offspring from within-population crosses. Heritable variation in early life-history traits was found to remain stable across the control and pathogen environments. Our findings show that outcrossing within a rather narrow geographical scale can have neutral effects on F1 hybrid viability at the embryonic stage, i.e. at a stage when environmental and genetic effects on phenotypes are usually large."
https://openalex.org/W2078272761,"The With No lysine (K) family of serine/threonine kinase (WNK) defines a small family of kinases with significant roles in ion homeostasis. WNK1 has been shown to have different isoforms due to what seems to be largely tissue specific splicing. Here, we used two distinct in situ hybridization riboprobes on developing and adult mouse tissues to make a comparative analysis of Wnk1 and its sensory associated splice isoform, Wnk1/Hsn2. The hybridization signals in developing mouse tissues, which were prepared at embryonic day e10.5 and e12.5, revealed a homogenous expression profile with both probes. At e15.5 and in the newborn mouse, the two probes revealed different expression profiles with prominent signals in nervous system tissues and also other tissues such as kidney, thymus and testis. In adult mouse tissues, the two expression profiles appeared even more restricted to the nervous tissues, kidney, thymus and testis, with no detectable signal in the other tissues. Throughout the nervous system, sensory tissues, as well as in Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), CA2 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus, were strongly labeled with both probes. Hybridization signals were also strongly detected in Schwann and supporting satellite cells. Our results show that the expression profiles of Wnk1 isoforms change during the development, and that the expression of the Wnk1 splice variant containing the Hsn2 exon is prominent during developing and in adult mouse tissues, suggesting its important role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1975482936,"We previously showed that DNA fragmentation factor, which comprises a caspase-3-activated DNase (CAD) and its inhibitor (ICAD), may influence the rate of cell death by generating PARP-1-activating DNA breaks. Here we tested the hypothesis that ICAD-deficient colon epithelial cells exhibiting resistance to death stimuli may accumulate additional genetic modifications, leading to a tumorigenic phenotype. We show that ICAD deficiency may be associated with colon malignancy in humans. Indeed, an examination of ICAD expression using immunohistochemistry in an array of both colon cancer and normal tissues revealed that ICAD expression levels were severely compromised in the cancerous tissues. Upon DNA damage caused by a low dose of irradiation, ICAD cells acquire a tumorigenic phenotype. Colon epithelial cells derived from ICAD mice showed a significant resistance to death induced by the colon carcinogen dimethylhydrazine in vitro and in mice. Such resistance was associated with a decrease in PARP-1 activation. In an animal model of dimethylhydrazine-induced colon tumorigenesis, ICAD−/− mice developed significantly higher numbers of tumors with markedly larger sizes than the wild-type counterparts. Interestingly, the phenotype of the ICAD−/− mice was not associated with a significant increase in the precancerous aberrant crypt foci suggesting a potential link to tumor progression rather than initiation. More importantly, ICAD deficiency was associated with severe genomic instability as assessed by array comparative genomic hybridization. Such genomic instability consisted most prominently of amplifications but with sizable deletions as compared to the wild-type counterparts affecting several cancer-related genes including RAF-1, GSN, LMO3, and Fzd6 independently of p53. Altogether, our results present a viable case for the involvement of ICAD deficiency in colon carcinogenesis and show that apoptosis and genomic instability may comprise the means by which such deficiency may contribute to the process of increasing susceptibility to carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2093776400,"Brain serotonin homeostasis is crucially maintained by the serotonin transporter (5-HTT), and its down-regulation has been linked to increased vulnerability for anxiety- and depression-related behavior. Studies in 5-HTT knockout (5-HTT(-/-)) rodents have associated inherited reduced functional expression of 5-HTT with increased sensitivity to adverse as well as rewarding environmental stimuli, and in particular cocaine hyperresponsivity. 5-HTT down-regulation may affect normal neuronal wiring of implicated corticolimbic cerebral structures. To further our understanding of its contribution to potential alterations in basal functional and structural properties of neural network configurations, we applied resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), pharmacological MRI of cocaine-induced activation, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 5-HTT(-/-) rats and wild-type controls (5-HTT(+/+)). We found that baseline functional connectivity values and cocaine-induced neural activity within the corticolimbic network was not significantly altered in 5-HTT(-/-) versus 5-HTT(+/+) rats. Similarly, DTI revealed mostly intact white matter structural integrity, except for a reduced fractional anisotropy in the genu of the corpus callosum of 5-HTT(-/-) rats. At the macroscopic level, analyses of complex graphs constructed from either functional connectivity values or structural DTI-based tractography results revealed that key properties of brain network organization were essentially similar between 5-HTT(+/+) and 5-HTT(-/-) rats. The individual tests for differences between 5-HTT(+/+) and 5-HTT(-/-) rats were capable of detecting significant effects ranging from 5.8% (fractional anisotropy) to 26.1% (pharmacological MRI) and 29.3% (functional connectivity). Tentatively, lower fractional anisotropy in the genu of the corpus callosum could indicate a reduced capacity for information integration across hemispheres in 5-HTT(-/-) rats. Overall, the comparison of 5-HTT(-/-) and wild-type rats suggests mostly limited effects of 5-HTT genotype on MRI-based measures of brain morphology and function."

This study was directed to evaluate the immunoexpression of LPA-1, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis markers in preneoplastic lesions induced with cadmium chloride in rat prostate.The following parameters were calculated in ventral prostate of normal rats and rats that received Cd in drinking water during 24 months: percentages of cells immunoreactive to LPA-1 (LILPA1), PCNA (LIPCNA), MCM7 (LIMCM7), ubiquitin (LIUBI), apoptotic cells (LIAPO), and p53 (LIp53); volume fraction of Bcl-2 (VFBcl-2); and length of microvessels per unit of volume (LVMV/mm3). Data were analyzed using Student's t-test and Pearson correlation test.The LILPA1 in dysplastic lesions and normal epithelium of Cd-treated rats was significantly higher than those in the control group. Markers of proliferation were significantly increased in dysplastic lesions, whereas some apoptotic markers were significantly decreased. No significant differences between groups were found in VFBcl-2. Dysplastic lesions showed a significant increase of LIp53. The length of microvessels per unit of volume was elevated in dysplastic acini. Statistically significant correlations were found only between LILPA1 and LIUBI.Our results suggest that LPA-1 might be implicated in dysplastic lesions induced by cadmium chloride development. More studies are needed to confirm its potential contribution to the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2005471330,"The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway is a multi-member signaling cascade whose basic components are found in all animals. One member, BMP3, which arose more recently in evolution and is found only in deuterostomes, serves a unique role as an antagonist to both the canonical BMP and Activin pathways. However, the mechanisms that control BMP3 expression, and the cis-regulatory regions mediating this regulation, remain poorly defined. With this in mind, we sought to identify the Bmp3 promoter in mouse (M. musculus) through functional and comparative genomic analyses. We found that the minimal promoter required for expression in resides within 0.8 kb upstream of Bmp3 in a region that is highly conserved with rat (R. norvegicus). We also found that an upstream region abutting the minimal promoter acts as a repressor of the minimal promoter in HEK293T cells and osteoblasts. Strikingly, a portion of this region is conserved among all available eutherian mammal genomes (47/47), but not in any non-eutherian animal (0/136). We also identified multiple conserved transcription factor binding sites in the Bmp3 upstream ECR, suggesting that this region may preserve common cis-regulatory elements that govern Bmp3 expression across eutherian mammals. Since dysregulation of BMP signaling appears to play a role in human health and disease, our findings may have application in the development of novel therapeutics aimed at modulating BMP signaling in humans."

This study set out to explore the possibility that urinary calculi (UC) and PC may share an association by conducting a case-control study on a population-based database in Taiwan.The cases of this study included 2,900 subjects ≥ 40 years-old who had received their first-time diagnosis of PC and 14,500 randomly selected controls without PC. Conditional logistic regressions were employed to explore the association between PC and having been previously diagnosed with UC.We found that prior UC was found among 608 (21.0%) cases and 2,037 (14.1%) controls (p<0.001). Conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that compared to controls, the odds ratio (OR) of prior UC for cases was 1.63 (95% CI = 1.47-1.80). Furthermore, we found that cases were more likely to have been previously diagnosed with kidney calculus (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.42-2.05), bladder calculus (OR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.32-3.23), unspecified calculus (OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.37-2.00), and ≥2 locations of UC (OR = 1.73; 1.47-2.02) than controls. However, there was no significant relationship between PC and prior ureter calculus. We also found that of the patients with UC, there was no significant difference between PC and treatment method.This investigation detected an association between PC and prior UC. These results highlight a potential target population for PC screening."
https://openalex.org/W2065904376,"The role of the mesothelial layer in the peritoneal spreading of cancer cells is only partially clarified. Here we attempted to better define the mesothelial contribution to the tumor cell adhesion using a direct adhesion test applied to human primary cultures of mesothelial cells (HPMCs) derived from the peritoneal washes of patients with gastric and colorectal cancers. Gastric and colon carcinoma cells were seeded on different mesothelial monolayers and quantitative fluorescence analysis was performed to analyze their growth and adhesive properties. The adhesion of the cancer cells was not affected by the origin of the HPMCs when derived from patients with different cancers or with benign disease. In contrast, the high levels of ICAM1 expression and ROS production, which characterize these senescent mesothelial cells, enhanced the tumor cell adhesion. These results suggest that the mesothelial adhesive properties are dependent on the cell senescence, while are not affected by the tumor environment. The use of peritoneal washes as a source to isolate HPMCs provides a practical and reliable tool for the in vitro analysis of the mesothelial conditions affecting the peritoneal carcinomatosis."
https://openalex.org/W1990859895,"The physiological and pathological functions of angiotensin II are largely mediated through activating the cell surface angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transport of newly synthesized AT1R from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface remain poorly defined. Here we demonstrated that the C-terminus (CT) of AT1R directly and strongly bound to tubulin and the binding domains were mapped to two consecutive Lys residues at positions 310 and 311 in the CT membrane-proximal region of AT1R and the acidic CT of tubulin, suggestive of essentially ionic interactions between AT1R and tubulin. Furthermore, mutation to disrupt tubulin binding dramatically inhibited the cell surface expression of AT1R, arrested AT1R in the ER, and attenuated AT1R-mediated signaling measured as ERK1/2 activation. These data demonstrate for the first time that specific Lys residues in the CT juxtamembrane region regulate the processing of AT1R through interacting with tubulin. These data also suggest an important role of the microtubule network in the cell surface transport of AT1R."
https://openalex.org/W2025239761,"The potassium channel antagonist 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) improves a variety of motor abnormalities associated with disorders of the cerebellum. The most rigorous quantitative data relate to 4-AP's ability to improve eye movement deficits in humans referable to dysfunction of the cerebellar flocculus. Largely based on work in the ataxic mouse mutant tottering (which carries a mutation of the Cacna1a gene of the P/Q voltage-activated calcium channel), 4-AP is hypothesized to function by enhancing excitability or rhythmicity of floccular Purkinje cells. We tested this hypothesis by determining whether systemic or intrafloccular administration of 4-AP would ameliorate the eye movement deficits in tottering that are attributable to flocculus dysfunction, including the reductions in amplitude of the yaw-axis vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and vision-enhanced vestibulo-ocular reflex (VVOR), and the optokinetic reflex (OKR) about yaw and roll axes. Because tottering's deficits increase with age, both young and elderly mutants were tested to detect any age-dependent 4-AP effects. 4-AP failed to improve VOR, VVOR, and OKR gains during sinusoidal stimuli, although it may have reduced the tendency of the mutants' responses to VOR and VVOR to decline over the course of a one-hour recording session. For constant-velocity optokinetic stimuli, 4-AP generated some enhancement of yaw OKR and upward-directed roll OKR, but the effects were also seen in normal C57BL/6 controls, and thus do not represent a specific reversal of the electrophysiological consequences of the tottering mutation. Data support a possible extra-floccular locus for the effects of 4-AP on habituation and roll OKR. Unilateral intrafloccular 4-AP injections did not affect ocular motility, except to generate mild eye elevations, consistent with reduced floccular output. Because 4-AP did not produce the effects expected if it normalized outputs of floccular Purkinje cells, there is a need for further studies to elucidate the drug's mechanism of action on cerebellar motor dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1968114029,"In this study we aim to boost the functional output of the intra-kidney islet transplantation for diabetic patients using a tissue engineered polymeric scaffold. This highly porous electrospun scaffold featured randomly distributed fibers composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) and poliglecaprone (PGC). It successfully sustained murine islets in vitro for up to 4 weeks without detected cytotoxicity. The in vivo study showed that the islet population proliferated by 89% within 12 weeks when they were delivered by the scaffold but only 18% if freely injected. Correspondingly, the islet population delivered by the scaffold unleashed a greater capability to produce insulin that in turn further drove down the blood glucose within 12 weeks after the surgery. Islets delivered by the scaffold most effectively prevented diabetic deterioration of kidney as evidenced by the lack of a kidney or glomerular enlargement and physiological levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen and albumin through week 12 after the surgery. Unlike traditional wisdom in diabetic research, the mechanistic study suggested that monocytes chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was responsible for the improved preservation of renal functions. This study revealed a therapeutic role of MCP-1 in rescuing kidneys in diabetic patients, which can be integrated into a tissue engineered scaffold to simultaneously preserved renal functions and islet transplantation efficacy. Also, this study affords a simple yet effective solution to improve the clinical output of islet transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W2031495969,"Treated biosolids have been applied to 750-ha of a Pinus radiata forest plantation on Rabbit Island near Nelson City in New Zealand since 1996. A long-term research trial was established in 1997 to investigate the effects of the biosolids applications on the receiving environment and tree growth. An analysis of the likely economic impact of biosolids application shows that biosolids application has been beneficial. Stem volume of the high treatment (biosolids applied at 600 kg N ha(-1) every three years) was 36% greater than the control treatment (no biosolids applied), and stem volume of the standard treatment (300 kg N ha(-1)) was 27% greater than the control treatment at age 18 years of age. Biosolids treatments have effectively transformed a low productivity forest site to a medium productivity site. Although this increased productivity has been accompanied by some negative influences on wood quality attributes with reduced wood stiffness, wood density, and larger branches, an economic analysis shows that the increased stem volume and greater average log diameter in the biosolids treatments outweighs these negative effects. The high and standard biosolids treatments are predicted to increase the net stumpage value of logs by 24% and 14% respectively at harvesting, providing a large positive impact on the forest owner's economic return."
