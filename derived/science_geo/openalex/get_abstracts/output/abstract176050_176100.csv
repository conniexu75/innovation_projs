Here we measure how long the drop remains in contact with the solid during the shock, a problem that was considered by Hertz4 for a bouncing ball. Our findings could help to quantify the efficiency of water-repellent surfaces (super-hydrophobic solids5) and to improve water-cooling of hot solids, which is limited by the rebounding of drops6 as well as by temperature effects."

Here bulk cytosolic constituents and organelles become sequestered in specialized autophagic vesicles, which then deliver their cargo to the vacuole for degradation. In yeasts, genetic screens have identified two novel post-translational modification pathways remarkably similar to ubiquitination that are required for autophagy. From searches of the Arabidopsisgenome, we have identified gene families encoding proteins related to both the APG8 and −12 polypeptide tags and orthologs for all components required for their attachment. A single APG7gene encodes the ATP-dependent activating enzyme that initiates both conjugation pathways. Phenotypic analysis of anAPG7 disruption indicates that it is not essential for normal growth and development in Arabidopsis. However, theapg7-1 mutant is hypersensitive to nutrient limiting conditions and displays premature leaf senescence. mRNAs for both APG7 and APG8 preferentially accumulate as leaves senesce, suggesting that both conjugation pathways are up-regulated during the senescence syndrome. These findings show that the APG8/12 conjugation pathways have been conserved in plants and may have important roles in autophagic recycling, especially during situations that require substantial nitrogen and carbon mobilization.

Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 845-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,2Vierstra R.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 275-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Especially critical is the degradation of protein, given the importance of reused amino acids to the nitrogen and carbon economy. Selective protein removal is accomplished primarily by the ubiquitin (Ub)1/26 S proteasome pathway (3Callis J. Vierstra R.D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). In this pathway, the covalent attachment of Ubs is used as a signal to target specific proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Another major recycling system employs the vacuole, or its animal equivalent, the lysosome, as a lytic organelle (5Marty F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 6Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Here cytosolic proteins are delivered to the vacuole and then degraded by a wide variety of vacuolar proteases. In some situations, entire organelles can be targets (7Dunn W.A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Unlike the Ub/26 S proteasome pathway, vacuolar proteolysis is for the most part non-selective, thus targeting proteins indiscriminately. As a consequence protein turnover by the vacuole is thought to play less of a role in cellular regulation and a more prominent role under conditions when rapid remobilization and resorption of nutrients are crucial. These conditions include nutrient deprivation and environmental stress and developmental periods that require extensive cell and organ remodeling such as senescence and programmed cell death (5Marty F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 6Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The vacuole degrades cytoplasm by three unique but overlapping mechanisms, chaperone-assisted import, microautophagy, and macroautophagy (6Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 7Dunn W.A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 8Klionsky D.J.

Chaperone-assisted import is activated during starvation; it employs Hsp70-related proteins that help transport individual proteins directly into the vacuole without the use of a vesiculated intermediate (9Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 6-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microautophagy defines the sequestration of cytosol by invaginations of the tonoplast, thus forming small intravacuolar vesicles. These vesicles and their cargo are then broken down by resident vacuole hydrolases (7Dunn W.A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In methylotrophic yeasts for example, microautophagy is important for removing peroxisomes in a process called pexophagy, as the cells switch from methanol to glucose metabolism (6Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 7Dunn W.A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy involves the engulfment of large portions of cytoplasm by vesicles called autophagosomes (5Marty F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 6Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 8Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). These vesicles appear to arise from the endoplasmic reticulum as provacuole tubules; as the tubules elongate, they form long threaded structures that eventually encircle portions of cytoplasm in a cage-like structure. Autophagosomes are then created when these threads fuse to seal completely the region in a double-membrane compartment. The outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the tonoplast thus releasing the internal vesicle into the vacuole where its cargo is degraded in a process similar to microautophagy. Although both macro- and microautophagy have been observed and their morphological characteristics have been described in plants (10Van Der Wilden W. Herman E.M. Chrispeels M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 428-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Herman E.M. Baumgartner B. Chrispeels M.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 24: 226-235PubMed Google Scholar, 12Toyooka K. Okamoto T.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms underpinning these processes are not understood. One of the main barriers has been the paucity of molecular markers for autophagic vesicles and lack of mutants that impair their assembly and delivery. To date, the only known plant vacuole mutant isvacuoleless-1, which encodes an essential gene required for organelle assembly (17Rojo E. Gillmor C.S. Kovaleva V. Somerville C.R. Raikhel N.V. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 303-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, substantial progress has been made recently with yeasts using genetic screens to identify autophagy-deficient mutants. These include mutants inSaccharomyces cerevisiae sensitive to starvation (autophagy or apg (18Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar,19Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar)) or defective in cytoplasm to vacuolartargeting (cvt (20Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar)), and the isolation of mutants in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris blocked in pexophagy (glucose-stimulatedautophagy or gsa (21Yuan W. Stromhaug P.E. Dunn W.A., Jr. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)). Many of theapg/cvt/gsa mutants simultaneously abrogate microautophagy, macroautophagy, and pexophagy, indicating that the corresponding proteins participate in steps common to each of these processes. However, the mutants still retain functioning vacuoles indicating that they do not alter vacuolar ontogeny. Characterizations of a subset of yeastapg/cvt/gsa mutants have identified two novel protein conjugation pathways required for autophagy (22Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 23Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the tags are APG8 and −12, small proteins of 117 and 186 amino acids, respectively. Although bearing little sequence similarity to Ub, APG8 and −12 become attached to other cellular factors by an enzymatic cascade remarkably similar to ubiquitination (8Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, 24Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, the first step of each pathway requires the activity of APG7 (also known as CVT2 and GSA7). This E1 activates both APG8 and −12 by first directing the formation of a phosphoanhydride bond between the AMP moiety of ATP and the C-terminal glycine of the tag. Then APG7 becomes linked to the tag via a high energy thiol ester bond between the glycine moiety of the tag and a unique cysteine in APG7. APG7 subsequently donates the activated tag via transesterification to a unique cysteine within an E2. For APG8 and −12, this E2 activity is provided by APG3 and −10, respectively. The E2-bound tag is then donated to appropriate targets. In yeast, APG12 becomes attached to a single target, APG5, via an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of APG12 and a single lysine (Lys-149) in APG5 (22Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). In contrast, APG8 is bound to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) via an amide bond between the C-terminal glycine of APG8 and the terminal amino group in this lipid (23Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). By an unknown sequence of events, production of the APG12-APG5 and APG8-PE conjugates then promotes the formation of autophagic vesicles and their subsequent delivery to the vacuole. The yeast APG8 pathway also requires an additional protease step directed by APG4, which removes an extra C-terminal amino acid (arginine) in the APG8 precursor to expose the glycine essential for conjugation (Fig. 1). Orthologs for several yeast APG proteins have been discovered recently in animals, suggesting that this autophagic system is present in all eukaryotes (21Yuan W. Stromhaug P.E. Dunn W.A., Jr. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 26Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). As a consequence, we attempted to find similar proteins in plants through searches of available genome sequences. Here we report that potential orthologs for all components of the APG8 and −12 conjugation pathways are present in Arabidopsis thaliana (see Fig. 1). An Arabidopsis T-DNA mutant that interferes with the accumulation of APG7, the ortholog of the yeast E1 required for both APG8 and −12 conjugation, is phenotypically normal under non-stressed conditions, suggesting that these two pathways are not essential in plants. However, the mutant plants show accelerated senescence and are highly sensitive to nutrient-limiting growth conditions, suggesting that these conjugation pathways become important when carbon and nitrogen remobilization is essential. The discovery of these APG genes/proteins may now provide important new tools to dissect the autophagic process in plants at the genetic, cytological, and biochemical levels. TheA. thaliana genomic and expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases (genome-www.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/) were searched by BLAST (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) for potential APG genes using the sequences of yeast and human proteins as queries. A full-length cDNA forAtAPG12a (162B16T7) and a genomic BAC fragment (T14L9) containing AtAPG7 were obtained from theArabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Ohio State University, Columbus). The complete coding sequence of APG7was determined from a reverse-transcribed (RT) PCR clone generated withPfu polymerase and the primers CATATGCACCATCATCATCATCACATGGCTGAGAAAGAAACTCCAGCA (predicted start codon underlined) and GAAGCCACCTAGTGAATATAGTCTATGGAC using A. thaliana Col-0 RNA as the template. The forward primer was designed to add codons for an N- terminal His6 tag. The product was first ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript; the NdeI-Acc65I fragment of this plasmid was isolated and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET32 (Novagen, Madison, WI) for expression of recombinant APG7 protein inEscherichia coli (see below). The complete coding sequences for AtAPG8a and AtAPG8h were determined from RT-PCR clones generated with the primers TCGCATATGGCTAAGAGTTCCTTCAAGATCTCT and GTGAGCTCAAGCAACGGTAAGAGATCCAAAGT, and TCGCATATGAAATCGTTCAAGGAACAATACA and GTGAGCTCAACCAAAGGTTTTCTCACTGCTA, respectively (predicted start and stop codons underlined). DNA sequences were determined by the PCR-based dideoxy method (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Intron/exon boundaries were identified by comparing cDNA and EST sequences with their respective genomic DNA sequences or predicted by comparing related genes. Amino acid sequence comparisons and phylogenic analyses were performed using MACBOXSHADE (Institute of Animal Health, Pirbright, UK) and ClustalW (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw), respectively. The GenBankTM accession numbers for the sequences described in this article are AF492761 (AtAPG7), P38862(ScAPG7), NP_006386 (HsAPG7), AF492759(AtAPG8a),AF492760 (AtAPG8h), NP_009475 (ScAPG8), NP_009216 (HsAPG8), AF492758(AtAPG12a), P38316 (ScAPG12), and O94817(HsAPG12). Theapg7-1 insertion mutant was identified by a PCR screen of a T-DNA-transformed population of A. thaliana ecotype WS generated by Dr. Kenneth Feldman (DuPont) using the 5′-CAATCTCTCAGAAAGATAAGATCAGCCATG or 3′-GAAGCCACCTAGTGAATATAGTCTATGGAC gene-specific primers in combination with either a left border or right border T-DNA-specific primer (28Krysan P.J. Young J.C. Tax F. Sussman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8145-8150Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The presence of this T-DNA in subsequent generations was followed by PCR and by kanamycin resistance conferred by the T-DNA. Theapg7-1 mutant was backcrossed 3 times to the wild-type WS ecotype to help eliminate secondary mutations and then the homozygous apg7-1 mutant was obtained by segregation analysis. For complementation of apg7-1, a 7.5-kb KpnI genomic DNA fragment from BAC T14L9 encompassing the APG7gene was ligated into the KpnI site of pCAMBIA 1301 (Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). TheAPG7C-S mutant with the Cys-558 codon substituted for that encoding Ser was generated by the QuickChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the primers CGAACTCTAGACCAACAAAGCACTGTTACACGCC and GGCGTGTAACAGTGCTTTGTTGGTCTAGAGTTCG (altered nucleotides underlined) and a 1.5-kb BamHI-EcoRV fragment ofAPG7 cloned into pBluescript as the template. The presence of the desired mutation and the absence of secondary mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Both pCAMBIA1301 APG7constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciensstrain C81 (pMP90) and then transformed into hemizygousapg7-1 plants using the floral dip method (29Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed seedlings (T1) were selected on medium containing 15 mg/liter hygromycin B. T2 plants homozygous for both the apg7-1allele and the APG7 transgene were identified by testing progeny for growth on 25 mg/liter kanamycin and 15 mg/liter hygromycin B and confirmed by PCR. T3 seeds were used for the phenotypic analyses. Wild-type WS, apg7-1, apg7-1/APG7, andapg7-1/APG7C-S seeds were surface-sterilized in 50% bleach, placed on Gamborg B5 (Invitrogen) agar or liquid medium, and incubated at 4 °C for 2 days. The plates or flasks were then incubated at 21 °C in 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod for long days, 8-h light/16-h dark photoperiod for short days, or in continuous light. Two weeks after germination, plants growing in a short-day photoperiod were transferred to soil and grown until seed maturation. Seeds collected from individual plants were weighed and counted. One-week-old plants growing in liquid medium under continuous light were washed two times with modified Murashige and Skoog medium lacking nitrogen and sucrose (nitrogen/carbon (N/C)-free medium: Murashige and Skoog micronutrient salts (Invitrogen), 3 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMES (pH 5.7)) and then grown in this N/C-free medium. One-week-old plants grown on Gamborg B5 agar were transferred to N/C-free agar medium for further growth and subsequently transferred back to Gamborg B5 agar. For the detached leaf assay, first and second true leaves were detached with a sharp blade from 2-week-old plants grown under a long-day photoperiod on Gamborg B5 medium and placed in the dark with their abaxial sides down on 3MM paper wetted with 3 mm MES (pH 5.7) with or without 1 μm kinetin (Sigma). Leaves were collected at the indicated times, blotted dry, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and used for chlorophyll, protein, and RNA isolation. Chlorophyll was extracted from frozen leaves into 1 ml of 96% EtOH by overnight incubation at 4 °C and quantified spectrophotometrically (30Wintermans J.F.G.M. De Mots A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 109: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). Values given were per leaf and were expressed as a percentage of the maximum chlorophyll level for each set of treatments. Total soluble protein was isolated from detached leaves or soil-grown plants by homogenization in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mmNa4EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm KCl, and 30 mm Na2S2O5, and the extracts were clarified by low speed centrifugation (31Doelling J.H. Yan N. Kurepa J. Walker J. Vierstra R.D. Plant J. 2001; 27: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and either stained with silver or transferred to Hybond-C Extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for immunoblot analysis using alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) for detection. Sample sizes were adjusted to reflect a per leaf basis. For production of anti-APG7 antibodies, pET32His6APG7 was introduced intoE. coli BL21 Codon Plus (Stratagene) for expression of recombinant APG7. Following a 3-h induction of log phase cells with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, inclusion bodies were collected, solubilized in urea, and injected into rabbits (Polyclonal Antibody Service, Madison, WI). Antibodies against the large subunit of spinach Rubisco and the CH-42 subunit of pea magnesium-protoporphyrin chelatase (32Guo R. Luo M. Weinstein J.D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 605-615Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were provided by Drs. Archie Portis and Tanya Falbel, respectively. The anti-PBA1 and RPT2 antibodies were as described (33Smalle J. Kurepa J. Yang P. Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Durski A. Vierstra R.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from detached leaves or soil-grown plants using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA for RT-PCR was treated with DNase RQI (Promega, Madison, WI) prior to the synthesis of first-strand cDNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega). The primer was either theAPG7 3′ gene-specific primer GAAGCCACCTAGTGAATATAGTCTATGGAC (primer 2, Fig. 5) or the primer ATTGAATCCTGAGGTGCAA (primer 4, Fig. 5). PCR included 41 cycles with Ex-Taq polymerase (Panvera, Madison, WI), the first strand synthesis primer, and either the APG7 5′ gene-specific primer CAATCTCTCAGAAAGATAAGATCAGCCATG (primer 1, Fig. 5) or the primer GTTTCTTCTGATTCAAAAGC (primer 3, Fig.5). Products were visualized following 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and EtBr staining. For RNA gel blot analysis, total RNA (sample size adjusted to reflect an equal leaf number) was size-separated by electrophoresis through 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond-XL membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using 20× SSC (1× = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m Na3citrate). RNA probes were synthesized at 37 °C from linearized pGEMT (Promega) or pBluescript (Stratagene) cDNA constructs using the appropriate RNA polymerase (T3, T7, or SP6) and [α-32P]UTP. Membranes were hybridized overnight at 65 °C and washed according to Ref. 34Kurepa J. Herouart D. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar prior to autoradiography. Ten-day-oldArabidopsis seedlings were plasmolysed in 0.5 mmannitol, 10 mm CaCl2, 20 mmNH4NO3, 30 mm sucrose, 1 mm KNO3, 2 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mmpolyvinylpyrrolidone-40, 5 mm MES (pH 5.7) for 1 h before overnight digestion in 10 ml/g fresh weight of Protoplast Isolation Enzyme Solution II (Sigma). Protoplasts were collected and stained with 3.5 mm neutral red (NR) (35Di Sansebastiano G.P. Paris N. Marc-Martin S. Neuhaus J.M. Plant J. 1998; 15: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) or 50 μm monochlorobimane (MCB, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (13Swanson S.J. Bethke P.C. Jones R.L. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) dissolved in the plasmolysis solution. Staining with NR was observed by light microscopy, and staining with MCB was visualized by fluorescence microscopy using 365 nm excitation and 395 nm emission filters. By reiterative BLAST searches, we attempted to find counterparts to many of the yeastAPG/CVT/GSA genes (6Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 24Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) in the near-complete genome data base of Arabidopsis(www.arabidopsis.org/BLAST). Remarkably, potential orthologs for almost all loci were discovered including APG1–10, −12–13 (Figs.2–4 and data not shown). For clarity, we have adopted the same nomenclature developed by Ohsumi (24Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) for these APG loci. Unlike yeast where each protein is encoded by a single gene (24Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), many of theArabidopsis proteins are encoded by two or more loci, suggesting a greater complexity of the APG system in plants. However, not all loci were detected; notably absent were obvious counterparts toAPG14, −16, and −17, suggesting that they have substantially diverged during evolution. Multiple cDNAs for many of the APG genes were also detected in various EST collections from Arabidopsis, rice, soybeans,Medicago, tomato, potato, corn, barley, wheat, sorghum, andChlamydomonas to name a few, implying that this autophagic system may be active in all plants. Importantly, a collection of Arabidopsis genes predicted to encode all components of the APG8 and −12 conjugation pathways was identified (8Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, 24Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). These include loci for APG8 and −12, the E1-APG7, the E2s-APG3 and −10, the target APG5, and the protease APG4 (see Fig.1). In all cases, the positionally important amino acids necessary for enzymatic activity and/or function are present. Nine loci encode a family of APG8 proteins with 69–96% amino acid sequence similarity to each other and 73–90% similarity to yeast APG8 (Fig. 2B). Intron/exon arrangements are also similar among theArabidopsis gene family, indicating that this family arose from a common progenitor (Fig. 2A). Like yeast and human APG8 (23Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 26Tanida I.

Phylogenic analysis of the APG8 family revealed that APG8a–g cluster into one clade of 84–96% amino acid sequence similarity that also includes yeast APG8 (Fig. 2C). APG8h and -i grouped into a separate clade; they are only 69–75% similar to members of the other clade and lack extra residues that protect the C-terminal glycine. ESTs are available for seven of the nine APG8 genes, the exceptions beingAPG8f and APG8i, indicating that most are expressed. Two Arabidopsis genes were identified that encode 94- and 96-amino acid proteins related to yeast APG12 (Fig. 3A). A full-length EST was identified in the data bases for onlyAPG12a, which was used to verify the correct coding region. No ESTs were available for APG12b; its gene structure was predicted by alignment with APG12a and its yeast and animal orthologs. The predicted amino acid sequences for APG12a and -b are 95% similar to each other and 36–45% similar to their yeast and human orthologs (22Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T.

Both Arabidopsis isoforms end in the C-terminal glycine essential for conjugation, indicating that post-translational processing is not needed to generate active APG12 proteins. The human and yeast orthologs of ArabidopsisAPG12a and -b are substantially larger, due to the presence of long hydrophilic N-terminal extensions of 45 and 90 residues, respectively (22Mizushima N.

Here we show that the treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 or its chemotherapeutic analog, EB 1089, releases Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. The increase in [Ca2+]i was associated with the activation of a calcium-dependent cysteine protease, μ-calpain. Interestingly, ectopic expression of a calcium-binding protein, calbindin-D28k, in MCF-7 cells not only attenuated the elevation in [Ca2+]i and calpain activation, but also reduced death triggered by vitamin D compounds. Similarly, the inhibition of calpain activity by structurally unrelated chemical inhibitors increased the survival of the cells and reduces the amount of annexin V-positive cells. Despite the complete absence of effector caspase activation, transmission electron microscopy of MCF-7 cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 or EB 1089 revealed apoptosis-like morphology characterized by the condensed cytoplasm, nuclei, and chromatin.

A desired profile of such analogs consists of a high potency for induction of antiproliferative effects, differentiation, and apoptosis combined with reduced effects on systemic calcium homeostasis compared with the parental compound. The vitamin D analog EB 1089 displays such a profile and is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of cancer (5Mathiasen I.S. Colston K.W. Binderup L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Colston K.W. Mackay A.G. James S.Y. Binderup L. Chander S. Coombes R.C. Biochem.

Des. 2000; 6: 803-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the signaling pathways mediating vitamin D-induced cell death. A single family of proteases, the caspases, has until recently been considered the pivotal executioner of all programmed cell death (8Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar). Therefore it is interesting to note that breast cancer cells treated with vitamin D compounds die in the complete absence of effector caspase activation (4Mathiasen I.S. Lademann U. Jäättelä M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the lack of the caspase activation, dying cells present several characteristics of apoptosis, i.e. rounding, shrinkage, and detachment of cells as well as DNA strand breaks and DNA fragmentation (4Mathiasen I.S. Lademann U. Jäättelä M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sergeev I.N. Colby J. Norman A.W. Norman A.W. Bouillon R. Thomasset M.

Furthermore, antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL can rescue breast cancer cells from death induced by the active form of vitamin D or its analogs (4Mathiasen I.S. Lademann U. Jäättelä M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar). This apoptosis-like death program appears also independent of cysteine cathepsins and p53 tumor suppressor protein (4Mathiasen I.S. Lademann U. Jäättelä M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mathiasen I.S. Hansen C.M. Foghsgaard L. Jäättelä M. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Instead, the elevation in the intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) brought about by vitamin D compounds correlates with the induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells (9Sergeev I.N. Colby J.

Data from studies employing various pharmaceutical modulators of calcium homeostasis have suggested that the elevation in [Ca2+]i is a sufficient signal to induce apoptosis in several model systems, even though it may also have the opposite effect in other systems (14Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Further supporting the idea that the elevation in [Ca2+]i may mediate apoptosis, studies based on modulated expression of calcium-binding proteins, calbindin-D28k or glucose-regulated proteins GRP78 and GRP94, have shown that Ca2+ buffering can confer protection against various apoptotic stimuli (15Dowd D.R.

The calcium-dependent neutral cysteine proteases, calpains, are frequently activated in apoptosis models involving elevated [Ca2+]i (20Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 21Ray S.K. Fidan M. Nowak M.W. Wilford G.G. Hogan E.L. Banik N.L.

Lett. 2000; 279: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Two forms of calpains, μ-calpain and m-calpain or type I and type II calpain, respectively, are ubiquitously expressed in human cells (23Wang K.K. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 24Tidball J.G. Spencer M.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The active forms of the enzymes consist of a variable large subunit (80 kDa) and a common small subunit (30 kDa). To become active, calpains require an elevation in [Ca2+]i, and the autoproteolytic cleavage of the enzymes further enhances their activity. Whereas m-calpain requires Ca2+ at a millimolar range, micromolar concentrations are enough for the activation of μ-calpain (in vitro; lower in cells). So far no difference in the substrate specificity of the two isozymes has been found. Growing evidence suggests that calpains may play a central role in the execution of apoptosis either upstream or downstream of caspases in, e.g.glucocorticoid-treated and irradiated thymocytes, neuronal cells exposed to various stresses, or MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with β-lapachone (20Nakagawa T.

Interestingly, caspases and calpains share several substrates (e.g. endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin, fodrins, focal adhesion kinase, calmodulin-dependent kinases, actin, vimentin, and keratins), suggesting that these enzymes may execute the cell in a partially indistinguishable manner (23Wang K.K. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar).

This study was undertaken to enlighten the poorly understood signaling pathway mediating vitamin D-induced caspase-independent death of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The focus was centered on finding a responsible protease for this form of cell death and characterization with respect to the ultrastructural morphology of the dying cells. 1,25(OH)2D3and EB 1089 were generous gifts from Christina Mørk Hansen and Lise Binderup (LEO Pharmaceutical Products, Ballerup, Denmark). Both compounds were stored at −20 °C and diluted in isopropyl alcohol. Control cells were always treated with the isopropyl alcohol vehicle (1% v/v). TNF was a generous gift from Anthony Cerami (Kenneth Warren Laboratories, Tarrytown, NY). Recombinant human TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Alexis Corp., San Diego) was used with 2 μg/ml anti-FLAG® M2 monoclonal antibody (F3165, Sigma). N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (calpain inhibitor I) dissolved in ethanol to 20 mm was used at 10 μm final concentration.N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met-CHO (calpain inhibitor II) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to 20 mm was used at 20 μmfinal concentration.

All were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co.Z-Val-Ala-d,l-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) was dissolved in ethanol to 10 mm and used at 1 μm. The compound was purchased from Bachem (Bubbendorf, Switzerland). Thapsigargin, Pluronic F-127 and fura-2/AM were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The pEBS7-calbindin-D28k plasmid was created by subcloning a 1-kb EcoRI fragment of pGEM-calbindin (kindly provided by Dr. Diane Dowd, St. Louis University, St. Louis, MO) containing the sequence encoding for the complete chicken calbindin-D28k(33Wilson P.W.

Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305PubMed Google Scholar) of MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells with a sensitivity to vitamin D-induced apoptosis comparable with that of parental cells was used throughout the study (4Mathiasen I.S. Lademann U. Jäättelä M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar, 10Danielsson C. Mathiasen I.S. James S.Y. Nayeri S. Bretting C. Hansen C.M. Colston K.W. Carlberg C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The MCF-cont and MCF-calb28 cells are pools of MCF-7S8 cells transfected with empty pEBS7 vector or pEBS7-calbindin-D28k, respectively. Cells were transfected by electroporation (960 microfarads, 330 V) and selected for hygromycin (0.15 mg/ml) resistance. The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Bio Whittaker Europe, Belgium), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The transfection did not change the proliferation rate of the MCF-cont and the MCF-calb28 cells compared with the parental cell line under normal growth conditions. The cells were tested regularly and found negative for mycoplasma. The MTT tetrazolium assay was used to measure the density of viable cells as described previously (4Mathiasen I.S. Lademann U. Jäättelä M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar). The Cell Death Detection ELISATM kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to quantitate DNA fragmentation as described previously (11Mathiasen I.S. Hansen C.M. Foghsgaard L. Jäättelä M. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The [Ca2+]i was measured using fluorescence ratiometric high resolution digital imaging employing the Ca2+ indicator fura-2/AM as described previously (13Sergeev I.N. Rhoten W.B. Endocrine. 1998; 9: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Sergeev I.N. Rhoten W.B. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on coverslips were loaded with 2 μmfura-2/AM (cell-permeable acetoxymethyl ester) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide and 0.01% Pluronic F-127 for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were maintained in phosphate-buffered saline for a 15-min recovery period (to allow the intracellular esterases to cleave the dye completely to the cell-impermeable form) and analyzed directly thereafter, retention never exceeding 30 min. The dynamics of intracellular Ca2+ were assessed with cells placed in the microincubation chamber (37.0 °C ± 0.2 °C) on a Nikon Eclipse TE-300 inverted microscope equipped for fluorescence digital ratiometric imaging (Fryer Co., Huntley, IL). The images were captured using a Nikon Super Fluor 40× oil immersion objective and CoolSnapFX digital CCD camera (Photometrics, Trenton, NJ), ratioed (340/380 nm excitation, 510 nm emission) on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and stored for analysis. Mobilization of Ca2+ from the ER stores was accomplished by using thapsigargin, which specifically inhibits ER Ca2+-ATPase and results in the rapid Ca2+release from the ER. To measure Ca2+ release from the ER stores, 1 μm thapsigargin was added to the cell preparations after recording the basal [Ca2+]i for 1–3 min, and the peak values of the [Ca2+]i increase were measured. The fluorescence of the Ca2+ signal was calibrated at the end of experiments (35Sergeev I.N. Rhoten W.B. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Ca2+ saturation was achieved by adding 5 μm ionomycin in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ and virtually zero Ca2+by the further addition of 10 mm EGTA; 5 mmMnCl2 was subsequently added to obtain background fluorescence. The concentration of vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide, never exceeded 0.1%; the vehicle did not affect [Ca2+]i at this concentration. Image and data analyses were performed as described previously (35Sergeev I.N. Rhoten W.B. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,36Sergeev I.N. Rhoten W.B. Carney M.D. Endocrine. 1996; 5: 335-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of protein samples separated by SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described before (11Mathiasen I.S. Hansen C.M. Foghsgaard L. Jäättelä M. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cell samples were separated by 8% (detection of fodrin, μ-calpain, calpastatin, and 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein, Hsc70) or 12% SDS-PAGE (calbindin-D28k). After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred onto a Hybond ECL membrane (AmershamBiosciences) in a transfer buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0,05% w/v SDS, 10% v/v methanol) using a semidry blotter (Millipore, Amicon) and detected with the respective antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (AmershamBiosciences). The primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal antibodies against calbindin-D28k (1:100) (Sigma) (the estimated size of the detected protein was, however, double the expected size), fodrin (1:1,000) (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA, USA), μ-calpain (1:1,000) (monoclonal antibody 3082, Chemicon), calpastatin (1:500) (monoclonal antibody 3084, Chemicon), and Hsc70 (1:8,000) (Boris A. Margulis, St. Petersburg, Russia). The appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from DAKO A/S (Glostrup, Denmark). Cells (5 × 106 cells/sample) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and detached cells from medium, as well as cells detached by trypsinization, were collected, centrifuged, and washed twice in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2) before incubation in binding buffer supplemented with 1:100 annexin V (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 μg/ml propidium iodide for 20 min at room temperature protected from light. After staining, the cells were handled ice-cold, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline with calcium and magnesium before analyzing using a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer. The amount of cells presented in the plots was 20,000. The cells were grown in Petri dishes and fixed for 10 min in 50% Karnovsky solution at 25 °C. Cells were collected by scraping with a rubber policeman, transferred to a centrifugation tube, and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min. After removal of the supernatant the pellet was washed once and subsequently stored in 70% Karnovsky solution at 4 °C until embedding. After two 10-min washings in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer and centrifugation as above, the pellet was embedded in agar, cut into smaller cubes, and fixed in osmium and embedded in Epon according to standard procedures. Ultrathin sections were collected on Formwar-coated copper grids, stained according to standard procedures, and examined in a JEOL 1210 electron microscope. After treatment of MCF-7 cells with 1,25(OH)2D3, the appearance of apoptotic cells becomes evident first after 3–5 days (4Mathiasen I.S. Lademann U. Jäättelä M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar). During this relatively long latent period the cells are growth-arrested, and unknown cellular changes may occur. Previous studies have shown that the treatment of breast cancer cells with vitamin D compounds results in the elevation of [Ca2+]i (9Sergeev I.N. Colby J. Norman A.W. Norman A.W. Bouillon R. Thomasset M. Vitamin D Endocrine System: Structural, Biological, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. University of California, Riverside, CA2000: 399-402Google Scholar,12Vandewalle B. Hornez L. Wattez N.

Endocrine. 1998; 9: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To test whether this calcium signal plays a role in vitamin D-induced apoptosis, we introduced a cDNA encoding a calcium-binding protein, calbindin-D28k, into MCF-7 cells. Immunoblot analysis employing anti-calbindin-D28kantibodies did not reveal a detectable level of the protein in MCF-7 cells left untreated or treated with 100 nm1,25(OH)2D3 (not shown). Analysis of the MCF-7 cell pool transfected with pEBS7-calbindin-D28k and selected for hygromycin resistance (MCF-calb28) revealed a single band detectable with the anti-calbindin-D28k antibody (Fig.1A). Based on the migration in the SDS-PAGE, the size of the detected protein was double the expected size (56 kDa). Because a single anti-calbindin-D28k-reacting protein of the same size was also observed in MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with pEBS7-calbindin as well as in MG-63 osteosarcoma cells known to express calbindin-D28k (16Bellido T. Huening M. Raval-Pandya M. Manolagas S.C. Christakos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26328-26332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), but not in vector-transfected MCF-7 cells (MCF-cont), the detected protein was likely to be calbindin-D28k. As analyzed by the MTT cell density assay, 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment for up to 4 days resulted in similar growth inhibition in MCF-calb28 and MCF-cont cells (Fig.1B). Interestingly, after day 4 of the treatment, the MCF-calb28 cells were, however, clearly more resistant to 1,25(OH)2D3, suggesting that the antiproliferative effect of the compound was unaffected by the presence of calbindin-D28k, but the onset of apoptosis occurring after day 4 was inhibited. These data correlated with the microscopic examination showing clearly reduced appearance of cells with apoptotic morphology in MCF-calb28 cells compared with MCF-cont cells (not shown). Although MCF-calb28 cells were almost completely rescued from apoptosis induced by 10 nm1,25(OH)2D3, only partial inhibition was observed when a 10× higher concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3 was used. Contrary to this form of cell death, MCF-7 cell apoptosis induced by 1–10 ng/ml TNF or 10–100 ng/ml TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand was not affected by the ectopic expression of calbindin-D28k (Fig. 1Cand data not shown). To ensure that the expression of calbindin-D28k increased the cytosolic Ca2+buffering capacity of the cells (37Rhoten W.B. Sergeev I.N. Endocrine. 1994; 2: 989-995Google Scholar), the changes in [Ca2+]i induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 or EB 1089 in the MCF-calb28 cells were compared with those in similarly treated MCF-cont cells. The basal level of [Ca2+]i was not affected by calbindin-D28k expression or the treatment with the vehicle for up to 5 days (Fig.2A). The treatment of MCF-cont cells with 100 nm 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig.2B) or EB 1089 (Fig. 2C) resulted in a significant increase in the [Ca2+]i at day 3, which gradually diminished during days 4 and 5. Although calbindin-D28k did not affect the basal [Ca2+]i, the magnitude of the [Ca2+]i increase induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 2B) or EB 1089 (Fig. 2C) at days 3 and 4 was significantly attenuated. In both cell lines EB 1089 was clearly more potent in increasing [Ca2+]i than 1,25(OH)2D3. Both vitamin D compounds failed to evoke rapid (from seconds to 1 h) Ca2+ responses (data not shown), and even after a 1-day treatment the [Ca2+]i remained unchanged (Fig.2, B and C). Next, we tested whether the calcium signal evoked by vitamin D compounds originated from the ER, which serves as an important intracellular reservoir of Ca2+. Thapsigargin is a specific mobilizer of the ER Ca2+ stores and causes a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i in most cells, including the MCF-7 cells (9Sergeev I.N. Colby J. Norman A.W. Norman A.W. Bouillon R. Thomasset M. Vitamin D Endocrine System: Structural, Biological, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. University of California, Riverside, CA2000: 399-402Google Scholar, 35Sergeev I.N. Rhoten W.B. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin evoked typical Ca2+ responses in both MCF-cont and MCF-calb28 cells, but the magnitude of the [Ca2+]i increase was significantly lower in the calbindin-D28k-expressing cells, indicating that the exogenous calbindin-D28k is capable of buffering the Ca2+ released from the ER (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, treatment of the MCF-cont cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 or EB 1089 resulted in a decrease in the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ response in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2E). These results imply that vitamin D compounds cause a sustained depletion of the ER Ca2+ stores. MCF-calb28 cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 or EB 1089 for 1 day responded to thapsigargin by a lower increase in [Ca2+]i than MCF-cont cells (Fig.2D). This effect was, however, not evident at later time points (data not shown). This suggests that the buffering capacity of calbindin-D28k in the MCF-calb28 cells is exceeded during the sustained treatment of the cells with vitamin D compounds. Overall, these data indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3 or EB 1089 results in increased [Ca2+]i by inducing a sustained release of Ca2+ from the ER. Furthermore, the forced expression of calbindin-D28kincreases the Ca2+ buffering capacity of the cells, thus partially counteracting the Ca2+-mediated signaling induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 and EB 1089. To investigate whether calcium-dependent proteases, calpains, are activated during treatment of MCF-7 cells with vitamin D compounds, we analyzed protein samples from cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 or EB 1089 for characteristic signs of calpain activity by immunoblot analysis. Although caspases and calpains share a number of substrates, including fodrin and calpastatin, their cleavage during treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 or EB 1089 in MCF-7 cells would indicate calpain activity because effector caspases are not activated in this model (4Mathiasen I.S. Lademann U. Jäättelä M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, fodrin processing becomes evident in cells treated with vitamin D compounds for 4 days and increases at days 5 and 6. These data strongly suggest the presence of active calpain, and therefore we subsequently analyzed whether the μ-calpain or the intracellular inhibitor of calpain, calpastatin, was cleaved (23Wang K.K. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells express a high level of the large subunit of μ-calpain. In contrast to vehicle-treated control cells, cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 or EB 1089 also contained a cleaved form of μ-calpain, suggesting that the enzyme is, indeed, activated by vitamin D compounds (Fig. 3). Moreover, the level of the calpain substrate, calpastatin, was clearly reduced after 6 days treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 or EB 1089 (Fig. 3). Overall we conclude that the treatment of MCF-7 cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 or EB 1089 leads to the activation of μ-calpain occurring in parallel with the onset of apoptosis. The apoptosis-like cell death induced by vitamin D compounds is associated with DNA fragmentation (10Danielsson C. Mathiasen I.S. James S.Y. Nayeri S. Bretting C. Hansen C.M. Colston K.W. Carlberg C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To test whether the activation of calpain is necessary for this nuclear sign of apoptosis, the effect of protease inhibitors on the degree of vitamin D-induced DNA fragmentation was analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measuring histone-associated cytoplasmic DNA. As expected, the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk at a concentration specific for caspases (1 μm) could not inhibit the DNA fragmentation induced by a 6-day treatment with 100 nm1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig.4A). A 10× higher concentration of zVAD-fmk was also with"

Molecular insight into the role of arrestins in GPCR trafficking has suggested that arrestin interaction with clathrin, β2-adaptin (the β-subunit of the adaptor protein AP2), and phosphoinositides contributes to this process. In the present study, we have attempted to better define the molecular basis and functional role of arrestin-2 interaction with clathrin and β2-adaptin. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the C-terminal region of arrestin-2 mediated β2-adaptin and clathrin interaction with Phe-391 and Arg-395 having an essential role in β2-adaptin binding and LIELD (residues 376–380) having an essential role in clathrin binding. Interestingly, arrestin-2-R169E, an activated form of arrestin that binds to GPCRs in a phosphorylation-independent manner, has significantly enhanced binding to β2-adaptin and clathrin. This suggests that receptor-induced conformational changes in the C-terminal tail of arrestin-2 will likely play a major role in mediating arrestin interaction with clathrin-coated pits. In an effort to clarify the role of these interactions in GPCR trafficking we generated arrestin mutants that were completely and selectively defective in either clathrin (arrestin-2-ΔLIELD) or β2-adaptin (arrestin-2-F391A) interaction. Analysis of these mutants in COS-1 cells revealed that arrestin/clathrin interaction was essential for agonist-promoted internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor, while arrestin/β2-adaptin interaction appeared less critical. Arrestin-2 mutants defective in both clathrin and β2-adaptin binding functioned as effective dominant negatives in HEK293 cells and significantly attenuated β2-adrenergic receptor internalization.

G protein-coupled receptor adaptor protein β2-adrenergic receptor β-subunit of the adaptor protein AP2 bovine serum albumin glutathione S-transferase human embryonic kidney Tris-buffered saline Many transmembrane signaling systems consist of specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 that transduce the binding of a diverse array of extracellular stimuli into intracellular signaling events (1Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). GPCRs modulate the activity of numerous effector molecules including adenylyl cyclases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, non-receptor tyrosine kinases, small G proteins, phosphodiesterases, phospholipases, and ion channels. To ensure that extracellular stimuli are translated into intracellular signals of appropriate magnitude and specificity, these signaling cascades are tightly regulated. GPCRs are subject to three principle modes of regulation: desensitization, in which a receptor becomes refractory to continued stimuli; endocytosis, whereby receptors are removed from the cell surface; and down-regulation, where total cellular receptor levels are decreased (2Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 3Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). GPCR desensitization is primarily mediated by second messenger-dependent kinases, such as protein kinase A and protein kinase C, and by G protein-coupled receptor kinases. G protein-coupled receptor kinases specifically phosphorylate activated GPCRs, initiating recruitment of arrestins. Arrestins are divided into two major classes, visual and non-visual, on the basis of localization. The non-visual arrestins, arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 (also termed β-arrestin-1 and -2), are broadly distributed and have been implicated in regulating multiple processes including GPCR desensitization (4Wilden U.

While each of these interactions appears to contribute to the ability of non-visual arrestins to mediate GPCR trafficking, the mechanistic basis of this process remains unclear. Here we have attempted to better define the interactions of arrestin-2 with clathrin and β2-adaptin. We were able to generate arrestin mutants that were selectively and completely defective in either clathrin or β2-adaptin interaction. These mutants were then used to elucidate the role of these interactions in β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) trafficking. Our studies suggested that arrestin interaction with clathrin, but not β2-adaptin, is critical for β2AR internalization. Moreover, we found that arrestin-2 mutants defective in both clathrin and β-adaptin binding functioned as effective dominant negative mutants. These mutants should prove useful in better defining the role of arrestins in receptor trafficking. Reagents were generously provided by Drs.

A GST-β2-adaptin appendage (residues 700–937) fusion protein, several mutant GST-β2-adaptin fusions, and a GST-clathrin terminal domain (residues 1–579) fusion were expressed and purified on glutathione-agarose as described previously (13Krupnick JG.

Wild type and mutant arrestins were expressed in COS-1 cells by transient transfection as described previously (19Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34616-34622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Arrestin extracts were prepared by lysing the cells by freeze/thaw and Polytron disruption in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine. The extracts were centrifuged (55,000 × g, 20 min), and the supernatants were aliquoted, frozen, and stored at −80 °C until needed (extracts contained ∼2 μg of arrestin/ml). Arrestin-containing lysates (∼20 ng of arrestin) were incubated with 5 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (containing ∼50 pmol of bound GST or GST fusion protein) in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 120 mm potassium acetate, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 4 °C (in a total volume of 100 μl). The beads were then pelleted (1000 rpm, 5 min at 4 °C) and washed two to three times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold binding buffer, and bound arrestin was eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer for 10 min. The samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose, and arrestin was detected by immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal (F4C1) or rabbit polyclonal (178) anti-arrestin antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescence. To prepare brain extracts, fresh bovine brain was stripped of connective tissue and minced in ∼1 ml of homogenization buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, 0.02 mg/ml pepstatin) per mg of tissue using a Brinkman Polytron (20,000 rpm, 30 s). The homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, homogenized again (20,000 rpm, 30 s), and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 55,000 × g for 30 min, and the final supernatant (∼20 mg of protein/ml) was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. For binding of bovine brain proteins to GST-β2-adaptin, 20 μl of brain extract (∼400 μg of total protein) were incubated with 50 pmol of various GST-β2-adaptin mutant proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were washed, and bound proteins were eluted, electrophoresed, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Binding of AP180 and Eps15 to GST-β2-adaptin was visualized by probing the membrane with either anti-AP180 or anti-Eps15 monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories). COS-1 and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection was done using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. COS-1 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-β2AR and various pcDNA3-arrestin-2 constructs were stimulated with 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol for 2 min at 37 °C and then lysed in 1 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer (coIP buffer) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 55,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were incubated with 5 μg of purified polyclonal anti-β2AR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h followed by incubation with 20 μl of 50% protein A-agarose for 16 h at 4 °C to immunoprecipitate the β2AR. Immunocomplexes were then extensively washed with coIP buffer, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis for β2AR (using M1 anti-FLAG antibody, Sigma) or arrestin-2 (using mouse monoclonal anti-arrestin antibody F4C1). Internalization of FLAG-β2AR was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (20Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Briefly, COS-1 cells transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-β2AR and various arrestin constructs were split into poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well tissue culture plates after 24 h. The next day (48 h post-transfection), cells were treated with 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol and 0.1 mm ascorbate at 37 °C for 0, 15, or 30 min, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 5 min at ambient temperature, and washed three times with TBS. Cells were then blocked with TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (TBS/BSA) for 45 min, incubated with a primary antibody (M2 anti-FLAG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma), 1:2000 dilution in TBS/BSA) for 1 h, and washed three times with TBS. Colorimetric visualization of antibody binding was performed using an alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad), and samples were read at 405 nm in a microplate reader using Microplate Manager software (Bio-Rad). The reading from cells that did not express FLAG-β2AR was used as a blank. The percentage of surface receptor loss was determined by calculating the change of antibody-accessible FLAG-β2AR.

Additional studies revealed that Arg-394 and Arg-396 in arrestin-3 are critical for β2-adaptin binding (16Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), while we recently found that Phe-391 and Arg-395 (analogous to Arg-396 in arrestin-3) are essential for arrestin-2 binding to β2-adaptin (21Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.-M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In an attempt to more completely define the binding interface of arrestin and β2-adaptin we constructed several additional C-terminal mutant arrestin-2 proteins including K397E, M399A, K400E, D401R, D402R, and K403E (Fig.1a). The mutant arrestins were then expressed in COS-1 cells and tested for binding to a GST fusion protein containing the β2-adaptin appendage domain (residues 700–937) (Fig. 1b, upper panel). The appendage domain has been implicated in interactions with multiple proteins including clathrin, AP180, Eps15, epsin, and non-visual arrestins (18Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M.F. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.-M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 22Laporte S.A. Miller W.E. Kim K.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9247-9254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Subsequent densitometric analysis of the blots revealed that mutation of Lys-397, Lys-400, or Lys-403 resulted in a 65–90% loss in β2-adaptin binding (Fig. 1c, left panel). The various mutants were also tested for their binding to a GST fusion protein containing residues 1–579 of the clathrin terminal domain (Fig. 1b, middle panel). Quantification of the blots suggested that mutation of Lys-397, Lys-400, or Lys-403 resulted in an ∼40% loss in clathrin binding (Fig. 1c, right panel). Overall these results suggest that Lys-397, Lys-400, and Lys-403 may play a role in β2-adaptin and, to a lesser extent, clathrin binding. It is somewhat surprising that several C-terminal residues (Lys-397, Lys-400, Lys-403, and Arg-395; Ref. 21Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.-M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) contribute to interaction with both β2-adaptin and clathrin. While one possible explanation is that charge inversion of these residues results in partial misfolding of the C-terminal region of arrestin, this seems unlikely since individual mutations elicited a more profound inhibitory effect on β2-adaptin binding compared with clathrin. Since binding surfaces on components of clathrin-mediated endocytic pathways are often shared by multiple interacting proteins (18Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M.F. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31ter Haar E. Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), we favor the explanation that these particular residues directly contribute to β2-adaptin and clathrin binding. The partial overlap of the binding surfaces for β2-adaptin and clathrin on arrestin-2 may contribute to spatial and temporal regulation of GPCR targeting to clathrin-coated pits. We next attempted to further address the specificity of arrestin interaction with APs. Four AP complexes have been identified, each of which consists of two large (γ-, α-, δ-, ε-adaptin and β1–4-adaptin), one medium (μ1–4-adaptin), and one small (φ1–4-adaptin) subunit (23Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). AP2 is localized in cell surface clathrin-coated pits and mediates endocytosis from the plasma membrane, while AP1, AP3, and AP4 are associated with intracellular membranes and mediate sorting at the trans-Golgi network and/or endosomes (23Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Since arrestins interact with the appendage domain of β2-adaptin and arrestin interaction with other adaptins could potentially contribute to receptor trafficking, we compared the ability of arrestin-2 to bind to GST fusion proteins containing the appendage domains of α-adaptin, β2-adaptin, and β3-adaptin. These studies revealed that arrestin-2 was highly specific for binding to β2-adaptin and suggested that the primary function of this interaction will involve GPCR endocytosis (Fig.2a). In an effort to elucidate the molecular basis for β2-adaptin binding to arrestin-2, we systematically mutated 10 surface residues in β2-adaptin, several of which have been implicated in β2-adaptin binding to clathrin, AP180, Eps15, and epsin (18Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M.F. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The various β2-adaptin mutants were expressed as GST fusions and then tested for binding to purified arrestin-2. These studies suggested that arrestin-2 interacts with multiple residues on the β2-adaptin surface including Arg-834, Trp-841, Glu-849, Tyr-888, and Glu-902 (Fig. 2b). These results confirm and extend a recent study that suggested a role for Glu-849, Tyr-888, and Glu-902 in arrestin-3 binding to β2-adaptin (22Laporte S.A. Miller W.E. Kim K.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9247-9254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and also confirm many of the features of our proposed model of β2-adaptin interaction with arrestin-2 (21Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.-M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To verify that the various adaptins were functional, we also analyzed the binding of AP180 and Eps15 to the GST-β2-adaptin mutants. These studies largely recapitulated previous findings (18Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M.F. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and revealed that Lys-917 and Tyr-888 contributed to AP180 binding, while Trp-841 and Tyr-888 were involved in Eps15 binding (Fig.2c). Overall our results suggest that Phe-391 and Arg-395 in arrestin-2 play an essential role in interacting with β2-adaptin since mutation of either of these residues completely disrupts binding (21Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.-M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Indeed, our modeling predicted that Phe-391 interacts with Trp-841 and Tyr-888 in β2-adaptin, while Arg-395 interacts with Glu-849 and Glu-902. However, our results suggest that Leu-396, Lys-397, Lys-400, and Lys-403 also contribute to β2-adaptin binding (Ref. 21Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.-M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). While the binding analysis of the β2-adaptin mutants fully supports this model (Ref. 22Laporte S.A. Miller W.E. Kim K.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9247-9254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and Fig. 2b), structural analysis will be required to completely define the binding interface of these proteins. Structural insight has revealed that arrestin-2 contains two major domains made up of β-sheets that are joined by a polar core of buried salt bridges (21Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.-M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 24Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure. 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The region of arrestin-2 that interacts with β2-adaptin includes one residue in the last β-sheet (Phe-391) as well as several residues that are C-terminal to this region (Arg-395, Leu-396, Lys-397, Lys-400, and Lys-403). The C-terminal region in arrestin has been suggested to undergo significant conformational change upon receptor binding (25Schleicher A. Kuhn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar,26Ohguro H. Palczewski K. Walsh K.A. Johnson R.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2428-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and potentially loses intramolecular contacts between β-sheets in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the protein (27Vishnivetskiy S.A. Schubert C. Climaco G.C. Gurevich Y.V. Velez M.-G. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 41049-41057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, the conformational change induced by receptor binding is also thought to reflect disruption of the polar core of arrestin potentially mediated by interactions between basic residues within the polar core and phosphoserines from the receptor (28Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 29Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In particular, Arg-169 in arrestin-2 appears to play a key role in stabilizing the polar core since mutation of this residue results in an activated form of arrestin-2 that binds to GPCRs independent of their phosphorylation state (30Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Based on the importance of the polar core in stabilizing the basal state of arrestin, we hypothesized that mutation of Arg-169 would not only result in a less constrained C-terminal domain but more avid binding to β2-adaptin. Indeed, purified arrestin-2-R169E bound to GST-β2-adaptin much better than wild type arrestin-2 (Fig. 3a). Dose-response analysis suggested that arrestin-2-R169E bound to β2-adaptin with much higher affinity than wild type arrestin-2 (Fig. 3b, left panel). Interestingly, arrestin-2-R169E also bound with higher affinity to GST-clathrin compared with wild type arrestin-2 (Fig. 3, a and b). Since the R169E mutant most likely better represents the conformation of arrestin-2 that would bind to β2-adaptin and clathrin in cells, we also assessed whether the various arrestin mutants that were defective in β2-adaptin and/or clathrin binding remained so in the background of the R169E mutation. Thus, we compared the ability of F391A, R393E, R395E, L396A, K397E, K400E, and K403E mutants of arrestin-2-R169E to bind to GST-β2-adaptin (Fig. 3c, upper panel) and GST-clathrin (Fig. 3c, lower panel). These studies revealed that the Phe-391 mutation retained its selective and complete disruption in β2-adaptin binding, while the Arg-395 mutation remained completely disrupted in β2-adaptin binding and partially disrupted in clathrin binding. Interestingly, the reduced binding of the L396A, K397E, K400E, and K403E mutants to β2-adaptin and clathrin previously observed (Ref. 21Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.-M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar and Fig. 1) appeared to be largely attenuated by the R169E mutation. Overall these results suggest that the conformational change induced by GPCR binding will likely play a major role in mediating β2-adaptin and clathrin binding and that the F391A mutant should prove useful in selectively dissecting the functional role of arrestin/β2-adaptin interaction. We next focused on further characterizing the binding of arrestin-2 to clathrin. Previous work has implicated a C-terminal LφXφE motif in clathrin binding and demonstrated that mutation of the three aliphatic residues within this motif results in an ∼85% reduction in clathrin binding (13Krupnick JG. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Indeed, such a motif appears to play an important role in the ability of numerous proteins to bind clathrin (31ter Haar E. Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In an effort to generate an arrestin-2 mutant that was completely defective in clathrin binding we deleted the five-amino acid clathrin binding motif (LIELD) in arrestin-2. This mutant, arrestin-2-ΔLIELD, was expressed and initially tested for its ability to bind GST-clathrin and GST-β2-adaptin. As expected, arrestin-2-ΔLIELD was completely defective in clathrin binding (Fig. 4, middle panel), while it was largely unchanged in β2-adaptin binding (Fig. 4, top panel). These studies confirmed that the LφXφE motif plays an essential role in arrestin-2 binding to clathrin. A number of additional mutations were tested in the background of arrestin-2-ΔLIELD including F391A, R395E, and F391A/R395E. As expected, each of these mutants was completely defective in clathrin and β2-adaptin binding (Fig. 4). Since arrestin-2 binding to clathrin appeared to be conformationally sensitive (Fig. 3), we also tested whether incorporation of the R169E mutation in arrestin-2-ΔLIELD affected clathrin binding. Arrestin-2-R169E-ΔLIELD remained completely defective in clathrin binding and unaltered in β2-adaptin binding (not shown). This suggests that the conformational change in arrestin-2 induced by the Arg-169 mutation most likely mediates clathrin binding via the LφXφE motif. Nevertheless, to further address whether the C-terminal domain is involved in mediating clathrin binding we analyzed binding of C-terminally truncated arrestin-2 and arrestin-2-ΔLIELD to clathrin. Arrestin-2-(1–393) was completely defective in β2-adaptin binding, while it appeared to have modestly increased binding to clathrin (Fig. 4). As expected, arrestin-2-ΔLIELD-(1–393) did not bind to clathrin or β2-adaptin. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of secondary clathrin binding sites on arrestin-2, our data suggest that the LIELD motif plays an essential role in clathrin binding and that arrestin-2-ΔLIELD is an effective mutant for assessing the functional role of clathrin binding. For the various arrestin mutants to be useful in dissecting the role of clathrin and β2-adaptin binding in cells, we also needed to analyze whether these mutants were altered in receptor binding. The various arrestin constructs were co-expressed with a FLAG-tagged β2AR in COS-1, the cells were incubated with agonist for 2 min and lysed, and the receptor was immunoprecipitated using a β2AR-specific polyclonal antibody. The samples were then run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-arrestin monoclonal antibody to detect arrestin-2 in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 5, upper panel) or in the initial lysate (Fig. 5, lower panel). Subsequent densitometric analysis of blots from three independent experiments suggested that all of the arrestin mutants interacted with the β2AR to a similar extent (data not shown). However, there was an ∼40–50% reduction in co-immunoprecipitation of the β2AR with the ΔLIELD and R395E mutants compared with wild type arrestin-2 suggesting that these mutants might have a modestly reduced ability to bind the β2AR. In contrast, the various double and triple mutants (ΔLIELD/F391A, ΔLIELD/R395E, and ΔLIELD/F391A/R395E) had ∼30–35% higher binding to the β2AR compared with wild type arrestin-2 suggesting that the ΔLIELD and R395E mutations do not attenuate receptor binding. Taken together these results suggest that the C-terminal mutations in arrestin-2 do not significantly affect interaction with receptor and that the ΔLIELD, F391A, and ΔLIELD/F391A arrestin-2 mutants should prove effective in further dissecting the role of clathrin and β2-adaptin interaction in arrestin function. Previous studies using an arrestin-3 construct containing mutations of the three aliphatic residues within the LφXφE motif suggested that binding of non-visual arrestins to clathrin contributes to GPCR internalization (13Krupnick JG. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A similar line of investigation identified a role for arrestin-3 interaction with β2-adaptin in GPCR internalization and further concluded that the β2-adaptin binding, and not clathrin, is necessary for the initial targeting of receptor to clathrin-coated pits (16Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). One concern with these previous studies is that the arrestin mutants used to dissect the role of clathrin and β2-adaptin binding in GPCR internalization were potentially flawed. For example, the LIFA mutant (containing the three aliphatic residues in the LφXφE motif in arrestin-3 mutated to alanines) is only ∼85% reduced in clathrin binding (13Krupnick JG. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), while the R396E mutant (which corresponds to R395E in arrestin-2) used by Laporte et al. (16Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) is completely defective in β2-adaptin binding but is likely also reduced in clathrin binding (21Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.-M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, these are not ideal mutants to draw conclusions about the respective involvement of clathrin and β2-adaptin binding in arrestin function. Since our studies demonstrate that the F391A (Ref. 21Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.-M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar and Fig.3c) and ΔLIELD (Fig. 4) mutants are selectively defective in β2-adaptin and clathrin binding, respectively, we used these mutants to further dissect the role of these interactions in GPCR internalization. When co-expressed in COS-1 cells, wild type arrestin-2 promoted an ∼2-fold increase in agonist-induced internalization of the β2AR (Fig. 6). In striking contrast, the ΔLIELD mutant was completely defective in promoting β2AR internalization demonstrating the important role of arrestin/clathrin interaction in this process. By comparison, arrestin-2-F391A promoted an ∼2-fold increase in β2AR internalization suggesting that arrestin-2 interaction with β2-adaptin is not essential in this process. Interestingly, arrestin-2-R395E, which was completely defective in β2-adaptin binding and attenuated in clathrin binding, was also ineffective at promoting β2AR internalization (Fig. 6). This finding largely recapitulates the results of Laporte et al. who used the analogous mutation in arrestin-3 (R396E) to conclude that the binding of a receptor-arrestin complex to AP2 is necessary for the initial targeting of receptor to clathrin-coated pits (16Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Analysis of additional mutants defective in either β2-adaptin binding (residues 1–393) or β2-adaptin and clathrin binding (ΔLIELD/F391A, ΔLIELD/R395E, and 1–393/ΔLIELD) confirmed that arrestin-2 binding to clathrin plays the primary role in agonist-promoted internalization of the β2AR (Fig. 6). We next analyzed the ability of the various arrestin-2 mutants to regulate β2AR internalization in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells have higher endogenous levels of arrestin and have proven useful for testing whether arrestin mutants can function as dominant negatives to inhibit GPCR internalization (6Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 32Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 33Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). β2AR internalization in HEK293 cells was ∼25% following a 30-min treatment with agonist and was increased to ∼35% by wild type arrestin-2 (Fig. 7). In contrast, arrestin-2 mutants that were completely defective in β2-adaptin binding (F391A, R395E, and residues 1–393) did not promote any additional internalization. This suggests that arrestin binding to β2-adaptin contributes to β2AR internalization in HEK293 cells, although loss of such interaction did not produce an effective dominant negative mutant. Selective loss of clathrin binding (ΔLIELD) produced a modestly effective dominant negative, although in these studies it appeared as effective as a C-terminal arrestin-2 construct (residues 319–418) that is widely used to study the role of arrestins in receptor trafficking (33Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutants that were defective in both clathrin and β2-adaptin binding functioned as potent dominant negative mutants with ΔLIELD/F391A and ΔLIELD/F391A/R395E being as effective at inhibiting β2AR internalization as dominant negative dynamin I. The ΔLIELD/F391A/R169E mutant was also an effective dominant negative and should be particularly useful in future studies since it overcomes the requirement for GPCR phosphorylation for arrestin binding. We conclude that arrestin-2 binding to clathrin is essential for promoting GPCR endocytosis, while binding to β2-adaptin appears less important. These findings appear to contradict Laporteet al. (16Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) who concluded that binding of a receptor-arrestin complex to AP2 was critical for targeting the receptor to coated pits. How do we explain these differences in the two studies? We favor the explanation that the arrestin mutants used by Laporte et al. were either incomplete in disrupting clathrin interaction (13Krupnick JG. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) or were not completely selective in disrupting β2-adaptin binding (21Milano S.K. Pace H.C. Kim Y.-M. Brenner C. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This would result in an apparent diminished role of clathrin binding and exaggerated role of β2-adaptin binding. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that mechanistic differences between arrestin-2 (used in the present study) and arrestin-3 (used by Laporte et al.) may have contributed to the different findings. In addition, non-visual arrestins also interact with several additional proteins that have been implicated in GPCR endocytosis including ADP-ribosylation factor-6, ADP-ribosylation factor nucleotide binding site opener, and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (34Claing A. Chen W. Miller W.E. Vitale N. Moss J. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42509-42513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35McDonald P.H. Cote N.L.

Since the arrestin residues that mediate binding to these proteins have not been identified, we also cannot exclude the possibility that our arrestin mutants may be altered in their interaction with one or more of these proteins, although this seems unlikely. Overall, our studies are compatible with non-visual arrestin binding to activated phosphorylated GPCRs mediating a conformational change in arrestin that promotes binding to clathrin and β2-adaptin. Although our studies do not address whether receptor-bound arrestins directly recruit clathrin or AP2 to inducede novo coated pit formation, we favor a mechanism whereby the receptor-arrestin complex moves laterally within the membrane and binds to clathrin and AP2 in a pre-existing coated pit. This mechanism is consistent with our earlier studies that demonstrated that arrestins do not promote clathrin assembly (7Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar) as well as more recent studies that demonstrate that a receptor-arrestin-3 complex does not promote new coated pit formation (36Santini F. Gaidarov I. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that arrestin-2 binding to clathrin is essential for mediating GPCR trafficking, while the interaction with β2-adaptin appears less critical. Nevertheless, arrestin interaction with β2-adaptin may participate in the cooperative formation of an arrestin-AP2-clathrin complex and thereby contribute to the dynamics of receptor/arrestin association with clathrin-coated pits.

https://openalex.org/W2052568266,"We have shown that four metabolites of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) (4-oxo-, 4-OH-, 18-OH-, and 5,6-epoxy-RA) can induce maturation of NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells (Idres, N., Benoit, G., Flexor, M. A., Lanotte, M., and Chabot, G. G. (2001) Cancer Res. 61, 700–705). To better understand the mechanism of action of ATRA metabolites and isomers, we assessed their binding to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and activation of RAR-mediated transcription via a retinoic acid response element (RARE). Competition binding experiments with tritiated ATRA showed that all metabolites could bind to RARs with variable affinity. For transactivation studies, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with RARα, β, or γ expression vectors and the reporter plasmid RARE-tk-Luc, and the retinoid concentrations for half-maximal luciferase activity (EC50) were determined. All retinoids tested could activate the three RAR isotypes. The lowest EC50 value for RARα was with 9-cis-RA (13 nm), followed by 4-oxo-RA (33 nm), 5,6-epoxy-RA (77 nm), 13-cis-RA (124 nm), 18-OH-RA (162 nm), ATRA (169 nm), and 4-OH-RA (791 nm). For RARβ, the EC50 values increased as follows: 4-oxo-RA (8 nm), ATRA (9 nm), 18-OH-RA (14 nm), 5,6-epoxy-RA (35 nm), 13-cis-RA (47 nm), 4-OH-RA (64 nm), and 9-cis-RA (173 nm). For RARγ the EC50 values were: ATRA (2 nm), 5,6-epoxy-RA (4 nm), 18-OH-RA (14 nm), 13-cis-RA (36 nm), 9-cis-RA (58 nm), 4-oxo-RA (89 nm), and 4-OH-RA (94 nm). By comparing the -fold induction of luciferase activity, all retinoids tested were equipotent at transactivating RARE-tk-Luc whatever the RAR considered. However, the best induction of the transcription was obtained for RARα, which was 5-fold higher than for RARβ and 10-fold higher than for RARγ. In conclusion, these data show that ATRA metabolites can bind to and activate the three RARs with variable relative affinity but with similar efficacy. These results suggest that ATRA metabolites may activate several signaling pathways and probably play an important role in cellular physiology and cancer therapy.

Beside their role in the physiology of normal cells, retinoids possess pharmacological properties used in dermatology and in cancer therapy, including epithelial cancers, precancerous lesions (2Hong W.K. Itri L.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine.

Blood. 1988; 72: 567-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA1) (see Fig. 1), which is considered as one of the most active retinoid, is metabolized by several cytochrome P450s (CYPs) (4Marill J. Cresteil T. Lanotte M. Chabot G.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). CYPs are heme proteins catalyzing the oxidation of several endobiotics and xenobiotics such as environmental pollutants and drugs. The CYP-mediated metabolism may transform some substrates into inactive compounds but can also lead to the formation of biologically active metabolites. ATRA is metabolized into several oxidized metabolites, including 4-oxo-RA, 4-OH-RA, 18-OH-RA, and 5,6-epoxy-RA (Fig. 1) (reviewed in Ref. 5Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S.

All of these metabolites have shown biological activity, e.g. 4-oxo-RA is a highly active modulator in embryogenesis (6Pijnappel W.W. Hendriks H.F. Folkers G.E. van den Brink C.E. Dekker E.J.

Some of these metabolites can inhibit growth and induce differentiation of rhabdomyosarcoma cells (9Ramp U. Gerharz C.D. Eifler E. Biesalski H.K. Gabbert H.E. Biol.

We have recently shown that ATRA metabolites, including 4-oxo-, 4-OH-, 18-OH-, and 5,6-epoxy-RA, can induce granulocytic differentiation of NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, elicit nuclear bodies reorganization, and induce the degradation of the chimeric protein PML-RARα (11Idres N. Benoit G. Flexor M.A. Lanotte M. Chabot G.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 700-705PubMed Google Scholar). The retinoid signal is transduced by two families of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) family comprising three isotypes, RARα, RARβ, and RARγ, and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) family comprising also three isotypes, RXRα, RXRβ, and RXRγ (12Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-350Google Scholar). Each RAR and RXR isotype includes several isoforms. These receptors belong to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors and act as ligand-activated transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 12Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-350Google Scholar and 13Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). RARs function as a heterodimer together with RXR. The ligand-receptor complexes act as inducible transcription regulators of several genes by binding to specific retinoic acid response elements (RARE). Two types of RARE were found on retinoic acid-regulated genes, the DR-2 type, which is rarely encountered, and the DR-5 type, which is the most frequent. The RXR can also act as a homodimer on transcription activation via the retinoid X response element (DR-1) and as a heterodimer with several nuclear receptors, e.g. the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor, and the vitamin D receptor, on their specific response elements. The natural ligands for the RARs are ATRA and its stereoisomers 9-cis-RA and 13-cis-RA, whereas RXRs are activated by 9-cis-RA only. Because ATRA isomers and metabolites are biologically active (6Pijnappel W.W. Hendriks H.F. Folkers G.E. van den Brink C.E. Dekker E.J. Edelenbosch C. van der Saag P.T. Durston A.J.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 700-705PubMed Google Scholar), the purpose of this work was to determine their relative binding and transactivating activities toward RARα, RARβ, and RARγ. Our binding experiments showed that ATRA metabolites and isomers can bind the three RARs with different affinity. Moreover, all ATRA metabolites tested could transactivate the three RAR isotypes. Dose-response experiments showed that the effective concentrations of the metabolites to obtain half-maximal luciferase activity (EC50) were highly variable for the different RAR isotypes. However, the analysis of the extent of induction of luciferase activity showed that all the retinoids tested were almost equipotent at transactivating pRARE-tk-Luc, whatever the RAR isotype considered. ATRA, 9-cis-RA, and 13-cis-RA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France). 4-OH-RA, 4-oxo-RA, 18-OH-RA, and 5,6-epoxy-RA were kindly donated by Dr. Eva-Maria Gutknecht and Pierre Weber (Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) and Dr. Louise H. Foley (Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ). [11,12-3H]ATRA (52.5 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). pSG5-RARα, pSG5-RARβ, and pSG5-RARγ were kindly donated by Dr. Hinrich Gronemeyer (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), Illkirch, France). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against RAR receptors, RARα (RPα(F)), RARβ (RPβ(F)2), and RARγ (RPγ(mF)), were generously provided by Dr. Cécile Rochette-Egly and Prof. Pierre Chambon (IGBMC, Illkirch, France). Stock solutions of retinoids were prepared in ethanol at 10−2m and stored protected from light at −80 °C. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cell density was assessed with an electronic particle counter and size analyzer (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Stock solutions of retinoids (at 10−2m in ethanol) were further diluted in culture medium to the final concentration indicated in each experiment. The final concentration of ethanol in culture medium did not exceed 1%. Stock solutions of retinoids were regularly checked for purity using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis and did not show any contamination by ATRA. All experimental procedures were light-protected. The day before transfection, cells were seeded on six-well culture plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells per well so they reached 50–70% confluence the day of transfection. Cells were transfected, using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 1 μg of pSG5-RARα, -RARβ, or -RARγ per well. The DNA diluted in 100 μl of DMEM was mixed with 6 μl of Plus reagent and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. LipofectAMINE (4 μl) diluted with 100 μl of DMEM was added, and the mixtures were incubated again for 15 min at room temperature. While complexes were formed, the cells were washed twice with DMEM to remove serum, and 800 μl of serum-free DMEM were added per well. The mixtures were added to the cells and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The culture volume was then increased to 4 ml with DMEM supplemented with serum to 10%. 24 h after transfection, cells were collected with 500 μl of trypsin and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed twice with PBS 1× and lysed with 100 μl of protein extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 450 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 25% v/v glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The cells were submitted to three cycles of freezing/thawing in liquid nitrogen and in a 37 °C bath for complete cells lysis. The samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing crude protein extracts were collected, and protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). The protein extracts were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. Crude protein extracts (50 μg) of RARα-, RARβ-, or RARγ-expressing COS-7 cells were incubated with 2 nm [3H]ATRA and increasing concentrations (from 1 nm to 1 μm) of unlabeled competitor, i.e. 4-oxo-RA, 4-OH-RA, 18-OH-RA, 5,6-epoxy-RA, 9-cis-RA, and 13-cis-RA, in a final volume of 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol). After 18-h incubation at 4 °C in the dark, 100 μl of a chilled dextran-carbon suspension (Norit A 3%, dextran T70 0.3%, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added, and the mixture was mixed vigorously and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C to remove the unbound [3H]ATRA. The samples were then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and centrifuged again in the same conditions to remove any trace of charcoal. 150 μl of the supernatants was counted for the radioactivity in 8 ml of scintillation fluid (Biofluor). Radioactivity counted in the presence of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled ATRA was subtracted from total binding to obtain specific binding. The day before transfection, cells were seeded on 24-well culture plates at a density of 6.5 × 104 cells per well so that they were 50–70% confluent the day of transfection. Cells were cotransfected, using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 0.1 μg of reporter vector pRARE-tk-Luc that allows the expression of the reporter gene Firefly luciferase, 0.05 μg of pSG5-RARα, pSG5-RARβ, or pSG5-RARγ expression vectors and 0.02 μg of the pRLnull vector that encodes the Renilla luciferase (Promega) as an internal control to normalize for variations in transfection efficiency. The total DNA (0.17 μg/well) diluted with 25 μl of DMEM was mixed with 2 μl of Plus reagent and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. LipofectAMINE (0.6 μl) diluted with 25 μl of DMEM was added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. While complexes were formed, the cells were washed twice with DMEM to eliminate serum traces, and 200 μl of serum-free DMEM was added per well. The mixture was added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C. After 3 h of incubation, the culture volume was increased to 1 ml per well with DMEM supplemented with dextran-coated charcoal-treated serum (10% final). From this point, all subsequent steps were carried out with dextran-coated charcoal serum. 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed and then treated with the appropriate retinoid at the indicated concentration and time. The cells were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 200 μl per well of passive lysis buffer (Promega) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Whole cell extracts from COS-7 cells (2 μg) were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), then incubated with a specific antiserum raised against human RARα (RPα(F)), RARβ (RPβ(F)2), or RARγ (RPγ(mF)) as described previously (14Rochette-Egly C. Lutz Y. Saunders M. Scheuer I. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson Laboratories) at 1:10,000 dilution at room temperature for 30 min. Each step was followed by three 10-min washes in PBS-T. Detection was performed as described in the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were determined on 10 μl of lysate using the Dual luciferase assay system kit (Promega). The light intensity was determined with a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) after injecting 50 μl of LAR II reagent (firefly luciferase substrate), and 50 μl of Stop and Glo reagent (Renilla luciferase substrate), successively. All the experiments were carried out in duplicate or triplicate, and the Firefly luciferase activity was normalized with the Renillaactivity (efficiency of transfection) and with the protein content. Percent maximal response data, or [3H]ATRA competition from RARs by metabolites, were fitted to a sigmoidal equation using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 software (San Diego, CA). Binding data are presented as IC50 values, i.e. the concentration of unlabeled compound required to prevent 50% of the radiolabeled ligand from binding to the receptor. Data for the transactivation studies are presented as EC50 values, which represent the effective concentration for half-maximal luciferase activity. To determine the binding of ATRA metabolites (4-oxo-, 4-OH-, 18-OH-, 5,6-epoxy-RA) and isomers (9-cis- and 13-cis-RA) on the three RAR isotypes, we performed competition binding assays. Protein from COS-7 cells transfected with RARα, RARβ, or RARγ were incubated with [3H]ATRA (2 nm) and increasing concentrations of the unlabeled ligands (1–1000 nm). All the retinoids tested could compete with [3H] ATRA binding to the three RAR isotypes. However, the determination of the concentration of unlabeled ligand required to inhibit 50% of [3H]ATRA binding on the receptors (IC50) (Table I) show that the IC50 values were highly variable and could reach high values for certain metabolites. Examples of the competition binding with 9-cis-RA, 13-cis-RA, and 4-oxo-RA are depicted in Fig. 2. The best competitors for both RARα and RARβ were 9-cis-RA with IC50 values of 28 and 10 nm, respectively, followed by 4-oxo-RA with IC50 values of 59 and 50 nm, respectively, and 13-cis-RA with IC50 values of 115 and 51 nm, respectively. 18-OH-RA and 5,6-epoxy-RA were also good competitors for RARα (IC50, 141 nm), and RARβ (IC50, 127 nm), respectively. In the case of RARγ, the best competitor was 4-oxo-RA with an IC50 of 142 nm. The other ligands, although binding to the three RAR isotypes, exhibited high IC50 values, i.e. superior to 200 nm.Table IDetermination of retinoid concentrations required to prevent [3H]ATRA from binding to RAR isotypesRetinoidsIC50RARαRARβRARγnmATRA93109-cis-RA281031113-cis-RA115513654-oxo-RA59501424-OH-RA60629889218-OH-RA1412372525,6-epoxy-RA232127429 Open table in a new tab COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the reporter gene Luciferase under the control of a DR5 retinoic acid response element, together with the expression vector of either the retinoic acid receptor RARα, RARβ, or RARγ. Western blot analyses were performed to ensure that RARα, RARβ, and RARγ were indeed overexpressed in COS-7 cells after transfection. As expected, Fig. 3 shows that these nuclear receptors were overexpressed compared with controls. Dose-response effects of ATRA, its isomers (9-cis- and 13-cis-RA), and its four oxidized metabolites (4-oxo-, 4-OH-, 18-OH-, and 5,6-epoxy-RA) on the transcription of the reporter gene were studied. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the different retinoids (10−11 to 5 × 10−5m) for another 24-h period, and the concentrations required to obtain half-maximal luciferase activity (EC50) were determined by non-linear sigmoidal analysis of the dose-response experiments for each RAR isotype. Fig. 4 shows representative dose-response curves obtained with ATRA and the metabolite 18-OH-RA for each RAR. A dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity was observed for the three RARs, and the EC50 values with RARα and RARβ were very similar for ATRA and 18-OH-RA. Table II presents the EC50 values of ATRA isomers and the other metabolites determined for the three RARs. These data show that 9-cis-RA was the most effective retinoid for RARα activation with an EC50 value of 13 nm, followed by 4-oxo-RA with an EC50 value of 33 nm. The other retinoids showed relatively high EC50 values, with 77 nm for 5,6-epoxy-RA, 124 nm for 13-cis-RA, 162 nm for 18-OH-RA, and 169 nm for ATRA. The metabolite 4-OH-RA displayed the highest EC50 value of 791 nm.FIG. 4Representative dose-response curves used to determine the effective concentrations for half-maximal luciferase activity ( EC50 ) for RAR α, RAR β, or RAR γ.COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the reporter vector RARE-tk Luc with either RARα, RARβ, or RARγ expression vectors, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The dose-response curves were performed in duplicate at concentrations ranging from 10−11 to 5 × 10−5m of the indicated retinoid for 24 h.

The less effective retinoid for RARβ activation was 9-cis-RA with an EC50 value of 173 nm. The lowest EC50 values were found with RARγ. ATRA, 5,6-epoxy-RA, and 18-OH-RA were the most effective retinoids with EC50 values of 2, 4, and 14 nm, respectively (Table II). 13-cis- and 9-cis-RA showed intermediate EC50 values for RARγ of 36 and 58 nm, respectively. 4-oxo-RA and 4-OH-RA were the less effective retinoids tested for RARγ, with EC50 values of 89 and 94 nm, respectively. Because all the retinoids tested could bind to and activate the three RARs, we next investigated their efficiency to stimulate the transcription of the reporter plasmid RARE-tk-Luc in the presence of each RAR isotype by analyzing the -fold induction of luciferase activity. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with RARE-tk-Luc plasmid and expression vectors for RARα, RARβ, or RARγ, separately. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with a single concentration of 100 nm of the different retinoids for 6 h. The choice of these treatment conditions was based on preliminary experiments that established that 100 nm was a non-saturating retinoid concentration at 6 h (data not shown). The comparison of maximal luciferase activities showed that for each RAR isotype tested, ATRA, its isomers, and metabolites were almost equipotent for the transactivation of the transcription of the RARE-tk-Luc reporter gene as shown in Fig.5A. However, the best induction of the transcription was obtained for RARα with all retinoids. As can be seen in Fig. 5B, the -fold induction of luciferase activity with RARα was about 5-fold higher than with RARβ and about 10-fold higher than with RARγ, whatever the retinoid tested. Because ATRA can be metabolized into several oxidized metabolites, we wondered if the transactivation of the reporter gene RARE-tk-Luc observed with ATRA and its metabolites could have been altered as a function of time. To answer this question, the induction of the transcription of the reporter gene by RARα with ATRA and two of its metabolites, i.e. 4-oxo-RA and 5,6-epoxy-RA, was studied using shorter incubation times where metabolite formation is minimized. As shown in Fig. 6, ATRA or the metabolites caused the same pattern of time-dependent increase of luciferase activity between 0 and 8 h of treatment. Although a decrease of luciferase activities was observed at 16 and 24 h with the three retinoids, the patterns of transactivation of the luciferase gene were similar for ATRA and its metabolites. These results indicate that the luciferase activities determined with exposure times of 6 or 24 h used in the preceding experiments allow a direct comparison between retinoids. Moreover, this experiment confirms the equivalence of ATRA and its metabolites at transactivating the reporter gene. Until recently, relatively little information was available on ATRA metabolism, and the oxidized metabolites of ATRA were considered as mere degradation products possessing low biological activity. In fact, ATRA oxidation to various compounds was thought of as a way to eliminate ATRA, and hence to negatively regulate its biological activities. However, several groups have shown that ATRA metabolites can induce the growth arrest and the differentiation of several cancer cell lines (7van der Leede B.M. van den Brink C.E. Pijnappel W.W.

It has also been shown that some metabolite may be more active than ATRA, e.g. 4-oxo-RA is more effective in the modulation of positional specification in early embryo, and in the transcription induction of the development genes Hoxb-4 and Hoxb-9 (6Pijnappel W.W.

In addition to their differentiating activity of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, ATRA metabolites can also induce the degradation of the chimeric protein PML-RARα and the reorganization of nuclear bodies (11Idres N.

We have also observed that the differentiation activity of ATRA metabolites seems to be mediated via the RARα pathway (11Idres N. Benoit G. Flexor M.A. Lanotte M. Chabot G.G.

Considering the multiple biological activities of ATRA metabolites, we were interested to further understand their molecular mechanism of action, by assessing their binding capacity to the three retinoic acid rec"

Using a subtractive hybridization technique on isolated renal cortical collecting ducts from rats injected with a physiological dose of aldosterone, we have identified an early response cDNA highly homologous to human and murine NDRG2 (N-Mycdownstream regulated gene2), which consists of four isoforms and belongs to a new family of differentiation-related genes. NDRG2 mRNA was expressed in classical aldosterone target epithelia, and in the kidney, it was specifically located in the collecting duct, the site of aldosterone-regulated sodium absorption. NDRG2 mRNA was increased within 45 min by aldosterone in the kidney and distal colon, whereas it was unaffected in the heart. In the RCCD2 collecting duct cell line, NDRG2 mRNA was enhanced as early as 15 min after aldosterone addition by transcription-dependent effects. NDRG2 was induced by aldosterone concentrations as low as 10−9m, and a maximal effect was observed at 10−8m. In contrast, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone was ineffective in NDRG2expression, whereas the glucocorticoid-regulated gene sgkwas induced. Taken together, these results indicate thatNDRG2 regulation by aldosterone is an early mineralocorticoid-specific effect. Interestingly, NDRG2 is homologous to Drosophila MESK2, a component of the Ras pathway, suggesting that activation of the Ras cascade may play a significant role in mineralocorticoid signaling.

The mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone plays a major role in regulation of sodium absorption in tight epithelia such as the renal collecting duct, the distal colon, and the salivary and sweat glands (1Verrey F.

Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F181-F192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its effects are mediated through the mineralocorticoid receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that modulates transcription of mostly unknown target genes. This results in stimulation of sodium reabsorption by increasing both the passive luminal entry of sodium into epithelial cells through the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)1 and its active extrusion into the blood by the basolateral Na/K-ATPase. However, the hormone-elicited sodium reabsorption occurs before aldosterone-induced transcriptional regulation of ENaC and Na/K-ATPase subunits. Indeed, aldosterone stimulation of transepithelial sodium transport is a complex response (3Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). An enhanced apical sodium permeability is observed 30–90 min after aldosterone addition, with a maximal effect several hours later. The early phase is thought to involve post-translational regulation such as methylation or phosphorylation of a pre-existing transport machinery. In particular, the activation of “silent” apical sodium channels mainly contributes to the initial increase in apical sodium influx. The late phase of aldosterone response (several hours to days) correlates with enhanced transcription/translation of sodium channel subunits and Na/K-ATPase molecules. The aldosterone-induced regulatory proteins involved in the early phase of hormone response are mostly unknown. The search for early corticosteroid-induced genes is the subject of intensive investigations. In amphibian A6 cells, induction ofASURs (adrenalsteroid-up-regulated RNA) was evidenced. Among them, ASUR5, corresponding to the oncogene K-ras2, stimulates ENaC activity in theXenopus laevis oocyte expression system (4Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Forster I. Loffing J. Assandri R.

Serial analysis of gene expression of aldosterone-induced genes in a mouse collecting duct cell line revealed that a 4-h exposure to aldosterone results in large changes in the transcriptome because 34 transcripts were induced and 29 were repressed (13Robert-Nicoud M. Flahaut M. Elalouf J.M. Nicod M. Salinas M. Bens M. Doucet A. Wincker P. Artiguenave F. Horisberger J.D. Vandewalle A. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Among induced genes, GILZ (glucocorticoid-inducedleucine zipper) appears to be an interesting induced candidate in this cellular model. This study was designed to identify early target genes for aldosterone in native kidney cells and in a physiological context. For this purpose, we used a rat model in which glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid plasma levels are controlled; such a model has been used for decades to describe early effects of aldosterone in vivo on renal Na+ and K+ excretion (14Horisberger J.D. Diezi J. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F89-F99PubMed Google Scholar). Rats were adrenalectomized, supplemented with glucocorticoid hormone to maintain renal glomerular filtration rate at normal values, and injected acutely with a low dose of aldosterone. Then, a search for early aldosterone-regulated genes was performed by a subtractive hybridization approach conducted on a renal collecting duct preparation. We have identified a member of the NDRG (N-Mycdownstream regulated gene) gene family, NDRG2, as a putative effector of early effects of aldosterone. We show that the NDRG2 mRNA level was rapidly (45 min) enhanced in vivo by aldosterone in target epithelia such as the distal colon and kidney. In an aldosterone-sensitive cellular model derived from rat cortical collecting duct (RCCD2 cells), the NDRG2 mRNA level was increased as early as 15 min after aldosterone addition via transcription-dependent effects. Dose-dependent effects of aldosterone on NDRG2 expression showed thatNDRG2 was induced with 10−9maldosterone, and a plateau was reached at 10−8m hormone. In contrast, NDRG2 expression was not affected by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone, whereas thesgk mRNA level was strongly increased. Taken together, these results indicate that NDRG2, a member of a gene family related to cell differentiation, represents a novel mineralocorticoid-specific mediator of early physiological response to aldosterone in target tight epithelia. Experiments were performed on Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 160–180 g. To select the conditions for differential cloning of early aldosterone-induced genes, urinary sodium excretion was measured after intravenous injection of a unique physiological dose of aldosterone. Rats were adrenalectomized and received a substitutive dose of dexamethasone (1 μg/100 g of body weight/day) for 7 days via osmotic minipumps (1007D Alzet, Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA) to prevent a fall in glomerular filtration rate. They were anesthetized with Inactin (Sigma), tracheotomized, and perfused (36 μl/100 g/min) via a catheter introduced in the jugular vein for 1 h with a saline solution (65 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 100 mm mannitol, and 52 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Aldosterone (0.2 μg/100 g of body weight) was then injected as a bolus in the tail vein. Urine was collected via a catheter placed in the bladder before aldosterone injection and then every 30 min for 3 h and analyzed for Na+ content. As shown in Fig.1, this experimental protocol resulted in a progressive decrease in the urinary sodium excretion rate, which was apparent 60–90 min after hormonal injection and was maximal at 1.5–2 h. Because of these results, we chose to search for aldosterone-induced genes in rats injected with either aldosterone or vehicle (referred to as the control situation) and killed after 45 min. Other rats were killed 2 h after aldosterone injection. Plasma levels of aldosterone from adrenalectomized rats, supplemented with dexamethasone and treated or not with aldosterone, were determined by radioimmunoassay (Table I). The plasma aldosterone concentrations from animals used either for subtractive hybridization or for RNase protection assays are given. 45 min after hormone injection, the plasma aldosterone concentration was increased compared with control rats (adrenalectomized and dexamethasone-supplemented). This rise was within the physiological range of hormone level variations (91–145 pg/ml, i.e. 0.2–0.4 nm) and was transient because it was no longer apparent 2 h after aldosterone injection.Table IPlasma aldosterone concentrations in control and aldosterone-treated ratsSeries 1Series 2ControlAldo (45 min)ControlAldo (45 min)Aldo (2 h)Aldo (pg/ml)< 5 (8)91 ± 11.9 (8)6 ± 4.5 (3)145 ± 19.9 (3)7.1 ± 3.4 (3) Open table in a new tab The RCCD2 model has been described (15Djelidi S.

RCCD2 cells were cultured in complete medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1), 14 mmNaHCO3, 2 mm glutamine, 5 × 10−8m dexamethasone, 6 × 10−8m sodium selenite, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 5 × 10−8m triiodothyronine, 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. For experiments, cells were seeded on Transwell filters (Corning Costar Corp.) previously coated with collagen (Institut J. Boy, Reims, France). Cells were incubated overnight in minimal medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1), 14 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and then treated or not with aldosterone (10−11 to 10−7m) or dexamethasone (5 × 10−8m) for various times. Actinomycin D was from Sigma, and RU486 was a kind gift from Roussel-Uclaf. Cortical collecting ducts (CCDs) were isolated using a Percoll gradient technique as previously described (16Blot-Chabaud M. Laplace M. Cluzeaud F. Capurro C. Cassingena R. Vandewalle A. Farman N. Bonvalet J.P. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 367-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, kidneys from control or aldosterone-treated rats (eight rats in each group, killed 45 min after intravenous injection of aldosterone or vehicle) were removed, and cortex slices were digested with collagenase (0.75 mg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C; Serva) and then submitted to differential centrifugation on a Percoll gradient (40%). The lowest density band corresponded mainly to CCD fragments (25–40 mg), with minor contamination by glomeruli or proximal tubules. Poly(A) mRNAs were extracted from hormone-treated or control CCDs using oligo(dT)25 covalently bound to magnetic beads (Dynal A.S., Oslo, Norway). To identify up-regulated sequences, the two pools of mRNA fragments derived from control and aldosterone-treated animals were submitted to PCR-based subtractive hybridization and suppression PCR (PCR-SelectTM cDNA subtraction kit, CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized and digested withRsaI. Adaptors were then linked to the aldosterone-treated cDNA pool, and two successive hybridizations followed by extension to fill in ends were performed in the presence of an excess of cDNA without linkers from untreated CCDs. The first PCR amplification using suppression PCR amplified exponentially only differentially expressed sequences. The second PCR amplification allowed us to reduce background levels and further enriched differentially expressed cDNA fragments. “Forward” subtraction was performed when linkers were added to cDNA fragments obtained from hormone-treated CCDs, whereas “reverse” subtraction was performed when linkers were added to cDNA fragments obtained from control CCDs. PCR products were cloned into the pT-Adv vector using the AdvanTAgeTM PCR cloning kit (CLONTECH). Differential screening of the subtracted library was performed to eliminate false positives by hybridization with 32P-labeled probes prepared from forward- and reverse-subtracted cDNAs (PCR-SelectTMdifferential screening kit, CLONTECH). Clones showing signal ratios of >5:1 (forward-subtracted versusreverse-subtracted probes) were further analyzed by DNA sequencing (GENOME Express, Paris, France). The full-length sequence of one expressed sequence tag (447 bp) was established by screening a rat kidney cDNA library (kindly provided by M. C. Lecomte, INSERM U409, Faculté de Médecine Xavier Bichat) by anchored PCR. We performed the first series of PCR with an antisense oligonucleotide (AS1) localized in the sequence of the expressed sequence tag and a sense oligonucleotide (S1) specific to the pGAD793 plasmid containing the library. To improve the specificity of the PCR products, we also carried out nested PCR with a second set of oligonucleotides, AS2 and S2. The different oligonucleotides were designed as follows: S1, 5′-CGATGATGAAGATACCCCACC-3′; AS1, 5′-TTAGGAGCATTGCCTTCAGAG-3′; S2, 5′-AGAGATCCTAGAACTAGTCGG-3′; AS2, 5′-AGGCACTGTGTCAGCTTTGGGG-3′. PCRs were performed in 50 μl of a mixture containing 1× Advantage-2 PCR buffer, 200 μm dNTPs, 50 pmol of each oligonucleotide (S1/AS1 or S2/AS2), 10 ng of rat kidney library, and 1× Advantage-2 polymerase mixture (Advantage®-2 cDNA polymerase mixture, CLONTECH). Cycles were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min and then 94 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 20 cycles. PCR products (∼740 bp) were sequenced and used to design an antisense oligonucleotide (GSP1, 5′-AGAGGGTCGCTCAACAGGAGACTT-3′) to clone cDNA 5′-ends by rapid amplification with the SMARTTM RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 μg of total RNA from rat heart (a tissue strongly expressing NDRG2; see Fig. 4) with the SMART II oligonucleotide and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 5′-RACE/PCRs were realized with GSP1 and Universal Primer Mix oligonucleotides (cPontech) as indicated by the manufacturer's protocol. 5′-RACE products were characterized by sequencing (GENOME Express). Rat tissues were fixed by perfusion via the aorta with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (130 mm NaCl, 7 mmNa2HPO4, and 3 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4). Organs were dehydrated in graded alcohol solutions and embedded in paraffin (Paraplast). Hybridization was then carried out on tissue sections as previously described (17Farman N. Coutry N. Logvinenko N. Blot-Chabaud M. Bourbouze R. Bonvalet J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C810-C817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region of NDRG2 cDNA (nucleotides 1500–1946 of NDRG2b2, DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI accession number AJ426427) was subcloned into the XbaI-BamHI site of the pBluescript KS vector. 35S-Labeled antisense and control sense probes were synthesized using 35S-labeled UTP (specific activity of 1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and the Riboprobe® combination system T3/T7 kit (Promega). Sense cRNA was synthesized after linearization with BamHI from the T7 promotor, and the antisense probe was synthesized after linearization with XbaI from the T3 promotor. Probes were then hybridized on tissue sections, and slides were developed after 27 days of exposure. Total RNA was extracted from rat tissues or RCCD2 cells with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNase protection assay (RPA) was performed as previously described (18Escoubet B. Coureau C. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1482-C1491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from different organs and yeast tRNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were hybridized overnight at 50 °C with NDRG2 (or Sgk) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) radiolabeled probes (4 × 105counts/min for NDRG2, 3 × 105 counts/min for Sgk, and 5 × 104 counts/min for GAPDH) in 80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 400 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Unhybridized RNAs were digested with RNase A (40 μg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and RNase T1 (2 μg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 30 °C. RNase digestion was followed by a 30-min incubation with proteinase K (125 μg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C. Protected fragments were then extracted with phenol, precipitated with ethanol, and separated by 6% urea-PAGE. Gels were fixed with 10% acetic acid for 30 min and vacuum-dried (slab gel drier, Avantec) for 1 h at 80 °C. Gels were then exposed to Biomax MR films (Eastman Kodak Co.) and analyzed with an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.).32P-Labeled cRNA probes were synthesized using [32P]UTP (specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol; AmershamBiosciences). For NDRG2, the cRNA probe was 573 nucleotides long, and the protected fragment was 447 nucleotides (nucleotides 1500–1946 of NDRG2b2). The Rat Sgk probe was 360 nucleotides long, and the protected fragment was 29-S nucleotides (nucleotides 691–985). A 183-nucleotide probe and a 16-S nucleotide protected fragment were obtained with rat GAPDH cDNA (nucleotides 707–871). Total RNA was extracted from RCCD2 cells with Trizol reagent, and 2 μg were treated with DNase I (Invitrogen). The total RNA concentration was measured using the ultrasensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain RiboGreen (RiboGreen® RNA quantitation kit, Molecular Probes, Inc.) and a Model F-2000 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), which allow for accurate determination of the RNA concentration and standardization between samples (19Bustin S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (3074) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was performed with 500 ng of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 500 ng of random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) in a final volume of 20 μl. Real-time PCR analysis of NDRG2 was carried out on an ABI7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The Taqman probe and primers (MWG Biotech) for NDRG2 were as follows: upper primer, 5′-TCCATTCCCCCAAAGCTG-3′; lower primer, 5′-CATCCATTTAGGAGCATTGCC-3′; and Taqman probe, 5′-FAM (6-carboxyfluorescin)-AACAGTGCCTTGACGTTTAAGGCCTCTGA-TAMRA (6-carboxytetromethylrhodamine)-3′. In some experiments, the 18 S RNA level was measured as an internal control (upper primer, 5′-CCCTGCCCTTTGTACACACC-3′; lower primer, 5′-CGATCCGAGGGCCTCACTA-3′; and Taqman probe, 5′-FAM-CCCGTCGCTACTACCGATTGGATGGT-TAMRA-3′). PCR was performed with one-fifth (NDRG2) or one-twentieth (18 S RNA) of the reverse transcription reaction, 5 mm (NDRG2) or 3 mm(18 S RNA) MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase. The final primer and probe concentrations were 400 and 100 nm, respectively. PCR reagents were from Eurogentec (qPCR core kit). The thermal cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Standard curves were generated using serial dilutions of a purified restriction fragment of NDRG2 (nucleotides 1500–1946 of NDRG2b2) or 18 S RNA (nucleotides 1428–1788), covering 5 orders of magnitude and yielding correlation coefficients of at least 0.98 in all experiments. Each standard and sample values were determined in triplicate in three independent experiments. In each experiment, NDRG2expression under a given experimental condition was calculated relative to the control condition. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. (n = number of animals). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test after analysis of variance. PCR-based subtractive hybridization was used to establish a library of cDNAs representing mRNAs rapidly (45 min) up-regulated by a physiological dose of aldosterone in isolated rat CCDs. Selected clones were sequenced and analyzed for sequence homology using the BLAST program. About 50% of them corresponded to genes involved in oxidative metabolism (cytochrome c oxidase subunits) and the cytoskeleton (actin). One of the clones (clone 2, 447 bp) that was homologous to expressed sequence tag 239096 (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI accession number AI410803) was further studied. The full-length sequence of clone 2 was obtained using RACE. Four different cDNAs were isolated. The cDNA sequences of rat NDRG2a1, NDRG2a2, NDRG2b1, and NDRG2b2 have been deposited in the DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank under accession numbersAJ426424, AJ426425, AJ426426, and AJ426427, respectively. They share a common sequence over 1927 nucleotides and were shown to correspond to different mRNA isoforms. A new BLAST search revealed ∼90% sequence homology to mouse and human NDRG2 cDNAs, members of theNDRG family. The four isoforms have an identical 846-bp 3′-untranslated sequence containing a polyadenylation signal located 14 bp from the poly(A) tail, but they differ in their 5′-untranslated sequences, which are either 87 bp (NDRG2a) or 50 bp (NDRG2b) in length; furthermore, a 42-bp insertion in the coding sequence is either present (NDRG2a1 and NDRG2b1) or absent (NDRG2a2 and NDRG2b2) in these clones (Fig.2). For NDRG2b1 and NDRG2b2, the presumed initial ATG codon was assigned to the first Met codon because of an in-frame stop codon located 39 bp upstream from this ATG codon and a Kozak consensus sequence (ACCATGG) around this translation initiation site. For NDRG2a1 and NDRG2a2, the same translation initiation site was predicted. The open reading frame is either 1113 bp (NDRG2a1 and NDRG2b1) or 1071 bp (NDRG2a2 and NDRG2b2) long. The 42-bp insertion encodes an additional 14 residues; the putative proteins contain 357 or 371 amino acids and present a high degree of homology to the murine and human NDRG2 proteins (∼90% identity). A search for the presence of consensus motifs in the amino acid sequences was performed using the Prosite, Pfam, and PSORTII programs. Fig. 3 shows a putative tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site (residues 302–309) and an α/β-hydrolase fold predicted between amino acid 95 and 311. Interestingly, one putative nuclear localization signal was identified (residues 58–64), and a nuclear localization for NDRG2 was predicted with a 56.5%versus 13% chance in the cytoplasm. We next investigatedNDRG2 mRNA expression in different rat tissues by RPA using a probe common to the four isoforms. NDRG2 mRNA was strongly expressed in the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and aorta and more weakly in the lung, distal colon, kidney, and bladder (Fig.4A). NDRG2 mRNA was not detected in the small intestine and parotid. Fig. 4Bshows the relative expression of NDRG2 in a large variety of tissues, including aldosterone target organs. These results indicate that NDRG2 is relatively ubiquitously expressed, although at different levels. Interestingly, two patterns of expression were identified: tissues with low levels of NDRG2 expression, including the lung, kidney, distal colon, and bladder, and tissues in which expression was ∼10-fold higher such as the heart, aorta, skeletal muscle, and liver. To determine the NDRG2mRNA localization at the cellular level, in situhybridization experiments were performed in different tissues (Fig.5). In the kidney cortex, theNDRG2 mRNA signal (antisense probe) was clearly seen in the distal tubule and CCD, with a low signal in the proximal convoluted tubule, as shown in Fig. 5 (A, C, and D). Glomeruli were negative. The outer medullary portion of the collecting duct (but not its papillary part) also showed positive labeling. Because the majority of collecting duct cells were positive (Fig. 5, C and D), NDRG2 is presumably expressed by principal cells, which are the most typical aldosterone-sensitive cells. NDRG2 mRNA was also found all along the epithelium of the distal colon (Fig.6A), but not in the proximal colon (Fig. 6C). Among other epithelia, pulmonary bronchioles were positive, whereas alveoli were negative (Fig.6E). Sense probes (Figs. 5B and 6, B, D, and F) gave background signals. A low signal was also present in the jejunum; in salivary glands, the ducts expressed NDRG2 mRNA, whereas acini were negative (data not shown).FIG. 6In situ hybridization of ratNDRG2 mRNA in colonic and bronchiolar epithelia. Tissue sections were hybridized with a35S-labeled antisense (A, C, and E) or sense (B, D, and F) probe.

This complex membrane-bound molecular organization has hindered efforts to purify and reconstitute γ-secretase activity.

Although these transition state analogs have been extensively used as tools to probe the structure and mechanism, as well as the biochemical and cellular functions, of γ-secretase, the mechanisms of γ-secretase inhibition by these compounds have not been elucidated. Among potent and specific γ-secretase inhibitors are also a number of small molecules of different structural classes, such as sulfonamides (25Smith D.W. Munoz B. Srinivasan K. Bergstrom C.P. Chaturvedula P.V. Deshpande M.S. Keavy D.J. Lau W.Y. Parker M.F. Sloan C.P. Wallace O.B. Wang H.H. Patent 0050391. 2001; (August 31)Google Scholar) and benzodiazepines (26Wu J. Tung J.S.

It is an intriguing question whether these non-aspartyl protease isosteres would inhibit γ-secretase by the same mechanism as the transition state isosteres. Elucidating the inhibitory mechanisms of these different classes of inhibitors may provide important insights into the catalytic mechanism of γ-secretase and help in the design of novel drugs. Here we report the results from inhibition of solubilized cell-free human γ-secretase by pepstatin A methylester (PME), L685458, sulfonamides 1 and 2, and benzodiazepines3 and 4 (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, the transition state analogs PME and L685458 inhibited γ-secretase by a linear non-competitive inhibition mechanism, suggesting that substrate can bind to the enzyme while the active site is occupied by transition state analogs. Similar non-competitive inhibition was also observed for the non-aspartyl protease isosteres1-4. To our knowledge, this is the first example of aspartyl protease transition state analogs displaying non-competitive inhibition kinetics. A number of theoretical models are discussed in an attempt to rationalize this phenomenon. CHAPS and CHAPSO were purchased from Pierce.

Affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was ruthenylated using Origin TAG-NHS ester (IGEN) at a challenge ratio of 10, according to the manufacturer's procedure. C100 (a recombinant protein with an amino acid sequence identical to CTFβ but containing an extra methionine residue at the N terminus) was purified fromEscherichia coli inclusion bodies and stored at −80 °C before use. A 300-bp C100 fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from an APP695 cDNA template. This fragment was cloned into the vector pET-21a(+). The insert contained a stop codon to prevent the C terminus of C100 from fusing with the His tag of the vector. Transformation of BL21 (DE3)pLysS cells with pET-21-C100 was conducted following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in LB broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and harvested 4 h after isopropyl-1-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) induction by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min. The resulting cell pellet (4 g) was resuspended by vortexing in 40 ml of TE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mmEDTA). This suspension was homogenized on ice with a 55-ml Wheaton glass-teflon homogenizer and sonicated with a Branson Sonifier 450 (10 times at a setting of 5 for 30 s each with a 30-s break in between). The solution was centrifuged at 23,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of TE buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged again as above. The pellet was washed twice, resuspended with TE buffer (10 ml/g), layered over a 1-m sucrose cushion prepared in TE buffer (12.5 ml/g), and centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the top layer was recovered, and the centrifugation step was repeated. The pellets from the two sucrose centrifugations were combined and dissolved in 2 ml of 2% diethylamine containing 0.1% CHAPS and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20% glycerol, 5% ethylene glycol, and 0.02% azide in a dialyzer (size cutoff: 3.5 kDa). The dialyzed solution was centrifuged at 289,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. SDS was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 2%. Aliquots of 1.8 mm C100 solutions were stored at −80 °C until use. The substrate was diluted to a final concentration from 0 to 2 μm in reaction. At this highest concentration of substrate, the SDS content was only 0.002%, and there was no indication of inhibition of the activity of γ-secretase at this level of SDS. Hela cells (8A8) (previously harvested and stored as cell pellets at −80 °C) were weighed and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline mixed in 1:1 ratio with a wash buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 2 m KCl, and 50 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (final concentrations: 0.1 μm pepstatin A, 10 μmleupeptin, 0.1 μm MG 132, 10 μm E64, and 1 mm benzamidine). The suspended cells were disrupted with a Polytron homogenizer, and the membranes were washed and collected by high speed centrifugation. After the total protein concentration was determined, the membranes were suspended at 4 mg/ml protein in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, the protease inhibitor mixture, and 2% CHAPSO. The extraction was allowed to proceed at 4 °C for >2 h but <24 h. The extraction solution was centrifuged at 38,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C before use. All the reactions were run in 96-well microplates. Reactions of defined final volume were run in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, containing C100 at a defined concentration, solubilized enzyme at 20-fold dilution from stock, inhibitor at a defined concentration diluted from a stock in ME2SO (final concentration of ME2SO was maintained at 5%), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.25% CHAPSO, 0.01% phosphatidylethanolamide, and 0.01% phosphatidylcholine. The γ-secretase activity was not affected by 5% ME2SO, and control reactions were performed in the presence of 5% ME2SO. The reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme, and 40-μl aliquots were quenched at different times by addition of 50 μl of 200 μm PME. A 100-μl detection solution containing 0.2 μg/ml RAAβ40, 0.25 μg/ml biotin-4G8, 0.018 μg/ml Ru-GAR, and 62.5 μg/ml Dynabeads was added per quenched reaction mixture. The 96-well plates were incubated at 4 °C and vibrated with a plate shaker for >8 h. The plates were measured for ECL counts in an IGEN ECL M8 Analyzer. Time courses of γ-secretase reaction monitored by ECL assay were analyzed by linear regression to obtain the slopes in counts/min. This value was then converted to pm/min by an ECL standard curve of Aβ40, the main product of the reaction. Enzyme initial rate (υ) data were fit by non-linear least squares analysis to Michaelis-Menten Equation 1, v=Vm[S]Km+[S](Eq. 1) where Vm and Km are maximum velocity and the Michaelis-Menten constant, respectively, and S is substrate. Inhibition data were fit to Equations 2, 3, and 4, respectively, for competitive, non-competitive, or uncompetitive inhibition, v=Vm[S]Km1+[I]Kis+[S](Eq. 2) v=Vm[S]Km1+[I]Kis+[S]1+[I]Kii(Eq. 3) and v=Vm[S]Km+[S]1+[I]Kii(Eq. 4) where Kis is the inhibition constant for the inhibitor binding to the free enzyme and Kiiis the inhibition constant for the inhibitor binding to the ES complex. To analyze whether inhibition is linear, the double reciprocal plots obtained at different inhibitor concentrations were fit to a linear equation, and the slope or intercept was then re-analyzed either by linear Equation 5, slope or intercept=a+b[I](Eq. 5) where a and b are constants, or by a second order polynomial in Equation 6, slope or intercept=a+b[I]+c[I]2(Eq. 6) where c is also a constant. The primary goal of this study was to elucidate the inhibition mechanisms of known γ-secretase transition state analogs, PME and L685458, and small molecule inhibitors, sulfonamides and benzodiazepines. Because γ-secretase is quite complex structurally and has never been purified to homogeneity, it is crucial to characterize carefully the substrate kinetics in order to provide a framework for inhibition studies. The substrate used in this study was C100, a recombinant protein constructed according to the sequence of the β-secretase-generated C-terminal fragment of APP (CTFβ), a natural substrate of γ-secretase. All the reactions were run at pH 6.5, the pH optimum under the reaction conditions employed in this study (data not shown). The reaction of γ-secretase with C100 was monitored by following the production of Aβ40, the major product of the γ-secretase reaction, using the IGEN ECL technology. The initial rate was calculated as the slope of the reaction progress curve for Aβ40 production. The total turnover was <1% even at the lowest substrate concentration (0.05 μm), so there was essentially no substrate depletion. The total product formed was <1 nm, and this product concentration was in the linear range of Aβ40 detection as judged from the Aβ40 standard curves (data not shown). The progress curves at pH 6.5 were linear for at least 2 h (Fig.2A), suggesting the enzyme was stable during the experiments. This method for determination of initial rates was much more accurate than end point measurements and was used to perform all the kinetic experiments described in this study. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, the initial rate of the solubilized γ-secretase as a function of C100 concentration followed a typical hyperbola. This, as well as the apparent linearity in the progress curves for initial rate measurements as stated above, suggested that the reactions followed a typical steady state kinetic mechanism. The kinetic constants were calculated by fitting the initial rates to the Michaelis-Menten equation (see Equation 1), and the values are tabulated in Table I. The Km values (0.12–0.39 μm) are comparable with the Km value of 1 μmreported previously using a FLAG-tagged C100 substrate (14Li Y.-M. Lai M.-T., Xu, M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K.

Transition state analogs by definition are enzyme inhibitors that bind to the catalytic site of their target; therefore, such inhibitors generally display competitive inhibition. Unexpectedly, initial inhibition data obtained at four different inhibitor concentrations indicated non-competitive inhibition of γ-secretase by PME (data not shown). As a result of these data, we examined in greater detail the effect of inhibitor concentration on the slope and intercept of the double reciprocal plot by employing a total of eight inhibitor concentrations in a separate kinetic experiment, reasoning that the slope replot as a function of inhibitor concentration would be curved. A parabolic slope replot but a linear intercept replot would indicate that the inhibitor, while binding at the catalytic site as a transition state analog is expected to do, may also bind at an allosteric site, thereby causing the observed non-competitive inhibition (). On the other hand, linear slope and intercept replots would indicate that the inhibitor binds at a single, non-competitive binding site (31Plowman K.M. Enzyme Kinetics. McGraw-Hill, New York1972Google Scholar, 32Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, the double reciprocal plot of inhibition by PME (Fig. 3A) again clearly indicated non-competitive inhibition. Importantly, both the slope (Fig.3B) and intercept (Fig. 3C) replots were linear, consistent with a pure non-competitive model where just one inhibitor binds to enzyme, as illustrated by Equation 7. (Eq. 7) The value of Kis, which is the inhibition constant for inhibitor binding to free enzyme (E), and the value ofKii, which is the inhibition constant for inhibitor binding to the ES complex, were similar (Table I), suggesting that there was little interaction between the substrate C100 and PME in the ternary complex and minimal conformational change that would affect the inhibitor binding upon substrate binding or vice versa. To rule out the possibility that the apparent non-competitive inhibition might arise from artifacts due to substrate aggregation at room temperature, the kinetic experiments were repeated at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 4A, the kinetic pattern for PME obtained at 37 °C was not different from that which was obtained at 22 °C (Fig. 3A), although the inhibition constants were slightly higher at high temperature (Table I). The linear progress curves in the presence of PME (data not shown) and the near total recovery of enzyme activity from dilution of the enzyme-PME complex (data not shown) ruled out the possibility of time dependence or irreversible inhibition of γ-secretase by PME as the cause of the observed non-competitiveness. Taken together, these data indicate that PME is a bona fide linear non-competitive inhibitor of γ-secretase. To determine whether this type of non-competitive inhibition is PME-specific, we investigated the inhibition kinetics for three other types of γ-secretase inhibitors. L685458, another aspartyl protease transition state analog, also displayed a non-competitive inhibition pattern, as shown in Fig.4B. The data obtained for four non-transition state inhibitors, two sulfonamides (1 and 2) and two benzodiazepines (3 and 4), also indicated non-competitive inhibition (Fig.5). As observed for PME, the values ofKis were also quite similar to the values ofKii for each of these compounds (Table I), suggesting minimal interaction between substrate and inhibitor. These data demonstrate that the non-competitive inhibition kinetics observed with γ-secretase is not restricted to a certain class of compounds but is quite common among γ-secretase inhibitors. Several different structural classes of γ-secretase inhibitors have been extensively used as tools for biochemical and functional studies of γ-secretase. In this study, the mechanisms of γ-secretase inhibition by transition state analogs, PME and L685458, and non-transition state inhibitors, sulfonamides and benzodiazepines, were investigated. Surprisingly, both the transition state isosteres and the non-transition state inhibitors displayed linear non-competitive inhibition. The simplest interpretation of the linear non-competitive inhibition by PME is that PME binds to a non-catalytic, allosteric site of γ-secretase, which can be adequately described by a simple kinetic scheme as shown by Equation 7. It is known that γ-secretase is a high molecular weight, macromolecular complex (13Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L.L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F.S. Kawarai T. Supala A.

Furthermore, mature presenilin in the active γ-secretase complex is a heterodimer of two subunits, NTF and CTF, formed by endoproteolysis of the full-length presenilin (15Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R.

Given this structural complexity, it would not be surprising if an inhibitor binds to a non-catalytic site to interrupt subunit interactions, thereby displaying non-competitive inhibition kinetics. Yet to be proven, evidence exists to suggest strongly that γ-secretase is an aspartyl protease (12Li Y.M., Xu, M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A.

Therefore, the issue with this model of PME or L685458 binding to an allosteric site is the issue of a transition state analog binding exclusively at a non-catalytic site. Consistent with the inhibitor binding to a site that is different from the substrate-binding site, Wolfe and co-workers (33Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L., Ye, W.J. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) recently reported that CTFα, a natural substrate of γ-secretase, could be co-purified with PS1 from an aspartyl protease inhibitor affinity column. To interpret this result, they proposed that substrate first binds to a docking site on the enzyme and then moves to the catalytic site where it is subsequently cleaved (Fig.6A). The inhibitor, however, can bind directly at the catalytic site, thus explaining the co-purification of PS1 and CTFα by the transition state analog-based affinity chromatography. This model is consistent with the non-competitive kinetic inhibition results presented in this study. Alternatively, the initial substrate binding is not docking but a process that anchors a tail (for example, the N or C terminus) of the substrate. A conformational change of substrate bound at the anchor site may then occur, perhaps swinging the scissile bond into the catalytic site for cleavage (Fig. 6B). Several other possibilities exist that may also explain the non-competitive inhibition kinetics. For example, the inhibitor may bind to an intermediate on the catalytic pathway of the substrate, which would result in non-competitive inhibition. However, a substrate-derived intermediate, such as an acyl-enzyme complex, is not expected to be present along the catalytic pathway if γ-secretase is indeed an aspartyl protease. Another possibility would be that the active site is shaped as a channel with the docking site located at the entrance and the catalytic site at the end. The catalytic site would be accessible to the inhibitor while a substrate molecule is bound at the opening of the channel. The substrate binding process may also involve docking proteins that deliver specific substrates in much the same way E2 conjugases introduce specific substrates to E3 ligases (30Wu K. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Tan P.L. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1382-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The docking proteins would have specific binding sites for the substrate and would share a common binding domain for γ-secretase. These putative mechanisms are attractive in light of the data presented here, explaining the non-competitive inhibition kinetics of known aspartyl protease inhibitor isosteres, PME and L685458, and providing additional sites of interactions for non-transition state inhibitors such as the sulfonamides and benzodiazepines that also inhibit γ-secretase activity. Whether these other inhibitors block γ-secretase by binding at the catalytic or some other site awaits further investigation. Typically, enzymes involved in intermediate metabolism have an active site that is generally compact, and the residues involved in binding of substrate are located close to catalytic groups. For such enzymes, transition state analogs usually inhibit the enzyme competitively. However, in the case of proteases, which catalyze reactions with proteins as substrate, groups involved in binding and catalysis may have greater spatial separation so that binding and catalysis may happen at different locations (Fig. 6). In such cases, transition state analogs may display non-competitive inhibition, whereas non-transition state analogs may show competitive inhibition if their binding interferes with substrate binding. For enzymes such as γ-secretase, which are capable of catalyzing reactions with different protein substrates, non-competitive transition state analogs will be unable to selectively inhibit reactions between different substrates; all the substrates will need to use the same catalytic machinery for reactions regardless of how they bind to the enzymatic machinery. On the other hand, non-transition state inhibitors could be selective for a particular substrate if different substrates bind or anchor at different sites. Such inhibitors will be competitive with the substrate that shares the binding pocket with the inhibitor and non-competitive with substrate that does not. In the case of γ-secretase, if APP and Notch are anchored either at different sites or on separate docking proteins associated with the enzymatic machinery, it may be possible to develop inhibitors that are selective for APP over Notch or vice versa by targeting the anchor site rather than the catalytic site.

We examined the role of MTP in the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins in cultured murine primary hepatocytes using an inhibitor of MTP. The MTP inhibitor reduced TG secretion from hepatocytes by 85% and decreased the amount of apoB100 in the microsomal lumen, as well as that secreted into the medium, by 70 and 90%, respectively, whereas the secretion of apoB48 was only slightly decreased and the amount of lumenal apoB48 was unaffected. However, apoB48-containing particles formed in the presence of inhibitor were lipid-poor compared with those produced in the absence of inhibitor. We also isolated a pool of apoB-free TG from the microsomal lumen and showed that inhibition of MTP decreased the amount of TG in this pool by ∼45%. The pool of TG associated with apoB was similarly reduced. However, inhibition of MTP did not directly block TG transfer from the apoB-independent TG pool to partially lipidated apoB in the microsomal lumen.

Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Bjorkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Moreover, apoB100 secretion from cultured MTP−/− hepatocytes was greatly reduced, whereas apoB48 secretion was only slightly reduced compared with that in MTP+/+ hepatocytes (16Raabe M. Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Bjorkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural analyses revealed that compared with MTP+/+ hepatocytes, MTP−/−hepatocytes contained very few VLDL-sized particles within the ER and Golgi lumina (16Raabe M. Veniant M.M.

In addition, in mice unable to synthesize apoB in the intestine, chylomicron-sized, lipid particles (without apoB) accumulated in the ER lumen of enterocytes (18Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Cham C.M. Nielsen L.B. Young S.G. J.

The importance of MTP for apoB secretion is underscored by the demonstration that overexpression of MTP activity in mouse liver increased plasma levels of apoB100 and -B48, as well as TG (19Tietge U.J.F.

The function of MTP has also been investigated in HeLa and COS cells that do not normally secrete lipoproteins but in which apoB secretion was induced by transfection with cDNAs encoding MTP and apoB variants (31Thrift R.N.

Some of the conflicting data on the role of MTP in VLDL assembly might, therefore, be related to the different model systems used. Only a few studies have been performed on the function of MTP in primary hepatocytes (34Hebbachi A.-M. Gibbons G.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Hebbachi A.-M. Brown A. Gibbons G.F. J.

Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Bjorkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 17Chang B.H.-J. Liao W. Nakamuta M. Mack D. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6051-6055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), detailed studies were not reported on the function of MTP in hepatocytes from these mice. Because many types of genetically modified mice are now frequently used as models of human lipoprotein metabolism it is important to understand the mechanism of lipoprotein assembly in murine hepatocytes.We have investigated the requirement of MTP for VLDL assembly and secretion in murine primary hepatocytes. Our data show that secretion of apoB100 is markedly more sensitive to inhibition of MTP than is apoB48, and that when MTP is inhibited the apoB48 particles produced are lipid-poor compared with those made in hepatocytes with normal MTP activity. We have also isolated from the microsomal lumen a pool of TG that is not associated with apoB and show that inhibition of MTP reduces the amount of TG within this pool. However, inhibition of MTP does not directly impair the transfer of TG from this pool to lipid-poor apoB-containing particles.DISCUSSIONWe have studied the role of MTP in the hepatic assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins in murine hepatocytes. Our experiments show that inhibition of MTP (as monitored by inhibition of TG secretion) abolished the secretion of apoB100, whereas the amount of apoB48 secreted was unaffected, although the lipidation of apoB48 was markedly diminished. Parallel differences were found in the amounts, and degree of lipidation, of apoB100 and apoB48 in the microsomal lumen. The difference in sensitivity of apoB100 and apoB48 to inhibition of MTP was independent of the presence of LDLRs. We isolated a microsomal lumenal pool of TG that was not associated with apoB and showed that the size of this pool was ∼3 times larger than the pool of TG associated with apoB. Although the MTP inhibitor decreased by 40–45% the amount of both apoB-free and apoB-associated TG in the microsomal lumen, inhibition of MTP did not impair the transfer of TG to poorly lipidated apoB for VLDL formation.Inhibition of MTP Differentially Impairs the Assembly of ApoB100- and ApoB48-containing LipoproteinsSome of the apparently conflicting reports on the role of MTP in lipoprotein assembly can probably be ascribed to the different cell models used to study this process. MTP has been proposed to act as a “chaperone” that assists in translocating newly synthesized apoB across the ER membrane and into the lumen (20Du E.Z. Wang S.-L. Kayden H.J. Sokol R. Curtiss L.K. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1309-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Liang J.S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28606-28612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Fleming J.F. Spitsen G.M. Hui T.Y. Olivier L., Du, E.Z. Raabe M. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9509-9514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that when TG secretion is inhibited by 85% the amount of apoB100 in the microsomal lumen is reduced by ∼90%, whereas the amount of apoB48 is unaffected. This observation is consistent with studies in which the murine MTP gene had been inactivated specifically in the liver. In hepatocytes from these mice apoB100 secretion was abolished, whereas apoB48 secretion was reduced only slightly (16Raabe M. Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Bjorkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In contrast, in another study using hepatocytes from a different line of liver-specific MTP-deficient mice, the secretion of both apoB100 and apoB48 was undetectable (17Chang B.H.-J. Liao W. Nakamuta M. Mack D. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6051-6055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The reason for the different results obtained from these two lines of genetically modified mice is not clear. Small amounts of apoB, particularly apoB48 have been detected in the serum of individuals with abetalipoproteinemia (20Du E.Z. Wang S.-L. Kayden H.J. Sokol R. Curtiss L.K. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1309-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Herbert P.N. Hyams J.S. Bernier D.N. Berman M.M. Saritelli A.L. Lynch K.M. Nichols A.V. Forte T.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The finding that some newly synthesized apoB100 was translocated across the ER membrane and protected from trypsin digestion in the presence of the inhibitor (Fig. 2), particularly after the 15-min labeling period, might be explained by residual MTP activity. Alternatively, because no buoyant apoB100-containing lipoproteins were detected in the lumen of inhibitor-treated cells (Fig. 3), the protease-protected apoB100 might represent apoB100 that is associated with the lumenal surface of the ER membrane because the protease protection assay does not distinguish between apoB that is associated with the lumenal leaflet of the membrane and apoB that has been released into the lumen.Our data using hepatocytes from LDLR−/− and LDLR+/+ mice show that the preferential reduction in secretion of apoB100, compared with apoB48, upon inhibition of MTP cannot be attributed to LDLRs. An alternative explanation might be that apoB100 is preferentially degraded either during, or shortly after, its translocation into the lumen because apoB that is misfolded and/or underlipidated is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (47Fisher E.A. Pan M. Chen X., Wu, X. Wang H. Jamil H. Sparks J.D. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27855-27863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 48Yeung S.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We speculate that because of its large size, apoB100 requires more lipids to attain a stable conformation than does the smaller apoB48. Thus, if lipid availability were reduced by the MTP inhibitor, apoB100 might preferentially be targeted for degradation. We attempted, unsuccessfully, to test this hypothesis by incubating hepatocytes with the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, or MG132. However, although these inhibitors have been successfully used in other cell types, the viability of the murine hepatocytes was compromised by equivalent doses of the inhibitors (data not shown).MTP Is Required for Accumulation of Lumenal ApoB-free TG as Well as for ApoB LipidationTo our knowledge, our study is the first report of isolation of an apoB-free pool of TG from the microsomal lumen of hepatocytes. We consider it unlikely that this pool of TG is the result of contamination by the cytosolic TG pool for the following reasons. (i) Before the lumenal contents were isolated, microsomes were thoroughly washed with 0.5 m KCl, which removes loosely bound proteins and lipid droplets adhering to membranes. (ii) When hepatocytes were incubated with the MTP inhibitor, the amount of cytosolic [3H]TG was unaltered, whereas the amount of apoB-free [3H]TG in the lumenal contents was decreased by 45%. Thus, the pattern of labeling of the lumenal TG did not reflect that of cytosolic TG (3Davis R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). When cytosolic [3H]TG was mixed with unlabeled microsomes, the amount of [3H]TG in the lumenal apoB-independent pool was only 4% of that found when this TG pool was isolated from radiolabeled cells. Our isolation of the pool of apoB-free TG from the microsomal lumen is consistent with an ultrastructural analysis of mice that were unable to synthesize apoB in the intestine (18Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Cham C.M. Nielsen L.B. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1543-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these mice, chylomicron-sized, lipid-staining particles (that did not contain apoB) accumulated in the ER lumen of enterocytes. In another study (49Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), lipid-staining particles, the size of VLDLs but lacking immunoreactive apoB, were detected in the lumen of the rough ER of rat hepatocytes. From these studies, a model for VLDL assembly has been proposed in which a TG droplet in the rough ER lumen fuses with a small apoB-containing particle at the junction of rough and smooth ER (49Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).A clue to the function of MTP is our observation that the MTP inhibitor decreased by 45% the amount of microsomal lumenal TG not associated with apoB. This finding, combined with our observation that the MTP inhibitor reduced the amount of TG associated with apoB by 40%, supports the electron microscopy studies of Raabe et al. (16Raabe M. Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Bjorkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) in which disruption of the MTP gene in liver essentially eliminated VLDL-sized particles from the ER and Golgi lumina. Thus, our data suggest that an important function of MTP is to mediate TG accumulation in the ER lumen in a pool not associated with apoB. In light of published data (50Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 51Yang L.-Y. Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Steiner G. J.

Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it seems likely that this TG is derived primarily from the cytosolic TG pool.Our experiments do not distinguish between the apoB-independent TG being loosely associated with the lumenal surface of the membrane (such a pool would have been released upon sodium carbonate treatment) or floating freely in the lumen. Our laboratory has previously concluded that VLDLs are completely assembled with their full complement of lipid within the rough ER of rat hepatocytes (54Rusiñol A. Verkade H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3555-3562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the apoB structure suggests that apoB contains a “lipid pocket” that expands as lipids are added (55Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1401-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on evidence that MTP transfers TG between membranes via a shuttle mechanism (13Atzel A. Wetterau J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10444-10450Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), one possibility is that a sequential addition of TG to apoB occurs on the lumenal surface of the ER membrane. Our observation that apoB48 is distributed among lipoprotein particles with a wide range of densities in the microsomal lumen (Fig. 3) and in the medium (Fig. 7) is also consistent with a sequential addition of TG to apoB. Alternatively, the wide spectrum of densities of apoB48 particles might be the consequence of lipid-poor apoB particles “fusing” with TG droplets of different sizes.The mechanism by which MTP regulates the supply of TG within the ER lumen for lipoprotein assembly remains to be determined. Mobilization of cytosolic TG via a lipolysis re-esterification cycle is thought to provide the majority (∼70%) of TG that is assembled with apoB (50Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 51Yang L.-Y. Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Steiner G. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but the enzymes involved in this lipolysis-esterification cycle have not yet been fully characterized. A microsomal TG hydrolase has been recently implicated in this TG lipolysis re-esterification cycle (52Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 53Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 56Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mice with targeted disruption of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase-1 gene have normal plasma TG levels (57Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), indicating that a different TG-synthesizing enzyme makes the TG utilized for VLDL secretion. A candidate enzyme is diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2, which is expressed primarily in liver and adipose. The gene encoding this enzyme has recently been identified (58Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38870-38876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) but its requirement for providing TG for VLDL secretion has not yet been established.In conclusion, our data demonstrate that MTP is required for TG accumulation within the ER lumen, as well as for apoB lipidation. However, in agreement with studies in hepatoma cells (2Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), MTP does not appear to transfer the majority of TG to apoB. We, therefore, propose a model (Fig. 9) for the role of MTP in VLDL assembly that incorporates our new findings. When MTP is inhibited, the accumulation of apoB-independent TG in the ER lumen is compromised, resulting in the availability of less TG for assembly with apoB. We speculate that the decreased lipidation of apoB induced by inhibition of MTP is a consequence of the decreased availability of TG in the apoB-independent lumenal TG pool. During assembly of very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs)1 in the liver, triacylglycerol (TG) is concentrated within the hydrophobic core of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoprotein particles. A microsomal lumenal protein, the microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein (MTP), has been implicated in the acquisition of TG by nascent apoB for assembly and secretion of VLDLs (reviewed in Refs. 1"
https://openalex.org/W2051092460,"Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 3A4 (CYP3A4) is responsible for the metabolism of endogenous steroids and drugs in liver. Many inducers of human CYP3A4, such as rifampicin, bind to the orphan nuclear receptor SXR (steroid and xenobiotic receptor) as ligands and stimulate transcription on xenobiotic response elements located in the CYP3A4 promoter. Conversely, it is not known whether SXR mediates the transcriptional repression. We thus examined transcriptional repression of SXR and its interaction with corepressors, NCoR (nuclear receptor corepressor) and SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors) using reporter assays in the absence and presence of ligand. Cotransfection of SMRT, but not NCoR, inhibited not only basal but also rifampicin-induced transcriptional activity of SXR on the CYP3A4 promoter through specific SMRT-SXR interaction in HepG2 cells. Interestingly, rifampicin also increased the interaction of SXR with SMRT as well as with coactivator SRC-1. On the other hand, the anti-fungal agent ketoconazole decreased SXR interaction with both SRC-1 and SMRT. Ketoconazole partially inhibited corticosterone-induced SXR-mediated transcription on the CYP3A4 promoter. Taken together, our results suggest that the differential interaction of coactivators and corepressors induced by various xenobiotics may alter SXR-mediated transcription. Further, the effects of ketoconazole on theCYP3A4 gene suppression may explain, in part, drug-induced inhibition of the CYP3A4 action at the transcriptional level.

The expression of the CYP3A4 is transcriptionally activated by many natural and xenobiotic compounds. This induction of the CYP3A4 gene by xenobiotic compounds, in turn, can cause drug-drug interactions. One such example is the antibiotic rifampicin, a well known inducer of the humanCYP3A4 gene, which then increases the clearance of immunosuppressant cyclosporine A, oral contraceptives, glucocorticoid derivatives, and calcium channel blockers.

SXR is highly expressed in the liver and small intestine and regulates the CYP3A4 gene. SXR forms heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR) on xenobiotic-response elements (XREs), located in the promoter region of the CYP3A4 gene. A variety of known CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, clotrimazole, and nifedipine bind to SXR as ligands and stimulate transcription of the CYP3A4 (3Lehmann J.M. Mckee D.D. Watson M.A. Wilson T.M.

Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 900-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells or CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 5% fetal calf serum. The serum was stripped of hormones by constant mixing with 5% (w/v) AG1-X8 resin (Bio-Rad) and powdered charcoal before ultrafiltration. The cells were maintained without antibiotics. Cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method in six-well plates with 1.5 μg of reporter plasmid containing the XREM-CYP3A4-LUC or 5× UAS-TK-LUC cDNA with expression vectors as indicated in the figure legends. CMV-β-galactosidase plasmid was used as an internal control. In some samples, empty expression vectors were added to equalize total transfected plasmid concentration. Cells were grown for 24 h in the absence or presence of ligands and then harvested. Cell extracts were analyzed for both luciferase and β-galactosidase activity to correct for transfection efficiency as described previously (10Takeshita A. Koibuchi N. Oka J. Taguchi M. Shishiba Y. Ozawa Y. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 145: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The corrected luciferase activities of untreated samples were normalized to the luciferase activities of samples as described in the figure legends. All transfection studies were repeated at least twice in triplicate. The results shown are the mean ± S.D. To determine the silencing ability of SXR and its interaction with the corepressors (NCoR and SMRT) on the CYP3A4 gene, transient transfection assays were performed. Human SXR expression plasmid and a reporter plasmid, XREM-CYP3A4-LUC, containing the enhancer and promoter of the CYP3A4 driving luciferase gene expression (18Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 19Moore L.B. Parks D.J. Jones S.A. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Stimmel J.B. Goodwin B. Liddle C. Blanchard S.G. Willson T.M. Collins J.L. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15122-15127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) were cotransfected into a human liver-derived cell line, HepG2. Previously, it has been reported that CYP3A4expression is induced by rifampicin in cultured HepG2 cells (20Sumida A. Fukuen S. Yamamoto I. Matsuda H. Naohara M. Azuma J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We then examined SXR regulation of CYP3A4 gene expression in the absence or presence of rifampicin. As shown in Fig.2, SXR showed a weak basal activation (2.3-fold) rather than repression in the absence of ligand. Rifampicin treatment stimulated SXR-mediated transcription by ∼100-fold. Cotransfection of NCoR did not show a significant change in SXR transcription. However, cotransfection of SMRT repressed not only basal but also rifampicin-induced transcriptional activity of SXR. This result suggests that SMRT, but not NCoR, may be involved in SXR-mediated gene repression both in the absence and presence of ligands. We then generated a series of fragments of SXR, fused to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the yeast transcription factor GAL4, to test their transcriptional activity on five copies of a GAL4 upstream activation sequence reporter (5× UAS- TK-LUC) in HepG2 cells (Fig.3). The GAL4 SXR-LBD (amino acids 107–434) showed basal repression and rifampicin-induced transactivation. Of note, the GAL4 SXR-LBD contains the CoR box, located in the hinge region of SXR. The CoR box in TRs and RARs is one of the important binding sites for corepressor proteins such as NCoR and SMRT (11Ho¨rlein A.J. Na¨a¨r A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. So¨derstro¨m M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar, 12Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). In addition to the repression function in the unliganded SXR-LBD, we observed another repression domain in the DBD of SXR (amino acids 41–107). The two GAL4 constructs that contain both DBD and LBD (amino acids 1–434 and 41–434) have less rifampicin-induced transcriptional activity than the GAL4 SXR-LBD (amino acids 107–434) (Fig. 3). Using a mammalian two-hybrid assay in HepG2 cells, we tested whether the silencing function of SXR-LBD is mediated by interaction with nuclear corepressors. The homologous regions of nuclear receptor-interacting domains in SMRT and NCoR were fused to the transactivation domain of VP16 (VP16 SMRT-RID and VP16 NCoR-RID in Fig.1) (16Cohen R.N. Putney A. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 900-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Cohen R.N. Brzostek S. Kim B. Chorev M. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1049-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As a control experiment, we used VP16 SRC-1-RID, which contains the nuclear receptor-interacting domain (10Takeshita A. Koibuchi N. Oka J. Taguchi M. Shishiba Y. Ozawa Y. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 145: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26Liu Y. Takeshita A. Nagaya T. Baniahmad A. Chin W.W. Yen P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). GAL4 and VP16 fusion constructs were cotransfected with a 5× UAS-TK-LUC reporter plasmid. As shown in Fig. 4, when GAL4 SXR-LBD was used, VP16 SRC-1-RID increased transcriptional activity in the presence of rifampicin, suggesting rifampicin-induced interaction of SXR with SRC-1 (10Takeshita A. Koibuchi N. Oka J. Taguchi M. Shishiba Y. Ozawa Y. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 145: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Importantly, whereas cotransfection of VP16 NCoR-RID did not show significant change in GAL4 SXR-LBD-mediated transcription, cotransfection of VP16 SMRT-RID increased basal transcription in the absence of rifampicin. Transcription of GAL4 SXR-LBD also was significantly increased by cotransfection of VP16 SMRT-RID in the presence of rifampicin. Taken together, the data show that not only basal but also rifampicin-induced transcriptional activity of SXR was suppressed by SMRT (Fig. 2) and is likely due to interaction with SMRT in the absence or presence of rifampicin in HepG2 cells. Of note, rifampicin-induced activation of GAL4 SXR-LBD with VP16 alone in Fig. 4 is less than that of GAL4 SXR-LBD in Fig. 3, which is probably due to different amounts of total transfected DNA, GAL4 SXR-LBD, and reporter DNA used with the two studies. When GAL4 empty vector was used, no VP16 construct (VP16 SMRT-RID, VP16 NCoR-RID, or VP16 SRC-1-RID) increased the luciferase activity (data not shown). To examine the effect of rifampicin on SMRT-SXR interaction, the interactions between SXR and the two corepressors (NCoR and SMRT) were also examined using the reverse configuration of GAL4 or VP16 fusion constructs in HepG2 cells. The analysis of TR interaction with NCoR or SMRT was used as a control. As recently reported, NCoR, but not SMRT, specifically interacted with TR-LBD (16Cohen R.N. Putney A. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 900-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Cohen R.N. Brzostek S. Kim B. Chorev M. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1049-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The addition of T3 dissociated the TR and NCoR interaction (Fig.5A). In contrast, SMRT, but not NCoR, interacted with SXR-LBD (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, rifampicin increased the interaction between SMRT and SXR-LBD. These mammalian two-hybrid assays suggest that the ligands of SXR may increase the interaction with both the coactivator, SRC-1, and the corepressor, SMRT. We also used CV-1 cells instead of HepG2 cells to test the specificity. In the absence of ligand, SMRT, but not NCoR, interacted with SXR-LBD in CV-1 cells. However, rifampicin treatment neither increased nor decreased the interaction of SXR with SMRT (data not shown). In addition, GST pull-down assays using35S-labeled SXR with GST SMRT-RID or GST NCoR-RID failed to show ligand-dependent interaction of SXR with both corepressors (data not shown). Therefore, ligand-dependent interaction of SXR with SMRT in HepG2 cells may require other cell-specific factor(s) or post-transcriptional modification. The induction of the CYP3A4 enzyme is mainly explained by the xenobiotic-induced transactivation of SXR. On the other hand, the inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme by xenobiotics, such as the drugs nefazodone, clarithromycin, erythromycin, itraconazole, and ketoconazole, is generally thought to be the inhibition of the enzyme activity at post-transcriptional level (1Thummel K.E. Wilkinson G.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 389-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Ketoconazole, an anti-fungal agent, is known as a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4. It inhibits the CYP3A4 action with low Ki value by forming a complex with the CYP3A4 enzyme (1Thummel K.E. Wilkinson G.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 389-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 21Maurice M. Pichard L. Daujat M. Fabre I. Joyeux H. Domergue J. Maurel P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 22Beck D.J. Stevenson P. Tjia J.F. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1989; 28: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 6, ketoconazole partially inhibited corticosterone-induced SXR activation. Of note, ketoconazole treatment alone showed a weak agonistic activity (∼8-fold). This result suggest that ketoconazole may act as an antagonist only when the SXR is activated by its agonist such as corticosterone. To understand the mechanism of the antagonistic activity by ketoconazole, the effect of ketoconazole for the interaction of SXR with SMRT or SRC-1 was analyzed by a mammalian two-hybrid assay in HepG2 cells (Fig. 7). Constitutive interaction of SXR with SMRT or SRC-1 was enhanced by rifampicin or corticosterone treatment. On the other hand, ketoconazole dissociated the interaction of SXR with SMRT or SRC-1 to near basal level. Thus, ketoconazole may inhibit corticosterone-induced transactivation by disrupting SXR-coactivator interaction directly. The nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) such as TRs and RARs repress gene transcription in the absence of ligands. The repression is mediated by the interaction of the NRs with nuclear corepressors such as NCoR and SMRT (7McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar, 8Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ho¨rlein A.J. Na¨a¨r A.M. Heinzel T.

Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). SXR belongs to the same subfamily of the NRs as TRs and RARs, which heterodimerize with RXRs and mediate ligand-dependent transcription. SXR regulates various members of the CYP enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP3A11, and CYP2C8 (24Staudinger J.L. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Hawkins-Brown D. MacKenzie K.I. LaTour A. Liu Y. Klaassen C.D.

The basal level of the CYP3A11 mRNA was increased in the SXR null mouse, indicating that SXR may have a repression function in vivo (24Staudinger J.L. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Hawkins-Brown D. MacKenzie K.I. LaTour A. Liu Y. Klaassen C.D. Brown K.K. Reinhard J. Willson T.M. Koller B.H. Kliewer S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3369-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that unliganded SXR exhibited basal repression on the heterologous promoter. Two repression domains were located in the LBD and DBD of SXR. We found the repression function of the LBD-SXR was mediated by the specific interaction with SMRT. We have not analyzed how the DBD-SXR mediates repression. Similar to SXR, we reported previously that the DBD of TR contains an inhibitory region, which prevents full-length wild-type TR transcriptional activation in the GAL4 chimeric receptor system (26Liu Y. Takeshita A. Nagaya T. Baniahmad A. Chin W.W. Yen P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mathur et al. (27Mathur M. Tucker P.W. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2298-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) reported a corepressor protein, PSF (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor), which binds to the DBD of type II nuclear hormone receptors such as TRs and RXRs. They showed that PSF interacts with Sin3A and mediates silencing through the recruitment of histone deacetylases. Importantly, although thyroid hormone (T3) dissociates TR-NCoR interaction, the levels of TR-bound PSF and Sin3A remain unchanged (27Mathur M. Tucker P.W. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2298-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to test the interaction of DBD-SXR with PSF. When we used the CYP3A4 promoter, we failed to observe basal repression. However, cotransfection of SMRT, but not NCoR, inhibited the SXR transcription. We and others reported previously that conformational change(s) of NRs induced by the specific hormone-response elements may influence the nature of binding to coactivators such as SRC-1 (28Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Ikeda M. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Koibuchi N. Norwitz E.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21554-21562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Wood J.R. Likhite V.S. Loven M.A. Nardulli A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1114-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In our mammalian two-hybrid assays, SXR showed constitutive interaction with both SRC-1 and SMRT. The relative balance of SXR interaction with coactivators and corepressors may determine the specific promoter activity. It also will be important to know whether the basal transcriptional activities by SXR depend on the specific XREs of the promoters. We showed that SXR specifically interacts with SMRT, but not NCoR. While our work was in progress, Synold et al. (30Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) reported preferential recruitment of SMRT by SXR in CV-1 cells, consistent with our result. Although NCoR and SMRT share a similar structure in their C-terminal nuclear receptor-interacting domains, recent studies demonstrated that there is specificity in terms of NR recruitment of corepressors. TRβ1 preferentially interacts with NCoR, whereas RARα preferentially interacts with SMRT (16Cohen R.N. Putney A. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 900-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Cohen R.N. Brzostek S. Kim B. Chorev M. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1049-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). (I/L)XXII motifs and the adjacent α helical structure within the nuclear corepressor IDs are critical for mediating interactions with NRs (31Hu X.

NCoR contains three IDs, whereas SMRT has two IDs (17Cohen R.N. Brzostek S. Kim B. Chorev M. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1976-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In vitro and in vivointeraction studies using fragments and chimeric mutants of IDs revealed that the preferences of TR and RAR interaction with the distinct corepressors are due to the sequence differences in the IDs (16Cohen R.N. Putney A. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 900-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Cohen R.N. Brzostek S. Kim B. Chorev M. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol.

It would be interesting to know which ID(s) of SMRT is important for the specific interaction with SXR. In HepG2 cells, the SXR-SMRT interaction was unexpectedly increased by rifampicin or corticosterone treatment. In CV-1 cells, we failed to observe such ligand-dependent interaction of SXR with SMRT. Synold et al. (30Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) showed that the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel, but not docetaxel, disrupted the SXR-SMRT interaction, whereas both drugs induced SXR-SRC-1 interaction in CV-1 cells. Although we have not analyzed SXR-SMRT interaction using paclitaxel and docetaxel in HepG2 cells, the effect of xenobiotics on SXR-SMRT interaction may be different among different tissues. In fact, the agonist-induced recruitment of corepressors in the specific cell is not restricted to the SXR. Smith et al. (35Smith C.L. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) have reported that SMRT inhibits 4-hydroxytamoxifen agonist activity of estrogen receptor α in HepG2 cells. The long QT syndrome is a group of disorders characterized by a prolonged QT interval, and this disorder promotes the specific type of life-threatening ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes. The long QT syndrome can be inherited or acquired as an adverse response to electrolyte abnormalities, bradycardia, or drugs that include ketoconazole, which inhibits CYP activities (1Thummel K.E. Wilkinson G.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 389-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Using human liver microsomes, Maurice et al. (21Maurice M. Pichard L. Daujat M. Fabre I. Joyeux H. Domergue J. Maurel P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) reported that ketoconazole is a strong and selective inhibitor of the CYP3A4. It has been generally considered that imidazole derivatives such as ketoconazole are able to interact with various CYPs of liver microsomes, thereby inhibiting some monooxygenase activities (1Thummel K.E. Wilkinson G.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 389-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). However, we showed that ketoconazole disrupted both SXR-SMRT and SXR-SRC-1 interactions and partially inhibited corticosterone-stimulated SXR transcription on theCYP3A4 promoter in HepG2 cells. Blumberg et al.(4Blumberg B. Sabbagh W., Jr. Juguilon H. Bolado J., Jr. van Meter C.M. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) reported that the cocktails of endogenous steroids containing corticosterone additively increase human SXR-mediated transcription. Thus, it is possible that many endogenous steroid hormones in serum may additively stimulate SXR transcription in vivo. It has been reported that the plasma concentration of ketoconazole after 1 h of oral administration of a 200-mg single dose is 6.2 μg/ml (i.e. 11.7 μm) (36Huang Y.C. Colaizzi J.L. Bierman R.H. Woestenborghs R. Heykants J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 30: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Ketoconazole may inhibit the endogenous steroid-induced transcription in vivo to alter the CYP3A4 transcription. In summary, our results suggest that the differential interaction of coactivators and corepressors induced by various xenobiotics may alter SXR-mediated transcription. Furthermore, the effects of ketoconazole on the CYP3A4 gene suppression may explain, in part, drug-induced inhibition of the CYP3A4 action at transcriptional level.

https://openalex.org/W2010238780,"We have investigated the intracellular traffic of PrP<sup>c</sup>, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein implicated in spongiform encephalopathies. A fluorescent functional green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged version of PrP<sup>c</sup> is found at the cell surface and in intracellular compartments in SN56 cells. Confocal microscopy and organelle-specific markers suggest that the protein is found in both the Golgi and the recycling endosomal compartment. Perturbation of endocytosis with a dynamin I-K44A dominant-negative mutant altered the steady-state distribution of the GFP-PrP<sup>c</sup>, leading to the accumulation of fluorescence in unfissioned endocytic intermediates. These pre-endocytic intermediates did not seem to accumulate GFP-GPI, a minimum GPI-anchored protein, suggesting that PrP<sup>c</sup> trafficking does not depend solely on the GPI anchor. We found that internalized GFP-PrP<sup>c</sup>accumulates in Rab5-positive endosomes and that a Rab5 mutant alters the steady-state distribution of GFP-PrP<sup>c</sup> but not that of GFP-GPI between the plasma membrane and early endosomes. Therefore, we conclude that PrP<sup>c</sup> internalizes via a dynamin-dependent endocytic pathway and that the protein is targeted to the recycling endosomal compartment via Rab5-positive early endosomes. These observations indicate that traffic of GFP-PrP<sup>c</sup> is not determined predominantly by the GPI anchor and that, different from other GPI-anchored proteins, PrP<sup>c</sup>is delivered to classic endosomes after internalization."
https://openalex.org/W2080152431,"Constitutive and inducible expression of the gene encoding the modulator subunit of human glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLM) is regulated by either of two regions of the promoter; an antioxidant response element (ARE) at −302:−291 and a 44-bp fragment (−346:−303) upstream of the ARE. This second region includes a consensus AP-1 site previously considered responsible for the enhancer activity of the upstream fragment. Deletion of a 165-bp fragment (−348:−183) including the ARE and upstream 44-bp fragment totally ablated t-butyl hydroquinone (tBHQ) inducibility of a GCLM promoter/luciferase transgene. Mutation analyses confirmed that both the ARE and the −346:−303 fragment could support induction following tBHQ exposure but demonstrated that induction in the latter case did not involve the AP-1 site at −341:−335. A region sharing significant homology with the consensus ARE sequence except for a single nucleotide mismatch at −330 (5′-TTACnnnGCA-3′ versus5′-TGACnnnGCA-3′) was identified at the 5′-end of the 44-bp fragment immediately adjacent to the AP-1 site. A G in this position has been considered an invariant requirement of functional ARE sequences. Mutation of T−330 to A (a substitution known to ablate ARE function) or C eliminated basal and inducible expression. Substitution of a G at −330 enhanced basal expression relative to the wild-type sequence, but induction following tBHQ exposure was comparable, indicating that either sequence (5′-TTACnnnGCA-3′ versus5′-TGACnnnGCA-3′) may function as an ARE, although the former sequence is less effective at directing basal expression. This possibility was confirmed by similar mutational analyses of the core sequence of hNQO1, a prototypic ARE. Electrophoretic mobility shift competition assays revealed that the 5′-TTACnnnGCA-3′ sequence could compete with the hNQO1 ARE for protein binding but was less effective than a similar probe containing the 5′-TGACnnnGCA-3′ motif. Probes including the T(−330)A or T(−330)C mutations were ineffective. These results reveal that the GCLM promoter includes two functional AREs, one having a variant sequence.

The results indicate that the consensus ARE sequence should be revised to 5′-RTKAYnnnGCR-3′. glutamate cysteine ligase modulator subunit of GCL catalytic subunit of GCL antioxidant response element t-butyl hydroquinone β-naphthoflavone Glutathione is an abundant cellular sulfhydryl compound that functions as an important antioxidant contributing to the protection of cells from free radical, oxidative, and electrophilic damage. Glutathione is synthesized in two ATP-dependent steps, the first catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL,1 also referred to as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase or γ-GCS), and the second by glutathione synthetase. GCL is a heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit (GCLC, 73 kDa) and a modifier subunit (GCLM, 28 kDa), each encoded by separate genes. The catalytic subunit is responsible for synthetic activity (1Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is the site of feedback inhibition by GSH (2Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The modifying subunit lacks catalytic activity but regulates the kinetic properties of the catalytic subunit, rendering it more efficient under physiological concentrations of glutamate and glutathione (3Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In many cases adaptive changes in glutathione homeostasis are associated with an elevation of GCLC enzyme activity. Recent studies have revealed that the genes encoding the catalytic and modifier subunits are commonly induced along with a battery of other drug metabolizing and antioxidant defensive genes, all contributing to an adaptive response to cellular stress. Many of the protective enzymes encoded by these adaptive response genes, including NQO1 (4Li Y. Jaiswal A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), heme oxygenase 1 (5Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M. Cook J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), have been shown to be coordinately up-regulated through antioxidant-responsive elements (AREs) (10Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14648-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also known as electrophile-responsive elements or EpREs (6Friling R.S. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), located within the promoters of their respective genes. The presence of consensus AREs in the promoter of each GCL subunit gene provides an appealing mechanism to explain the apparent coordinate regulation of these two genes detected in early studies of cellular responses to oxidative and electrophilic challenges. However, recent evidence demonstrating differential expression of the two GCL subunit genes following exposure to certain chemical and physical agents suggests that regulation of the two genes is complex (11Wild A.C. Mulcahy R.T. Free Rad. Res. 2000; 32: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although induction of GCLC by β-NF (9Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.B. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and lactacystin (12Sekhar K.R. Soltaninassab S.R. Borrelli M.J., Xu, Z.Q. Meredith M.J. Domann F.E. Freeman M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) has been shown to be regulated through a distal ARE, other studies have reported that GCLC induction following exposure to the pro-oxidants menadione or hydrogen peroxide is mediated through an AP-1 site (13Rahman I. Bel A. Mulier B. Lawson M.F. Harrison D.J. Macnee W. Smith C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 14Rahman I. Smith C.A. Antonicelli F. MacNee W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and induction following exposure to ionizing radiation can be mediated via an NF-κB site (15Iwanaga M. Mori K. Iida T. Urata Y. Matsuo T. Yasunaga A. Shibata S. Kondo T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1256-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the case of transcriptional activation of the human GCLM subunit gene we reported that two distinct regions of the promoter, an ARE located ∼300 base pairs upstream of the ATG start site and a putative AP-1 site located 33 base pairs upstream of the ARE (8Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), can direct induction following exposure to β-NF. In contrast, Galloway and McLellan (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that neither the ARE nor the AP-1 site was capable of supporting GCLM induction following exposure to the phenolic antioxidant tBHQ or β-NF. They concluded that one or more unidentified cis-elements located within a 42-base pair region of the GCLM promoter immediately upstream of the ARE site, but overlapping the nucleotides that we identified as an AP-1 site, mediates induction (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To better define the transcriptional regulation of GSH homeostasis in general and GCLM subunit gene control in particular, we re-evaluated the functional significance of the region between −345 and −209 of the GCLM promoter. Our results confirm that the ARE is capable of supporting induction of GCLM expression following exposure to tBHQ, as was previously reported for β-NF. However, as suggested by Galloway and McLellan (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the upstream cis-element capable of supporting GCLM induction is not an AP-1 site per se. Our results indicate that the upstream regulatory element responsible for up-regulation of the GCLM gene is in fact a second ARE, unidentified in previous analyses because of a single nucleotide mismatch within the ARE consensus sequence in a position previously considered to be invariant. In addition to reconciling fundamental differences in previous experimental observations and identifying specific regulatory sequences capable of directing induced expression of the GCLM gene, the findings reported strongly suggest that the ARE consensus sequence needs to be revised. Transient transfection assays were performed as described previously (8Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures of HepG2 liver hepatoblastoma cells were grown overnight in 6-well plates in complete (10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin) Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium (DMEM) and then aspirated and refed with fresh complete DMEM. Two hours later, each well was transfected with 1–2 μg of luciferase reporter DNA plus 0.5 μg of a plasmid encoding β-galactosidase, using a standard calcium phosphate transfection procedure. 4–6 h after transfection, cells were shocked with 10% glycerol in the medium for 3 min. Cells were washed twice with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and then refed with complete DMEM. Approximately 24 h later, cells were treated with media containing Me2SO or 100 μm tBHQ dissolved in Me2SO. 18 h after addition of tBHQ, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested using Promega reporter lysis buffer. Cellular extracts were analyzed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity and protein concentration, compared with activity in cells transfected with control vectors, and expressed as relative luciferase activity. Creation of GCLM reporter constructs containing specific deletions or point mutations was described previously (8Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The −1927/GCLM5′Δ−348:−183 construct was made by digesting the full-length −1927/GCLM5′-luc transgene with SacII and AgeI, blunt-ending the cut sites, and re-ligating. Single mutants mA1 and mA3, as used by Galloway and McLellan (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), were created using Promega Gene Editor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system, using the wild-type −1927/GCLM5′-luctransgene as a template (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The double ARE/AP-1 mutant, mA1:3, was made with the Stratagene QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit using the mA3 construct as a template. All recombinant vectors were sequenced to confirm the sequence of regions of interest. To make the enhancer/reporter transgenes (−346:−303, −345:−315, −346:−334, −344:−329, −346:−324, −346:−303m, and −346: −303mA3), complementary pairs of oligonucleotides (see Fig. 5A) were synthesized at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center. The oligonucleotides were annealed as described (17Tilburn J. Sarkar S. Widdick D.A. Espeso E.A. Orejas M. Mungroo J. Penalva M.A. Arst Jr., H.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), phosphorylated, and then ligated into theSmaI site of the pT81-luciferase vector (ATCC 37584), creating the various enhancer vectors shown. The T(−330)A mutant was created with the Stratagene QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit using the −346:−303 enhancer/reporter transgene as a template. The −312 and −302 inserts (see Fig. 4) were created using a PCR strategy and were cloned into the SmaI:NcoI site of a pGL3-Basic vector, which had been mutated by introduction of a point mutation into an AP-1 site contained in the parental pGL3-Basic as described previously (18Wild A.C. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The 5′-PCR primer for the −313 construct was 5′-TGCTTAGTCATTGTCTTCCA-3′ and for the −303 construct it was 5′-CTACGATTTCTGCTTAGTCA-3′, and both utilized the same 3′-PCR primer, 5′-GGCGTCTTCCATGGCAGCGG-3′. The PCR reaction was performed usingPfu polymerase utilizing the full-length −1927/GCLM5′-luc reporter construct as a template. The ARE consensus sequence of the −312 construct was mutated from ATGACTCAGCA to AgGACTCAGCA using the 5′–3′ MORPH DNA site-directed mutagenesis kit to create the −312m construct. Complimentary oligonucleotides containing the human hNQO1 ARE sequence (hNQO1) were prepared for use as double-stranded probes as described previously (19Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The sequence of the sense strand was 5′-CAGTCACAGTGACTCAGCAGAATCTG-3′. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Digman et al. (20Digman J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar) from HepG2 cells following treatment with Me2SO or 100 μm tBHQ for 18 h. Incubation conditions and non-denaturing gel analysis were performed as reported previously (19Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). To localizecis-elements capable of mediating tBHQ induction, a series of promoter/luciferase transgenes containing progressive deletions of the full-length (1927 bp) GCLM 5′-promoter were transfected into HepG2 cells. As observed previously for β-NF, maximal induction by tBHQ (∼2.5–4-fold) was achieved with a transgene containing the −345-−209 promoter fragment (Fig. 1). No further induction was observed in cells transfected with transgenes including longer GCLM promoter fragments. Regulation of basal expression was also similar to previous findings (8Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Elements within the −345:−209 fragment of the promoter contributed ∼50% of basal expression, whereas the remainder was mediated by elements contained within the −713:−345 promoter fragment. To confirm that full inducibility of the GCLM gene was solely mediated by the −345:−209 fragment of the promoter, a mutant transgene in which the region between −348:−183 was deleted (−1927/GCLM5′Δ−348:−183) was engineered. Transfection of the −1927/GCLM5′Δ−348:−183 transgene into HepG2 cells completely eliminated the induction of reporter gene expression following tBHQ exposure. The −345:−209 promoter fragment contains both an ARE (−302:−292) and an AP-1 site (−341:−335), suggesting that one or both elements may mediate tBHQ induction as reported previously for β-NF (8Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To examine the functional capabilities of these elements further, mutations in the ARE (m1, m2), upstream AP-1 site (m4), or both sites (m1m4, m2m4) were introduced into the wild-type −1927/GCLM5′-luc transgene (Fig.2A). When either the ARE (m3, m4, m3m4) or the upstream AP-1 site (m1, m2) were left intact, full induction (2–2.5-fold) of the transgene by tBHQ was retained. Induction was only lost when mutations of both sites were introduced simultaneously (m1m4, m2m4). Mutation of the consensus AP-1 site contained within the GCLM ARE (m1, m3, m1m4, and m3m4) did not significantly influence induction of reporter gene expression. These outcomes were entirely consistent with our previous reports with β-NF (8Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Because the mutations of the ARE and AP-1 sites used by Galloway and McLellan (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) differed slightly from the mutations used for our studies, transgenes replicating the ARE mutant (mA1), AP-1 mutant (mA3), and ARE/AP-1 double mutant (mA1:3) (Fig.3A) used by these authors were created and transfected into HepG2 cells. These new mutants are similar to the m2, m4, and m2m4 transgenes, respectively, used in our previous study except for the specific base substitutions used to disrupt the AP-1 and ARE sequences (compare Figs. 2A and 3A). Like their counterparts (the m2 and m4 mutants) mA1 and mA3 were fully inducible by tBHQ (Fig. 3B) as reported previously (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). So, too, was the double mutant mA1:3. This observation replicated Galloway and McLellan's (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) experience with the double mutant but differed dramatically with the m2m4 double mutant, which failed to respond to tBHQ exposure (Fig. 2B). Thus, these experiments confirmed the previously reported results from each laboratory, suggesting that the very slight differences between the m2m4 and mA1:3 mutants are sufficient to either confer or ablate inducibility. Based on previous analyses of GCLM promoter functions, elements capable of supporting increased expression in response to β-NF or tBHQ were proposed to be the ARE (−302:−292), the upstream AP-1 site (−341:−335), (8Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) or a 42-bp region immediately upstream of the ARE (−344:−303) (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To further delineate the role of these three elements in induction of the GCLM gene, a series of additional promoter/reporter transgenes were developed and transfected into HepG2 cells. Two new transgenes, each containing the GCLM ARE sequence, the first terminating at the 3′-limit of the core ARE sequence (−302; Fig.4A) and the second including an additional 10 bp of 3′-flanking sequence from the GCLM promoter (−312) were generated from −1927/GCLM 5′-luc by deleting the GCLM promoter sequence further upstream. Although the longer of the two transgenes (−312) supported higher levels of basal expression (Fig. 4B), both were induced by tBHQ treatment. Introduction of a single base mutation within the consensus ARE core (−312m) completely eliminated tBHQ responsiveness. Collectively these data demonstrate that the GCLM ARE is capable of directing increased expression following exposure to this agent. The 42-base pair fragment (−344:−303) immediately upstream of the ARE sequence, but not the AP-1 site contained therein, has been hypothesized to mediate induction of the GCLM gene (18Wild A.C. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Expression of two enhancer/reporter transgenes (−346:−303 and −345:−315, Fig. 5A) containing this region of the promoter was induced (∼3-fold) by exposure to 100 μm tBHQ (Fig. 5B). However, three different AP-1 enhancers, each including an intact AP-1 site and variable lengths of flanking sequence (−346:−334, −344:−329, and −346:−324), failed to respond to tBHQ by directing increased reporter expression, demonstrating that the AP-1 sequence per se was incapable of enhancing expression following tBHQ exposure. Nevertheless, mutation of the AP-1 sequence from TGAGTAA togGAGTAA (−346:−303m; corresponding to the mutation introduced to generate the m4 mutant, Fig. 3A) eliminated the induction of the −346:−303 transgene, indicating that this nucleotide position contributes to the inducibility inherent in this region of the promoter. Paradoxically, when the AP-1 sequence was mutated from TGAGTAA to ctAGTAA (−346:−303mA3) as done by Galloway and McLellan (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to produce the mA3 mutant, tBHQ inducibility was retained. These enhancer studies suggest that the −345:−315 region of the GCLM promoter includes one or more response elements other than the AP-1 site capable of supporting full induction of the gene, independently of the downstream GCLM ARE. However, sequence analysis failed to identify any candidatecis-elements within this region. When the sequence of the 44-bp fragment from −346-−303 was aligned with the expanded consensus ARE motif defined by Wasserman and Fahl (21Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), a remarkably strong match was identified (Fig. 6A). The region of the GCLM promoter between positions −337 and −318 satisfies the ARE core motif requirements with a single exception, a T instead of a G at position −330. Although the alignment depicted in Fig.6A suggests an additional departure in the 3′-end of the expanded consensus ARE sequence, Wasserman and Fahl (21Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) determined that a minimum of three of the last four positions (wwww) needed to be occupied by either an A or a T, with no particular requirement for specific order. The 3′-end of the −337:−318 fragment therefore satisfies this requirement. To evaluate the possibility that the −337:−318 fragment might function as an ARE despite this single base difference with the defined ARE consensus, the T at −330 within the −345:−315 enhancer was mutated to an A, a nucleotide previously shown to ablate ARE function (22Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The T(−330)A mutation completely eliminated induction by tBHQ (Fig. 6B). To complete the analysis, T → G and T → C mutations were introduced at the −330 residue in the −345:−315 enhancer. The T(−330)G enhancer was capable of directing a ∼4-fold greater constitutive expression relative to the wild-type sequence but was similarly responsive (∼2.5-fold) to induction by tBHQ. The T(−330)C enhancer lacked both constitutive and inducible activity. These studies suggested that the wild-type −337:−318 sequence constitutes a functional ARE and that the TTAC motif was less potent at directing constitutive expression than the TGAC motif but that either motif was capable of directing full induction following exposure to tBHQ. Because the GCA-box at the 3′-end of the core ARE sequence has also been shown to be essential for ARE function, we mutated the GCA in the wild-type −345:−315 enhancer to TTT and eliminated basal and inducible properties. To further test the hypothesis that the TTAC may function as an ARE, we introduced the same series of mutations described above into an enhancer/reporter vector containing the ARE from the human NQO1 gene, transfected the vectors into HepG2 cells, and examined luciferase expression following exposure to tBHQ. As expected, the wild-type hNQO1 enhancer directed constitutive expression of the luciferase gene (Fig.6C). Expression was induced ∼2.5-fold by tBHQ. Substitution of an A or C for G in the TGAC core motif eliminated both the basal and inducible responses. Interestingly, however, the G → T mutation, rather than ablating ARE function, resulted in an enhancer with reduced basal expression but full inducibility. As was true for the wild-type −345:−315 enhancer, mutation of the hNQO1 GCA-box eliminated basal and inducible enhancer activity. Because the TTAC motif retained ARE function, albeit reduced relative to the properties of the TGAC sequence, the ability of the wild-type −345:−315 sequence and each of the three T−330 mutants to compete for binding of proteins to an hNQO1 ARE probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assays were compared. Unlabeled probes corresponding to the hNQO1 and GCLM AREs both effectively competed with the labeled hNQO1 probe for protein binding following tBHQ exposure (Fig. 7; compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 2). The GCLM −345:−315 TtAC and TcAC mutants were ineffective as competitors (lanes 6 and 8). Not surprisingly the effectiveness of the TgAC mutation was comparable with the two consensus ARE probes (lanes 3, 4, and 7). The wild-type −345:−315 GCLM sequence (TTAC) partially competed with the hNQO1 probe (lane 5 versus lanes 6, 7, and 8). Two independent investigations have demonstrated that constitutive expression of the human GCLM subunit gene is mediated by an AP-1 site located at −341:−335 in the promoter of the gene (8Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additional sequences upstream of the AP-1 site also contribute to maximal basal expression (8Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Both studies also mapped elements responsible for induction of the GCLM gene to a common region of the GCLM promoter, between nucleotides −345 and −209 in one case and between −411 and −256 in the other. The region of overlap, −345 to −256, contains a consensus ARE as well as the AP-1 site involved in directing basal expression. The functional relevance of this region of the promoter was confirmed in the present study by loss of reporter gene inducibility in cells transfected with the −1927/GCLM5′Δ−348:−183 deletion mutant (Fig. 1). Although both studies localized inducible transactivating activity to this common region, the conclusions about the role of the AP-1 and ARE sequences in inducible expression of the gene differed significantly. Our laboratory reported that either the ARE or upstream AP-1 sites was sufficient to support induction, whereas Galloway and McLellan (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) concluded that induction was mediated by a 42-bp region immediately upstream of the ARE, including nucleotides comprising the AP-1 site but not the AP-1 site per se. Paradoxically, the results summarized in Figs. 2 and 3 confirm the previous observations from both laboratories. From Fig. 2 it is obvious that elimination of induction requires simultaneous mutation of both the ARE and AP-1 sites (m1m4 or m2m4), suggesting that either is capable of supporting induction independently of the other, as we reported previously. In contrast, the double mutant (mA1:3) employed by Galloway and McLellan (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) continued to support inducible expression (Fig. 3) as had been reported, suggesting that neither element was required for induction. These results, therefore, failed to unequivocally resolve the question regarding whether the ARE and AP-1 sites are involved in GCLM induction in response to these two agents. To better define possible roles for these cis-elements in GCLM gene regulation the properties of promoter/reporter transgenes or enhancers containing only one or the other of the two sequences were evaluated. The −302/GCLM5′-luc and −312/GCLM5′-luc promoter/reporter transgenes (each containing the GCLM ARE at −302:−292) supported basal expression and full induction of the luciferase gene following tBHQ exposure (Fig. 4). A single base mutation disrupting the consensus ARE sequence abolished this response, firmly establishing that the GCLM ARE is capable of mediating induction. Favreau and Pickett (23Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) demonstrated previously that nucleotides contiguous to the 3′-end of the minimal ARE sequence, particularly multiple adenines, exert a profound enhancing effect on basal expression, as was observed for the −312/GCLM5′-luctransgene (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the elimination of 3′-flanking sequences decreased tBHQ induction by ∼30% as described by Wasserman and Fahl (21Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Hence, the GCLM ARE at −302:−292 exhibits all of the functional characteristics typical of an ARE. Assessment of the potential role of the AP-1 site using a series of enhancer/reporter constructs spanning the 44-bp region between −346 and −303 (upstream of the ARE; Fig. 5) clearly indicates that induction by sequences upstream of the ARE does not involve the AP-1 site per se, contrary to our earlier conclusion. This is clearly evident by the failure of the −346:−334, −344:−329, and −346:−324 enhancers, each containing the intact AP-1 motif, to respond to tBHQ exposure. Although the introduction of the specific AP-1-disrupting mutation (−346:−303m; TGAGTAA togGAGTAA) into the inducible −346:−303 enhancer completely abolished the responsiveness of the enhancer, in aggregate the data support Galloway and McLellan's (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) conclusion that the 42-bp fragment immediately upstream of the ARE can support induction of the GCLM gene but does not involve the AP-1 site as such. We also examined the functional consequences of the specific AP-1-disrupting mutation (−346:−303mA3; TGAGTAA toctAGTAA) examined by Galloway and McLellan (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Even though this double base mutant and the single base −346:−303m mutant described above each contained a mutation at nucleotide position −341 (see Fig. 5A), the mA3 mutant enhancer/reporter was still inducible by tBHQ (Fig. 5B), in contrast to the single base mutant. Why two strikingly similar mutants would manifest such profoundly different consequences is currently unknown. However, the failure of the mA3 mutation to ablate induction following tBHQ exposure provides an explanation for the paradoxical results reported in the two original publications describing GCLM promoter characterizations. Galloway and McLellan (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) based their conclusion that induction of the GCLM gene was not regulated by the ARE at −302:−292 largely on the observation that the GCLM promoter mutant (mA1:3) containing a mutation of the ARE (mA1) as well as the AP-1-disrupting mA3 mutation continued to support induction following tBHQ and β-NF exposures. However, as shown in the current study, the specific base substitutions employed to create the mA3 mutant are of little functional consequence in and of themselves. Hence, the mA1:3 mutant was functionally not a double mutant; it retained an inducible upstream element. In contrast, the current enhancer studies confirm that both inducible activities were functionally disrupted in the m1m4 mutant used by Moinova and Mulcahy (8Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The functional difference between these two mutants therefore accounts for the most significant difference in the findings reported in the two previous reports. The enhancer studies summarized in Fig. 5 were also particularly informative for identifying the cis-element(s) within the 44-bp −346:−303 region of the promoter that is operative in induction of the gene, enabling functional mapping of potential regulatory sites to the region between nucleotides −345 and −315. Subsequent analyses revealed that this region of the promoter comprises a previously unrecognized functional ARE spanning nucleotides −337 to −318 (Fig.6). Prior recognition of this site as an ARE was masked by the presence of a T instead of a G at position −330 within the sequence, which otherwise satisfies the expanded ARE consensus (Fig. 6) as defined by Wasserman and Fahl (21Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Designation of this sequence as an ARE, despite the single base difference with the core motif, is supported by the otherwise high degree of homology with the expanded ARE consensus sequence, by the disruption of function following introduction of a specific single base mutation (5′-TGAC-3′ to 5′-TAAC-3′) known to abolish ARE function (22Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by the observation that mutation of the TGAC motif in the prototypic hNQO1 ARE to TTAC preserves ARE function (albeit with lower basal potency), and by the ability of the TTAC-containing sequence to partially compete with the hNQO1 ARE sequence for protein binding (Fig.7). Prior to the current study, the G within the 5′-TGACnnnGCA-3′ core consensus ARE motif was considered to be an invariant requirement for basal and inducible activity of AREs. In fact, following a comprehensive analysis of ARE sequence requirements, Favreau and Pickett (23Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) concluded that the TGA sequence within the 5′-GTGACnnnGCA-3′ was absolutely required for high basal and inducible expression. However, in defining the sequence requirements for functional AREs, all previous studies only considered the influence of a substitution of an A for the G at this position within the TGA sequence. Although this particular substitution was shown to ablate induction following exposure to various ARE-inducers, the functional consequences of a T or C substitution were not previously considered, leaving open the possibility that an operative ARE could accommodate either of these nucleotides at this position within the ARE core motif. Our findings with both the GCLM ARE at −337:−318 and the hNQO1 ARE demonstrate that substitution of an A or C for the G residue in the core ARE sequence (5′-TGACnnnGCA-3′) eliminates ARE function. More importantly, the sequence 5′-TTACnnnGCA-3′ supports ARE function. The two functional ARE sequences are not, however, functionally equivalent with respect to constitutive expression; the 5′-TTACnnnGCA-3′ motif is only ∼25% as effective as an enhancer of basal expression. Nevertheless, in terms of gene induction following exposure to tBHQ the two sequences are equipotent. Based on the studies described in this report we conclude that the GCLM promoter contains two adjacent AREs (Fig. 7A), each capable of supporting induction of the gene in response to tBHQ, β-NF, and most likely other Phase II enzyme inducers. It is also important to note that residues flanking the variant ARE must also contribute in some way to GCLM gene induction because site-directed mutagenesis of position −341 effectively eliminated induction by the −346:−303 promoter fragment (Fig. 5). The identification of the variant ARE rationalizes differences reported in the two previous analyses of GCLM promoter function because this sequence is contained within the functional 42-base pair fragment identified by Galloway and McLellan (16Galloway D.C. McLellan L.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition to resolving issues specifically related to the control of expression of the human GCLM gene, these studies further demonstrate that the consensus ARE core sequence should be revised to 5′-RTKAYnnnGCR-3′. Such revisions of the consensus sequence will undoubtedly culminate in identification of additional ARE-regulated genes."

In recent years its role in membrane traffic has emerged as one of its predominant functions, but the regulation of its intracellular distribution still remains unclear. We demonstrated that annexin 6 translocates to the late endocytic compartment in low density lipoprotein-loaded CHO cells. This prompted us to investigate whether cholesterol, one of the major constituents of low density lipoprotein, could influence the membrane binding affinity and intracellular distribution of annexin 6. Treatment of crude membranes or early and late endosomal fractions with digitonin, a cholesterol-sequestering agent, displayed a strong reduction in the binding affinity of a novel EDTA-resistant and cholesterol-sensitive pool of annexin 6 proteins. In addition, U18666A-induced accumulation of cholesterol in the late endosomal compartment resulted in a significant increase of annexin 6 in these vesicles in vivo. This translocation/recruitment correlates with an increased membrane binding affinity of GST-annexin 6 to late endosomes of U18666A-treated cells in vitro.

Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). They are widely expressed and have been demonstrated to reside in one or more membranous structures depending on the cell type or tissue analyzed. As any one cell might express as many as ten different annexins, the understanding of the distinct physiological role of each annexin still remains elusive (1Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys.

In recent years several annexins, including annexins 2 and 6, have been found at the plasma membrane in endocytic and secretory vesicles and have directly been implicated in the regulation of different steps of endo- and/or exocytic trafficking pathways (1Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 2Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Bandorowicz-Pikula J. Annexins - Biological Importance and Annexin-related Pathologies. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2002Google Scholar). Recently it was suggested that annexin 6 is involved in remodeling the spectrin cytoskeleton at the cell surface during receptor-mediated endocytosis (9Kamal A. Ying Y. Anderson R.G.W. J.

Complex protein-protein interactions ultimately facilitate the release of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane, although the involvement of annexin 6 is not instrumental in the budding event itself as previously hypothesized (9Kamal A.

In addition to the plasma membrane, annexin 6 is also found in other membrane structures of the endocytic and exocytic compartments (11Tagoe C.E. Boustead C.M. Higgins S.J. Walter J.H. Biochim.

In previous studies we were able to demonstrate that annexin 6 is localized predominantly in the apical endosomes of rat hepatocytes (17Ortega D. Pol A. Biermer M. Jäckle S. Enrich C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 261-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although it is also in the prelysosomal compartment of NRK1 or WIF-B cells (18Pons M. Ihrke G. Koch S. Biermer M. Pol A. Grewal T. Jäckle S. Enrich C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 33-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Little is known about how the cells control the topologic intracellular distribution of annexin 6. Although the majority of annexin 6 are most likely targeted to membranes via Ca2+-dependent binding to negatively charged phospholipids, recent findings suggest that other components such as acidic pH and cholesterol could also stimulate the membrane binding affinity of annexin 6 (19Golczak M. Kicinski A. Bandorowicz-Pikula J. Buchet R. Szewczyk A. Pikula S. FASEB J. 2001; 6: 1083-1085Google Scholar, 20Ayala-Sanmartin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FASEB J. 2001; 6: 1083-1085Google Scholar) demonstrated that acidic pH stimulates the binding of porcine liver annexin 6 to phospholipid bi- and monolayers in a Ca2+-independent manner. Lowering the pH seems to induce conformational changes in annexin 6, leading to increased hydrophobicity and membrane binding affinity (21Golczak M. Kicinski A. Bandorowicz-Pikula J. Buchet R.

Most of the results obtained for the potential role of cholesterol affecting the membrane binding of annexin 6 are derived from studies on another member of the annexin family in the early endosomal compartment, annexin 2, which also binds to biological membranes in the absence of calcium (20Ayala-Sanmartin J.

However, low concentrations of cholesterol-sequestering agents like filipin or digitonin quantitatively released annexin 2 from the membranes (23Harder T. Kellner R. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar,24Jost M. Zeuschner D. Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 221-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is in agreement with the restoration of the Ca2+-independent membrane association of annexin 2 to cholesterol-depleted chromaffin granule membranes after cholesterol replenishment (26Ayala-Sanmartin J. Henry J.P. Pradel L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, addition of cholesterol increased the membrane binding affinity of annexin 2 to phosphatidylserine (PS)-enriched liposomes (20Ayala-Sanmartin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Ayala-Sanmartin J. Henry J.P. Pradel L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Until recently it was believed that annexins do not interact directly with cholesterol, but Smart and co-workers (29Uittenbogaard A. Everson W.V. Matveev S.V. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4925-4931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) identified annexin 2 in a cytosolic complex together with cholesterol and caveolin. Therefore, cholesterol may directly or indirectly affect the membrane binding affinity of annexins, and eventually, their intracellular localization. Annexin 6 is a very dynamic protein that undergoes dramatic changes in the intracellular distribution. Babiychuk et al. (30Babiychuk E.B. Palstra R.J. Schaller J. Kämpfer U. Draeger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35191-35195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Babiychuk E.B. Draeger A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) identified the Ca2+-regulated and reversible association of annexin 6 with the membrane cytoskeleton in smooth muscle cells. The Ca2+-dependent association of annexin 6 with lipid rafts was observed in synaptic plasma membranes of rat brain (32Orito A. Kumanogoh H. Yasaka K. Sokawa J. Hidaka H. Sokawa Y. Maekawa S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 64: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similarly, oxidative stress-induced changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were accompanied by the translocation of annexin 6 from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm (33Hoyal C.R. Thomas A.P. Forman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29205-29210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Besides these Ca2+-induced changes, we recently described the ligand-induced translocation of annexin 6 in response to LDL uptake (34Grewal T. Heeren J. Mewawala D. Schnitgerhans T. Wendt D. Salomon G. Enrich C. Beisiegel U. Jäckle S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33806-33813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In these experiments accumulation of LDL-containing vesicles was accompanied by an increased amount of annexin 6 in the late endosomal compartment (34Grewal T. Heeren J. Mewawala D. Schnitgerhans T. Wendt D. Salomon G. Enrich C. Beisiegel U. Jäckle S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33806-33813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As cholesterol is the major lipid component of LDL, it could play a role in the increased association of annexin 6 in late endosomes of LDL-loaded cells. Up-to-date experimental evidence of cholesterol stimulating the membrane binding affinity of annexin 6 only comes from in vitro binding studies with artificial membranes (PS liposomes) (20Ayala-Sanmartin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). But essentially nothing is known about the role of cholesterol regarding the intracellular localization and binding affinity of annexin 6 to endosomal membranes. In the present study we determined that cholesterol sequestration of endosomal membranes reduces the membrane binding affinity of an EDTA-resistant pool of annexin 6. Furthermore, accumulation of cholesterol in late endosomes results in the rearrangement of the intracellular localization/distribution of annexin 6. Taken together these findings indicate that within the endosomal compartment not only phospholipids but also cholesterol participates in the modulation of annexin 6 localization and function. Ham's F-12 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, l-glutamine, PBS, fetal calf serum, trypsin, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Invitrogen. Bovine serum albumin, glycine, horseradish peroxidase, paraformaldehyde, and filipin were purchased from Sigma. Mowiol® 4-88 was fromCalbiochem. Digitonin was purchased from Fluka, and U18666A was from Biomol. Two different antibodies to annexin 6 were used: a rabbit anti-annexin 6 antibody raised against GST-annexin 6 and an affinity-purified sheep anti-annexin 6 antibody (AB3718) raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the first 11 N-terminal amino acids of rat annexin 6 (MAKIAQGAMYR) (34Grewal T.

Secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent labeled) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12, and NRK cells were grown in in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The generation of the annexin 6-overexpressing CHO cell line CHOanx6 has been described (34Grewal T. Heeren J. Mewawala D. Schnitgerhans T. Wendt D. Salomon G. Enrich C. Beisiegel U. Jäckle S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33806-33813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol, cells were treated for 3–24 h with U18666A (2 μg/ml) as described (37Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant annexin 6 was obtained as GST fusion protein. Full-length 2.0-kb annexin 6 cDNA was cloned into pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences) to generate the GST gene fusion vector GST-anx6. GST-anx6 was expressed in BL21 pLysE Escherichia coli strain and purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography as described (38Pons M. Grewal T. Rius E. Schnitgerhans T. Jäckle S. Enrich C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 269: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For Western blotting 5–20 μg of cell protein were resolved by 10–12% SDS-PAGE (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and transferred to ProtranR nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schüll). Annexin 6 in the overexpressing CHOanx6 cell line and GST-annexin 6 were detected using the polyclonal sheep anti-annexin 6 antibody. Endogenous annexin 6 in wild-type CHO cells was detected with the polyclonal rabbit anti-annexin 6 antibody. Annexin 2 and caveolin proteins were detected with the antibodies described above. After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies the reaction product was finally detected using the ECL system (AmershamBiosciences). CHO, CHOanx6, or NRK cells (∼1 × 105) were grown on chamberslides (Nunc). 24 h after plating cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed for 10 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer prior to permeabilization with 0.1% saponin in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, PBS for 15 min. Then cells were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with primary antibodies, rinsed with PBS, and incubated for 45 min with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies anti-mouse F(ab′)2 or anti-sheep F(ab′)2fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Cholesterol was stained with filipin (10–20 μg/ml) together with the secondary antibodies. Samples were washed extensively with PBS, and finally the chamberslides were mounted with Mowiol®. In some experiments, cells were treated with 2 μg/ml of U18666A for 4–24 h. After treatment cells were washed with PBS and fixed. Confocal images were collected using a Leica TCS NT equipped with a ×63 Leitz Plan-Apo objective (numerical aperture, 1.4). Deconvoluted images requiring UV analysis (filipin) were obtained with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a Cool SNAP-HQ (Photometrics) digital camera. For the preparation of crude membranes and endosomal membrane fractions, 4–6 × 107 CHOwt or CHOanx6 cells were lysed and separated on sucrose gradients as described (34Grewal T. Heeren J. Mewawala D.

After cell lysis the homogenate was centrifuged and the postnuclear supernatant (PNS) served as a crude membrane extract. For the isolation of early and late endosomes the PNS was prepared according to the protocol of Gorvel et al. (40Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). PNS was brought to a final 40.2% sucrose (w/v) concentration by adding 62% sucrose (3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) and 35% sucrose. 25% sucrose and finally homogenization buffer were poured stepwise on top of the PNS. The gradient was centrifuged for 90 min at 35,000 rpm, 4 °C in a swingout Beckman SW40 rotor. After centrifugation 1-ml fractions were collected from top to bottom, and the fractions representing early (4Donelly S.R. Moss S.E. Cell Mol.

Aliquots of each fraction were assayed for β-hexosaminidase activity as described (34Grewal T. Heeren J. Mewawala D. Schnitgerhans T. Wendt D. Salomon G. Enrich C. Beisiegel U. Jäckle S. J. Biol.

For the characterization of the Ca2+-dependent binding of annexin 6, 100 μl of PNS or early and late endosomes from 5 × 107 to 1 × 108 CHOwt or CHOanx6 cells were incubated in ± 5 mm EDTA for 30 min at 4 °C. Membranes were pelleted in a TL-100 Beckman ultracentrifuge at 45,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 100–200 μl of HB buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors), and aliquots of the supernatant and pellet were analyzed by Western blotting for the distribution of annexin 6, annexin 2, and caveolin. For the characterization of the cholesterol-sensitive binding of annexin 6, the membranes were pretreated with 5 mm EDTA for 30 min at 4 °C, pelleted as described above, resuspended in HB buffer, and incubated in ± 5 μg/ml digitonin for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. The membranes were pelleted again at 45,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C and resuspended in HB buffer. Aliquots of the membranes and the supernatant were analyzed for the distribution of annexins and caveolin. For the binding of GST-annexin 6 to ±U18666A-treated early and late endosomes, 3 μg of GST-annexin 6 were incubated in the presence of Ca2+ (0–50 μm) with 100 μl of late endosomal fraction for 30 min at 4 °C. Membranes were pelleted as described above, and aliquots of the membrane and unbound fraction were analyzed for distribution of GST-annexin 6. The amount of cholesterol in early and late endosomes of cells incubated with ±U18666A was determined with the AmplexTM Red Cholesterol Assay kit (Molecular Probes). For the fluorometric quantification, 25 μl of endosomes and cholesterol standards (PrecinormTM, PrecipathTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were incubated in 24-well plates according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and fluorescence was detected using FluorocountTM (Packard Instrument Co.). To study the effect of cholesterol on the binding of annexin 6 to biological membranes, postnuclear crude membrane fractions from annexin 6-overexpressing cells (CHOanx6) (Fig. 1A) and CHOwt (Fig. 1B) were isolated and analyzed for their association with annexin 6 after cholesterol sequestration with digitonin. To control for the Ca2+-dependent binding of annexin 6, membranes from CHOanx6 were first treated with or without EDTA, and the amount of annexin 6 in the membrane-bound (Fig 1, Pel, one-third of total) and unbound fractions (Sup, one-half of total) was determined. Annexin 2 and caveolin served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Whereas annexin 2 is known to bind to membranes in a Ca2+- and cholesterol-dependent manner, caveolin is resistant to the incubation of membranes with either EDTA or digitonin (24Jost M. Zeuschner D. Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 221-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25König J. Gerke V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In untreated membranes of CHOanx6 cells, annexin 6, annexin 2, and caveolin were predominantly found in the membrane-bound fraction (with annexin 2 and caveolin being more abundant in the membrane-bound fraction) (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 2). As expected, incubation of membranes with 5 mm EDTA resulted in a strongly reduced binding of annexin 6 and annexin 2 (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 5 and 6). Similar results were obtained from crude membranes of CHO control cells (Fig.1B, compare lanes 7 and 8 withlanes 11 and 12), indicating that overexpression of annexin 6 did not alter annexin 2 and caveolin membrane binding properties. Treatment of membranes with low concentrations of digitonin (5 μg/ml) did not negatively affect the membrane binding affinity of annexin 6, annexin 2, or caveolin (Fig. 1A, comparelanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4; Fig. 1B, compare lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 9 and 10). However, the treatment of crude membranes with EDTA did not remove all annexin 6 and annexin 2 proteins from cellular membranes. In five independent experiments the amount of EDTA-resistant annexin proteins represented approximately 20–30% total annexin 6 and 40–60% total annexin 2 (Fig. 1A, lane 6; Fig. 1B, lane 12). In order to study the effect of digitonin on the EDTA-resistant pool of annexin 6, the crude membrane extract of CHOanx6 cells (Fig. 2A) was pretreated with EDTA to remove the EDTA-sensitive pool of annexin proteins. These membranes were pelleted, resuspended, incubated with digitonin (Fig.2A), and pelleted again. Then the distribution of annexin 6 was analyzed in the membrane-bound and the unbound fraction (50% each fraction). A second incubation of EDTA-pretreated membranes with EDTA did not affect the binding of the Ca2+-insensitive annexin proteins (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, after digitonin treatment we observed a significant reduction in the membrane binding of the annexin 6 and annexin 2 remaining after EDTA pretreatment (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 2 withlanes 5 and 6). Incubation of EDTA together with digitonin did not lead to an additional loss of annexin 6 binding. But EDTA and digitonin strongly reduced the binding of annexin 2 (Fig.2A, lanes 7 and 8) indicating a cooperative role for cholesterol in Ca2+-dependent binding to annexin 2. This digitonin-sensitive binding of EDTA-resistant annexin 6 in CHOanx6 could be the result of a partially reduced or altered Ca2+-dependent binding affinity of a pool of annexin 6 proteins because of the high annexin 6 overexpression in CHOanx6 cells. Therefore, the effect of cholesterol sequestration on the EDTA-resistant pool of endogenous annexin 6 proteins in CHOwt cells was analyzed (Fig. 1B). Crude membrane extracts from CHO controls were pretreated with EDTA, pelleted, resuspended, and incubated again with EDTA or with digitonin. Then the distribution of endogenous annexins (6 and 2) was analyzed in the membrane-bound or the unbound fraction as described above. Similar to the results described in Fig. 2A, digitonin slightly reduced the membrane binding of EDTA-resistant annexin 2 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). A second incubation of EDTA-pretreated membranes with EDTA did not affect the binding of the Ca2+-insensitive endogenous annexin 6 proteins (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). Again, digitonin strongly reduced the membrane binding of endogenous annexin 6 remaining after EDTA pretreatment (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that not only the annexin 6-overexpressing CHOanx6 cell line but also the CHOwt controls with low levels of endogenous annexin 6 contain a significant proportion of an EDTA-resistant pool of annexin 6. In CHO cells annexin 6 is predominantly found at the plasma membrane and in the endosomal compartment (34Grewal T. Heeren J. Mewawala D. Schnitgerhans T. Wendt D. Salomon G. Enrich C. Beisiegel U.

Therefore, early and late endosomes from CHOanx6 cells were analyzed to study the potential role of cholesterol on annexin 6 membrane binding in the endosomal compartment. Similar to the experiment described above, early and late endosomes from CHOanx6 cells were pretreated with 5 mm EDTA. These EDTA-pretreated endosomes were pelleted, resuspended, incubated with digitonin, and pelleted again to analyze the membrane-bound and unbound fraction. A second incubation of EDTA-pretreated membranes with EDTA confirmed the presence of EDTA-resistant annexin 6 (F"

Among the second messenger cascades initiated by TCR ligation include the phosphatidylinositol pathway where the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, is hydrolyzed to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate signals a rise in intracellular free calcium, leading to translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells into the nucleus. DAG activates RasGRP and protein kinase C θ. Because both RasGRP and protein kinase C θ are essential for thymocyte and T cell function, it is critical to understand how DAG is regulated. In this report, we demonstrate expression of DAG kinase ζ (DGKζ, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid) in multiple lymphoid organs, with highest expression observed within the T cell compartment. Overexpression studies in Jurkat T cells indicate that DGKζ interferes with TCR-induced Ras and ERK activation, AP-1 induction, and expression of the activation marker CD69. In contrast, TCR-stimulated calcium influx is not altered. Mutational analysis indicates that the kinase and DAG binding domains, but not the ankyrin repeats of DGKζ, are required for its inhibitory effects. Collectively these studies demonstrate a potential role of DGKζ to function as a selective negative regulator of DAG signaling on T cell activation and provide the first structure/function analysis of this enzyme in T cells.

Similarly, PLCγ1 deficiency (with consequent defects in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-derived second messenger production) abrogates TCR-mediated cellular activation in the Jurkat T cell model system (38Irvin B.J.

Together, these findings underscore the central role of DAG in T cell biology. Although these studies and others have demonstrated the importance of regulated production of DAG for T cell activation, the role of DAG inactivation in T cell function remains largely unexplored. DAG is phosphorylated by members of a family of kinases, the DAG kinases (DGKs), resulting in conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid (39Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 40van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Although certain DGKs have been implicated in the regulation of receptor signaling in various cellular contexts, the importance of DGKs as regulators of T cell activation is less clear. In the experiments described in this work, we focused on DGKζ (41Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11196-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 42Bunting M.

A. 1996; 93: 11196-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We documented its pattern of protein expression in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs and, by using the Jurkat T cell line as a model for TCR signaling, demonstrated that overexpression of DGKζ potently inhibits TCR-induced activation of the Ras-ERK pathway without affecting Ca2+ influx. Concordant with these observations, DGKζ blocks TCR-induced expression of CD69 and activation of an AP-1 reporter construct. Structure/function analysis demonstrated that both the kinase activity and DAG binding domains of DGKζ are essential for its ability to interfere with TCR signaling, whereas the ankyrin repeats are dispensable for such inhibition. Collectively, these observations suggest DGKζ can function as a negative regulator of T cell activation, presumably by terminating signaling via DAG. The human Jurkat leukemia T cell line and the J14 SLP-76-deficient Jurkat variant (kind gift of A. Weiss, University of California, San Francisco) (26Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 292 μg/ml ofl-glutamine (RPMI-10). The pEF-IRES-NGFR bi-cistronic expression vector was generated by replacing the Myc-His from pEF-Myc-His vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with an IRES-NGFR cassette (kindly provided by Dr. Warren Pear, University of Pennsylvania). FLAG-tagged wild type (WT), the N-terminal (ΔNT), and C-terminal (ΔCT) truncation mutants of DGKζ were generated by PCR with Pfu-Turbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using pcDNA-DGKζ WT (44Topham M.K.

The kinase dead (KD) mutant of DGKζ was generated using pcDNA-DGKζ KD (44Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) as the template, and hDGKz89F and hDGKz2900R as primers. The PCR products were digested and cloned in-frame with a FLAG tag coding sequence at the N terminus into pEF-IRES-NGFR. An N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human H-Ras (HA-Ras) construct was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using total RNA from Jurkat cells as template and HRas5′Kpn (5′ CGG GGT ACC ACG GAA TAT AAG CTG GTG G) and HRas3′RI (5′ CGG AAT TCT CAG GAG AGC ACA CAC TTG) as primers. Amplified Ras cDNA was digested with KpnI and EcoRI and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites in pHM6 (Roche Diagnostics) for HA tag and mammalian expression. Sequences of all cloned cDNAs were confirmed using automated sequence analysis. Jurkat cells were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and once with cytomix (25 mm HEPES, 120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4, 10 mmKH2PO4, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.6) (45Fang N. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16206-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were resuspended in cytomix spiked with ATP (2 μm) and glutathione (5 μm) at a concentration of 5 × 107cells/ml. For each transfection, 40 μg of test plasmids and 20 μg of the AP-1-Luc reporter (46Shapiro V.S. Mollenauer M.N. Greene W.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were added to 0.4 ml of cells in a 4-mm gap cuvette. Cells were electroporated at 250 V and 950 microfarads, incubated on ice for 10 min, transferred into 15 ml of RPMI-10, and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were harvested 18 h later and seeded in 96-well plates in triplicate at 1 or 2 × 105 cells/well in 200 μl of RPMI-10 with various stimuli; the final concentrations are as follows: 1:1000 of C305 ascites (a monoclonal IgM antibody specific for the TCR on Jurkat cells) (47Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), 1 μg/ml monoclonal anti-human CD28 antibody (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma), and 1 μg/ml ionomycin (Sigma). Eight hours after stimulation, cell pellets from each well were lysed in 110 μl of luciferase lysis buffer (1% Triton, 120 mm K2PO4, 15 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.8, with freshly added 5 mm dithiothreitol). To measure luciferase activity, 50 μl of each lysate was mixed with 50 μl of luciferase assay buffer (176 mm K2PO4, 24 mm KH2PO4, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm ATP, pH 7.8) in duplicate in a 96-well white polystyrene assay plate (Corning Incorporated, Acton, MA). Fifty μl of 1 mm luciferin (Sigma) was injected into each well, and luciferase activity was measured for 10 s after a 2-s delay by fluorimetry. J14 cells were transfected with a control vector, pEF-hSLP-76 (48Fang N. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773PubMed Google Scholar), or pEF-hSLP-76 plus the DGKζ expression vector. Thirty-six hours later, cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS. Cells were resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml, aliquoted at 0.5 ml/tube, rested at 37 °C for 30 min, and then stimulated with 1 μl of C305 ascites at 37 °C for 0, 1, 5, 15, and 30 min or stimulated with PMA (50 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 5 min. Stimulated cells were pelleted and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 7.4) with freshly added protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. Proteins in cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%) and transferred to Trans-Blot Nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and analyzed for ERK activation by probing the membrane with an anti-phospho-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Levels of transfected SLP-76 and DGKζ were assessed with anti-FLAG antibody. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with an anti-ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for loading control. In some experiments, ERK activation was analyzed in cotransfection experiments where a vector encoding Myc-tagged ERK was used. To assess the effect of DGKζ on the activation of cotransfected ERK, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) coupled to GammabindTM Plus Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with high salt buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 450 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and twice with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Proteins on the beads were denatured, resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%), and transferred as described above. The membrane was blotted with an anti-phospho-ERK antibody, stripped, and reprobed with monoclonal anti-Myc (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) to control loading. J14 cells were transfected with 40 μg of test plasmids, 20 μg of pEF-hSLP-76, and 20 μg of pHM6-Ras and stimulated as described above. Stimulated cells were pelleted and lysed in 400 μl of ice-cold MLB (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5) with freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) on ice for 15 min. Cell lysates were spun at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were mixed with 30 μg of GST-Raf-RBD fusion protein (plasmid kindly provided by Dr. Jeff Pessin, University of Iowa) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. After three washes with 0.6 ml of cold MLB, the beads were mixed with 40 μl of 2× SDS reducing buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (13%), transferred nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with an anti-HA antibody (Roche Diagnostics). Protein levels of FLAG-DGKζ, FLAG-SLP-76, and HA-Ras in each sample before GST-Raf-RBD pull-down were determined by Western blot with anti-FLAG (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and anti-HA antibodies. Jurkat cells were transfected with WT FLAG-DGKζ or the control expression vector as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, live cells were separated from dead cells via Ficoll-PaqueTM Plus (Amersham Biosciences) gradient centrifugation (2500 rpm, 20 min, room temperature). Live cells were then washed three times with RPMI-10 and resuspended at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. 1.0 ml of cells was transferred to individual wells of a 24-well plate pre-coated with different dilutions of C305 and stimulated overnight. Stimulated cells were harvested, stained with allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-CD69 and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-NGFR antibodies (BD PharMingen), and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD PharMingen) with Cellquest software. Calcium flux was measured by flow cytometry using a fluorescent calcium indicator. Briefly, 24–30 h after transfection, Jurkat cells were labeled with Indo-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and PE-conjugated anti-NGFR antibody to distinguish transfected from nontransfected cells. After establishing the base line of the ratio of FL5 to FL4, cells were stimulated with C305, and calcium flux was measured on a BD-LSR (BD PharMingen), and analyzed based on the change of ratio of FL5 to FL4. Thymocytes, splenocytes, and lymph node cells were harvested from 8-week-old C57B/6 mice according to standard procedures. Single cell suspensions (5 × 107 cells/ml) in PBS with 5% FBS and 10% normal rat serum were stained with various combinations of PE- or APC-conjugated antibodies (BD PharMingen) at 4 °C for 45 min and washed three times with PBS, 2% FBS by centrifugation. Different populations of cells were sorted using a MoFlo (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO) and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with protease inhibitors. DGKζ expression in individual populations was determined by Western blotting of lysates from 3 × 106 cells with anti-DGKζ antibody (42Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10230-10236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Previous reports (41Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The smaller transcript includes the first coding exon spliced to the third exon, whereas the larger form is generated by eliminating the first coding exon but utilizing the second (49Ding L. Bunting M. Topham M.K. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5519-5524Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We investigated expression of DGKζ protein in the lymphoid system by Western analysis using a DGKζ-specific antibody (Fig.1A), and we found that two isoforms of DGKζ protein are expressed in the thymus, spleen, and lymph node (apparent molecular masses of 115 and 130 kDa). Interestingly, in the thymus the 130-kDa form is expressed at a higher level, whereas in the spleen and lymph node the smaller (115 kDa) form predominates, suggesting developmental regulation of the two isoforms. To analyze further the pattern of DGKζ expression in hematopoietic lineages, T cells of different developmental stages, B cells, and myeloid cells were purified from mouse spleen and thymus by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Lysates were prepared from each population and examined for DGKζ expression by Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, we found that DGKζ protein is preferentially expressed in T cells, with severalfold lower expression in CD11b-positive (myeloid) cells and B220-positive (Fig.1B) cells. Within the T cell compartment, DGKζ is expressed throughout all developmental stages with both the 115- and 130-kDa isoforms easily detected. In addition, the two isoforms of DGKζ appear to be differentially regulated in the thymus with the 130-kDa form preferentially expressed in immature DN and DP thymocytes and the 115-kDa form in CD4+ and CD8+ single positive mature thymocytes. Furthermore, in the thymus and spleen, it appears that CD4+ cells express more DGKζ than CD8+ cells. Although found at a lower level, both the 115- and 130-kDa forms of DGKζ are expressed in B cells and myeloid cells with the 115-kDa species predominant. In myeloid cells, the 130-kDa form is barely detectable. Interestingly, another smaller band (Fig.1B, arrowhead) which migrates slightly faster than the 115-kDa form exists in both B and myeloid cells but is not detectable in T cells, suggesting the possibility that an additional splice variant of DGKζ may be present in specific hematopoietic lineages. Alternatively, this could be because of differential post-translational modifications of the smaller form of DGKζ in these subsets of cells. Further experiments will distinguish these possibilities. Jurkat T cells have been used extensively as a model to examine the biology of TCR signaling. As expected from our studies of primary cells, DGKζ protein is expressed in Jurkat cells by Western analysis (data not shown). To study the role of DGKζ in modulating TCR signaling, we first tested whether overexpression of DGKζ affects TCR-induced activation of the Ras-ERK pathway by examining TCR-inducible ERK phosphorylation. The 115-kDa isoform of DGKζ was used in this study because previous experiments (50Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have indicated that the 115-kDa form but not the 130-kDa form of DGKζ can inhibit RasGRP activation when overexpressed in HEK293, a human embryonic kidney cell line. Because transfection efficiency in Jurkat cells is not 100%, we made use of J14, a mutant variant of Jurkat which lacks the adapter protein, SLP-76. Due to absence of functional SLP-76, stimulation of the TCR on J14 cells is deficient in activation of the Ras-ERK and calcium signaling pathways. Reconstitution of SLP-76 expression by gene transfer rescues the TCR signaling defect (26Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 27Yablonski D. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, when using J14 cells, only cells successfully transfected with SLP-76 (and cotransfected with other genes of interest) will signal efficiently after TCR ligation, whereas nontransfected cells should not contribute to the TCR-mediated response. J14 cells were transfected with a control vector, FLAG-tagged SLP-76, or SLP-76 plus FLAG-tagged DGKζ. Transfectants were left unstimulated, stimulated via the TCR for various times, or stimulated with PMA. ERK activation was analyzed by Western blot using an antibody specific for phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues (Thr202/Tyr204) (51Dong C. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar), markers of active ERK. As shown in Fig. 2A, we observed a low but reproducible degree of TCR-induced ERK phosphorylation in J14 cells transfected with the control vector (similar to that seen in non-transfected cells, data not shown). When SLP-76 was reintroduced into the cells, TCR-induced ERK phosphorylation was markedly increased. However, when DGKζ was cotransfected with SLP-76 into J14 cells, ERK phosphorylation was decreased to a level approximating that seen in cells transfected with the control vector, suggesting an inhibitory effect of DGKζ on TCR-induced ERK activation.

In response to hypoglycemia, glucagon-induced elevations in cAMP, as well as glucocorticoids, induce glucose production in the liver by increasing the expression of genes encoding hepatic enzymes that drive gluconeogenesis, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK).1 Conversely, in response to rising blood glucose levels, insulin rapidly inhibits PEPCK gene expression in a dominant fashion. Thus, tight control over hepatic gluconeogenesis is maintained by the opposing actions of hormones in response to constantly fluctuating plasma glucose concentrations. These hormones regulate PEPCK expression primarily at the level of gene transcription. Meticulous study of the PEPCK gene promoter has revealed an overlapping set of hormone response units, each one consisting of a specific array of hormone response elements. Glucocorticoids, for example, induce PEPCK gene transcription through the glucocorticoid response unit, which is comprised of two glucocorticoid receptor binding sites (GR1 and GR2), three glucocorticoid accessory factor binding sites (gAF1, gAF2, and gAF3), and a cAMP response element (CRE) (1Sugiyama T.

Hepatic nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor bind to gAF1, hepatic nuclear factor 3β (HNF3β) binds to gAF2, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor binds to gAF3, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) binds to the CRE to mediate the glucocorticoid response (2Scott D.K.

Likewise, cAMP signaling increases PEPCK gene transcription through the cAMP response unit, which is comprised of a CRE, two C/EBP binding sites (P3I and P4), and an AP-1 binding site (P3II) (6Roesler W.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 162: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism by which insulin dominantly represses PEPCK gene transcription has not been fully elucidated. Insulin signals through PI3K to inhibit PEPCK expression (7Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Also, an insulin response sequence on the PEPCK gene promoter, which coincides with the location of gAF2, has been identified (8O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, deletion of this site in stably transfected cell lines blocks only part of the ability of insulin to repress PEPCK expression, suggesting that there might be a more proximal insulin response sequence through which insulin could act (9Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Extensive analysis of the promoter has yet to reveal such a site. Alternatively, insulin might negatively regulate PEPCK gene transcription by disrupting the interactions of proteins involved in the communication among transcription factors, coactivators, and the general transcription machinery. To explore this possibility, we tested the effect of insulin on the assembly of transcription factors, coactivators, and the general transcription machinery on the endogenous PEPCK gene promoter. Our results demonstrate that glucocorticoids and cAMP increase, whereas insulin markedly decreases, the occupancy of CREB-binding protein (CBP) and RNA polymerase II (pol II) on the PEPCK gene promoter in vivo. In addition, the accessory factor C/EBPβ can help to recruit CBP to drive transcription. Our results also show that insulin increases the protein levels of LIP, a natural inhibitory form of C/EBPβ, in a PI3K-dependent manner. Remarkably, insulin causes the concomitant, specific dissociation of LAP, the activating form of C/EBPβ, from the endogenous PEPCK gene promoter, suggesting that LIP successfully competes away LAP in response to insulin. Finally, the expression of exogenous LIP and its subsequent binding to the promoter disrupt the recruitment of CBP and pol II in response to activating hormones, resulting in the inhibition of PEPCK expression and the reduction of hepatocellular glucose production. The Ad-LIP recombinant adenovirus was prepared by excising the LIP cDNA from the REC-LIP plasmid by digestion with HindIII and EcoRV. The excised LIP cDNA was then ligated into the HindIII/EcoRV sites in the AdTrack-CMV plasmid, which was used subsequently to construct the recombinant adenovirus as described (10He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar). The recombinant Ad-LIP virus was purified by freon extraction and cesium banding as described previously (11Nevins J.R. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. Leone G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To generate the LAP-specific 2952 antibody, a 19-amino acid peptide from the carboxyl terminus of rat C/EBPβ encompassing amino acids 278–296 was synthesized by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. as a keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate. This material was then sent to East Acres Biologicals where antibodies were raised in rabbits according to the company's recommended protocol. Antiserum from production bleeds of one rabbit (rabbit 2952) was incubated with purified, bacterially expressed rat p34-C/EBPβ (LAP) that had been immobilized on Immobilon-P filter strips overnight at 4 °C. The antigen-antibody-containing strips were washed at room temperature four times in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T), once with TBS-T containing 1 m NaCl, and then a final wash with TBS-T. Antibody was eluted from the antigen-containing strips by incubation in 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.2, containing 0.2% phenol red. Eluted antibody was neutralized immediately with the addition of sufficient 1.5 m Tris, pH 9, to bring the pH to 7.0, and bovine serum albumin was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The following commercially available antibodies were used for ChIP assays and Western blots: RNA pol II CTD 8WG16 MMS-126R (BAbCO); T7 tag 69522-3 (Novagen); RNA pol II sc-899 and sc-900, CBP sc-369, GR sc-1004, HNF4α sc-8987, HNF3β sc-9187, C/EBPα sc-61, and C/EBPβ sc-150 (Santa Cruz); acetylated histone H3 (06-599) and acetylated histone 4 (06-866) (Upstate Biotechnology). H4IIE rat hepatoma cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) serum (2% newborn, 3% calf, 5% fetal bovine) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For hormone treatments, cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the following: 500 nmdexamethasone (Sigma), 100 μm 8-CPT-cAMP (Sigma) and 500 nm dexamethasone, or 500 nm dexamethasone and 10 nm insulin (Sigma). For adenovirus infections, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 36–48 h in cell culture medium containing the appropriate amount of viral particles. Optical particle units were measured with a SmartSpec 3000 (Bio-Rad) spectrophotometer (extinction coefficient = 1.1 × 1012 virus particles/A260unit). Infection efficiency was evaluated by ascertaining the proportion of cells coexpressing GFP, using a C5810 series CCD camera (Hamamatsu) attached to a DMIBR-E inverted microscope (Leica). Glucose production from H4IIE cells treated with hormones for 8 h was measured essentially as described by Wang et al. (12Wang J.C. Stafford J.M. Scott D.K. Sutherland C. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14717-14721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using a glucose assay kit (Sigma 510-A). The glucose production buffer was modified slightly to include glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm sodium lactate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, without phenol red. RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center), as detailed in the manufacturer's protocol. The oligonucleotides PC28 and ACT25, designed to be complementary to positions 102–129 and 42–67 in the rat PEPCK and β-actin mRNAs, respectively (7Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) before use in primer extension assays. To measure the accumulation of PEPCK and β-actin mRNA, primer extension analysis was performed as described by Forest et al. (9Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The ChIP assay protocol was adapted from methods described previously (13Nissen R.M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2314-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 14Parekh B.S. Maniatis T. Mol.

H4IIE cells (1 × 108 cells/condition) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and preincubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for ≥48 h. After hormone treatments, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 5 min. To arrest cross-linking, glycine was added directly to the medium at a final concentration of 125 mm, and the cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were harvested with cell scraping buffer (1 ml/plate of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with protease and phosphatase inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, pH 8, 0.4 mmNa2MoO4, 125 nm okadaic acid). Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 700 × gfor 4 min at 4 °C, resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors), and incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysates were transferred to prechilled Eppendorf tubes containing 25-μm diameter glass beads (ratio of lysate to bead volume was 3:1), prewashed with cell scraping buffer. To shear chromatin, the lysate/bead mixture was sonicated (VirSonic, 2.5 mm tip) on ice for 12 10-s pulses at a setting of 3 (output of 4–5 watts), yielding chromatin fragments of 100–600 bp in size. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove detritus, and the supernatant was divided into aliquots for subsequent 10-fold dilution in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). To provide a positive control (input) for each condition, one undiluted aliquot was retained for further processing in parallel with all other samples at the reversal of cross-linking step. To reduce nonspecific background, each 1-ml chromatin sample was precleared with 10 μl of protein A/G-agarose slurry (Santa Cruz), supplemented with 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene), for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, after which the beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Chromatin complexes were immunoprecipitated for 12–18 h at 4 °C while rotating with amounts (5–10 μg) of primary antibody optimized for selective immunoprecipitation of signal, or without antibody (control) to provide negative controls. Immune complexes were collected with 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose + 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, while rotating for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. Secondary goat IgG anti-mouse IgM (Santa Cruz) antibody was added to samples immunoprecipitated with BAbCO mouse ascites fluid. The beads were washed for 5 min at 4 °C with 1 ml of each of the following buffers in succession: low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 mLiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA pH 8, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8), and twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8). Chromatin complexes were eluted from the beads in three consecutive 30-min rotating incubations with 200 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1m NaHCO3) at 22 °C. To reverse cross-linking and digest RNA present in the samples, NaCl (200 mm final concentration) and RNase mixture (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated at 65 °C for ≥ 6 h. To digest proteins, samples were incubated at 45 °C for 90 min after the addition of the following at their final concentrations: 10 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.5, and 50 μg/ml proteinase K. Samples were extracted twice with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). DNA was precipitated with 5 μg of glycogen azure (Sigma) and 2× volume of 95% ethanol, and pellets were collected by microcentrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were resuspended in 100 μl of nuclease-free water (Promega) and stored at –80 °C for subsequent PCR analysis. Promoter-specific PCR primers were designed with software found at the Primer3 website (17Rozen, S., and Skaletsky, H. J. (1998) www-genome.wi.mit.edu/genome_software/other/primer3.html.Google Scholar). These include primers specific for the proximal PEPCK gene promoter (5′-GGCCTCCCAACATTCATTAAC-3′, 5′-GTAGCTAGCCCTCCTCGCTTTAA-3′), the distal PEPCK gene promoter (5′-TTCTCCTCCTCCATCATTGG-3′, 5′-TGCATCCCTGGAAGGTTAAG-3′), the gene 33 promoter (5′-TAGGCTAGGCAGCTCACACA-3′, 5′-ATTTATAAGGCGAGCCGACA-3′), and the β-actin promoter (5′-CGTTCCGAAATTGCCTTTTA-3′, 5′-GGAGCTGCAAGGAGGTTGTA-3′). In general, 2% of the immunoprecipitate was added to the reaction mix (50-μl total volume), containing a 1 nm concentration of each primer, 200 μm dNTP mix, 1× PCR buffer, 1× Q-solution, and 2.5 units of HotStar Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen). For input controls, only 0.2% of the samples were used. After 35 cycles of amplification in a Mastercycler gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf), PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and analyzed on a Fluor-S MultiImager using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). To construct the PEPCK-luciferase (PEPCK-LUC) reporter plasmid, the PEPCK gene promoter (–467 to +65) was excised from pPL32-CAT (18Petersen D.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with HindIII and BglII (New England Biolabs), blunt end digested with exonuclease, and cloned into the SmaI site of pGL3-Basic (Promega). To make C/U-PEPCK-LUC, an AflIII/BglII fragment was excised from pΔCREGAL4 (19Yamada K. Duong D.T. Scott D.K. Wang J.C. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5880-5887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and inserted into theMluI/BglII sites of the pGL3 vector. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method described by Hall et al. (20Hall R.K. Yamasaki T. Kucera T. Waltner-Law M. O'Brien R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30169-30175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected, as indicated, with 10 μg of a reporter plasmid (PEPCK-LUC or C/U-PEPCK-LUC), 0.1 μg of pRL-SV40 (Promega), 5 μg of RSV-GR, 5 μg of RSV-PKA (or RSV-neo for plates not treated with 8-CPT-cAMP), and 2 μg of a GAL4 construct (GAL4 DBD, GAL4-C/EBPβ (118), or GAL4-CBP) to provide an equal amount of total plasmid DNA/plate. GAL4-C/EBPβ (118) contains amino acids 1–118 of C/EBPβ, whereas GAL4-CBP contains full-length CBP. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). H4IIE cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Waltner-Law et al. (21Waltner-Law M. Daniels M.C. Sutherland C. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31847-31856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), subjected to electrophoresis through a 12% acrylamide gel, and transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane using a Mini-PROTEAN II apparatus (Bio-Rad). After thorough washing, the membrane was exposed first to primary antibody and then to alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Protein bands were resolved by chemiluminescence using the Western Breeze immunodetection system (Novex). Individual bands were analyzed with a Fluor-S MultiImager using Quantity One software. The production of glucose from gluconeogenic precursors in H4IIE hepatoma cells, subjected to the indicated hormone treatments (Fig. 1A), was assayed by incubating the cells in glucose-free medium and measuring the amount of glucose released into the medium. The synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, stimulates glucose production more than 5-fold over basal conditions. Additionally, the cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP, along with dexamethasone, is able to induce glucose production ∼8-fold over basal conditions. In contrast, when the cells are treated with dexamethasone and insulin together, glucose production drops precipitously to levels below that observed in basal conditions. Thus, hormones are able to regulate glucose production from non-carbohydrate precursors, lactate and pyruvate, in these hepatoma cells in a manner that reflects normal physiology. To measure PEPCK gene expression under similar hormone conditions, primer extension assays were performed on RNA preparations from these cells (Fig. 1B). As shown previously (9Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Wang J.C. Stafford J.M. Scott D.K. Sutherland C. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14717-14721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), glucocorticoids stimulate the production of PEPCK mRNA, and cAMP is able to induce this stimulation further. In contrast, insulin inhibits PEPCK gene expression below even basal levels. Hence, the hormonal regulation of PEPCK gene expression parallels that of hepatocellular glucose production. The ChIP assay was used to determine whether the endogenous PEPCK gene promoter is occupied by a variety of factors under the above hormone conditions. Antibodies specific for pol II, CBP, GR, HNF4α, HNF3β, C/EBPβ, C/EBPα, acetylated histone H3, and acetylated histone H4 were used to immunoprecipitate chromatin fragments (Fig.2A). PCR amplification was conducted using primer pairs specific for the proximal, regulatory region (1) and a distal, nonregulatory region (2) of the PEPCK gene promoter. The latter primer set was included as a control to ensure that the signals observed were specific for the more proximal, regulatory region of the PEPCK gene promoter. Each input sample was examined to ensure efficient chromatin shearing (Fig.2G), yielding fragment sizes in the range of 100–600 bp. The sensitivity range of the assay was assessed in parallel PCRs using increasing amounts of a control template (Fig. 2F). For some factors (e.g. pol II), we tested the ability of different antibodies to immunoprecipitate chromatin fragments and found results similar to those presented, thereby diminishing the possibility that the disappearance of a particular band might be the result of epitope masking during hormone treatment and cross-linking (data not shown). Upon stimulation with either glucocorticoids alone or glucocorticoids and cAMP together, there is an increased association of pol II, CBP, and GR with the PEPCK gene promoter, presumably to drive transcription. In contrast, insulin markedly diminishes the association of pol II and CBP with the promoter (Fig. 2A). This may be one of the mechanisms through which insulin exerts its inhibitory effect on PEPCK expression and hepatic glucose production. Interestingly, GR occupancy remains constant as long as receptor ligand is present. Thus, insulin does not seem to inhibit PEPCK gene transcription by disrupting the binding of GR to the promoter, although this does not rule out the possibility of insulin-induced post-translational modifications of GR. The association of accessory factors, such as HNF4α, HNF3β, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPα, does not change across the hormone conditions tested, suggesting that these factors are bound constitutively to the PEPCK gene promoter. Likewise, the acetylation state of local histone proteins does not appear to be affected by different hormone treatments. This is consistent with previous work demonstrating the presence of hypersensitive sites and in vivo footprinting patterns in the proximal region of the PEPCK gene promoter which are not altered either by induction of transcription with cAMP or glucocorticoids or by inhibition with insulin (22Faber S. O'Brien R.M. Imai E. Granner D.K. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ip Y.T. Granner D.K. Chalkley R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A recent study using synchronized MCF-7 cells showed that activating factors cycle on and off estrogen-responsive promoters on a time scale of 30–60 min to drive transcription (24Shang Y., Hu, X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). To test this model of hormone activation, the ChIP assay was used to examine the assembly of pol II, C/EBPα, and C/EBPβ on the PEPCK gene promoter during a glucocorticoid time course (Fig. 2C). Polymerase II occupancy on the PEPCK gene promoter increases in the presence of dexamethasone but is not altered with prolonged hormone exposure. In addition, the binding of both C/EBP family members does not change over time. Thus, we do not observe a cyclic assembly of factors on the PEPCK gene promoter in response to glucocorticoids. To contrast the pattern of occupancy found with the PEPCK gene promoter in response to glucocorticoids, cAMP, and insulin, we examined gene 33 and β-actin using PCR primers specific for those gene promoters. Gene 33 was chosen because its expression in H4IIE cells is stimulated by all of the aforementioned hormones, including insulin (25Chu D.T. Davis C.M. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13007-13011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Johnson A.C. Lee K.L. Isham K.R. Kenney F.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 37: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Consistent with this pattern of regulation, and unlike that of PEPCK, the association of pol II and CBP with the gene 33 promoter is enhanced in the presence of glucocorticoids, cAMP, and also insulin (Fig.2D). β-Actin was chosen as a control; accordingly, the occupancy of pol II on the β-actin promoter does not significantly change across the different hormone conditions (Fig. 2E). Therefore, insulin does not disrupt the association of pol II at either the gene 33 promoter or the β-actin promoter, as it does at the PEPCK gene promoter. Accessory factors play important roles in the hormonal regulation of PEPCK gene transcription. Indeed, they are absolutely necessary for a response to glucocorticoid stimulation. Mutation or deletion of any one of the accessory elements leads to the loss of approximately half of the glucocorticoid induction, whereas mutation of any pair of accessory elements abolishes the response altogether (2Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar). But because their binding does not change in response to hormones, how might they help to mediate hormone-induced gene transcription? One possible role might be to assemble a platform upon which coactivators and the preinitiation complex may be recruited to drive transcription. Among the array of accessory elements on the PEPCK gene promoter, we chose to examine further the CRE because it is a pleiotropic element important for several aspects of PEPCK gene regulation, including basal, cAMP-, and glucocorticoid-induced gene transcription (28Imai E. Miner J.N. Mitchell J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Liu J.S. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

Biol. 1988; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we know from previous work that C/EBPβ functions well at this element to help mediate a glucocorticoid response (19Yamada K. Duong D.T. Scott D.K. Wang J.C. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5880-5887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To test whether C/EBPβ can serve as an accessory factor in PEPCK gene regulation under different hormone conditions when tethered to the CRE, H4IIE hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with either a wild-type PEPCK gene promoter-luciferase reporter construct (PEPCK-LUC) or a mutant construct in which the CRE is replaced by an upstream activating sequence to which cotransfected, chimeric GAL4 proteins bind (C/U-PEPCK-LUC) (Fig. 3A). After transfection, the cells were treated with hormones and harvested for luciferase assays. The wild-type PEPCK gene promoter construct exhibits a strong 16-fold induction by glucocorticoids and a 28-fold induction by glucocorticoids and cAMP together. Insulin suppresses the glucocorticoid induction by 77%. These results reflect the hormonal regulation patterns observed with endogenous PEPCK mRNA levels and hepatocellular glucose production (compare with Fig. 1). When GAL4-C/EBPβ is cotransfected with C/U-PEPCK-LUC, the magnitude of reporter gene expression is very similar that of the wild-type construct. There is a 17-fold induction by glucocorticoids and a 2"
https://openalex.org/W2052584125,"Rhodococcus equi is a major cause of foal morbidity and mortality. We have investigated the presence of lipoglycan in this organism as closely related bacteria, notablyMycobacterium tuberculosis, produce lipoarabinomannans (LAM) that may play multiple roles as virulence determinants. The lipoglycan was structurally characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry following permethylation, capillary electrophoresis after chemical degradation, and 1H and 31P and two-dimensional heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Key structural features of the lipoglycan are a linear α-1,6-mannan with side chains containing one 2-linked α-d-Manpresidue. This polysaccharidic backbone is linked to a phosphatidylinositol mannosyl anchor. In contrast to mycobacterial LAM, there are no extensive arabinan domains but single terminal α-d-Araf residue capping the 2-linked α-d-Manp. The lipoglycan binds concanavalin A and mannose-binding protein consistent with the presence of t-α-d-Manp residues. We studied the ability of the lipoglycans to induce cytokines from equine macrophages, in comparison to whole cells of R. equi. These data revealed patterns of cytokine mRNA induction that suggest that the lipoglycan is involved in much of the early macrophage cytokine response to R. equi infection. These studies identify a novel LAM variant that may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease caused by R. equi. Rhodococcus equi is a major cause of foal morbidity and mortality. We have investigated the presence of lipoglycan in this organism as closely related bacteria, notablyMycobacterium tuberculosis, produce lipoarabinomannans (LAM) that may play multiple roles as virulence determinants. The lipoglycan was structurally characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry following permethylation, capillary electrophoresis after chemical degradation, and 1H and 31P and two-dimensional heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Key structural features of the lipoglycan are a linear α-1,6-mannan with side chains containing one 2-linked α-d-Manpresidue. This polysaccharidic backbone is linked to a phosphatidylinositol mannosyl anchor. In contrast to mycobacterial LAM, there are no extensive arabinan domains but single terminal α-d-Araf residue capping the 2-linked α-d-Manp.

Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 4: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). This organism has also emerged as an opportunistic human pathogen, notably of people with compromised immunity (2Mosser D.M. Hondalus M.K. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 29-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). R. equi is an intracellular pathogen of alveolar macrophages, and infection is characterized by bronchopneumonia. The bacterium is known to enter macrophages primarily (but not exclusively) via the complement receptor type 3 (Mac-1) following complement component C3 deposition (2Mosser D.M. Hondalus M.K. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 29-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3Hondalus M.K. Diamond M.S. Rosenthal L.A. Springer T.A. Mosser D.M. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2919-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once within the macrophage the bacteria resist host-killing mechanisms and multiply, eventually killing the macrophage. Specific bacterial factors that facilitate entry of the organisms into the macrophages or that aid intra-macrophage persistence have yet to be identified. R. equi is a member of the mycolata, a supra-generic taxon including the extensively studied facultative intracellular pathogenMycobacterium tuberculosis (4Chun J. Kong S.-O. Hah Y.C. Goodfellow M. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1996; 16: 1-9Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Members of the mycolata have a characteristic cell envelope architecture, dominated by lipids, notably the high molecular weight branched-chain mycolic acids. The cell envelope profoundly affects the properties of these bacteria, and its composition and organization have been a major focus of mycobacterial research (5Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 6Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoarabinomannan (LAM)1 is a complex mycobacterial cell envelope component that has been identified as a putative virulence factor of M. tuberculosis (7Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 8Strohmeier G.R. Fenton M.J. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The structure of this macroamphiphile has been studied in detail and consists of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor unit that bears a branched d-mannan and d-arabinan heteropolysaccharide. However, many elaborations of this core structure have been described, including variations in the pattern of the lipid anchor acylation, the presence of succinate residues, and capping motifs on the non-reducing termini of arabinan branches (7Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 9Chatterjee D. Lowell K. Rivoire B. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. J. Biol.

Some of these structural variations, notably the presence of particular capping motifs, may vary between the LAM of different mycobacterial species in a species-specific manner (7Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To date LAM have been classified into ManLAM (15Venisse A. Berjeaud J.-M. Chaurand P. Gilleron M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12401-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PILAM (16Gilleron M. Himoudi N. Adam O. Constant P. Venisse A. Rivière M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 117-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), according to their small mannooligosaccharide or phosphoinositide cap structures, respectively. The former were found in slow growing mycobacterial species (asMycobacterium bovis BCG, M. tuberculosis), whereas the latter were found in fast growing mycobacterial species (as Mycobacterium smegmatis). ManLAM has been shown to have many properties that potentially influence the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis. In the early stages of infection, ManLAM may facilitate the adherence of bacteria to alveolar macrophages, particularly to mannose receptors (8Strohmeier G.R. Fenton M.J. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Schlesinger L.S. Hull S.R. Kaufman T.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4070-4079PubMed Google Scholar, 18Venisse A.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 4568-4575PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that mycobacterial internalization via these receptors evades macrophage bactericidal mechanisms (20Astarie-Dequeker C. N′Diaye E-N., Le Cabec V. Rittig M.G. Prandi J. Maridonneau-Parini I. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 469-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LAM has also been reported to have powerful immunomodulatory properties, promoting distinctive patterns of macrophage cytokine induction that subsequently directs host immune responses (8Strohmeier G.R. Fenton M.J. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 21Dahl K.E. Shiratsuchi H. Hamilton B.D. Ellner J.J. Toossi Z. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 399-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Small differences in LAM structure can strongly influence these biological activities, demonstrating the value of detailed structural studies. Lipoglycans apparently structurally related to LAM have been identified in representative organisms of other genera within the mycolata, including Corynebacterium matruchotii (22Sutcliffe I.C. Arch. Oral Biol. 1995; 40: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), Dietzia maris (23Sutcliffe I.C. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2000; 78: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), Gordonia rubropertincta (24Ikeda-Fujita T. Kotani S. Tsujimoto M. Ogawa T. Takahashi I. Takada H. Nagao S. Kokeguchi S. Kato K. Yano I. Okamura H. Tamura T. Harada K. Usami H. Yamamoto A. Tanaka S. Kato Y. Microbiol. Immunol. 1987; 31: 289-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 25Flaherty C. Sutcliffe I.C. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1999; 22: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and Rhodococcus rhodnii (26Flaherty C. Minnikin D.E. Sutcliffe I.C. Zbl. Bakteriol. 1996; 285: 11-19Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although these lipoglycans display components typical of LAM, considerable variation in monosaccharide composition has been found. Thus, further detailed study of the lipoglycan components of these taxa is necessary. By analogy with mycobacterial ManLAM, we hypothesized that a lipoglycan may be involved in the pathogenic success of R. equi. This study describes the isolation, purification, and structural characterization of a R. equi lipoglycan. The potential role of this lipoglycan in R. equi virulence was assessed by comparing the early cytokine responses of equine macrophages to the lipoglycan and to infection with virulent R. equi. Three strains ofR. equi were used in this study as follows: R. equi 103+ (foal isolate) and R. equi28+ (pig isolate), which are clinical isolates containing plasmids associated with increased virulence (27Takai S. Vet. Microbiol. 1997; 56: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); and the attenuated type strain R. equi ATCC 6939. Stock cultures were maintained on slopes of brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar (Oxoid, Unipath Ltd., Basingstoke, UK) at 4 °C. Cultures were maintained by routine subculture onto BHI agar and growth at 37 °C for 18 h. Broth cultures were grown in BHI broth incubated at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm). for 18 h. Growth was then harvested, washed twice in PBS, and lyophilized. Lyophilized cells were delipidated with chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v; 50 mg/ml) at ambient temperature for 18 h (28Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6228-6233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then recovered by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 10 min) and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were then permeabilized with mutanolysin (50 units/ml) and lysozyme (25 mg/ml) according to the method of Assaf and Dick (29Assaf N.A. Dick W.A. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 1010-1015PubMed Google Scholar). An equal volume of phenol (90% w/v) was then added to the cell suspension in lysozyme buffer, and the mixture was incubated with shaking at 68 °C for 1 h to extract lipoglycans, which were subsequently recovered into the aqueous phase formed on refrigerated centrifugation as described previously (30Sutcliffe I.C. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1994; 17: 321-326Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The crude aqueous extract was purified using a modification of the hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) method (22Sutcliffe I.C. Arch. Oral Biol. 1995; 40: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 31Leopold K. Fischer W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the crude extract was taken up into 6 ml of equilibration buffer (100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 15% v/v n-propyl alcohol) and loaded onto a column (1.25 × 17 cm) of octyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted with 40 ml of this buffer prior to gradient elution with a 120-ml gradient of 15–65% v/v n-propyl alcohol in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. Fractions were assayed for carbohydrate using the method of Fox and Robyt (32Fox J.D. Robyt J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). HIC fractions were also monitored by SDS-PAGE. Samples (30 μl) of alternate fractions were prepared and electrophoresed. With consideration of SDS-PAGE analysis, carbohydrate-containing peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed extensively, and lyophilized. To remove a persistent protein contaminant from the lipoglycan, a 1 mg/ml aqueous solution of lipoglycan was treated with an equal volume of 90% phenol (w/v). The mixture was heated at 68 °C for 1 h and then separated into distinct aqueous and phenol phases by centrifugation (30 min, 4000 rpm, 4 °C). The upper aqueous phase was recovered and re-extracted with phenol. After further centrifugation, the aqueous phase was recovered and extensively dialyzed before being lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. Lipoglycan-containing fractions (PK3) were pooled, dialyzed, and lyophilized. Contaminants were removed by gel filtration. A sample (16 mg) was dissolved in 0.2 m NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8, to a final concentration of 200 mg/ml, incubated 2 days at room temperature, and loaded on a gel permeation Bio-Gel P-100 column (52 × 3 cm) eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 15% acrylamide resolving gels. The lipoglycan bands were characterized by silver staining with polysaccharide-specific periodic acid oxidation according to Tsai and Frasch (34Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). Western blotting and lectin blotting using concanavalin A were performed as described previously (23Sutcliffe I.C. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2000; 78: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Lipoglycan samples (1 mg) were acid-hydrolyzed with 2m trifluoroacetic acid (250 μl) at 110 °C for 2 h in a 8.5 ml of polytetrafluoroethylene screw-capped tube. The hydrolysates were then neutralized in vacuo over sodium hydroxide pellets, and the dried residue was taken up in distilled water (250 μl) and then lyophilized. The monosaccharides were derivatized as alditol acetates and analyzed by GLC as described previously (23Sutcliffe I.C. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2000; 78: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fatty acid composition of the lipoglycan samples (1 mg) was analyzed by GLC of the acid hydrolysate following derivatization to form fatty acid methyl esters as described previously (23Sutcliffe I.C. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2000; 78: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An Immunopure® recombinant mannose-binding protein (MBP) column (Pierce and Warriner Ltd., Chester, UK) was used to demonstrate interaction of lipoglycan with MBP as described previously (23Sutcliffe I.C. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2000; 78: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Lipoglycan (2 mg) from R. equi strains 103+ and 28+ was deacylated according to the method of Beacheyet al. (35Beachey E.H. Dale J.B. Simpson W.A. Evans J.D. Knox K.W. Ofek I. Wicken A.J. Infect. Immun. 1979; 23: 618-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deacylated lipoglycans were permethylated according to the method of Dell et al.(36Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The permethylated samples were cleaned using a C18Sep-Pak Cartridge (Waters Associates). Each sample was taken up into chloroform/water (1:1 v/v, 1 ml). The cartridge was conditioned by sequential washing with distilled water (5 ml), acetonitrile (5 ml MeCN) and distilled water (10 ml). The sample was then loaded onto the cartridge and distilled water (5 ml) and 2 ml each of 15, 35, 50, and 75% aqueous MeCN and MeCN (2 ml) were used to elute the sample. Fractions collected at each step were assayed for carbohydrate as described previously (23Sutcliffe I.C. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2000; 78: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and by TLC in MeCN/H2O (85:15, v/v), visualizing with α-naphthol. Fractions that were found to contain carbohydrate were pooled and evaporated under nitrogen. The permethylated samples were hydrolyzed with 2 mtrifluoroacetic acid at 110 °C for 2 h as above. The methylated monosaccharides were then reduced with sodium borodeuteride and acetylated according to the method of Saddler et al. (37Saddler G.S. Tavecchia P. Lociuro S. Zanol M. Colombo L. Silva E. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1991; 14: 185-191Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the samples was performed on a Carlo-Erba 8060 MS gas chromatograph connected to a Micromass Trio 2000 mass spectrometer. Samples were injected with a split injector (split rate of 50:1). The injection port temperature was 250 °C and the transfer line 250 °C. The column was a 30 m × 0.32 mm internal diameter BPX-5 fused silica column with helium (50 kPa) as the carrier gas. The oven was programmed to hold 140 °C for 1 min followed by a 10 °C/min rise to 280 °C and a 10-min hold. The mass spectrometer operated in electron ionization mode (70 eV) and was set to scan from 20 to 650 atomic mass units. Analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was carried out on a Voyager DE-STR (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using linear mode detection. All samples were irradiated with UV light (337 nm) from an N2 laser and were analyzed with the instrument operating at 20 kV in the negative ion mode. The matrix used was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. 10 μg of samples were treated with 15 μl of acetic anhydride/acetic acid/sulfuric acid (10:10:1, v/v/v) mixture for 3 h at 40 °C. The reaction was quenched by addition of 40 μl of water. Acetolysis products were extracted twice with 40 μl of chloroform and, after drying, were deacetylated with 20 μl of a methanol, 20% aqueous ammonia solution (1:1 v/v) at 37 °C for 18 h. The reagents were removed under a stream of nitrogen. The samples were then submitted to APTS tagging (see below). Dried hydrolysis (complete hydrolysis, 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 110 °C for 2 h; mild hydrolysis, 0.1 m HCl at 110 °C for 30 min) or acetolysis (38Nigou J. Vercellone A. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) products were mixed with 0.4 μl of 0.2 m1-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonate (APTS) (Interchim, Montluçon, France) in 15% (v/v) acetic acid and 0.4 μl of a 1 msodium cyanoborohydride solution dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (39Guttman A. Chen F.T. Evangelista R.A. Cooke N. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed for 90 min at 55 °C and was quenched by addition of 20 μl of water. Dilutions of 1–5 μl of the APTS derivatives were prepared in 20 μl of total water before analysis by capillary electrophoresis (CE). The electropherograms were acquired and stored on a Dell XPS P60 computer using the System Gold software package (Beckman Instruments). APTS derivatives were loaded by applying 0.5 pounds/square inch (3.45 kPa) vacuum for 5 s (6.5 nl injected). Separations were performed using an uncoated fused-silica capillary column (Sigma) of 50-μm internal diameter with 40-cm effective length (47 cm total length). Analyses were usually performed on a P/ACE capillary electrophoresis system (Beckman Instruments) with the cathode on the injection side and the anode on the detection side (reverse polarity) (Fig. 3, a, c, and d). They were carried out at a temperature of 25 °C with an applied voltage of −20 kV and using 1% acetic acid (w/v), 30 mmtriethylamine in water, pH 3.5, as running electrolyte. For Fig.3b, the electropherogram was recorded in normal mode, at a temperature of 25 °C with an applied voltage of +25 kV and borate buffer (20 mm, pH 9.2) as running electrolyte. Detection system consisted in a Beckman laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) equipped with a 4-milliwatt argon-ion laser with the excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength filter of 520 nm. Prior to NMR spectroscopic analysis, fractions were exchanged in D2O (99.9% purity, Eurisotop, Saint Aubin, France) at room temperature with intermediate freeze-drying, and then dissolved in 400 μl of D2O or Me2SO-d6 (99.8% purity, Eurisotop, Saint Aubin, France). ReqLAM from strain 28+ (15 mg) and strain 103+ (3 mg) was analyzed in a 200 × 5-mm 535-PP NMR tubes at 313 K on a Bruker DMX-500 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a double resonance (1H/X)-BBi z-gradient probe head. Data were processed on a Bruker-X32 work station using the xwinnmr program. Proton and carbon chemical shifts are expressed in ppm downfield from internal acetone (δH/TMS 2.225 and δC/TMS 34.00). The one-dimensional phosphorus (31P) spectra were measured at 202.46 MHz and phosphoric acid (85%) was used as the external standard (δP 0.0). All two-dimensional NMR data sets were recorded without sample spinning, and data were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the time-proportional phase increment method (40Marion D. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). Four two-dimensional Homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn (HOHAHA) spectra were recorded using MLEV-17 mixing sequences of 9, 43, 82, and 113 ms (41Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Res. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar). The 1H-13C and 1H-31P single-bond correlation spectra (HMQC) were obtained using Bax's pulse sequence (42Bax A. Subramanian S. J. Magn. Res. 1986; 67: 565-569Google Scholar). The GARP sequence (43Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Res. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) at the carbon or phosphorus frequency was used as a composite pulse decoupling during acquisition. The pulse sequence used for 1H-detected heteronuclear relayed spectra (HMQC-HOHAHA) was that of Lerner and Bax (44Lerner L. Bax A. J. Magn. Res. 1986; 69: 375-380Google Scholar) and for HMBC was that of Bax and Summers (45Bax A. Summers M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2093-2094Crossref Scopus (3274) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood macrophages were isolated from a healthy adult horse using Percoll (Sigma) and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) supplemented with penicillin (100 μg/ml), streptomycin (80 μg/ml), and gentamicin (20 μg/ml). 1 ml of the suspension was placed in each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate, with 10 wells used for each treatment. Following overnight (18 h) incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, nonadherent cells were removed by washing the plate with warm DMEM/FCS with or without antibiotics for R. equi and lipoglycan treatments, respectively. Following 4–6 h of culturing, 2.5 × 106 cells remained in each well and were used for either bacterial infection or lipoglycan stimulation. Initial studies were done to optimize lipoglycan concentration. Infection of horse macrophages with R. equi was carried out as described by Giguère and Prescott (46Giguère S. Prescott J.F. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1848-1854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A multiplicity ratio of 5 bacteria per macrophage was used. After 40 min of incubation to allow phagocytosis, the macrophages were washed three times and then incubated in DMEM/FCS with antibiotics in order to kill extracellular bacteria and to prevent further extracellular bacterial growth and reinfection of macrophages. For the time course study of lipoglycan stimulation, 10 μl of lipoglycan in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (PBS), with 200 μg/ml polymyxin were added to each well to yield a final lipoglycan concentration of 5 μg/ml. Macrophages were harvested for RNA extraction at 0.7, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h following lipoglycan stimulation or exposure to R. equi for infection. Thus, the first time point for the R. equi-infected macrophages represents the time point at which infection was stopped by replacement with DMEM/FCS medium containing antibiotics. Untreated macrophages cultured under the same conditions were used as controls. Macrophages harvested at the times described above were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min and washed with warm PBS, and total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., CA). All RNA samples were treated with amplification grade DNase I (Invitrogen) to remove any traces of genomic DNA contamination. 1 μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis in a volume of 25 μl using the Thermoscript RT-PCR System kit (Invitrogen). After cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription, the reaction was diluted to 80 μl. Gene-specific primers and internal oligonucleotide probes for IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-18, TNF-α, and IFN-γ and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) were selected based on equine cDNA sequences (Table III) using the Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The internal probes were labeled at the 5′ end with the reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein, and at the 3′ end with the quencher dye 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. Amplification of 2 μl of cDNA was performed in a 25-μl PCR containing 900 nm of each primer, 250 nm of Taqman probe, and 12 μl of TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems). Amplification and detection were performed using the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) with initial incubation steps at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Each sample was assayed in triplicate, and the mean value was used for comparison. Samples without cDNA were included in the amplification reactions to determine background fluorescence and check for contamination. cDNA from 24-h concanavalin A-stimulated equine blood mononuclear cells was used as positive control. To account for variation in the amount and quality of starting material, all the results were normalized to G3PDH expression. Relative quantitation between samples was achieved by the comparative threshold cycles method and is reported as the n-fold difference relative to cytokine mRNA expression in unstimulated macrophages (47Leutenegger C.M.

Eps15 and its related partner Eps15R play a key role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of transmembrane receptors. Upon EGF stimulation of the cell, Eps15 becomes both phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and monoubiquitinated. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps15 has been implicated in EGF receptor internalization, the function of Eps15 ubiquitination is not known. Using a mutational approach, we have found that the second ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) of Eps15 and Eps15R is essential for their ubiquitination. This UIM partially overlaps with the recently characterized nuclear export signal in Eps15. We show that these two overlapping motifs have different structural requirements with respect to nuclear export signal versus ubiquitination signal activity. Our data demonstrate that the UIM does not contain the ubiquitin acceptor site but functions as a recruitment site for the ubiquitination machinery leading to the monoubiquitination of both Eps15 and Eps15R.

Eps15 and Eps15R1 (Eps15related) are both essential components involved in the internalization of plasma membrane receptors via the clathrin-mediated internalization pathway (2Carbone R. Fre S.

So far the function of Eps15 has been shown to be restricted to the early events leading to the formation of clathrin-coated pits where Eps15 is thought to recruit AP-2 complexes (7Benmerah A.

The N-terminal domain (DI) contains three EH domains, and the second domain (DII) is a coiled-coil region involved in Eps15 oligomerization (10Tebar F. Confalonieri S. Carter R.E., Di Fiore P.P. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15413-15418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

The multiple DPF (Asp-Pro-Phe) repeats present in the third domain of Eps15 and Eps15R are involved in the binding to the α-subunit of the clathrin adaptor protein complex AP-2 (11Iannolo G.

The third domain of Eps15 also contains the major tyrosine phosphorylation site of Eps15, Tyr850. Tyrosine phosphorylation on Tyr850 is specifically required for EGF receptor internalization but not for transferrin receptor internalization (13Confalonieri S. Salcini A.E. Puri C. Tacchetti C. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This tyrosine phosphorylation site is not present in Eps15R, indicating that these two closely related proteins are not solely dedicated to the same functions. Eps15 is subjected to two post-translational modifications: tyrosine phosphorylation and monoubiquitination (14van Delft S. Govers R. Strous G.J. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14013-14016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is the covalent attachment of ubiquitin, an 8.6-kDa protein, onto a lysine residue of a target protein, which can be ubiquitin itself, thereby allowing the formation of ubiquitin chains. Proteins can be modified by the conjugation of a single molecule of ubiquitin (monoubiquitination or multiubiquitination when several individual lysines are monoubiquitinated) by short ubiquitin chains of two to three ubiquitins (oligoubiquitination) or by longer chains of at least four ubiquitins (polyubiquitination). Polyubiquitination targets proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Mono- and oligoubiquitination have been implicated in different cellular functions such as endocytosis, targeting of plasma membrane proteins for degradation in the vacuole/lysosome, virus budding, or histone regulation (15Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin conjugation is carried out by successive enzymatic reactions involving a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). E3-ubiquitin ligases, either alone or in combination with a bound E2, catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and ε-amino group of a lysine residue on the target protein. E3 enzymes are responsible for the important step of substrate recognition. They bind to ubiquitination signals, which are usually small primary sequence motifs (16Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6897) Google Scholar, 17Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M.

The high specificity of substrate recognition is an essential feature of the ubiquitination machinery since a wide variety of proteins become ubiquitinated in the cell. To get more insight into the function of Eps15 monoubiquitination, we have analyzed the process of Eps15 ubiquitination in more detail. In this study, we found that both Eps15 and Eps15R are subjected to monoubiquitination. We have investigated the molecular determinants that are critical for Eps15 and Eps15R ubiquitination. A mutational approach was carried out to determine which domain of both Eps15 isoforms is essential for ubiquitination. For this purpose, we have developed an in vivo ubiquitination assay using COS-1 cells. We reasoned that if a deletion mutant was not ubiquitinated, it would indicate that either the ubiquitination site(s) or the recognition motif for the ubiquitination machinery, or both, has been removed. This approach allowed us to identify a new ubiquitination signal that does not contain the ubiquitination site(s) but targets both Eps15 and Eps15R for ubiquitination. COS-1 cells, Her14 cells (NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with human EGF receptor cDNA), and BHK-21 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2humidified atmosphere. The pMT123 vector containing the HA-ubiquitin cDNA was obtained from Prof. Dr. G. Strous (Utrecht, The Netherlands) and has been described by others (19Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). The cDNA of Myc-Reps2 cloned in pcDNA4.TO was obtained from Dr. L. Blok (Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The cDNA of human Eps15 subcloned into the EGFP-C2 vector was a kind gift from Dr. A. Benmerah (Paris, France). The full-length cDNA of mouse Eps15 was subcloned from pCEV-eps15 (a kind gift from Dr. C. Schumacher, Novartis, East Hanover, NJ) into pcDNA3.1zeo (Invitrogen). An adaptor encoding the FLAG tag (MDYKDDDDKGS) was inserted into the KpnI and BamHI sites of pCDNA3.1zeo-Eps15. The FLAG-Eps15 cDNA was subcloned into the bicistronic vector pIREShyg (CLONTECH). The pCDNA3.1zeo-FLAG-Eps15-ΔI (aa 351–897) was obtained by removing theBamHI/PpuMI fragment and replacing it by an adaptor encoding GSN351VEQ. The pCDNA3.1zeo-FLAG-Eps15-ΔII (deletion of aa 361–643) was obtained by removing the PpuMI/BstEII fragment and replacing it by an adaptor encoding355DLKEKE360G644. The pCDNA3.1zeo-FLAG-Eps15-ΔIII (truncated at aa 648) was obtained by removing the BstEII/XbaI fragment and replacing it by an adaptor coding for644GDPFK648 followed by a stop codon. The pCDNA3.1zeo-FLAG-Eps15-ΔC84 lacking the last 84 residues, i.e. truncated at Gly813, was obtained by cutting out the fragment BstEII/XbaI (coding for aa 645–897) and replacing it by a PCR product encoding for residues 645–813 followed by a stop codon. A similar strategy was used to obtain the pCDNA3.1zeo-FLAG-Eps15-ΔC26 lacking the last 26 residues, i.e. truncated at Arg871. All the FLAG-Eps15 constructs containing point mutations were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the pMT2SM-FLAG-Eps15 vector as template. The multiple lysine to arginine mutants of FLAG-Eps15 were obtained in successive steps. The mutants FLAG-Eps15–2KR (K818R/K820R), FLAG-Eps15-L872A/L875A, FLAG-Eps15-L883A/L885A, FLAG-Eps15-I887A/L889A, and FLAG-Eps15-E879A/E881A/D882A were generated by introducing simultaneously the two or three desired mutations into the primers. The full-length cDNA of mouse Eps15R was subcloned from pCEV-eps15R (a kind gift from Dr. C. Schumacher, Novartis) into pcDNA3.1zeo, and an adaptor encoding the Myc tag (MEQKLISEEDL) was inserted into the HindIII and NarI sites of pCDNA3.1zeo-Eps15R. The pCDNA3.1zeo-Myc-Eps15R-ΔIII (truncated at aa 661) was obtained by removing theBamHI/XbaI fragment and replacing it by an adaptor encoding DPF661 followed by a stop codon. The pCDNA3.1zeo-Myc-Eps15R-ΔC90 lacking the last 90 residues, i.e. truncated at Ala817, was obtained by cutting out the fragment BamHI/XbaI (coding for aa 659–907) and replacing it by a PCR product encoding residues 659–817 followed by a stop codon. A similar strategy was used to obtain the pCDNA3.1zeo-Myc-Eps15R-ΔC25 lacking the last 25 residues, i.e. truncated at Arg882. The Myc-tagged CT1-R and CT2-R fragments coding for aa 818–907 and aa 774–907 of Eps15R (last 90 and last 134 residues, respectively) were obtained by PCR and subcloned into pCDNA3.1zeo. All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). To select cells stably expressing FLAG-Eps15, Her14 cells were transfected with the bicistronic vector pIREShyg-FLAG-Eps15 and selected with 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Diagnostics) for 2 weeks. Resistant cells were collected and grown in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin B. Immunofluorescence analysis of the selected cells showed that all cells expressed FLAG-Eps15. COS-1 cells seeded in 35-mm dishes were grown to 50% confluency and co-transfected with a mixture of plasmids encoding HA-ubiquitin (HA-Ub), FLAG-Eps15, or Myc-Eps15R. After 24 h, cells were either left untreated or stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 300 μl of ice-cold RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and115 of the clarified lysates (20 μl) was used for immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to ensure that the expression level of HA-ubiquitin was identical in all the samples. The lysates were precleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the appropriate monoclonal antibody for 2 h (anti-FLAG M2, Sigma; anti-Myc 9E10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein G-Sepharose was incubated with the mixture for 2 h, and the immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with ice-cold RIPA buffer, and boiled in Laemmli buffer. Samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The first immunoblot analysis was performed with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5) to detect the ubiquitinated forms of Eps15 or Eps15R present in the immunoprecipitates. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), the signal was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the second immunoblot analysis, the membrane was stripped during 30 min at 50 °C in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol and subsequently incubated with the monoclonal antibody used for immunoprecipitation (anti-FLAG or anti-Myc). The position of the molecular weight markers and the outline of the membrane were systematically reported on the autoradiography films to compare the positions of the bands detected with the anti-HA antibody with those detected after the second immunoblotting. Cells were plated on 15-mm glass coverslips, grown to 40–50% confluency, and transfected with the appropriate plasmids. Immunostaining experiments were performed at room temperature 24 h after transfection. The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After quenching for 10 min with 50 mm glycine in PBS, cells were blocked for 1 h with 0.2% gelatin, PBS. The cells were then incubated with anti-FLAG M5 antibody in 0.2% gelatin, PBS for 1 h. Cells were washed in 0.2% gelatin, PBS and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Cy3 for 1 h followed by four washes in 0.2% gelatin, PBS. The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides in 10% Mowiol 4–88, 25% glycerol, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5 containing 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine (Sigma). Cells were examined under an inverted Leica fluorescence microscope and a laser scanning confocal imaging system using a ×63 objective. All pictures shown correspond to similar settings to compare fluorescence intensities. The Scion Image software was used to obtain inverted black and white images. To study the structural requirements for Eps15 ubiquitination, we created a FLAG-tagged murine Eps15 and several deletion mutants. We first investigated whether FLAG-Eps15 could undergo EGF-induced monoubiquitination in Her14 cells in a manner similar to endogenous Eps15 (14van Delft S. Govers R. Strous G.J. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14013-14016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We established a stable cell line expressing FLAG-Eps15 (Her14-FLAG-Eps15) using a bicistronic expression vector that allowed us to select cells expressing FLAG-Eps15. Immunostaining of the cells confirmed that 100% of the selected cells expressed FLAG-Eps15 (not shown). In these cells, FLAG-Eps15 undergoes EGF- induced monoubiquitination as shown by the electrophoretic mobility shift (Fig.1A). We next developed an in vivo ubiquitination assay. Murine FLAG-tagged Eps15 was co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin in COS-1 cells, and after 24 h FLAG-Eps15 was isolated by immunoprecipitation. The ubiquitinated Eps15 was detected by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody (12CA5), while Eps15 was detected with anti-FLAG antibody after stripping of the membrane. As shown in Fig. 1B, a clear band was detected in the anti-HA immunoblot showing that murine Eps15 undergoes ubiquitination in COS-1 cells. In addition, a minor band was observed. The presence of two bands might reflect the existence of oligoubiquitinated species of Eps15 (modified with short ubiquitin chains) or might result from monoubiquitination on several lysine residues. Immunodetection of the same immunoblot with an anti-FLAG antibody did show only one band, with a lower molecular weight, corresponding to the non-ubiquitinated form of FLAG-Eps15. The ubiquitinated species, of higher molecular weight, were detected with the anti-FLAG antibody when chemiluminescence detection was carried out for a longer time (not shown). We estimate that ∼20% of the FLAG-Eps15 population is ubiquitinated. Stimulation of COS-1 cells with EGF did not have any effect on Eps15 ubiquitination (Fig. 1B). Increasing the expression level of EGFR by co-expression of a human EGFR did not influence the ubiquitination pattern of FLAG-Eps15 in unstimulated cells as well as in EGF-treated cells (not shown). The ubiquitination of FLAG-Eps15 was identical whether cells were serum-starved or not prior to EGF stimulation (not shown). Similar results were obtained in BHK cells and with a transiently transfected green fluorescent protein-tagged human Eps15 in COS-1 cells (not shown). Interestingly, we did not detect any effect of EGF on endogenous Eps15 ubiquitination in other cell types tested (HeLa, A431, Madin-Darby canine kidney, BHK, and Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with EGFR, data not shown). It is likely that the ubiquitination process of Eps15 is constitutively active in these cells. To assess whether Eps15R displays a ubiquitination pattern similar to Eps15, we studied the ubiquitination of a transiently transfected Myc-tagged murine Eps15R (Myc-Eps15R) in COS-1 cells. Myc-Eps15R displayed a ubiquitination pattern similar to Eps15 as shown by the presence of two bands detected on the anti-HA immunoblot (Fig.1C). The ubiquitination of Myc-Eps15R was not due to the presence of the Myc tag (which contains one lysine, a potential ubiquitination acceptor site) because another Myc-tagged protein, Myc-Reps2, was not ubiquitinated using the same ubiquitination assay. Similarly to Eps15, ubiquitination of Eps15R was not affected by EGF stimulation in COS-1 cells (not shown). To determine which part of Eps15 is involved in its ubiquitination, we created several deletions and point mutations in the context of the FLAG-tagged Eps15 construct (summarized in Fig.2) and studied their ubiquitination using the in vivo ubiquitination assay. A mutant lacking the first structural domain of Eps15, i.e. devoid of the three EH domains (FLAG-Eps15-ΔI, lacking aa 1–350), and a mutant lacking the central coiled-coil domain (FLAG-Eps15-ΔII, lacking aa 361–643) were still ubiquitinated, whereas truncation of the third domain of Eps15 (FLAG-Eps15 ΔIII, truncated at position 648) resulted in a major loss of ubiquitination (Fig. 3A). The equivalent truncation in Eps15R (Myc-Eps15R ΔIII, truncated at position 661) led to a complete loss of ubiquitination (Fig.3A).FIG. 3The C terminus of Eps15 and Eps15R contains a domain essential for ubiquitination. A, COS-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin and FLAG-Eps15 wild type (WT) or the indicated mutants (ΔI, deletion of aa 1–350; ΔII, deletion of aa 361–643; ΔIII, truncation at position 648) or Myc-Eps15R wild type (WT) or ΔIII (truncation at position 661). Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed with anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibody, and ubiquitination was assessed using the in vivo ubiquitination assay as described under “Material and Methods” (IB, immunoblot). Positions of the molecular mass markers are indicated (kDa). B, as inA with the indicated mutants (ΔC84, FLAG-Eps15 truncated at position 813; ΔC90, Myc-Eps15R truncated at position 817).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate further the molecular determinant regulating Eps15 and Eps15R ubiquitination, we created smaller C-terminal deletion mutants of both Eps15 and Eps15R. Fig. 3B shows that the truncation of the last 84 amino acids of Eps15 (FLAG-Eps15-ΔC84) resulted in a major loss of ubiquitination, and the equivalent truncation in Eps15R deleting the last 90 amino acids (Myc-Eps15R-ΔC90) resulted in a total loss of ubiquitination. The loss of ubiquitination of the FLAG-Eps15-ΔC84 mutant indicates that the last 84 residues of Eps15 contain a molecular determinant essential for ubiquitination. This molecular determinant can be the ubiquitin acceptor site(s), the binding site for the ubiquitination machinery (E3-ubiquitin ligase alone or in combination with an E2 enzyme), or both. To analyze whether the C-terminal 84 residues of Eps15 contain the ubiquitin attachment site(s), we substituted all the lysine residues located in this part of the molecule (Lys818, Lys820, Lys837, Lys861, and Lys891) with arginine residues in the context of the full-length FLAG-Eps15. The ubiquitination of the resulting mutant (FLAG-Eps15-5K→R) was similar to that of the wild-type FLAG-Eps15 (data not shown) demonstrating that the last 84 amino acids of Eps15 do not contain the ubiquitination site(s). Two strategies were applied to test whether the last 84 residues of Eps15 contain a binding site for the ubiquitination machinery. In the first approach, we reasoned that if the C-terminal part of Eps15 and Eps15R contains a binding site for an E3-ubiquitin ligase, overexpression of this domain would result in a decrease in wild-type Eps15 or Eps15R ubiquitination as a result of competition for the binding of the E3 ligase. Furthermore, if this binding site for a putative E3 ligase is conserved between Eps15 and Eps15R, overexpression of the C terminus of Eps15R should result in a decrease in Eps15 ubiquitination. Two Myc-tagged constructs, CT1-R and CT2-R, encoding for the last 90 and the last 134 residues, respectively, of Eps15R were made. A strong inhibition in the ubiquitination of Myc-Eps15R was observed when CT1-R or CT2-R was co-expressed with full-length Myc-Eps15R (Fig.4A, IB: α-HA). The decrease in ubiquitination of Myc-Eps15R was not due to a decrease in HA-ubiquitin expression levels since levels were similar in all conditions (Fig. 4A, IB: α-HA of Total lysates). Similarly, CT1-R and CT2-R were also able to inhibit the ubiquitination of full-length FLAG-Eps15 (Fig. 4B). As a second strategy to demonstrate that the last 84 aa of Eps15 contain a binding site for the ubiquitination machinery, we tested whether this domain could re-establish the ubiquitination of a non-ubiquitinated truncated mutant of Eps15R. We therefore created a chimera (Myc-Eps15R-ΔC90+5K→R) composed of Myc-Eps15R-ΔC90 to which we added the last 84 aa of Eps15 (aa 814–897 corresponding to the missing aa 818–907 of Eps15R) containing the five Lys → Arg mutations. This particular mutant was used for this experiment to exclude the possibility that the possible recovery of ubiquitination was due to the presence of a substrate lysine in the last 84 aa added to the C terminus of Myc-Eps15R-ΔC90. Fig.5 shows that the chimera Myc-Eps15R-ΔC90+5K→R is ubiquitinated indicating that the last 84 aa of Eps15, containing no lysine, was able to re-establish ubiquitination on Eps15R-ΔC90. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the last 84 residues of Eps15 contain a binding site for the ubiquitination machinery. To map more precisely the binding site for the ubiquitination machinery, we created a truncated form of Eps15 devoid of the last 26 aa (FLAG-Eps15-ΔC26, lacking aa 872–897) and the equivalent truncated Eps15R (Myc-Eps15R-ΔC25, lacking aa 883–907). These truncations resulted in a dramatic reduction of ubiquitination of both Eps15 and Eps15R (Fig. 6A) suggesting that the E3 ligase binding site is located in this part of the C terminus of the two molecules. Interestingly, the last 25 amino acids of Eps15 contain a classical leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) involved in CRM-1 binding in a leucine-dependent manner (20Vecchi M. Polo S.

Moreover, this part of Eps15 and Eps15R is particularly enriched in hydrophobic leucine and isoleucine residues, all conserved in Eps15R except Ile894 (Fig. 6B). Strikingly, a very similar leucine-rich motif (LALAL) present in the proteasome subunit S5a was shown to bind polyubiquitin chains (22Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This motif is part of a UIM identified in S5a and in several endocytic proteins. Two UIMs are present at the C terminus of Eps15 and Eps15R. Interestingly, the second UIM is located in the last 25 amino acids of Eps15 and Eps15R (23Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). To investigate the functionality of this UIM in the ubiquitination of Eps15, we replaced the leucine/isoleucine residues with alanine in the context of the full-length FLAG-Eps15. Four different mutants were generated: L872A/L875A, L883A/L885A, I887A/L889A, and I894A. As shown in Fig. 6C, mutation of Leu872 and Leu875 to alanine did not affect Eps15 ubiquitination nor did the mutation of Ile894 to alanine. Interestingly, these three leucine/isoleucine residues are not part of the UIM (23Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of UIM residues L883A/L885A and I887A/L889A resulted in a complete loss of ubiquitination, indicating that the UIM is critical for Eps15 ubiquitination. However, single point mutations of each of these four residues (L883A, L885A, I887A, and L889A) did not affect ubiquitination of Eps15 (data not shown). Comparison of Eps15 and Eps15R sequences surrounding the leucine-rich motif shows that the motif 878QEQED882 is conserved in both proteins (Fig. 6B). Some leucine-rich protein-protein interaction motifs have been shown to require a charged environment (24Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Moreover, these negatively charged residues are conserved in most UIMs (23Hofmann K. Falquet L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). We examined whether the negatively charged residues were involved in the binding of the ubiquitination machinery. Four mutants were generated in the context of FLAG-Eps15: E879A, E881A, D882A, and a triple mutant E879A/E881A/D882A. As shown in Fig.6D, single mutation of acidic residues did not affect Eps15 ubiquitination, whereas the triple mutant E879A/E881A/D882A (EED→A) was significantly less ubiquitinated than wild-type Eps15.

Previously we identified Site B (residues 3359–3369) in apolipoprotein (apo) B100 as the proteoglycan binding sequence in low density lipoproteins (LDLs) and showed that the atherogenicity of apoB-containing lipoproteins is linked to their affinity for artery wall proteoglycans. However, both apoB100- and apoB48-containing lipoproteins are equally atherogenic even though Site B lies in the carboxyl-terminal half of apoB100 and is absent in apoB48. If binding to proteoglycans is a key step in atherogenesis, apoB48-containing lipoproteins must bind to proteoglycans via other proteoglycan binding sites in the amino-terminal 48% of apoB. In vitro studies have identified five clusters of basic amino acids in delipidated apoB48 that bind negatively charged glycosaminoglycans. To determine which of these sites is functional on LDL particles, we analyzed the proteoglycan binding activity of recombinant human LDLs from transgenic mice or rat hepatoma cells. Substitution of neutral amino acids for the basic amino acids in Site B-Ib (residues 84–94) abolished the proteoglycan binding activity of recombinant apoB53. Carboxyl-truncated apoB80 bound biglycan with higher affinity than apoB100 and apoB48. ApoB80 in which Site B was mutated had the same affinity for proteoglycans as apoB48. These data support the hypothesis that the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 “masks” Site B-Ib, the amino-terminal proteoglycan binding site, and that this site is exposed in carboxyl-truncated forms of apoB. The presence of a proteoglycan binding site in the amino-terminal region of apoB may explain why apoB48- and apoB100-containing lipoproteins are equally atherogenic.

Accumulating evidence during recent years has led to the concept that subendothelial retention of apoB100-containing lipoproteins is the initiating event in atherogenesis (1Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Skålen K. Gustafsson M. Rydberg E.K. Hulten L.M. Wiklund O. Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Nature. 2002; 417: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a series of biological responses to this retained material leads to specific molecular and cellular processes that promote lesion formation (1Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we identified Site B (residues 3359–3369) in apoB100 as the principal proteoglycan binding sequence (3Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and presented direct experimental evidence that the atherogenicity of apoB-containing lipoproteins is linked to their affinity for artery wall proteoglycans (2Skålen K. Gustafsson M. Rydberg E.K. Hulten L.M. Wiklund O. Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Nature. 2002; 417: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Mice expressing proteoglycan binding-defective LDLs developed significantly less atherosclerosis than mice expressing wild-type control LDLs (2Skålen K. Gustafsson M. Rydberg E.K. Hulten L.M. Wiklund O. Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Nature. 2002; 417: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). However, Site B lies in the carboxyl-terminal half of apoB100 and is absent in apoB48. This finding presented a paradox because numerous studies have demonstrated that apoE-deficient (Apoe−/−) mice develop severe atherosclerosis (4Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 133-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). What is less appreciated is that these animals contain mainly apoB48-containing lipoproteins, which must therefore be the type of lipoprotein that causes their atherosclerosis. In addition, at similarly high cholesterol levels, gene-targeted mice expressing only apoB48 or only apoB100 developed an equivalent degree of atherosclerosis (7Veniant M.M. Pierotti V. Newland D.

If binding to artery wall proteoglycans is a key step in atherogenesis, these apoB48-containing lipoproteins must bind to proteoglycans at other proteoglycan binding sites in the amino-terminal 48% of the apoB molecule.

In this study, we analyzed the interaction between apoB48-containing lipoproteins and artery wall proteoglycans, identified the proteoglycan binding site of apoB48, and elucidated why this site is nonfunctional in full-length apoB100.

Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The resulting P1 plasmid encodes apoB80 with Site B mutated (i.e. RK3359–3369SA apoB80). An apoB P1 plasmid encoding apoB48 was generated by substitution of the Q2153L mutation at the editing site in the P1 apoB100 (3Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) with a translational termination codon (TAA). The Q2153L mutation effectively abolishes the formation of apoB48, which is formed by an editing mechanism in mouse liver (12Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Johnson D.F. Taylor S.M. Haubold K.W. McCarthy B.J.

The mutation was inserted into the 5.7-kb fragment using oligomer 5′-ctatctcaactacagacatatatgatataatttgatcagtatattaaag-3′. Mutagenic colonies were screened for the lack of a PstI cleavage site. The same approach was used to generate the apoB P1 plasmid 3-GBSM (i.e. three glycosaminoglycan binding sites mutated) apoB48 from the P1 apoB plasmid 6-GBSM apoB100 (2Skålen K. Gustafsson M.

The pZErO-2.45kb was then subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. Different oligonucleotides were used to convert the basic amino acids arginines and lysines in the amino terminus to the neutral amino acids serines and glutamines, respectively: RK15–25SQ, 5′-agcttccagcacctcagccagtacacatacaactat-3′); K84–94Q, 5′-gcaaagccttgctgcagcaaacccagaactctgaggag-3′; and RK221–231SQ, 5′-cacactggacgctcagagccagcatgtggcagaagc-3′. The three mutated 2.45-kb constructs were religated into human apoB53 Q2153L in a pCMV vector (15Tran K. Borén J. Macri J. Wang Y. McLeod R. Avramoglu R.K. Adeli K. Yao Z. J. Biol.

Transgenic mice were generated at MouseCamp (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden) by microinjection of P1 DNA into fertilized mouse eggs (B6CBA). Transgenic mice were identified with a human apoB-specific immunoassay using antibodies 1D1 (16Milne R.W. Theolis Jr., R. Verdery R.B. Marcel Y.L. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 23-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Bsol22 (16Milne R.W. Theolis Jr., R. Verdery R.B. Marcel Y.L. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 23-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two founders with the highest levels of plasma apoB were selected for breeding and further analysis. McArdle 7777 cells were cultured as described previously (17Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One day before transfection, the cells were seeded in a six-well plate (25 × 104 cells/well). The three constructs and wild-type apoB53 were cotransfected with pcDNA 3.1 (+) using Tfx 50 reagent at a 3:1 ratio. Two days after the transfection, Geneticin (600 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium. Colonies were picked after 2 weeks and screened for human apoB expression by Western blot with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal antibody against human apoB. Two clones of each construct were labeled with [35S]methionine as described previously (17Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular apoB and apoB in the medium were recovered by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-apoB antibody. After separation by electrophoresis on a 3–15% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS, apoB was visualized by autoradiography. Clones 36 and 58 expressing apoB53 and clones 18 and 20 expressing K84–94Q apoB53 were cultured in 32 bottles (150 cm2)/clone, each containing 50 ml of medium. After 3 days, the medium was collected, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 units/ml aprotinin were added. The medium was centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g and concentrated in a stirred ultrafiltration cell (Amicon) with a Millipore membrane (molecular weight, 100,000). Thed < 1.07 g/ml supernatant was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (Ti 70 rotor) and dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl and 0.01% EDTA, pH 7.4, and endogenous rat apoB and apoE were removed by immunoaffinity chromatography (3Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). After ultracentrifugation (d = 1.07 g/ml) at 657,000 ×g for 4 h in a TLA 110 rotor, the top 1 ml was recovered and separated by fast performance liquid chromatography gel filtration (ÄKTA Explorer, Amersham Biosciences) with a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column. Aliquots of 500 μl were injected onto the column and separated with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The fractions corresponding to LDL size were pooled and subjected to binding studies. Recombinant LDLs (d = 1.02–1.05 g/ml) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation and dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl and 0.01% EDTA, pH 7.4. Mouse apoE and apoB or rat apoE and apoB were removed by immunoaffinity chromatography with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (3Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). ApoB48-containing lipoproteins (d = 1.02–1.05 g/ml) isolated from transgenic mice (3Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) were incubated with a 200-fold molar excess of cyclohexanedione (CHD)-modified apoE from human very low density lipoproteins as described previously (2Skålen K. Gustafsson M. Rydberg E.K. Hulten L.M. Wiklund O. Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Nature. 2002; 417: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). After ultracentrifugation (d = 1.07 g/ml) at 657,000 ×g for 4 h in a TLA 110 rotor, the top 1 ml was recovered and separated by fast performance liquid chromatography gel filtration with a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column to eliminate contaminating free apoE. Fractions corresponding to LDL size were pooled and subjected to binding studies. The incubation with CHD-modified apoE was performed when not all endogenous apoE was removed by immunoaffinity chromatography. Maxisorp immunoplates (NUNC) were coated with biglycan or decorin (10 μg/ml) in HBS buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) overnight at room temperature and blocked with HBS buffer with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. LDL samples in HBS buffer with 2 mmCaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2 were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then incubated with the same buffer supplemented with lipoprotein-deficient serum (diluted 1:50) for 30 min. To each well, 100 μl of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal antibody against human apoB (The Binding Site; diluted 1:750 in HBS buffer with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% Tween 20) was added and incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h. Finally, 100 μl of 1-Step Turbo TMB-ELISA (Pierce) substrate was added and incubated for 5 min. The reactions were stopped with an equal volume of 2 mH2SO4 and measured at 450 nm in a spectrophotometer. To determine whether lipoproteins containing apoB48 bind to artery wall proteoglycans, we performed binding studies with LDLs from Apoe−/− gene-targeted mice. Scanning of the SDS-polyacrylamide gels revealed that the d = 1.02–1.05 g/ml fraction contained greater than 95% apoB48. The binding studies revealed that apoB48 LDLs bind to biglycan (Fig.1). To verify that the binding of apoB48 LDLs to proteoglycans was mediated by apoB48 and not by the lipids of the lipoprotein, we treated the lipoproteins with CHD or acetic anhydride (not shown) to modify the arginines and lysines, respectively. After chemical modification, the apoB48 LDLs had greatly reduced ability to interact with biglycan (Fig. 1). These results were verified in binding experiments with decorin and the total proteoglycan fraction from aortic smooth muscle cells (not shown). Thus, proteoglycan binding site(s) other than those on normal LDLs are exposed and physiologically important on apoB48 LDLs. In vitro studies of delipidated apoB100 have identified eight clusters of basic amino acids in the apoB moiety of LDLs that bind to the negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (8Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11097-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hirose N. Blankenship D.T. Krivanek M.A. Jackson R.L. Cardin A.D.

However, only one of these putative glycosaminoglycan binding sites (i.e. Site B-VII at residues 3359–3369) is functionally exposed on the surface of apoB100 LDLs (18Borén J. Olin K. Lee I. Chait A. Wight T.N. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2658-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Five of the sites (B-I–B-V) are present in apoB48. To elucidate the role of these sites in the binding of proteoglycan by apoB48 LDLs, we generated transgenic mice expressing wild-type apoB48 or 3-GBSM apoB48, a mutant form of apoB48 in which the basic amino acids in Sites B-III–B-V were converted to neutral amino acids (arginines to serines and lysines to alanines) (Fig.2). Because of the apparent importance of the amino-terminal domain of apoB100 in the formation of nascent very low density lipoproteins, we did not mutate the two heparin binding sites in the extreme amino terminus of the human apoB gene.Table IAmino acid sequences of eight putative glycosaminoglycan binding regions of apoBSite (amino acids)Amino acid sequenceB-Ia (15–25)1-aThe first putative glycosaminoglycan binding region was divided into B-Ia (15–25) and B-Ib (84–94).AspAlaThrArgPheLysHisLeuArgLysTyrB-Ib (84–94)1-aThe first putative glycosaminoglycan binding region was divided into B-Ia (15–25) and B-Ib (84–94).AlaLeuLeuLysLysThrLysAsnSerGluGluB-II (222–232)LeuAspAlaLysArgLysHisValAlaGluAlaB-III (900–910)ProSerProLysArgProValLysLeuLeuSerB-IV (2079–2089)GlnPheValArgLysTyrArgAlaAlaLeuGlyB-V (2117–2127)AlaLeuThrLysLysTyrArgIleThrGluAsnB-VI (3148–3158)AlaGlnTyrLysLysAsnLysHisArgHisSerB-VII (3359–3369)ArgLeuThrArgLysArgGlyLeuLysLeuAlaB-VIII (3668–3678)SerIleGlyArgArgGlnHisLeuArgValSer1-a The first putative glycosaminoglycan binding region was divided into B-Ia (15–25) and B-Ib (84–94). Open table in a new tab To determine the ability of the recombinant LDLs to interact with proteoglycans, recombinant control apoB48 LDLs, apoB48 3-GBSM LDLs, recombinant apoB100 control LDLs, and apoB100 6-GBSM LDLs were isolated from transgenic mice (2Skålen K.

Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In apoB100-containing 6-GBSM LDLs, the basic amino acids in the six putative carboxyl-terminal glycosaminoglycan binding sequences (Table I) in apoB100 were converted to neutral amino acids (2Skålen K. Gustafsson M. Rydberg E.K. Hulten L.M. Wiklund O. Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Nature. 2002; 417: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Previously we showed that apoB100-containing 6-GBSM LDLs do not interact with artery wall proteoglycans (2Skålen K. Gustafsson M. Rydberg E.K. Hulten L.M. Wiklund O. Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Nature. 2002; 417: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In addition to the direct interaction between LDL protein and proteoglycans, retention of LDLs in the extracellular matrix of the artery wall also appears to involve indirect binding facilitated by apoE (1Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10160-10167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was important to deplete the lipoproteins of apoE. This was especially important for apoB48 LDLs, which are more enriched in apoE than apoB100 LDLs. Immunoaffinity chromatography removed all of the apoE from recombinant apoB100 LDLs but only 32 ± 5% of the apoE from apoB48 LDLs. Therefore, we incubated the recombinant apoB48 LDLs with a 200-fold molar excess of CHD-modified apoE isolated from human very low density lipoproteins to replace the endogenous apoE with CHD-modified human apoE, which does not interact with proteoglycans (2Skålen K. Gustafsson M. Rydberg E.K. Hulten L.M. Wiklund O. Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Nature. 2002; 417: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Endogenous mouse apoB was removed by immunoaffinity chromatography (3Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that the competition with CHD-modified apoE does not affect the ability of apoB to interact with glycosaminoglycans (not shown). The purified recombinant LDLs, containing recombinant apoB48 or apoB100 only and no contaminating proteins (not shown), were subjected to solid-phase assays with artery wall proteoglycans. In two independent experiments, recombinant control apoB48 LDLs and recombinant control apoB100 LDLs bound biglycan with high affinity, whereas recombinant apoB100 6-GBSM LDLs displayed severely impaired binding to biglycan (Fig. 3). Of particular interest, recombinant apoB48 3-GBSM LDLs interacted normally with biglycan (Fig.3). These results were verified in binding experiments with decorin and the total proteoglycan fraction from aortic smooth muscle cells (not shown). These results indicate that one or both of the putative glycosaminoglycan binding sequences that are not mutated in apoB48 3-GBSM LDLs (i.e. Sites B-I and B-II) are exposed and functional in apoB48 LDLs. These data also indicate that these site(s) are nonfunctional in apoB100. To better understand how Sites B-I and B-II are located in the lipoproteins, we performed molecular modeling studies of the amino-terminal 6.6% of apoB. Regions of multiple local sequence homology between vertebrate lipovitellin and mammalian apoB were identified with the program MACAW (21Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proteins. 1991; 9: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 22Lawrence C.E. Altschul S.F. Boguski M.S. Liu J.S. Neuwald A.F. Wootton J.C. Science. 1993; 262: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). The regions of local sequence homology identified in the first 1000 residues of human apoB were then used to orient the sequence for molecular modeling by the Modeler-4 program (23Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10292) Google Scholar). A molecular model for the first 300 amino acids of human apoB created with the molecular graphics program RIBBONS (24Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 958-961Crossref Scopus (783) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 4. The model shows that Site B-I consists of two separate domains, Sites B-Ia (residues 15–25) and B-Ib (residues 84–94) (Table I) and that Sites B-Ia and B-II form a single contiguous positively charged domain. Site B-Ib is at the other end of the β C domain (25Segrest J. Jones M. Mishra V. Pierotti V. Young S. Borén J. Innerarity T. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 3: 85-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The extent of homology (i.e. sequence identity) in the model was 19.3%. Furthermore, the similarity (i.e. conserved substitutions) was 38.0%. These values are similar to those of the apoB model reported by Mann et al. (26Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Kochl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M. Infante R. Hancock J.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Those values were 19.4% and 35.5%, respectively. To identify the proteoglycan binding sequence in apoB48, the basic amino acids in regions B-Ia, B-Ib, and B-II were converted to neutral amino acids (arginines to serines and lysines to glutamines). Stably transfected McA-RH7777 cells expressing recombinant control apoB53, RK15–25SQ apoB53, K84–94Q apoB53, or RK221–231SQ apoB53 were generated. Analysis of two clones per construct showed that recombinant control apoB53 and K84–94Q apoB53 were secreted from the cells (Fig.5). RK15–25SQ and RK221–231SQ apoB53 were expressed in the cells but were not secreted (Fig. 5). To determine the importance of Site B-Ib (residues 84–94) in the interaction with artery wall proteoglycans, recombinant control apoB53 LDLs and K84–94Q apoB53 LDLs were isolated from the cell culture medium by ultracentrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography. Approximately 84 ± 5% of the endogenous rat apoB and 74 ± 6% of the apoE were removed by immunoaffinity chromatography techniques. However, in contrast to highly apoE-enriched recombinant apoB48 LDLs isolated from transgenic mice, recombinant apoB53 LDLs isolated from McA-RH7777 cells contain significantly less apoE. Therefore, only trace amounts of apoE were detected in purified apoB53 LDLs after immunoaffinity chromatography (not shown). In two independent experiments, recombinant control apoB53 bound biglycan with high affinity, whereas K84–94Q apoB53 displayed severely impaired binding to biglycan (Fig. 6). These results were obtained with two different lines of each construct and verified in binding experiments with decorin and the total proteoglycan fraction from aortic smooth muscle cells (not shown). These data indicate that Site B-Ib in apoB53 interacts with proteoglycans. The first 89% of apoB100 enwraps the LDL particle like a belt, and the carboxyl-terminal 11% constitutes a “bow” that crosses over the belt and brings the carboxyl tail of apoB100 close to amino acid 3500 (Fig. 7). Thus, the epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibodies MB19 (residue 71; apoB2) (27Young S.G. Bertics S.J. Curtiss L.K. Casal D.C. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 443-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and MB43 (residues 4027–4081; apoB89) (29Chen P.-F. Marcel Y.L. Yang C.-Y. Gotto Jr., A.M. Milne R.W. Sparrow J.T. Chan L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) are very close to or even on top of each other (30Chatterton J.E. Phillips M.L. Curtiss L.K. Milne R. Fruchart J.-C. Schumaker V.N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2027-2037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site B-Ib (residues 84–94) is located at apoB2. To test the hypothesis that the carboxyl terminus of full-length apoB100 masks this site in apoB100 LDLs, we generated human apoB transgenic mice expressing apoB80 or RK3359–3369SA apoB80 (i.e. apoB80 with Site B mutated). Recombinant LDLs containing control apoB100, apoB80, RK3359–3369SA apoB80, and apoB48 were isolated, and endogenous mouse apoB was removed by immunoaffinity techniques. Endogenous apoE was removed from the apoB100- and apoB80-containing lipoproteins by immunoaffinity chromatography and replaced with CHD-modified human apoE on the apoB48 LDLs. In two independent experiments, apoB80 bound biglycan and decorin (not shown) with higher affinity than apoB100 (Fig.8). RK3359–3369SA apoB80 (Site B mutated) had the same affinity for the proteoglycans as apoB48 (Fig.8). These data support the hypothesis that the carboxyl terminus of apoB100 masks Site B-Ib and that this site is exposed in carboxyl-truncated forms of apoB. Thus, apoB80 binds to proteoglycans using both the amino-terminal (i.e. Site B-Ib) and the carboxyl-terminal (i.e. Site B-VII) proteoglycan binding sites in apoB. ApoB80 in which Site B has been mutated interacts with the amino-terminal proteoglycan binding site only and displays the same affinity as apoB48 for artery wall proteoglycans. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction of apoB48-containing lipoproteins and artery wall proteoglycans. The K84–94Q substitution in apoB53 abolished the interaction with artery wall proteoglycans. These results identified Site B-Ib (residues 84–94) as the proteoglycan binding site of apoB48. This site is located at the other end of the β domain where Sites B-Ia and B-II form a single contiguous positively charged domain. Thus, it is less likely that Site B-Ib acts cooperatively with Sites B-Ia and B-II in the association with proteoglycans. This possibility could not be tested since RK15–25SQ and RK221–231SQ apoB53 were sorted to posttranslational degradation and not secreted. Proper folding of the amino-terminal globular domain of apoB is essential for the biosynthesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins, and two binding domains for microsomal triglyceride transfer protein have been identified in the amino terminus of apoB (26Mann C.J.

Thus, it is feasible that substitution of neutral amino acids for the basic amino acids in the contiguous positively charged domain in the amino terminus of apoB directly or indirectly disrupts the interaction between microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and apoB. This would explain the abolished secretion of RK15–25SQ and RK221–231SQ apoB53. The identification of Site B-Ib as the proteoglycan binding site in apoB48 is in agreement with results reported by Goldberg et al. (9Goldberg I.J. Wagner W.D. Pang L. Paka L. Curtiss L.K. DeLozier J.A. Shelness G.S. Young C.S.H. Pillarisetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35355-35361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These investigators analyzed the interaction between an artificial nonlipidized apoB fragment and proteoglycans and found that the amino-terminal 17% of apoB is sufficient for association with glycosaminoglycans (9Goldberg I.J. Wagner W.D. Pang L. Paka L. Curtiss L.K. DeLozier J.A. Shelness G.S. Young C.S.H. Pillarisetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35355-35361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear whether any of the putative glycosaminoglycan binding sites present in the nonlipidized apoB fragment were functionally exposed on the surface of LDL particles since only one of the eight glycosaminoglycan binding sites that have been identified in delipidated apoB100 is functional in apoB100 LDLs (18Borén J. Olin K. Lee I. Chait A. Wight T.N. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2658-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Therefore, structure/function studies of apoB must be performed with native LDLs. What is the biological significance of Site B-Ib in lipid metabolism and atherogenesis? In humans, apoB48-containing lipoproteins are enriched in apoE, a well known heparin-binding protein. Thus, the importance of site B-Ib for interaction with glycosaminoglycans is unclear, and it is possible that all binding is mediated by apoE. However, Goldberg et al. (9Goldberg I.J. Wagner W.D. Pang L. Paka L. Curtiss L.K. DeLozier J.A. Shelness G.S. Young C.S.H. Pillarisetti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35355-35361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have argued against the hypothesis that apoB48-containing lipoproteins require additional proteins for retention, and they have stated that the hypothesis that apoE promotes atherosclerosis by causing retention of apoB48 remnants is not tenable. We recently showed that apoE can substitute for the defective proteoglycan binding of mutant forms of apoB100 (2Skålen K. Gustafsson M. Rydberg E.K. Hulten L.M. Wiklund O. Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Nature. 2002; 417: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), and we have found that apoE-containing apoB48 LDLs bind proteoglycans with higher affinity than apoE-depleted apoB48 LDLs (not shown). These data indicate that Site B-Ib and apoE on apoB48-containing lipoproteins act cooperatively in binding to proteoglycans. The finding that apoB48 isolated from Apoe−/− gene-targeted mice binds proteoglycans is important because it is consistent with the response-to-retention hypothesis. However, direct experimental evidence for a role of Site B-Ib in atherogenesis is lacking and has to be addressed in future studies. Previously we proposed that the carboxyl-terminal tail of apoB100 serves as a modulator that can alter the affinity of the receptor binding domain of apoB100 (3Borén J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and that the interaction between arginine 3500 and tryptophan 4369 is essential for correct conformation of the carboxyl-terminal tail of apoB100 (33Borén J. Ekström U. Ågren B. Nilsson-Ehle P. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9214-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). LDLs containing apoB95 lack tryptophan 4369 and therefore have enhanced receptor binding; in contrast, apoB97 LDLs contain tryptophan 4369and bind normally (33Borén J. Ekström U. Ågren B.

However, both apoB95 and apoB97 display the same binding affinity for both biglycan and decorin (not shown). Therefore, we do not believe that this mechanism explains the increased affinity of apoB80 for proteoglycans. Instead we suggest a model that explains why apoB100- and apoB48-containing lipoproteins are equally atherogenic. In apoB100, Site B-Ib, the amino-terminal proteoglycan binding site, is masked by the carboxyl terminus, whereas in carboxyl-truncated forms of apoB, Site B-Ib is exposed. ApoB80 uses both the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal proteoglycan binding sites to interact with proteoglycans. ApoB80 in which Site B has been mutated uses only the amino-terminal proteoglycan binding site and displays the same affinity for artery wall proteoglycans as apoB48 (Fig. 8). In summary, we have identified Site B-Ib as the principal proteoglycan binding site in apoB48 LDLs and have proposed a model that explains why this site is masked and nonfunctional in full-length apoB100 LDLs. The presence of a proteoglycan binding site in the amino-terminal region of apoB is consistent with the response-to-retention hypothesis and may explain why apoB48- and apoB100-containing lipoproteins are equally atherogenic.

First, an interaction between the C terminus of GluR-A and a type I PDZ domain protein has been implicated in several models of activity-dependent regulation of synaptic strength (13Hayashi Y. Shi S.H. Esteban J.A. Piccini A. Poncer J.C. Malinow R. Science. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Second, it is to date the only PDZ domain interaction of AMPA receptors that does not involve the GluR-B subunit and, therefore, may be relevant for the synaptic organization of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, which lack this subunit (14Valtschanoff J.G. Burette A. Davare M.A. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Weinberg R.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3605-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Third, in contrast to the majority of synaptic MAGUKs, which generally share binding partners, GluR-A appears to bind only to SAP97. However, the true selectivity and its underlying mechanisms have yet to be defined. In the present study, we show that GluR-A binds to the second PDZ domain of SAP97 but not to the PDZ domains of PSD-93, PSD-95, or SAP102 and that the recognition of the GluR-A C terminus by SAP97 is critically dependent on an SSG sequence located outside the canonical PDZ binding motif.DISCUSSIONOur initial in vitro binding experiments showed that the C terminus of GluR-A binds to the PDZ domains of SAP97 but not to the closely related ones of PSD-95, PSD-93, and SAP102. Under the same conditions, the C termini of the NR2A and GluR6 subunits and the microtubule-binding protein CRIPT bound to all four proteins. These findings extend the original discovery of this interaction (12Leonard A.S. Davare M.A. Horne M.C. Garner C.C. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19518-19524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) by providing a clear demonstration of its highly selective nature. Intrigued by this unusual selectivity, we analyzed the interactions of GluR-A with single PDZ domains and the effects of C-terminal mutations on the binding in an attempt to identify the structural features responsible for the specificity of the molecular association. First, experiments with single domains indicated that the second PDZ domain of SAP97 provides the major contribution to binding. No binding of PDZ1 or PDZ3 domains to GluR-A CTD was observed under conditions in which binding to GluR-6 CTD (PDZ1) or CRIPT (PDZ3) was clearly detectable. A recent report (19Mehta S., Wu, H. Garner C.C. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16092-16099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), based on immunoprecipitations from transfected HEK293 cells, suggested that the first PDZ domain of SAP97 is responsible for GluR-A binding. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy are unclear at the moment, but it should be noted that all three PDZ domains of PSD-95 have been found to bind the same peptide substrate albeit with widely different affinities (16Niethammer M. Valtschanoff J.G. Kapoor T.M. Allison D.W. Weinberg T.M. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 693-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 20Imamura F. Maeda S. Doi T.

The finding, that similar SAP97-selective binding is exhibited by a GluR-D subunit mutated to uncover a cryptic PDZ binding motif, led us to identify a tripeptide sequence SSG as an important determinant for SAP97 binding. The crucial role of this segment in the binding was indicated by the complete loss of binding resulting from replacement of the SSG sequence by three alanine residues, both in the whole CTDs and the C-terminal 11-mer peptides of GluR-A and GluR-DΔP902. Moreover, three different substitutions of the “middle” S in the SSG sequence invariably led to loss of SAP97 interaction in 11-mer C-terminal peptide of GluR-A. Mechanistically, the critical role of the SSG sequence can be explained either by direct contacts between this sequence element and the PDZ domain or by an indirect conformational effect the SSG tripeptide sequence exerts on the extreme C terminus of GluR-A.The structural mechanisms underlying the specificity of PDZ interactions are only partially understood (18Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 21Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R.

PDZ domains bind preferentially to C-terminal peptide sequences of target proteins that contain a binding motif typical for each class of PDZ domain (22Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of several PDZ domains have been determined with type I peptide ligands and show that the PDZ domain consists of a core of five or six antiparallel β-sheets (A–F) and two α-helices (A and B) (18Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 22Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The last four to five residues of the peptide ligand associate as an β-strand in an antiparallel orientation with one strand (B) of the PDZ domain. The C-terminal residue of the peptide ligand is accommodated in a pocket created by an α-helix (B), the B strand, and a conserved GLGF loop connecting the A and B strands, whereas the serine or threonine residue at the −2 position forms an essential hydrogen bond with a conserved histidine residue in helix B. These features explain the requirement for a PDZ type I binding motif, but the specificity of the interaction seems to be determined mostly by further interactions between the side chains of residues at positions −1, −3, and −4 of the peptide ligand and the PDZ domain (17Songyang Z.

In contrast, mutations at positions −8 to −10 totally abolished the interaction between GluR-A C terminus and SAP97 PDZ domains, indicating the presence of a major contribution to binding. There are some previous reports of the importance of sequence elements, which are located upstream from the C-terminal 4–5 residues for PDZ domain binding. However, in most cases, these elements have not been clearly defined (17Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C.

Thus, it is probable that the SSG sequence interacts directly with the PDZ2 domain as the C-terminal motif does. In the absence of a three-dimensional structure, the mode of interaction can only be speculated for the moment. It seems, however, that the interaction between the C-terminal 4–5 residues of GluR-A with SAP97 is too weak, and a second interaction between the SSG sequence and the PDZ domain would be necessary to provide a stable complex. This second interaction may involve specific hydrogen bonds because two of the three residues are serines. An interesting possibility is that this second interaction site might serve a regulatory function, perhaps involving phosphorylation or further protein interactions. SAP97 has been reported to provide a link between protein kinases and phosphatases and GluR-A-containing AMPA receptors (28Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D.

Further studies to analyze the physiological importance of the SSG sequence element are clearly warranted.In conclusion, our present findings demonstrate the highly selective nature of the interaction between GluR-A and SAP97. Furthermore, they show that, in addition to a typical type I PDZ binding motif, an upstream SSG sequence, located 9 to 11 residues N-terminally, is essential for the interaction. Considered together with the relatively minor influence of residues at positions −1, −3, and −4, our results suggest that the interaction between SAP97 and GluR-A represents a novel variation of PDZ domain-peptide interactions. Synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97)1 and the closely related SAP90/PSD-95, SAP102, and PSD-93/chapsyn-110 form a family of membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologues (MAGUKs), characterized by the presence of three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a C-terminal guanylate kinase homologous domain (1Muller B.M.

No binding of PDZ1 or PDZ3 domains to GluR-A CTD was observed under conditions in which binding to GluR-6 CTD (PDZ1) or CRIPT (PDZ3) was clearly detectable. A recent report (19Mehta S., Wu, H. Garner C.C. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16092-16099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), based on immunoprecipitations from transfected HEK293 cells, suggested that the first PDZ domain of SAP97 is responsible for GluR-A binding. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy are unclear at the moment, but it should be noted that all three PDZ domains of PSD-95 have been found to bind the same peptide substrate albeit with widely different affinities (16Niethammer M. Valtschanoff J.G. Kapoor T.M. Allison D.W. Weinberg T.M. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 693-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 20Imamura F. Maeda S. Doi T. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3640-3646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutation analysis of the extreme C terminus of GluR-A confirmed, as expected, the importance of the type I PDZ binding motif for the interaction but provided no explanation for its unexpected MAGUK selectivity. The finding, that similar SAP97-selective binding is exhibited by a GluR-D subunit mutated to uncover a cryptic PDZ binding motif, led us to identify a tripeptide sequence SSG as an important determinant for SAP97 binding. The crucial role of this segment in the binding was indicated by the complete loss of binding resulting from replacement of the SSG sequence by three alanine residues, both in the whole CTDs and the C-terminal 11-mer peptides of GluR-A and GluR-DΔP902. Moreover, three different substitutions of the “middle” S in the SSG sequence invariably led to loss of SAP97 interaction in 11-mer C-terminal peptide of GluR-A. Mechanistically, the critical role of the SSG sequence can be explained either by direct contacts between this sequence element and the PDZ domain or by an indirect conformational effect the SSG tripeptide sequence exerts on the extreme C terminus of GluR-A. The structural mechanisms underlying the specificity of PDZ interactions are only partially understood (18Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 21Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). PDZ domains bind preferentially to C-terminal peptide sequences of target proteins that contain a binding motif typical for each class of PDZ domain (22Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of several PDZ domains have been determined with type I peptide ligands and show that the PDZ domain consists of a core of five or six antiparallel β-sheets (A–F) and two α-helices (A and B) (18Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 22Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The last four to five residues of the peptide ligand associate as an β-strand in an antiparallel orientation with one strand (B) of the PDZ domain. The C-terminal residue of the peptide ligand is accommodated in a pocket created by an α-helix (B), the B strand, and a conserved GLGF loop connecting the A and B strands, whereas the serine or threonine residue at the −2 position forms an essential hydrogen bond with a conserved histidine residue in helix B. These features explain the requirement for a PDZ type I binding motif, but the specificity of the interaction seems to be determined mostly by further interactions between the side chains of residues at positions −1, −3, and −4 of the peptide ligand and the PDZ domain (17Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 18Sheng M. Sala C.

It should be noted, however, that the GST pull-down assay would not be able to identify small differences in binding affinity between the mutants. Therefore, it is possible that more detailed binding analyses, using solution binding assays, might well reveal a minor contribution by residues −1, −3, and −4. In contrast, mutations at positions −8 to −10 totally abolished the interaction between GluR-A C terminus and SAP97 PDZ domains, indicating the presence of a major contribution to binding. There are some previous reports of the importance of sequence elements, which are located upstream from the C-terminal 4–5 residues for PDZ domain binding. However, in most cases, these elements have not been clearly defined (17Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 26Bassand P. Bernard A. Rafiki A. Gayet D. Khrestchatisky M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2031-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or their contribution to the binding has been relatively modest (27DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 594-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (137) Google Scholar). GluR-A CTD appeared to interact with the single PDZ2 domain or with the PDZ1–3 segment with similar strengths. Thus, it is probable that the SSG sequence interacts directly with the PDZ2 domain as the C-terminal motif does. In the absence of a three-dimensional structure, the mode of interaction can only be speculated for the moment. It seems, however, that the interaction between the C-terminal 4–5 residues of GluR-A with SAP97 is too weak, and a second interaction between the SSG sequence and the PDZ domain would be necessary to provide a stable complex. This second interaction may involve specific hydrogen bonds because two of the three residues are serines. An interesting possibility is that this second interaction site might serve a regulatory function, perhaps involving phosphorylation or further protein interactions. SAP97 has been reported to provide a link between protein kinases and phosphatases and GluR-A-containing AMPA receptors (28Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. Neuron. 2000; 27: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 29Tavalin S.J. Colledge M. Hell J.W. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 15: 3044-3051Crossref Google Scholar). However, the two serines in the SSG sequence are not part of any known consensus motif for protein kinase substrates. Further studies to analyze the physiological importance of the SSG sequence element are clearly warranted. In conclusion, our present findings demonstrate the highly selective nature of the interaction between GluR-A and SAP97. Furthermore, they show that, in addition to a typical type I PDZ binding motif, an upstream SSG sequence, located 9 to 11 residues N-terminally, is essential for the interaction. Considered together with the relatively minor influence of residues at positions −1, −3, and −4, our results suggest that the interaction between SAP97 and GluR-A represents a novel variation of PDZ domain-peptide interactions.

https://openalex.org/W1969846013,"Bacterial sulfate assimilation pathways provide for activation of inorganic sulfur for the biosynthesis of cysteine and methionine, through either adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) or 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) as intermediates. PAPS is also the substrate for sulfotransferases that produce sulfolipids, putative virulence factors, in Mycobacterium tuberculosis such as SL-1. In this report, genetic complementation using Escherichia coli mutant strains deficient in APS kinase and PAPS reductase was used to define the M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis CysH enzymes as APS reductases. Consequently, the sulfate assimilation pathway of M. tuberculosis proceeds from sulfate through APS, which is acted on by APS reductase in the first committed step toward cysteine and methionine. Thus, M. tuberculosis most likely produces PAPS for the sole use of this organism's sulfotransferases. Deletion of CysH from M. smegmatis afforded a cysteine and methionine auxotroph consistent with a metabolic branch point centered on APS. In addition, we have redefined the substrate specificity of the B. subtilis CysH, formerly designated a PAPS reductase, as an APS reductase, based on its ability to complement a mutant E. coli strain deficient in APS kinase. Together, these studies show that two conserved sequence motifs, CCXXRKXXPL and SXGCXXCT, found in the C termini of all APS reductases, but not in PAPS reductases, may be used to predict the substrate specificity of these enzymes. A functional domain of the M. tuberculosis CysC protein was cloned and expressed in E. coli, confirming the ability of this organism to make PAPS. The expression of recombinant M. tuberculosis APS kinase provides a means for the discovery of inhibitors of this enzyme and thus of the biosynthesis of SL-1."

This was not because of an effect of PI3K on phospholipase 2 activity. PI3K inhibition resulted in an increase in cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) protein, mRNA, and mRNA stability.

They play a central role in the response to Gram-negative bacteria in the lung. Endotoxin (LPS)1 is the principle activating component of the Gram-negative cell wall and is a major activator of these macrophages. After initial exposure to LPS, expression of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase 2 (COX2) and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) appears at 12 to 24 h after stimulation (1Monick M. Glazier J.

It is the rate-limiting step in the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostanoid products. Arachidonic acid is a 20-carbon unsaturated fatty acid that is hydrolyzed from membrane-bound phospholipids by the actions of phospholipases (PLA) (secretory PLA2 and cytosolic PLA2). Both COX1 and -2 catalyze the same step in the arachidonic acid pathway (a cyclooxygenase reaction in which arachidonic acid is converted to PGG2 and a peroxidase reaction in which PGG2 is reduced to PGH2) (2Smith W.L.

It is the only cyclooxygenase present in platelets and has been linked to platelet production of thromboxane A2. In contrast, COX2 is induced by inflammatory mediators and has been linked to inflammation, fever, pain, and a number of cancers (6Tilley S.L. Coffman T.M. Koller B.H. J. Clin.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a heterodimeric dual function lipid and protein kinase that has been linked to cell survival, transcription factor activation, and multiple signaling pathways (10Toker A.

Class 1A PI3Ks (found in alveolar macrophages) consist of a p85-kDa subunit protein (α and β) and a p110-kDa catalytic subunit (α, β, and δ) or a p101-kDa regulatory unit and a p110-kDa catalytic unit (γ). The p85 regulatory unit is activated via interaction of the SH2 domain with YXXM motifs of multiple receptors. The p101 regulatory unit is activated by γβ subunits of G proteins downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (10Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Once activated PI3K catalyzes the transfer of ATP to thed-3 position of the inositol ring of membrane-localized phosphoinositides. This results in the production of a number of bioactive lipid species including PI3P, PI3,4P, and PI3,4,5P. Both PI3,4P and PI3,4,5P are absent in most unstimulated cells and increase dramatically following PI3K activation. The presence of PI3,4,5P results in the membrane recruitment of proteins containing pleckstrin homology domains. This includes PI3K-dependent kinase (PDK-1), which phosphorylates a number of biologically important substrates (Akt, protein kinase A, and multiple protein kinase C isoforms) (13Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that LPS activates Akt via activation of PI3K in alveolar macrophages (14Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Flaherty D.M. Peterson M.W. Hunninghake G.W. J.

Activation of Akt is linked to NFκB translocation and transactivation, endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation, and inhibition of a number of substrates positively involved in apoptosis. The apoptosis-related factors that are inhibited by Akt include glycogen synthase kinase 3, forkhead transcription factors, Bad, and caspase 9 (17Ivanov V.N. Krasilnikov M. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4932-4944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibition results in increased signaling from a number of transcription factors, β catenin, nuclear factor of activated T-cells, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, GATA 4, and some of the activator protein 1 proteins (18Piwien-Pilipuk G.

Activation of PI3K is therefore linked to multiple biological effects. One possible role of PI3K activity is as a modulator of MAP kinase signaling. Akt, in some conditions, has been shown to negatively regulate c-Raf (part of the ERK pathway in some cells) (19Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann S. Nunez L. Rossman R. Reid K. Moelling K.

The MAP kinases are a family of evolutionarily conserved enzymes that connect cell surface receptors to regulatory targets that include both cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. The three major MAP kinase families are the ERK (1 and 2), p38 (α, β, γ, and δ), and the JNK (1, 2, and 3) (22Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2833) Google Scholar). LPS exposure leads to the activation of all three MAP kinase pathways (ERK, p38, and JNK) (23Carter A.B. Monick M.M.

Lack of PI3K activity increased the stability of COX2 mRNA, and this increased stability correlated with increased PGE2 release. We found PI3K activity to be correlated inversely with LPS-induced p38 activity. Inhibition of PI3K resulted in increased p38 activity. These studies suggest that constitutive and LPS-induced PI3K activity in alveolar macrophages delays and decreases the production of COX2 and release of PGE2. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma andCalbiochem. Protease inhibitors were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. LPS was obtained from LIST Biologicals, Campbell, CA, and LY294002 was from Calbiochem. IL-13 was from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. Nitrocellulose and ECL Plus were obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. Antibodies were obtained from various sources; antibodies to ERK, p38, MKK3, and MAPKAP2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Antibody to COX1 and COX2 was obtained from Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI. Phosphorylation-specific antibodies to ERK and p38 were obtained from Sigma, and all other phosphorylation-specific antibodies were from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA. Alveolar macrophages were obtained from normal non-smoking volunteers, as described previously (32Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol.

Briefly, normal volunteers with a lifetime non-smoking history, no acute or chronic illness, and no current medications underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. The cell pellet was washed twice in Hanks’ balanced salt solution without Ca2+and Mg2+ and suspended in complete medium, RPMI tissue culture medium (Invitrogen) with 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (a gift from Peter Tobias, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and added to gentamycin (80 μg/ml). Differential cell counts were determined using a Wright- Giemsa-stained cytocentrifuge preparation. All cell preparations had between 90–100% alveolar macrophages. This study was approved by the Committee for Investigations Involving Human Subjects at the University of Iowa. Alveolar macrophages were cultured in complete medium at 1–5 × 106 cells per ml depending on the experiment. Most cultures were done in 1.8-ml microfuge tubes at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Inhibitors (LY294002 at 10 μm or SB202190 at 10 μm) were added 30 min before LPS (100 ng/ml). Whole cell protein was obtained by lysing the cells on ice for 20 min in 500 μl of lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 protease minitab (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)/10 ml, and 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture (catalog number 524625;Calbiochem). The lysates were then sonicated for 20 s and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Protein determinations were made using a protein measurement kit from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Western analysis for the presence of particular proteins or for phosphorylated forms of proteins was performed as described previously (33Thomas K.W. Monick M.M. Staber J.M. Yarovinsky T. Carter A.B.

Cell proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose with a Bio-Rad semi-dry transfer system, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Equal loading of the protein groups on the blots was evaluated using Ponceau S, a staining solution designed for staining proteins on nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose was then blocked with 5% milk in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with the primary antibody at dilutions of 1:500 to 1:2000 overnight. The blots were washed four times with TTBS and incubated for 1 h with horseradish-peroxidase conjugated anti-IgG antibody (1:5000 to 1:20,000). Immunoreactive bands were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate, ECL Plus (AmershamBiosciences). An autoradiograph was obtained, with exposure times of 10 s to 2 min. Alveolar macrophages were cultured in standard medium for 24 or 48 h with and without LPS (100 ng/ml) or LY294002 or both. In some experiments, IL-13 (10 ng/ml) was added 30 min before the LPS. After the culture period, the supernatants were harvested and stored at −70o until they were assayed. The amount of PGE2 in the supernatant was measured by ELISA. (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was isolated using the Absolutely RNA RT-PCR miniprep kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was quantitated using a RiboGreen kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). RNA samples were stored at −70 °C. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a RETROscript RT-PCR kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The resulting cDNA was subjected to PCR in a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ system as follows: in a 0.2-ml PCR tube (Bio-Rad), 2 μl of cDNA was added to 48 μl of PCR reaction mixture containing 2 mm each dNTP (Invitrogen), 3.0 mmMgCl2 (Invitrogen), 1:15,000 SYBR Green I DNA dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), 0.2 μm of each sense and antisense primer (IDT, Coralville, IA), and 2.5 units of PlatinumTaqDNA (Invitrogen). Amplification and data collection was performed as described previously (34Sanlioglu S. Williams C.M. Samavati L. Butler N.S. Wang G. McCray P.B., Jr. Ritchie T.C. Hunninghake G.W. Zandi E.

Primers for human COX2 and HPRT genes are as follows (5′ to 3′): COX2 sense, TCAGCCATACAGCAAATCCTT; COX2 antisense, GTGCACTGTGTTTGGAGTGG; HPRT sense, CCTCATGGACTGATTATGGAC; HPRT antisense, CAGATTCAACTTG- CGCTCATC. Relative quantitative gene expression was calculated as follows. For each sample assayed, the threshold cycles (Ct) for reactions amplifying COX2 and HPRT were determined. The COX2 Ct for each sample was corrected by subtracting the Ct for HPRT (ΔCt). Untreated controls were chosen as the reference samples, and the ΔCt for all LPS-treated experimental samples were subtracted by the ΔCt for the controls samples (ΔΔCt). Finally, LPS-treated COX2 mRNA abundance, relative to control COX2 mRNA abundance, was calculated by the formula 2 − (ΔΔCt). Validity of this approach was confirmed by using serial 10-fold dilutions of template containing COX2 and HPRT genes. Using this set of template mixtures, the amplification efficiencies for COX2 and HPRT amplimers were found to be identical. Statistical analysis was performed on densitometry data, ELISA results, and real-time PCR data. Significance was determined by Student's t test. For these studies, some of the cells were treated with LPS and/or the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. LY294002 is a competitive inhibitor that binds to the ATP-binding site of PI3K (35Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Brown R.F. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Heyworth P.G. Prossnitz E.R., Ye, R.D. Marder P. Schelm J.A. Rothfuss K.J. et al.J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2413-2422PubMed Google Scholar, 36Vlahos C.J.

We have shown that in alveolar macrophages, LY294002 blocks PI3K activation and phosphorylation of Akt (15Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Robeff P.K. Flaherty D.M. Peterson M.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 16Monick M.M. Mallampalli R.K. Carter A.B. Flaherty D.M. McCoy D. Robeff P.K. Peterson M.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5977-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After culture for various periods of time, supernatants were harvested, and PGE2 was measured. LPS stimulation of alveolar macrophages resulted in increased amounts of PGE2. Significant levels of PGE2 first appear around 24 h and continue expanding out to 48 h (Fig.1A). The amounts of PGE2 were increased by inhibition of PI3K activity. At 24 h the increase with PI3K inhibition was 3- to 4-fold (Fig. 1B). At 48 h the increase was 8- to 10-fold. Because we found a significant difference in PGE2 at 24 h, and a 24-h culture period allowed us to avoid the significant viability differences in alveolar macrophages found at 48 h, the remaining experiments were done at 24 h. These data demonstrate that inhibition of the PI3K pathway increases the release of PGE2 after exposure to LPS significantly. The Th2 cytokine, IL-13, is a strong activator of the PI3K pathway (37Ceponis P.J. Botelho F. Richards C.D. McKay D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29132-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 38Wright K. Ward S.G. Kolios G. Westwick J. J. Biol.

First we evaluated the effect of IL-13 on Akt activation in alveolar macrophages. We found that, consistent with the literature, IL-13 activated Akt (Fig.2A). The administration of IL-13 caused a decrease in LPS-induced PGE2 release (∼70%) (Fig.2B). These two pieces of data (LY294002-dependent increases in PGE2 and IL-13-dependent decreases in PGE2) suggest that the PI3K pathway regulates LPS-induced PGE2 production negatively.Figure 2IL-13 activates Akt and inhibits LPS-induced PGE2.A, alveolar macrophages were cultured with IL-13 (10 ng/ml) for various times (1 min to 6 h), whole cell lysates were obtained, and Western analysis was performed for Akt phosphorylation (serine 473) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, alveolar macrophages were cultured with and without LPS (100 ng/ml) and IL-13 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. The supernatant was removed, and PGE2 levels were determined by ELISA. The data represent three separate experiments. **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In alveolar macrophages, Akt activation depends on PI3K activity and can be used as an indicator of active PI3K (15Monick M.M.

Akt activation occurs through phosphorylation of threonine 308 in the activation loop, followed by autophosphorylation of serine 473 in the carboxy-terminal region (39Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). We evaluated phosphorylation of serine 473 as a marker of both PI3K and Akt activity. To determine whether there is high baseline PI3K activity in alveolar macrophages, we obtained cells from four normal volunteers, cultured them for 30 min with LY294002, and obtained whole cell lysates. Examining newly isolated alveolar macrophages, we found significant amounts of phosphorylated Akt at baseline that was decreased by LY294002 incubation (Fig.3). These data, combined with our earlier studies showing increased activation of PI3K after LPS, suggest that alveolar macrophages have a mechanism (PI3K activity) that dampens production of PGE2. Having found significant amounts of baseline and LPS-induced PI3K activity at early time points (5 min to 3 h) (see Fig. 3 and earlier studies (15Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Robeff P.K. Flaherty D.M. Peterson M.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 16Monick M.M. Mallampalli R.K. Carter A.B. Flaherty D.M. McCoy D. Robeff P.K. Peterson M.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5977-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)), we next evaluated long term PI3K activation after exposure to LPS. We found that there was a time-dependent decrease in Akt activation (Fig.4). Akt activation was decreased to below baseline levels by 4 to 6 h after LPS and continued to decrease further out to 24 h. These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of PI3K on PGE2 decreases as cells begin to release PGE2. Inflammation-induced PGE2 production is regulated by the availability of arachidonic acid and by the production of COX2. Arachidonic acid is cleaved from phospholipids by PLA2. This provides a substrate for peroxidase, cyclooxygenase, and PGE synthase activities that lead to the generation of PGE2. The increased PGE2 seen with PI3K inhibition could be because of either increased production of COX2 or increased PLA2 activity. To determine whether the increased PGE2 was because of increased PLA2 activity or activation of the endogenous COX1, we bypassed PLA2 by providing exogenous arachidonic acid. The arachidonic acid was dried, resuspended in media, and added directly to the cultures. Previous studies have shown that arachidonic acid is taken up very quickly (5 min) by macrophages when added in this manner (40Mathur S.N. Field F.J. Spector A.A. Armstrong M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 837: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows that when the cell is provided with free arachidonic acid at early time points there is no difference in the amount of PGE2 produced by endogenous enzymes. This suggests that the LY294002 is not acting on the endogenous COX1. Fig. 5B shows that if the arachidonic acid is provided after the production of LPS-induced COX2 (24 h), there are still demonstrable increases in PGE2 in the LY294002-treated cells. If LY294002 was acting primarily on PLA2, the added arachidonic acid should have eliminated the increase in PGE2 in the LY294002-treated group. The fact that we still see LY294002-induced increases in PGE2 with surplus amounts of arachidonic acid suggests that PI3K inhibition is acting at some point other than the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids. For these studies, alveolar macrophages were treated for 24 h with LPS and LPS with LY294002, whole cell lysates were obtained, and COX2 protein was evaluated by Western analysis. The addition of LY294002 caused an ∼3-fold increase in the amount of COX2 protein after 24 h of LPS (Fig.6A). In addition, we evaluated the effect of LPS and PI3K inhibition on COX1 levels. Fig.6B shows that COX1 levels remain the same in control, Ly294002, LPS, and LPS with LY294002-treated cells. These data, combined with the previous experiment showing no effect of LY294002 on PLA2 activity or on the production of PGE2 by constitutive COX1, suggest that the increase in LPS-induced PGE2 in LY294002-treated cells is dependent on an increase in the production of COX2 protein. Alveolar macrophages were cultured with LPS with and without LY294002 for 6 or 24 h. RNA was isolated, and COX2 mRNA levels were analyzed via real-time RT-PCR. Fig.7 demonstrates that by 6 h after LPS treatment, LY294002 had increased the level of COX2 mRNA. By 24 h, the difference between LPS-treated cells and LPS with LY294002-treated cells had expanded significantly. The increase in COX2 mRNA and protein suggests that PI3K inhibition regulates LPS-induced COX2 production positively. COX2 mRNA stability is regulated at the 3′ untranslated region. The most abundant COX2 mRNA contains an exceptionally long untranslated region (2.5 kb) that contains multiple AUUUA repeats. Interactions at this region modulate the half-life of COX2 mRNA (27Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell.

At 24 h, actinomycin D was added and RNA harvested at 1, 2, and 3 h. Fig. 8Ademonstrates that PI3K inhibition prolongs the half-life of LPS-induced COX2 mRNA. LPS-induced COX2 mRNA has a half-life of ∼2 h. When PI3K activity is suppressed, ∼80% of the COX2 mRNA remains at 3 h, and the mRNA half-life was ∼8 h (data not shown). These data suggest that one mechanism by which PI3K inhibition increases LPS-induced PGE2 production is by extending the half-life of COX2 mRNA. Several studies have identified p38 as an upstream regulator of COX2 message stability (27Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell.

To evaluate the role of p38 in the PI3K inhibition-induced COX2 mRNA stability, we added a p38 inhibitor 1 h before the addition of actinomycin D. The addition of a p38 inhibitor (SB202190) (42Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R.

The p38 inhibitor was not added until 1 h before the actinomycin D, because we wanted to focus on mRNA stability and not p38-driven transcriptional effects. These data suggest that an increase in p38 activity is necessary for much (though not all) of the incr"

Although several mediators of their activation function have been suggested, few mechanisms for the repression or down-regulation of transactivation have been described. In a two-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with AP-2 factors, we have identified the UBC9 gene that encodes the E2 (ubiquitin carrier protein)-conjugating enzyme for the small ubiquitin-like modifier, SUMO. The interaction domain resides in the C-terminal half of AP-2, which contains the conserved DNA binding and dimerization domains. We have detected sumolated forms of endogenous AP-2 in mammalian cells and have further mapped the in vivo sumolation site to conserved lysine 10.

Moser M. Schorle H. Buettner R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 260: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Many proteins have previously been suggested to interact with and coactivate the AP-2 transcription factors, for example the general coactivator PC4 (20Kannan P. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell.

In addition, we have recently reported that two members of the CITED (CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail) family of proteins, CITED2 (22Bamforth S.D. Bragança J. Eloranta J.J. Murdoch J.N. Marques F.I.R. Kranc K.R. Farza H. Henderson D.J. Hurst H.C. Bhattacharya S. Nat.

It is also apparent, however, that AP-2 factors are able to repress expression of certain genes, particularly during cellular differentiation. For example, AP-2α contributes to adipogenesis by silencing expression of the pleiotropic activator C/EBPα during the early stages of adipocyte differentiation (24Jiang M.S. Tang Q.Q. McLenthian J. Geiman D. Shillinglaw W. Henzel W.J. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3467-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this context AP-2 factors might be expected to interact with a different set of cofactors, yet no corepressor proteins or mechanisms of down-regulation of AP-2 activity through a protein-protein interaction or protein modification have been described to date. We aimed to investigate further how the transcriptional activity of AP-2 factors is regulated and how their transcriptional effects are mediated by cofactors and other proteins. To this end we set up a two-hybrid screen with AP-2γ as bait to identify novel AP-2-interacting proteins. Here we describe the isolation of UBC9 as an AP-2 interactor and as a covalent modulator of AP-2 through its activity as the E21SUMO-conjugating enzyme. SUMO peptides are small ubiquitin-related modifiers that become covalently conjugated through an isopeptide linkage to lysine residues in a subset of cellular proteins via a series of enzymatic steps that closely parallels yet is distinct from the process of protein ubiquitination (for review, see Ref. 25Müller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The enzymes involved in SUMO conjugation have been identified in yeast and more recently in mammalian cells (26Desterro J.M Thomson J. Hay R.T.

Sumolation occurs in the nucleus and requires a distinct E1-activating enzyme from that mediating ubiquitination, a SUMO-specific E2-conjugating enzyme, UBC9, that is also involved in substrate recognition, plus, at least in some instances, a substrate-specific E3 ligase. SUMO modification has been shown to have varying consequences on the target proteins, and here we present evidence that sumolation of AP-2 transcription factors down-regulates their transcriptional activation potency. All plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing. Full-length human AP-2α, AP-2β, and AP-2γ cDNA sequences plus the AP-2γ deletion variants (see Fig. 2A) were subcloned into the GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH). The mammalian expression constructs pcDNA3.1-AP2γ and pcDNA3-CITED2 plus the Bluc and 3xAP2-Bluc reporter constructs have been described previously (22Bamforth S.D. Bragança J. Eloranta J.J.

The K10R mutation in AP-2γ was created using the GeneEditor kit (Promega) and, for mammalian transfections, was introduced into pcDNA3.1-AP2γ such that the construct was otherwise identical to the wild-type AP-2γ construct. Full-length coding sequences for human SUMO-1 and UBC9 were obtained by PCR using human Universal QUICK-Clone cDNA (CLONTECH) as the DNA template and subcloned into the yeast two-hybrid GAL4 activation domain fusion vector pGAD424 (CLONTECH) or the mammalian expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene). The C-terminal non-conjugatable SUMO-1 mutant, SUMO-1ΔC, was also created by PCR and identically cloned into pSG5. The UBC93/C93S mutant was obtained from R. T. Hay and introduced into the pSG5 and pGAD424 vectors to create expression constructs otherwise identical to the wild-type UBC9 constructs. The bait plasmid pGBT9-AP-2γ and a human placental oligo-dT-primed GAL4 activation domain fusion library (library vector pACT2, CLONTECH) were transformed into the yeast strain HF7c (CLONTECH) by simultaneous cotransformation using the Alkali-Cation yeast transformation kit (Bio101). Positive clones were isolated and further analyzed as instructed in the CLONTECH Matchmaker manual. To perform quantitative two-hybrid tests between known proteins, two yeast expression plasmids were simultaneously cotransformed into the yeast strain SFY526 (CLONTECH) as above. Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed according to the CLONTECH Matchmaker manual and repeated at least three times, and the average, with the S.D. presented as error bars, is shown. MDA MB 436, MCF7, T47D, and HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 60 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For MDA MB 436 and MCF7 cells the medium was further supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin. All cells were cultured in 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection assays were performed using TransFast transfection reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were transfected on 12-well plates when 60–70% confluent. The amounts of reporter constructs added to cells in each individual transfection were 0.5 μg of 3xAP2-Bluc or Bluc and 0.5 μg tk-renilla (Promega). The total amount of DNA transfected was normalized using the appropriate empty vectors. Cells were harvested after 48 h, and lysates were assayed using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Bio-Orbit 1251 luminometer (Labtech). Firefly luciferase readings were normalized to tk-renilla luciferase values. All the transfection experiments were repeated at least three times; the average, with the S.D. presented as error bars, is shown. The 6E4/4 mouse monoclonal antibody was raised against bacterially produced AP-2 protein and specifically recognizes the C terminus of AP-2γ (to be described elsewhere). Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysis in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40). Where indicated, isopeptidase inhibitors were included at 200 μm iodoacetamide (IAA) and 100 μg/mlN-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Alternatively, cell pellets were directly resuspended in SDS loading buffer at 85 °C and boiled immediately. SDS-PAGE, gel transfers (Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot transfer cell) to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences), and primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed using standard techniques. The chemiluminescent detection of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies was performed using the West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To reprobe for normalization, membranes were stripped in 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 55 °C and then reblocked before incubation with the goat polyclonal Ku-70 antibody (C-19, Santa Cruz). To identify novel proteins that interact with the members of the AP-2 family of developmentally regulated transcription factors, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen. As bait we subcloned the full-length coding sequence for human AP-2γ into the GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion vector pGBT9 and cotransformed it into the yeast strain HF7c together with a placental cDNA library fused N-terminal to the coding sequence of the GAL4 activation domain. The HF7c yeast strain contains two integrated GAL4-dependent reporter genes, HIS3 for metabolic selection and β-galactosidase for color detection. From the 1 × 106 cDNA clones screened, we isolated several positive clones. Upon sequencing the strongest positive clone, isolated twice, we found that it encoded a full-length cDNA for UBC9, the conjugating enzyme for human smallubiquitin-like modifier 1, SUMO-1 (26Desterro J.M Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 30Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T., Pu, R. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Having identified UBC9 as a novel AP-2γ-interacting protein in our two-hybrid screen, we then tested whether this was specific for AP-2γ or whether the AP-2α and AP-2β isoforms were also capable of UBC9 interaction. Yeast two-hybrid liquid β-galactosidase assays showed that UBC9 was indeed capable of interacting with all three of these AP-2 isoforms (Fig. 1). The specificity of these interactions was further confirmed when essentially the same result was obtained on performing the two-hybrid assays in the reciprocal configuration such that AP-2 proteins were expressed as a GAL4 activation domain fusion protein and UBC9 as a GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion protein (data not shown). To map the region in AP-2 responsible for the UBC9 interaction, we created various deletions of the AP-2γ-coding sequence (Fig.2A) and subcloned them into the pGBT9 vector so that the deletion variants were expressed as GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion proteins within yeast cells. Using these deletions in yeast two-hybrid assays, we mapped the UBC9-interacting region in AP-2γ to the C-terminal half encompassing the DNA binding and dimerization domains (ΔN220, Fig. 2B, column B). The C-terminal deletion variant ΔC181 of AP-2γ that contains the proposed transcriptional activation domain alone did not interact with UBC9 (Fig. 2B, column I). The removal of 37 C-terminal amino acids (ΔC413 and ΔN220C413, Fig.2B, columns H and D, respectively) also disrupted this interaction, whereas the form of AP-2γ lacking only the C-terminal 20 amino acids (ΔN220C430, Fig. 2B, column C) was still capable of interacting with UBC9. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays and protein-protein interaction experiments we have shown that the ΔC413 variant is incapable of dimerization, whereas the ΔC430 deletion can dimerize to a similar degree as the wild-type AP-2γ (data not shown). The ΔN220 deletion is still capable of both DNA binding and dimerization and interacts with UBC9 in two-hybrid assays, but further N-terminal deletion to ΔN292 abolishes the UBC9 interaction (Fig. 2B, column E). ΔN292 is analogous to the ΔN278 mutation of AP-2α that can still dimerize but lacks the basic domain and is, hence, defective in DNA binding and acts in a dominant-negative fashion in transfection assays (5Williams T Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data imply that the UBC9 interaction region in AP-2 overlaps with the region necessary for its DNA binding, but the functional interaction interface only forms when two molecules of AP-2 are brought together by dimerization. The DNA binding and dimerization domains of all AP-2 isoforms are very highly conserved; thus, the ability of the three tested AP-2 isoforms to interact with UBC9 is consistent with the interaction region mapping to this conserved region. Above we have described a novel interaction between the AP-2 factors and UBC9. Because UBC9 is known to mediate the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like modifier, SUMO, to target proteins, we examined whether we could detect sumolated forms of AP-2 in cellular extracts. Normally, sumolated forms of proteins escape detection by standard cell lysis techniques, because upon cell disruption endogenous isopeptidases readily cleave all conjugated SUMOs off the target proteins. However, the sumolated forms of proteins can be preserved by including the isopeptidase inhibitors IAA and NEM in the cell lysis buffer. Cell lysates from MCF7 cells, which endogenously express high levels of AP-2γ, were prepared either in the presence or absence of IAA and NEM and subjected to a Western blot probed with an AP-2γ-specific antibody. As expected, we failed to observe the SUMO-conjugated form of AP-2γ when the cells were lysed in the absence of IAA and NEM (Fig. 3, lane 2); however, in their presence we detected a slower migrating, higher molecular weight form of AP-2γ, characteristic of SUMO-modified proteins (Fig. 3, lane 3). This same species was also observed without the addition of inhibitors when cells were lysed directly in hot SDS sample buffer (Fig. 3, lane 4). The actual molecular weight of one SUMO-1 molecule is ∼11.5 kDa, but its conjugation to target proteins typically increases their apparent molecular weight by a few more kilodaltons than this (31Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 32Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar), presumably because SUMO conjugation creates a branched structure in the polypeptide chain that slows down the migration of the sumolated protein on SDS-PAGE. Consistent with this, the size of unmodified AP-2γ is ∼49 kDa, whereas the slower migrating sumolated form runs at ∼65 kDa. It is evident that only a small proportion of the total AP-2 population in cells is sumolated, which is again consistent with other proteins, including the transcription factors p53 (34Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 35Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and c-Jun (36Müller S. Berger M. Lehembre F. Seeler J.-S. Haupt Y. Dejean A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13321-13329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), which are known to be targets for sumolation. We have similarly detected sumolated forms of both AP-2γ and AP-2α in other cell lines, including T47D, which endogenously express AP-2 factors at high levels (data not shown). The consensus site for SUMO conjugation in target proteins has recently been defined as a tetrapeptide ψKxE (where ψ is a hydrophobic residue) that surrounds the acceptor lysine in substrate proteins (37Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Within the primary amino acid sequence of AP-2 isoforms we have identified a stretch of amino acids that fits into this relatively loose consensus sequence. In AP-2γ this sequence is VKYE, surrounding lysine 10. We mutated this suspected target lysine for SUMO conjugation to arginine in AP-2γ to create the mutant K10R. Expression plasmids for either wild-type AP-2γ or the K10R mutant were transfected into the low AP-2-expressing cell line, MDA MB 436, together with SUMO-1 expression plasmids. Whole cell extracts were prepared in the presence of isopeptidase inhibitors (IAA and NEM) from cells transfected with either AP-2γ variant and from control cells transfected with an empty vector and analyzed by Western blotting. The sumolated form of AP-2γ could only be detected when the wild-type but not the K10R mutant was exogenously expressed (Fig. 4, comparelanes 3 and 4). Lysine 10 and its surrounding sequence is conserved between AP-2 isoforms (IKYE in AP-2α and VKYE in AP-2β), further supporting the idea that all three AP-2 isoforms tested here are capable of both UBC9 interaction and subsequent SUMO conjugation. By mutational analysis, it has been demonstrated that isoleucine and valine are favored as the hydrophobic amino acids in the ψ position of the tetrapeptide recognition motif (37Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), thus indicating that the three AP-2 isoforms may be optimal substrates for SUMO conjugation. Essentially all SUMO-1 in mammalian cells is conjugated to target proteins, particularly to the RanGAP1 nuclear pore protein (32Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and the proportion of free SUMO-1 is consequently very small. We, therefore, attempted to exogenously increase the amount of SUMO-1 within cells to test whether this would have an effect on AP-2 activity, as monitored by an AP-2-dependent reporter construct in transient transfection assays. Indeed, when we cotransfected increasing amounts of a SUMO-1 expression plasmid into the low AP-2-expressing MDA MB 436 cells together with an AP-2γ expression plasmid, we could detect a SUMO-1-dependent decrease in AP-2γ-mediated activation of the 3xAP2-Bluc reporter (Fig. 5A). To confirm that the effect was due to SUMO-1-conjugation, we also exogenously overexpressed a mutant of SUMO-1 where we had deleted the two C-terminal glycine residues that are absolutely required to mediate the conjugation of SUMO-1 to target lysine residues. This mutant form of SUMO-1 failed to suppress the transcriptional activation of the AP-2-dependent luciferase reporter construct (Fig.5B). We also transiently overexpressed exogenous SUMO-1 in the T47D cell line that expresses AP-2γ and AP-2α endogenously at high levels. In agreement with our results above, overexpression of SUMO-1 led to a decrease in the activity of the AP-2-dependent luciferase reporter construct (Fig. 5C, columns 1 and 2). This negative effect was mediated by the AP-2 binding sites in the promoter construct, as SUMO-1 overexpression had no effect on the Bluc construct that lacks AP-2 DNA binding sites (Fig.5C, columns 3 and 4). We further examined the effect of sumolation on AP-2 activity using the non-sumolatable AP-2γ mutant K10R in transient transfection assays. Cotransfection into cells together with the AP-2-dependent reporter showed that the mutant was resistant to SUMO-1-mediated transcriptional repression (Fig. 5D). This result functionally confirms that lysine 10 is the most likely site in AP-2 for SUMO-1 conjugation in vivo. We have recently identified the CBP/p300-interacting proteins, CITED2 and CITED4, as novel transcriptional coactivators for AP-2 (22Bamforth S.D. Bragança J. Eloranta J.J. Murdoch J.N. Marques F.I.R. Kranc K.R. Farza H. Henderson D.J. Hurst H.C. Bhattacharya S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 23Bragança J. Swingler T. Marques F.I.R.

We therefore examined whether SUMO-1 can also affect the transcriptional coactivation of AP-2 by CITED2. As shown in Fig. 5E, in transient cotransfection assays overexpression of SUMO-1 can indeed decrease the CITED2-coactivated levels of AP-2-dependent reporter gene expression. In contrast, although the K10R mutant form of AP-2γ remains responsive to CITED2-mediated coactivation, this level of activity cannot be suppressed by SUMO-1 overexpression (Fig.5E). Having established that overexpression of SUMO-1 itself can affect AP-2 transcriptional activity, we next investigated whether AP-2 activity could be modulated by transient overexpression of the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9. Exogenous overexpression of wild-type UBC9 had no effect on AP-2-mediated activation of the 3xAP2-Bluc reporter construct in our transient transfection assays in either the low AP-2-expressing MDA MB 436 cell line (Fig. 6A, columns 1–3) or in the high AP-2-expressing T47D cell line (Fig.6B, columns 1–3). We speculate that the endogenous activity of the UBC9 enzyme may be saturating, thus not readily modulated by transient transfection. We then utilized a sumolation-defective mutant form of UBC9, UBC9/C93S (27Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 45: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In cotransfection experiments this variant led to increased levels of AP-2-dependent transcriptional activation in both MDA MB 436 and T47D cells (Fig. 6, A (columns 1, 5, and 6) and B (columns 1, 4, and 5). Our yeast two-hybrid assays confirmed that, whereas UBC9/C93S is indeed severely compromised in its interaction with SUMO-1 (Fig. 6C, columns 1–3), it does still interact with AP-2 as efficiently as wild-type UBC9 (Fig.6C, columns 4–6). We suggest, therefore, that the overexpressed mutant form of UBC9 can act in a dominant-negative fashion by interacting with AP-2 within cells, thus preventing the access of endogenous UBC9 capable of SUMO-1 conjugation. This would result in a decrease in the proportion of sumolated forms of AP-2 and, hence, increase transcriptional activation by unmodified AP-2. The AP-2 transcription factors are required for normal growth and differentiation during mammalian development and have been linked to the etiology of human breast cancer through their regulation ofERBB2 and estrogen receptor gene expression (3Bosher J.M. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Williams T. Hurst H.C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1701-1707PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gee J.M.W. Robertson J.F.R. Ellis I.O. Nicholson R.I. Hurst H.C. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Bosher J.M. Williams T. Hurst H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 16McPherson L.A. Baichwal V.R. Weigel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4342-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to establish how AP-2 factors mediate their transcriptional effects and how their activity is modulated. We sought to identify proteins that are involved in this process through their interaction with AP-2 factors. Here we have identified a novel interaction partner for AP-2, namely the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9, and examined the functional consequences of such an interaction. By deletion mutation analysis we have mapped the interaction interface with UBC9 to the C-terminal regions of the AP-2γ protein, which is highly conserved between the members of the AP-2 family. It is consistent, therefore, that two other AP-2 isoforms, AP-2α and AP-2β, were also capable of UBC9 interaction. The deletion of the 37 C-terminal amino acids of AP-2γ abolishes both dimerization and UBC9 interaction. On the other hand, when the AP-2γ C terminus is kept intact and, thus, dimerization-competent but the N-terminal deletion is extended to remove the basic region that mediates contacts with DNA, the UBC9 interaction is also lost. We propose a model where UBC9 interacts with the DNA binding, basic domains of AP-2 factors but only does so when the factors are in a dimerized form. The function, activity, stability, or subcellular localization of many proteins can be altered after their synthesis by post-translational covalent modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. The only suggested post-translational modification of the AP-2 transcription factors before this study has been protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation (38Park K. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17811-17819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Garcı́a M.A. Campillos M. Marina A. Valdivieso F. Vázquez J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Having established that the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 interacts with AP-2 factors, we examined whether they could consequently be modified by sumolation. We succeeded in demonstrating that a proportion of endogenous AP-2 does indeed exist in a sumolated form in mammalian cells. We could detect only one major SUMO-conjugated form of AP-2 and have defined lysine 10 near the N terminus of AP-2γ, conserved between AP-2α, -β, and -γ, as the site of sumolation in vivo. We note that the most recent member of the AP-2 family, AP-2δ, does not contain the conserved, sumolatable lysine at position 10 or any other sequences conforming to the sumolation consensus motif, whereas the region of proposed UBC9 interaction remains highly conserved in AP-2δ (4Zhao F. Satoda M. Licht J.D. Hayashizaki Y. Gelb B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40755-40760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Future studies will investigate whether the AP-2δ isoform is refractory to transcriptional suppression by sumolation and whether its activity is in any way modulated by an interaction with UBC9. Interestingly, the site of sumolation in AP-2γ does not overlap or lie adjacent to the UBC9 interaction site, as appears to be the case with many other sumolated proteins (40Sampson D.A. Wang M. Matunis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 41Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). We envisage that the N terminus of AP-2 must fold back toward the more C-terminal UBC9 interaction region to allow UBC9-mediated SUMO-conjugation, but structural studies will be required to clarify the precise spatial dynamics of AP-2 sumolation. We have also attempted to set up a reconstituted assay to sumolate AP-2 in vitro using human recombinant AP-2, SUMO-1, UBC9, and the SAE1 and SAE2 subunits of the SUMO-activating enzyme, but we have only achieved very inefficient sumolation of AP-2 in vitro. 2J. J. Eloranta and H. C. Hurst, unpublished results. It has recently been demonstrated that the enzymatic machinery for sumolation, similar to the ubiquitination system, utilizes the activity of an E3 ligase component of the enzyme cascade for optimal SUMO modification of at least some substrates (42Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2001; 107: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 43Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 44Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). It thus seems conceivable that specific substrates, such as AP-2, require a SUMO ligase activity for efficient modification, although at present the identity of the putative AP-2 E3 ligase remains unknown. We have tested whether PIAS1, the recently identified SUMO E3 ligase for the transcription factor p53 (44Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), has any influence on AP-2-dependent transcription in transfection assays but have failed to see any significant effect.2 By exogenously increasing cellular levels of free SUMO-1 we have shown that AP-2 transcriptional activation can be suppressed. SUMO-mediated transcriptional suppression is also effective on CITED2-coactivated AP-2-mediated transcription. Invertebrates only have a single SUMO gene, whereas three members of the SUMO family have been described in vertebrates, SUMO-1 and the close homologues SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 (45Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). All three SUMO species share the same conjugation machinery, and the UBC9-conjugating enzyme appears to show no preference between them (46Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M.P. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether the functional consequences of SUMO-2/3 conjugation differ from those of SUMO-1 conjugation. We have investigated whether, similar to SUMO-1, exogenous overexpression of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 can also have a suppressive effect on AP-2-activated transcription. Indeed, both SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 appeared capable of suppressing AP-2 activity to a similar degree as SUMO-1 in transient transfection assays2; thus, for AP-2, the functional consequences of SUMO-1 conjugation seem similar to those of SUMO-2 and -3. However, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 have been shown to be able to form polymeric chains (46Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M.P. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), and because we have not detected a range of slower migrating forms of AP-2 indicating its multi-sumolation, this may imply that AP-2 is primarily conjugated with SUMO-1 in vivo. Modulating the levels of wild-type UBC9 within cells showed no effect on AP-2-dependent transcription, and we speculate that the endogenous levels of UBC9 are not limiting in the cell lines used in this study. Interestingly, when the UBC9 mutant C93S is exogenously overexpressed in mammalian cells, the AP-2-dependent levels of reporter gene activity were elevated. This mutant lacks conjugation activity because cysteine 93, which is required to form a thioester linkage with SUMO peptides before their transfer to target lysines, has been replaced with serine. Because the C93S mutant is still able to associate efficiently with AP-2, the observed transcriptional enhancement is likely to be a consequence of decreased AP-2 sumolation by endogenous wild-type UBC9. Covalent modification of cellular proteins by SUMO regulates various cellular processes such as nuclear transport and cell cycle progression (for review, see Ref. 25Müller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Unlike ubiquitination, SUMO conjugation of proteins does not target them for proteasome-mediated degradation. Sumolation of transcription factors has been shown to have a range of differing effects on their activity. For example, sumolation of the tumor suppressor p53 (34Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V.

We have shown that AP-2 belongs to the latter group of SUMO-modified transcription factors, where sumolation has a negative effect on transcriptional potency. The mechanism of this effect is at present uncertain; however, our transfection assay results collectively point to SUMO modification down-regulating AP-2 transcription activation activity rather than it leading to the factors becoming transcriptional repressors. Thus, it is more likely that sumolation leads to a weakening or an abolition of the interactions between AP-2 and transcriptional coactivators than to an enhanced interaction with transcriptional corepressors. Because sumolation is known to alter the subcellular localization of many target proteins, such as RanGAP1 (31Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J.

Future studies will investigate these possibilities. In summary, this study represents the first description of a mechanism for down-regulation of the activity of the AP-2 family of transcription factors through a protein-protein interaction and subsequent post-translational modification.

In this report, we describe the identification of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Seven in Absentia homologue-1 (SIAH1), as a TIEG1-interacting protein. We show that TIEG1 and SIAH1 interact through an amino-terminal domain of TIEG1. Co-expression of SIAH1 results in proteasomal degradation of TIEG1 but not of the related factor TIEG2. Importantly, co-expression of SIAH1 completely reverses repression of Smad7 promoter activity by TIEG1. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant negative SIAH1 stabilizes TIEG1 and synergizes with TIEG1 to enhance TGFβ/Smad-dependent transcriptional activation. These findings suggest a novel mechanism whereby the ability of TGFβ to modulate gene transcription may be regulated by proteasomal degradation of the downstream effector TIEG1 through the SIAH pathway. In this manner, turnover of TIEG1 may serve to limit the duration and/or magnitude of TGFβ responses.

The carboxyl-terminal three zinc finger DNA binding domain allows TIEG1 to directly associate with GC-rich sequences of DNA in target gene promoters (3Yajima S. Lammers C.H. Lee S.H. Hara Y.

However, outside of the DNA binding domain, TIEG1 and TIEG2 bear little sequence homology.

Further support for this role arose from our studies demonstrating a decrease in TIEG1 protein levels that coincides with the increasing stages of cancer in breast tumor biopsies (13Subramaniam M.

TGFβ is a pleiotropic cytokine known to regulate many cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration whereas BMPs have been shown to play critical roles in development and bone formation. TGFβ or BMP binding to its cognate transmembrane type II receptor initiates formation and activation of a heteromeric complex with the corresponding type I receptor (14Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 105-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the type I receptor initiates intracellular signaling by phosphorylation of the receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad) proteins. Smad2 and -3 function in TGFβ signaling, whereas Smad1, -5, and -8 function in BMP signaling (15Miyazono K.

Phosphorylated R-Smads complex with the common mediator Smad4, translocate to the nucleus, and modulate target gene transcription. Negative regulation of the Smad pathway occurs through the inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and -7. Smad7 blocks both TGFβ and BMP signaling by binding to the type I receptor and preventing phosphorylation of the R-Smads as well as increasing turnover of the receptor (17Hayashi H. Abdollah S.

TIEG1 was recently shown to play a unique role in TGFβ/Smad signaling by down-regulating negative feedback through Smad7. By repressingSmad7 gene transcription, TIEG1 is able to enhance transcription of important TGFβ-regulated genes such as the cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor p21and the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (5Johnsen S.A. Subramaniam M. Janknecht R. Spelsberg T.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5783-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We have also observed that TIEG1 is able to repress Smad6promoter activity and may therefore serve an important role in BMP signaling as well. 2S. A. Johnsen, M. Subramaniam, and T. C. Spelsberg, unpublished data.2S. A. Johnsen, M. Subramaniam, and T. C. Spelsberg, unpublished data. Regulation of protein stability through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is now being recognized as a major mechanism of regulating a diverse array of cellular processes (23Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is carried out in a three-step process requiring three different proteins referred to as E1, E2, and E3 (23Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) undergoes a covalent intermediate in which the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin forms a high energy thioester bond in an ATP-dependent process with an active cysteine residue in the E1 molecule. Another thioester intermediate is formed when ubiquitin is transferred from E1 to the E2 protein, also referred to as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Specificity of substrate recognition is provided by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, which facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin to the target protein (23Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). The Seven in Absentia (Sina) protein was identified in a screen for mutants defective in the development of the R7 photoreceptor cell inDrosophila melanogaster (24Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 561-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown to function in signaling downstream of the receptor tyrosine kinase Sevenless by targeting a transcriptional repressor, Tramtrack, for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (25Tang A.H. Neufeld T.P. Kwan E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Degradation of Tramtrack will then result in derepression of target genes such as the pair-rule genes even-skipped and fushi tarazu(26Read D. Levine M. Manley J.L. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The human homologues of Sina, SIAH1 and SIAH2, are able to target both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins for proteasomal degradation (27Hu G. Zhang S. Vidal M. Baer J.L., Xu, T. Fearon E.R.

We demonstrate that the stability of TIEG1 protein is regulated by interaction with the human homologue of Seven in Absentia, SIAH1. Thus we propose a pathway in mammalian cells that closely parallels theDrosophila pathway in which degradation of a transcriptional repressor (Tramtrack or TIEG1) by a ubiquitin ligase (Sina or SIAH) results in derepression of genes encoding important cellular proteins (even-skipped or Smad7). This novel interaction suggests a role for the regulation of TIEG1 protein stability in modulating the activity of the TGFβ signal transduction pathway. The bait plasmid was constructed by cloning the region containing amino acids 1–350 of TIEG1 (1Subramaniam M. Harris S.A. Oursler M.J. Rasmussen K. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) into pAS2–1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by PCR. This plasmid was transformed into the MATa yeast strain AH109 using the Yeastmaker Transformation System (CLONTECH). The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using a pretransformed skeletal muscle library (CLONTECH) and interacting clones identified by the ability to grow on minimal SD agar medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine (CLONTECH). Prey plasmids were recovered and retransformed into AH109 with the bait or the GAL4 DNA binding domain alone to verify interactions by β-galactosidase filter lift assays. The identity of interacting clones was determined by DNA sequencing. The amino-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged TIEG1 and TIEG2 expression vectors were constructed by amplifying the respective open reading frames by PCR with primers that addEcoRI and BamHI or EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The resulting fragment was cloned into pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) behind a FLAG epitope tag. The Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-CMV) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The SIAH1 expression vector was constructed by cloning the entireSIAH1 coding region into pcDNA4/TO. FLAG-tagged dominant negative SIAH1 (dn-SIAH1), which contains a cysteine to serine mutation at residue 72, was constructed by PCR and cloned into pcDNA4/TO. Sequence integrity was verified by DNA sequencing. GST fusion proteins were generated by cloning portions of TIEG1 into pGEX-2T-6His-PL2. Fusion proteins were purified as previously described (34Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant35S-labeled SIAH1 was produced from pGBK-T7-SIAH1 using thetntin vitro transcription and translation system (Promega). GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with35S-labeled SIAH1 at 4 °C for 2 h in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 with gentle mixing. The mixtures were then centrifuged, and pellets were washed extensively in the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE using precast 10% (w/v) Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Radiolabeled SIAH1 was visualized using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). C2C12 mouse myoblast cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (1:1) (Sigma) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Bio Whittaker, Walkersville, MD) and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded in 12-well or 4-cm plates and transfected at 50% confluence with various combinations of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. All transfections included a plasmid containing Renilla luciferase driven from the cytomegalovirus promoter (pRL-CMV) as an internal transfection control. Cell extracts were harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) containing 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 500 μm sodium orthovanadate. Protein was separated on a SDS-10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). TIEG1 protein was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody, TIEG-228, raised to a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 133–154 of the human TIEG1 protein. Actin and FLAG epitope-tagged proteins were detected with anti-actin AC-40 and anti-FLAG M2 antibodies, respectively (Sigma). Primary antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Sigma). Cell extracts were harvested 48 h after transfection using 300 μl of passive lysis buffer. Luciferase assays were performed using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), and samples were read on a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer. To correct for differences in transfection efficiency, firefly luciferase units were normalized relative toRenilla luciferase units of the same sample. Corrected luciferase values were then expressed as a ratio (-fold induction) relative to the vector control transfected cells. To identify proteins that interact with TIEG1, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system. Because TIEG1 is a member of the Krüppel-like factor family of three zinc finger transcription factors, which bear a high degree of homology to one another in the carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain, we excluded this domain by utilizing a bait construct containing only the first 350 amino acids of TIEG1 (Fig.1A) to screen a skeletal muscle library. This region contains several potential SH3 binding domains as well as three distinct repression domains (1Subramaniam M. Harris S.A. Oursler M.J. Rasmussen K. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 7Cook T. Gebelein B. Belal M. Mesa K. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29500-29504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Four positive clones, which grew on selective media and were positive for β-galactosidase expression, were identified from 1.6 × 106 clones that were screened. All four clones contained inserts identified as the human homologues of the D. melanogaster seven in absentia gene. Three of the clones contained seven in absentia homologue (SIAH)-2 whereas the other contained SIAH1. SIAH1 and SIAH2 share 87% amino acid identity to one another and 76 and 68% to Sina, respectively (35Hu G. Chung Y.L. Glover T. Valentine V. Look A.T. Fearon E.R. Genomics. 1997; 46: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because these two proteins appear to be functionally redundant and similarly recognize substrate proteins (27Hu G. Zhang S. Vidal M. Baer J.L., Xu, T. Fearon E.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2701-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and because SIAH1 has been more thoroughly characterized, we focused primarily upon the interaction between TIEG1 and SIAH1. As shown by growth on selective medium, both full-length TIEG1 as well as TIEG11–350specifically interact with SIAH1, whereas TIEG1 did not do so with a control protein, the estrogen receptor-α (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, as previously reported, SIAH1 also interacts with itself (25Tang A.H. Neufeld T.P. Kwan E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 36Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, using in vitro binding assays TIEG1 appears to interact with SIAH1 through the amino-terminal 210 amino acids because all three constructs containing this region (TIEG11–480, TIEG11–350, and TIEG11–210) were able to pull SIAH1 down. However, a stronger interaction between TIEG1 and SIAH1 is observed when the entire amino-terminal domain remains intact (TIEG11–350; Fig. 1C). This suggests that some aspect of the TIEG1 tertiary structure is necessary for optimal interaction between TIEG1 and SIAH1 or that amino acids 211–350 augment binding. Based on previous data showing that both Sina and SIAH1 function as E3 ubiquitin ligases and target certain proteins for proteasomal degradation, we hypothesized that the interaction with SIAH1 may increase turnover of TIEG1 protein levels. Indeed, when a SIAH1 expression vector was co-transfected into C2C12 cells with a TIEG1 expression vector, a dramatic decrease in TIEG1 protein levels was observed. In fact, only small amounts of SIAH1 expression vector (75 ng) were necessary to decrease TIEG1 protein to undetectable levels, and even a very small amount (5 ng) had a visible effect (Fig.2A). As a control, actin protein levels were unaffected. Thus the effect of SIAH1 expression on TIEG1 protein levels is considerably more dramatic than that observed for other SIAH1 target proteins such as β-catenin, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), and synaptophysin, in which there is only a partial decrease in protein levels even with high amounts of SIAH1 expression (27Hu G. Zhang S. Vidal M. Baer J.L., Xu, T. Fearon E.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2701-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 32Wheeler T.C. Chin L.S., Li, Y. Roudabush F.L. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10273-10282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 37Liu J. Stevens J. Rote C.A. Yost H.J., Hu, Y. Neufeld K.L. White R.L. Matsunami N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 927-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of a dominant negative SIAH1 (dn-SIAH1), in which the RING finger structure required for E3 ligase activity has been obstructed, appears to stabilize TIEG1 protein levels (Fig. 2A). In addition, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 completely blocks the decrease in TIEG1 protein levels upon SIAH1 co-expression, suggesting that the decrease in TIEG1 protein levels is proteasome-dependent (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, degradation of TIEG1 by SIAH1 is specific because SIAH1 has no effect on TIEG2 protein levels (Fig. 2B). Regulation of gene expression through targeted degradation of important transcription factors is a common theme in transcriptional control. For example, the protein levels and activities of p53, β-catenin, and NFκB are all regulated by targeted degradation of specific proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (38Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar, 39Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M.

Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar). Therefore, based on the observation that SIAH1 targets TIEG1 for proteasomal degradation, we reasoned that SIAH1 may also influence the regulation of TIEG1 target genes. Simply stated, increased SIAH1 activity might decrease TIEG levels and reverse any TIEG protein effects on gene expression, whereas inhibition of SIAH1 activity may enhance these effects. Although we recently demonstrated that TIEG1 represses Smad7 expression by binding to a GC-rich sequence in the proximal Smad7 promoter (5Johnsen S.A. Subramaniam M. Janknecht R. Spelsberg T.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5783-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we now find that overexpression of SIAH1 by itself has very little effect onSmad7 promoter activity (Fig.3A). This observation may be explained by the fact that, in the absence of growth factor treatment, TIEG1 is expressed at levels too low for significant biological activity (1Subramaniam M. Harris S.A. Oursler M.J. Rasmussen K. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2Hefferan T.E. Subramaniam M. Khosla S. Riggs B.L.

Thus a subsequent reduction of TIEG protein levels by SIAH1 would be predicted to have no observable effect on the regulation of TIEG target genes, whereas an increase in endogenous TIEG protein levels, either through the inhibition of SIAH activity or overexpression of TIEG, should have a noticeable effect. Indeed, overexpression of dn-SIAH1 or TIEG1 alone decreases Smad7promoter activity (Fig. 3A). The effect of SIAH1 is more evident when TIEG1 is co-expressed. As shown in Fig. 3B, TIEG1 dramatically repressesSmad7 promoter activity. However, co-expression of SIAH1 restores normal promoter activity. The reversal of Smad7repression by SIAH1 is also specific for TIEG1 because TIEG2 also represses Smad7 promoter activity (Fig. 3B), but SIAH1 does not abrogate this repression. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an important role in regulating TGFβ signal transduction through the Smad proteins. Most notably, activation of the TGFβ/Smad pathway stimulates an interaction between Smad2 and the Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor-2 (Smurf-2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and results in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Smad2 (42Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36818-36822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 43Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Similarly, Smad3 is degraded through interaction with another ubiquitin ligase complex, the anaphase promoting complex, following ligand stimulation (44Fukuchi M. Imamura T. Chiba T. Ebisawa T. Kawabata M. Tanaka K. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1431-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In cancer cells, expression of oncogenic Ras or the presence of specific destabilizing mutations promotes ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent turnover of Smad4, rendering cells insensitive to the effects of TGFβ (45Saha D. Datta P.K. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29531-29537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 46Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43175-43181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an important role in regulating the TGFβ/Smad pathway. Because repression of Smad7 promoter activity by TIEG1 enhances TGFβ/Smad signaling by relieving negative feedback imposed by Smad7, it is likely that modulation of TIEG1 protein levels would also have an effect on the entire Smad pathway. Therefore we hypothesized that SIAH1 or dn-SIAH1 overexpression may influence Smad signaling by regulating TIEG1 stability. This was tested using a TGFβ-responsive reporter construct (CAGA12-MLP-Luc) and a constitutively active type I TGFβ receptor (ALK5TD) along with co-expression of TIEG1 and SIAH1 or dn-SIAH1. As shown in Fig. 4 and similar to the effects observed with the Smad7 promoter, expression of wild-type SIAH1 has virtually no effect on CAGA12-MLP-Luc reporter induction by itself and slightly reverses the enhancement observed with TIEG1 co-expression. However, dn-SIAH1 overexpression enhances TGFβ/Smad signaling to a similar degree as TIEG1 overexpression by increasing ALK5TD- induced transcription ∼2-fold compared with vector transfected cells. Interestingly, co-expression of dn-SIAH1 and TIEG1 appears to synergistically enhance CAGA12-MLP induction to about 5.5-fold compared with vector transfected cells. This effect is probably because of stabilization of TIEG1 protein. These data suggest that activation of the TGFβ/Smad pathway may be regulated through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway at an additional level by the regulation of the stability of the TGFβ-inducible early protein through SIAH1. By controlling TIEG1 protein levels a cell has an additional mechanism to control the amplitude or duration of TGFβ signaling. This also provides a mechanism that cancer cells may employ to evade cell cycle regulation by TGFβ. Mutations in the TGFβ pathway have been observed in certain types of cancer including pancreatic and colorectal cancers (48Akhurst R.J. Derynck R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11 (suppl.): 44-51Google Scholar). Most of these mutations result in a complete blockage of TGFβ signaling through the Smad pathway and are believed to relieve the cancer cells from the growth inhibitory effects of TGFβ. However, in many cases there appears to be subtle perturbations in the activity of TGFβ signaling that are not because of mutations in the known signaling components (48Akhurst R.J. Derynck R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11 (suppl.): 44-51Google Scholar). The effects of these subtle changes often increase the aggressiveness and/or metastatic potential of a tumor. Interestingly a decrease in TIEG1 protein levels correlates with the histological stage of breast cancer (13Subramaniam M. Hefferan T.E. Tau K. Peus D. Pittelkow M. Jalal S. Riggs B.L. Roche P. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unknown whether the mRNA levels also correlate. It is possible that the decrease in TIEG1 protein levels may be because of post-translational regulation of TIEG1 protein levels, possibly by the SIAH proteins or another, as yet, unidentified ubiquitin ligase. Investigations into the expression of the SIAH proteins and the regulation of the SIAH genes may provide insights into the regulation of the TGFβ/Smad signaling pathway and may hint at a new area of exploration in cancer research.

https://openalex.org/W1991990669,"Many naturally occurring and engineered mutations lead to constitutive activation of the G protein-coupled lutropin receptor (LHR), some of which also result in reduced ligand responsiveness. To elucidate the nature of interhelical interactions in this heptahelical receptor and changes thereof accompanying activation, we have utilized site-directed mutagenesis on transmembrane helices 6 and 7 of rat LHR to prepare and characterize a number of single, double, and triple mutants. The potent constitutively activating mutants, D556(6.44)H and D556(6.44)Q, were combined with weaker activating mutants, N593(7.45)R and N597(7.49)Q, and the loss-of-responsiveness mutant, N593(7.45)A. The engineered mutants have also been simulated using a new receptor model based on the crystal structure of rhodopsin. The results suggest that constitutive LHR activation by mutations at Asp-556(6.44) is triggered by the breakage or weakening of the interaction found in the wild type receptor between Asp-556(6.44) and Asn-593(7.45). Whereas this perturbation is unique to the activating mutations at Asp-556(6.44), common features to all of the most active LHR mutants are the breakage of the charge-reinforced H-bonding interaction between Arg-442(3.50) and Asp-542(6.30) and the increase in solvent accessibility of the cytosolic extensions of helices 3 and 6, which probably participate in the receptor-G protein interface. Asn-593(7.45) and Asn-597(7.49) also seem to be necessary for the high constitutive activities of D556(6.44)H and D556(6.44)Q and for full ligand responsiveness. The new theoretical model provides a foundation for further experimental work on the molecular mechanism(s) of receptor activation."

In the present study, we determined whether the expression of these two proteases in human breast fibroblasts was modulated by interactions with the extracellular matrix component, collagen I. Breast fibroblasts were isolated from non-malignant breast tissue as well as from tissue surrounding malignant human breast tumors. Growth of these fibroblasts on collagen I gels affected cell morphology, but not the intracellular localization of vesicles staining for cathepsin B or D. Cathepsins B and D levels (mRNA or intracellular protein) were not affected in fibroblasts growing on collagen I gels or plastic, nor was cathepsin D secreted from these cells. In contrast, protein expression and secretion of cathepsin B, primarily procathepsin B, was induced by growth on collagen I gels. The induced secretion appeared to be mediated by integrins binding to collagen I, as inhibitory antibodies against α1, α2, and β1 integrin subunits prevented procathepsin B secretion from fibroblasts grown on collagen. In addition, procathepsin B secretion was induced when cells were plated on β1 integrin antibodies. To our knowledge, this is the first examination of cathepsin B and D expression and localization in human breast fibroblasts and their regulation by a matrix protein.

In breast carcinoma an inverse correlation between staining for cathepsin D and basement membrane has been observed (14Visscher D.W. Sarkar F.H. Sakr W. Crissman J. Pathol. Res.

Extracellular matrix is not only a substrate for proteases, but also plays a role in regulating their expression. For example, growth of epithelial cells, tumor cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages on vitronectin, fibronectin, laminin, or collagen I increased expression and/or activation of the serine protease urokinase plasminogen activator and of MMPs (18Mauch C. Adelmann-Grill B. Hatamochi A. Krieg T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Khan K.M. Falcone D.J. J. Biol.

This increase in expression may be mediated through integrins, as ligation of integrins with collagen I increases the expression of collagenase-1 (MMP-1) and -3 (MMP-13) (18Mauch C. Adelmann-Grill B.

Interestingly, fibroblasts surrounding malignant breast tumors exhibit an increased expression of MMP-13 and stromelysin-3 (MMP-11) (23Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M.

We have shown that cathepsin B expression is increased in breast tumor-associated stromal cells as well as in the tumor cells themselves (25Castiglioni T. Merino M.J. Elsner B. Lah T.T. Sloane B.F.

The ability of extracellular matrix components to mediate expression of cysteine and aspartic proteases has not yet been examined. We hypothesize that interactions of breast cancer and stromal cells with extracellular matrices can modulate expression of cathepsins B and D and thereby modulate the contribution of these enzymes to degradative activities of human breast cancer. Expression of both enzymes has been assessed in breast tumor cells and lymphocytic cells (25Castiglioni T. Merino M.J. Elsner B. Lah T.T. Sloane B.F. Emmert-Buck M.R. Hum.

Stromal fibroblasts are a cell type that contribute extensively to the serine protease and MMP activities in tumors (23Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L.

Therefore, we have determined the expression of cathepsins B and D in both fibroblasts from tissue surrounding malignant human breast tumors and those from tissues obtained from reduction mammoplasties (non-cancerous). The fibroblasts were compared for the ability of type I collagen, their normal matrix, to alter the expression of cathepsins B and D. Overall protein expression of cathepsin B was increased, an effect mediated through interaction of α1β1 and α2β1 integrins with collagen I. In contrast, expression of cathepsin D was not affected. This differential induction of the two proteases may indicate that they play distinct roles in human breast pathophysiologies.

CA-O74 was a kind gift from Dr. Nobuhiko Katunuma (Tokushima Bunri University, Tokushima, Japan). Human breast fibroblasts (a kind gift from Drs. Rafael Fridman and Robert Pauley, Wayne State University and Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI) were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium enriched with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 5 mm HEPES. The isolation and characterization of these fibroblasts has been described elsewhere (29Pauley R.J. Santner S.J. Tait L.R. Bright R.K. Santen R.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Briefly, fibroblasts were obtained from three groups of patients: 1) fibroblasts surrounding malignant human breast tumors (9T, 10T, 11T, and 12T); 2) those from benign tissues at a grossly non-malignant site as distant as possible from the tumor (11B and 12B); and 3) those from reduction mammoplasty tissues from patients without cancer (14RM, 31RM, and 33RM). The human breast fibroblasts were infected at passages 5–7 with the LXSN16E6E7 recombinant retrovirus encoding the human papilloma virus serotype 16 E6 and E7 transforming proteins (30Bright R.K. Vocke C.D. Emmert-Buck M.R. Duray P.H. Solomon D. Fetsch P. Rhim J.S. Linehan W.M. Topalian S.L.

The human breast fibroblasts were grown on either uncoated or Vitrogen-100 bovine collagen (type I)-coated tissue culture plates. The latter were prepared by mixing, on ice, eight volumes of collagen I (2.9 mg/ml), pH 2.5, with 1 volume of 0.2m Na2HPO4, 1.3 m NaCl, pH 7.4, followed by one volume of 0.1 m NaOH. Neutralized collagen was added at 1 ml/well to a six-well plate resulting in a collagen concentration of 0.25 mg/cm2. The formation of gels was initiated by incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. The human breast fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 3.0 × 105 or 1.5 × 105 cells/well and grown for either 1 or 3 days. All human breast fibroblast cell lines, including fibroblast lines that were not infected with the papilloma virus, were grown for 12 or 60 h on uncoated or collagen I-coated plates and then serum-starved for 12 h. After the 12-h serum starvation, the cells (∼80% confluent) were harvested using 0.1% collagenase at 37 °C for 30 min. The resulting cell suspension was centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min and the cell pellet resuspended in cold (4 °C) 250 mmsucrose, 25 mm MES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (SME buffer). The cells were lysed by sonication (two times, 30 s each with 2-s pulses). An aliquot was used for determination of DNA as described by Downs and Wilfinger (31Downs T.R. Wilfinger W.W. Anal.

The conditioned media were centrifuged at 150 × g, passed through Millipore UltraFree 100 K (Burlington, MA) concentrators to remove large collagen fragments, and then concentrated by centrifugation through Millipore UltraFree 10 K concentrators. Samples were assayed as described below for cathepsin B protein by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis and for cathepsin B activity. Samples (cell lysate or media) normalized based on DNA determinations were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12% (w/v) gels. The protein in these gels was transferred to nitrocellulose and then immunoblotted using 3 μg/ml rabbit anti-human liver cathepsin B polyclonal antibody (32Moin K. Day N.A. Sameni M. Hasnain S.

Membranes were probed with a 1:16,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG) in 5% nonfat milk-T-PBS and reactive proteins detected using ECL-PlusTM. To reprobe, the blots were stripped for 35 min at 65 °C with 2% (w/v) SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and then washed three times with T-PBS. Immunoblots were quantified using NIH Image 1.62 and expressed as relative density units. Standards of cathepsin B and cathepsin D were used to establish linear ranges for quantification. Latent cathepsin B was assayed as previously described (33Keppler D. Waridel P. Abrahamson M. Bachmann D. Berdoz J. Sordat B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. To assess the amount of procathepsin B present, 100 μl of conditioned medium or PBS (control) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 25 μl of 0.5 msodium formate, 20 mm EDTA, pH 3.2, and 0.2 mg/ml pepsin. Additionally, two controls in the absence of pepsin were performed: 1) incubated on ice or 2) at 37 °C. The first assessed the amount of active cathepsin B in the conditioned media. The second assessed the amount of active cathepsin B generated autocatalytically during the incubation at acid pH. Cathepsin B activity was then assayed by adding 125 μl of 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, containing 4 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 200 μm Z-Arg-Arg-NHMec (final concentration, 100 μm). The final pH of the assay was 6.0. Duplicate samples and controls contained 10 μmCA-074. Samples and controls were transferred into 96-well plates and the fluorescence intensities read. Results were expressed as picomoles (NH2Mec formed)/min/mg of DNA. To determine statistical differences among the samples, one-way analysis of variance was performed. Dunnett's multiple comparison test was used as the post-test to compare pairs of group means with the control. Total cellular RNA from fibroblasts grown on collagen I gels and plastic was collected according to the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), electrophoresed (4 μg/lane) on a 0.8% agarose formaldehyde denaturing gel according to the procedure of Maniatis et al.(35Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar), and transferred overnight to a positively charged nylon membrane using a TurboblotterTM rapid downward transfer system (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were UV-cross-linked and analyzed by hybridization (68 °C, overnight) to 50 ng/ml DIG-labeled antisense riboprobe containing exons 7–11 (500 bp) of human cathepsin B in 0.02% SDS, 5× SSC, 50% deionized formamide, 0.1% sodium lauroylsarcosine, and 2% blocking reagent. Following post-hybridization washes (two at 22 °C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and two at 68 °C in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, for 15 min each), the hybridized probes were detected using anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate Fab fragment and CDP-StarTM chemiluminescent substrate. Equal loading was determined using a DIG-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (Ambion, Austin, TX). We localized cathepsins B and D using a modification (36Sameni M. Elliott E. Ziegler G. Fortgens P.H. Dennison C. Sloane B.F. Path. Oncol. Res. 1995; 1: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) of the general immunocytochemical method described by Willingham (37Willingham M. Focus. 1990; 12: 62-67Google Scholar). Human breast fibroblasts were grown to ∼80% confluence for 1 or 3 days on glass coverslips either uncoated or coated with a thin layer of type I collagen. For surface staining of cathepsins B and D and for staining of actin, cells were fixed for 10 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmCaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). For intracellular staining of cathepsins B and D, cells were fixed for 5 min in cold methanol. Fixation and subsequent steps were performed at 25 °C for intracellular staining and at 4 °C for surface labeling. After washing, the nonspecific binding was blocked with 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 45 min. For intracellular labeling, 0.1% saponin was added to all subsequent antibody and wash solutions. The cells were incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies (for intracellular double labeling, 230 μg/ml rabbit anti-human liver cathepsin B IgG and 20 μg/ml mouse anti-human liver cathepsin D IgG (D101); for surface labeling, 230 μg/ml rabbit anti-human liver cathepsin B IgG or 100 μg/ml sheep anti-human cathepsin D (D-23)) or FITC-conjugated phalloidin (1:1000). In controls, pre-immune serum (rabbit or mouse, 225 μg/ml) was substituted for the primary antibody. After washing, the cells were incubated for 1 h with fluorescein-conjugated affinity-purified anti-mouse IgG and/or Texas Red-conjugated affinity-purified donkey anti-rabbit or anti–goat IgG (20 μg/ml) containing 5% normal donkey serum. The cells were then washed, fixed, and mounted upside-down on slides with SlowFade reagent and observed with a Zeiss LSM 310 confocal microscope. Human breast fibroblasts grown on collagen or plastic for 1 day were collected by first treating the cells for 30 min with 0.1% collagenase and then trypsin-EDTA for 3 min. Integrin expression was determined following the protocol of Henriet et al. (38Henriet P. Zhong Z.D. Brooks P.C. Weinberg K.I. DeClerck Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10026-10031Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) using 10 μg/ml anti-integrin antibodies (α1 (FB12), α2 (P1E6), α3 (P1B5), αv(P3G8), β1 (6S6), and β3 (25E11)) or negative control (pre-immune mouse IgG) antibodies and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG. Ten thousand cells were sorted and their fluorescence quantified using a FACSCalibur and analyzed by Cell Quest version 3.1 (Becton Dickinson Immunocytochemistry System, San Jose, CA). Collagen I gels were prepared as described above but with the addition of 5 μg/ml inhibitory anti-integrin (α1(FB12), α2 (P1E6), and β1 (mAb13)) or negative control (pre-immune mouse IgG) antibodies. Fibroblasts were then treated with 5 μg/ml amounts of these antibodies for 10 min at 37 °C before seeding on collagen I gels containing the same anti-integrin or control antibodies. Untreated fibroblasts seeded on collagen I gels without antibody were used as controls. Twelve hours after seeding, the cells were changed to serum-free media for an additional 12 h. The fibroblasts were observed with a Zeiss LSM 310 confocal microscope, and then the cells and media were harvested and assayed for cathepsin B activity as described previously. Experiments were performed using immobilized anti-integrin antibodies (inhibitory α1 (FB12), α2 (P1E6), and β1 (mAb13); non-inhibitory β1 (K20); and activating β1 (12G10) and α2β1 (JBS2)) coated onto bacterial culture plates (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The plates (60 mm) were coated with 5, 10, or 20 μg/ml anti-integrin antibodies for 16 h in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 4 °C and then washed three times in PBS. The fibroblasts were seeded on these plates (4.5 × 105 cells/60-mm plate) and incubated for 12 h in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were serum-starved for an additional 12 h before collecting the media and cells to measure cathepsin B activity. Fibroblasts seeded on plastic tissue culture dishes, mouse pre-immune IgG (20 μg/ml), or collagen I-coated tissue culture dishes were used as controls. The fibroblasts would only bind to the bacterial culture dishes that were coated with anti-integrin antibodies; therefore, tissue culture dishes had to be used for the controls. Interactions with collagen I can increase expression of MMPs in fibroblasts (18Mauch C. Adelmann-Grill B. Hatamochi A. Krieg T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Ravanti L. Heino J. Lopez-Otin C. Kahari V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2446-2455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined whether interaction with collagen I affects expression in fibroblasts of proteases from two other classes: the cysteine protease cathepsin B and the aspartic protease cathepsin D. These two proteases have been proposed as prognostic markers for breast cancer (39Lah T.T. Cercek M. Blejec A. Kos J. Gorodetsky E. Somers R. Daskal I. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 578-584PubMed Google Scholar, 40Foekens J.A. Look M.P. Bolt-de Vries J. Meijer-van Gelder M.E. van Putten W.L. Klijn J.G. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We evaluated by immunoblotting the levels of these enzymes in nine different clones of human breast fibroblasts (9T, 10T, 11B, 11T, 12B, 12T, 14RM, 31RM, 33RM) comparing cells grown on either plastic or collagen I-coated plastic for 1 or 3 days. Similar results were obtained for all cell lines, including fibroblast lines that were not infected with the papilloma virus (data not shown). Only the mature (active) single-chain (SC) and double-chain (DC) forms of cathepsin B (Fig. 1A, top panels) and mature (active) double-chain form of cathepsin D (Fig. 1A, bottom panels) were present in cell lysates. Only the heavy chain of the double-chain form (i.e. H-DC) is observed in the 12% gels used here. Conversion from the single-chain forms of these enzymes to the double-chain forms occurs in the lysosome (41Ishidoh K. Takeda-Ezaki M. Watanabe S. Sato N. Aihara M. Imagawa K. Kikuchi M. Kominami E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 770-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Intracellular levels of cathepsins B and D were comparable in human breast fibroblasts whether grown on plastic or collagen I for 1 day (data not shown) or 3 days (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, levels were comparable in fibroblasts isolated from benign tissue (Fig.1A, lanes labeled B), areas surrounding malignant human breast tumors (Fig. 1A, lanes labeled T), or reduction mammoplasties (data not shown). Cathepsin B was secreted from the fibroblasts in response to growth on collagen I (Fig. 1B), yet cathepsin D was not (Fig. 1C). Neither enzyme was secreted from fibroblasts grown on plastic (Fig. 1, B and C). One might have anticipated that both enzymes would be secreted from fibroblasts, as both are secreted from breast cancer cells (42Rozhin J. Sameni M. Ziegler G. Sloane B.F. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6517-6525PubMed Google Scholar, 43Sloane B.F. Moin K. Sameni M. Tait L.R. Rozhin J. Ziegler G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 373-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Morisset M. Capony F. Rochefort H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The form of cathepsin B secreted in response to collagen I was predominantly the inactive precursor form, i.e. procathepsin B (Fig. 1B). The lower band of ∼10 kDa may represent a degradation product of cathepsin B or an artifact. When we quantified cathepsin B protein in the cell lysate and conditioned media (Fig.1D), it was apparent that interaction of breast fibroblasts with collagen I preferentially increased the total amount (lysate + media) of cathepsin B protein. This was not the case for cathepsin D protein (data not shown). The percentage of the total expressed cathepsin B protein that was secreted ranged from 39 to 84%, indicating a substantial induction of secretion by cellular interaction with collagen I. To determine whether the increase in cathepsin B protein induced by collagen I refl"

However, regions within the EKLF protein that serve as signals for its nuclear localization and the proteins that may enable it to become localized are unknown. Two approaches were used to address these issues. First, green fluorescent protein or pyruvate kinase was fused to EKLF domains, and localization was monitored and quantitated by confocal microscopy. Two necessary and sufficient nuclear localization signals (NLSs) were identified: one (NLS1) adjacent to the zinc finger DNA binding domain within a highly basic stretch of amino acids (275–296), and another more efficient signal (NLS2) within the zinc finger domain itself (amino acids 293–376). Interestingly, each zinc finger contributes to the overall effectiveness of NLS2 and requires an intact finger structure. Second, each NLS was tested in vitro for binding to importin proteins. Surprisingly, both EKLF NLSs, but principally the zinc finger domain, bind importin α and importin β. These findings demonstrate that two nuclear localization signals target EKLF to the nucleus and suggest this transport relies primarily on a novel zinc finger/importin protein interaction.

The aqueous channel of the nuclear pore has an effective diameter of 9 nm, and ions, molecules, and small proteins < 20 kDa can freely diffuse through it. However, proteins larger than 20 kDa are unable to freely diffuse through the nuclear pore and require an active transport process (reviewed in Refs.1Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar and 2Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The translocation of a protein can be divided into two steps. First, the protein is recognized by a soluble importin receptor, which then docks at the nuclear membrane. This step is energy-independent. Then these molecules are passed through the pore. Initially, it was suspected that energy played a role in this second step (reviewed in Ref. 3Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), but current models suggest that this step is also energy-independent; translocation per se is not directly coupled to energy expenditure (Refs. 1Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar and 2Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar and references therein). The importin β superfamily is highly conserved across species and is the receptor necessary for nuclear pore recognition (reviewed in Ref.4Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Different subsets of molecules required to be imported into the nucleus are recognized by alternate importin β isoforms. These isoforms recognize distinct classes of signals on their respective cargo. The classical pathway is the most well characterized and involves the first isolated importin receptor, importin β1, which recognizes basic stretches of amino acids in many cell proteins and transcription factors (e.g. Smad3 (5Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)). Most proteins that utilize the classical pathway are not directly recognized by importin β, but require an adaptor protein, importin α. This protein recognizes basic stretches of amino acids present in a wide range of cellular proteins. The importin α adaptor family consists of various isoforms, which have distinct binding properties and exhibit tissue-specific expression (6Nadler S.G. Tritschler D. Haffar O.K. Blake J. Bruce A.G.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although there are a variety of signals recognized by different importin β isoforms, nuclear localization signals (NLSs)1 recognized by the classical pathway receptors are characterized by a stretch of basic amino acids that can fall loosely into one of two categories. The first type, the monopartite NLS, is a continuous stretch of basic amino acids, where four out of six are positively charged (arginine or lysine). The prototype of this class is the SV40 large T-antigen protein with its sequence PKK128KRKV (12Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 13Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). The second category, the bipartite NLS, is best illustrated by nucleoplasmin, whereby a 10-amino acid linker region containing a few prolines separates two sets of two to three positively charged amino acids (14Dingwall C. Sharnick S.V. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1982; 30: 449-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar,15Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Either one of these signals is necessary and sufficient to localize a protein to the nucleus. A few proteins have unusual NLSs, which resemble neither canonical signal, because they lack clusters of arginine or lysine amino acids (16Davey J. Dimmock N.J. Colman A. Cell. 1985; 40: 667-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Wang P. Palese P. O'Neill R.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1850-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hall M.N. Hereford L.

A. 1990; 87: 6954-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that they are half NLSs that become juxtaposed to another positive cluster of amino acids within the three-dimensional structure of the protein (20Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 193-227PubMed Google Scholar). Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF/KLF1) was isolated in an effort to identify genes that contribute to erythroid cell differentiation (21Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Since the discovery of EKLF, a closely related family of Krüppel-like transcription factors has emerged. These proteins share extensive homology within their C-terminal C2H2 zinc finger DNA binding domains, yet contain distinct N-terminal transactivation or transrepression domains and exhibit differential tissue expression patterns (22Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). EKLF, a red cell-specific protein, is 358 amino acids long and consists of two separable, functional domains (23Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One serves as a DNA binding domain that is basic and is composed of three Krüppel-like C2H2 zinc finger motifs. The second is a transactivation domain that is proline-rich and contains an acidic region near its N terminus (amino acids 76–94) (21Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The EKLF protein binds the consensus sequence 5′-CCN CNC CCN-3′ (CACCC element) with each zinger finger making contacts with three bases in the recognition motif (24Feng W.C. Southwood C.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1493-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although CACCC elements are present in a multitude of gene promoters, not all CACCC sites are homogenous as illustrated by the ability of EKLF to differentiate between sites and preferentially bind the adult β-globin CACCC site (25Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In vivo, EKLF −/− mice die at E14.5, at the time of the switch in expression to adult β-globin, due to a fatal anemia caused by an α- to β-globin chain imbalance (26Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 27Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). These animals have little to no adult β-globin expression, whereas embryonic β-like globin expression levels are unaffected. In addition to these transcriptional effects, the absence of EKLF leads to loss of chromatin structure at the adult β-globin promoter (28Wijgerde M. Gribnau J. Trimborn T. Nuez B. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A molecular explanation for this follows from the observations that EKLF interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and that this affinity is increased by the in vivoacetylation of EKLF by p300/CBP (29Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 30Armstrong J.A. Bieker J.J. Emerson B.M.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2413-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although most functional evidence depicts EKLF as a transcriptional activator, recently it has been demonstrated that EKLF can also interact with mSin3A and HDAC1 and thus may behave as a transcriptional repressor as well (33Chen X. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3118-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although EKLF is a nuclear transcription factor, it is not known which regions of the protein serve as signals for its nuclear localization. Of particular interest is whether the zinc finger domain plays a role in this process because it is not known how individual fingers contribute to localization nor whether a zinc finger transcription factor could interact with importin proteins utilized by the classical pathway for nuclear import. The present studies elucidate the NLSs within the EKLF protein and the importin machinery that it may utilize for its nuclear localization. K562 cells were maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified enriched medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. Synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing BamHI sites and sequences complimentary to the 5′- and 3′-ends of full-length EKLF (amino acids 20–376), zinc finger only (EKLFΔpro, amino acids 287–376) or proline domain only (EKLFΔZn, amino acids 20–291) were used for PCR amplification on the full-length EKLF cDNA template. The inserts were ligated into theBamHI site of the mammalian expression vector, pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH). Similarly, primers were used to amplify and clone the 5′ basic region (amino acids 275–296), zinc finger 1 (amino acids 293–318), zinc finger 2 (amino acids 319–348), and zinc finger 3 (amino acids 349–376) into pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) to maintain the proper reading frame of the inserts. Generation of site-directed mutants and internal deletions used the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol after appropriate design of PCR primers. PCR primers containing a KpnI site in the 5′ primer and a stop codon and NotI site in the 3′ primer were used to amplify the full-length, 5′ basic region, zinc finger 1, zinc finger 2, and zinc finger 3 regions of EKLF as well as the regions containing both ZnF2 and ZnF3 (amino acids 318–376) and all three zinc fingers (ZnF1–3, amino acids 293–376). These primers were also utilized in various combinations to amplify EKLF RR/GL, EKLFΔpro-(20–274), EKLFΔZnF1, and EKLFΔZnF3 variants of the EKLF protein. A 3′ primer complimentary to the 3′-end of the basic region, which also contained a stop codon and a NotI site, was generated and used in conjunction with the 5′-EKLF primer described above to amplify EKLFΔZnF-(297–376) and EKLFΔZnF-(297–376) RR/GL. PCR products were ligated into the C terminus of the Myc-tagged pyruvate kinase vector (kind gift of Gideon Dreyfuss (34Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar)). Internal deletion of ZnF2 (EKLFΔZnF2) and point mutations within the zinc finger domain of EKLF (EKLF ZnF1,2,3 H/A) were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and Multichange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocols after the appropriate design of PCR primers. In general, GFP alone and GFP-fused murine and human EKLF regions were amplified with specific PCR primers that contained a NdeI site in the 5′ primer and a stop codon and NotI site in the 3′ primer, and cloned into the pet30a vector (Novagen). The GFP-SMAD3-MHI domain construct (kind gift of Harvey Lodish (5Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)) was similarly amplified and subcloned. A pcDNA3.1 vector containing HA-p53 was obtained as a kind gift from Jonathan Licht. For the GST-pull-down assays, GST alone (21Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), GST-importin α (major isoforms NPI-1/hSRP1 and GST-RCH-1/hSRP1α), and GST-importin β1 (kind gifts of Harvey Lodish) were as described previously (5Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All PCR products were gel-purified (Qiagen), and integrity of all constructs was verified by restriction and/or sequence analysis. PCR primer sequences are available upon request. Transfection of K562 cells and CV-1 cells was performed using the DMRIE lipofection method (Invitrogen). K562 cells were resuspended at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen), and 200 μl of cells were used per transfection. CV-1 cells were seeded onto 70% ethanol-treated coverslips 1 day prior to transfection so that coverslips would be 50–70% confluent on the day of transfection. 4 μg of test DNA and 8 μl of DMRIE reagent were used in each transfection. After 5 h at 37 °C, 2 ml of RPMI (K562) or DMEM (CV-1) supplemented with 15% FBS was added, and incubation continued at 37 °C. At 25–27 h post transfection, 750 μl of K562 cells was collected and spun onto frosted slides (Fisher) in a Shandon Cytospin 2 centrifuge at 600 rpm for 5 min. All cells were fixed with 2.5% formaldehyde/PBS for 12 min at room temperature. Fixative was added directly to CV-1 coverslips. Cells were washed with PBS, dried, and then mounted with DAPI containing Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The DAPI was used to identify cell nuclei. DAPI, GFP, and DIC images were visualized on a Leica confocal microscope. Myc-PK-transfected K562 cells were attached to slides by cytocentrifugation as described above at 48 h post-transfection. All steps were carried out at room temperature except when indicated. Cells were fixed for 30 min with 3% formaldehyde/PBS and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were then rinsed with PBS and blocked in 3% BSA/PBS for 1 h. The slides were incubated with 9E10 anti-myc monoclonal antibody (Mount Sinai Hybridoma Center) overnight at 4 °C at 2 μg/ml. Slides were washed 3× with 3%BSA/PBS and then incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa568 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 10 μg/ml. Cells were washed 3× with 3%BSA/PBS with a final rinse in PBS. Slides were then mounted with DAPI containing Vectashield. DAPI, Alexa568 (Texas Red), and DIC images were visualized on a Leica confocal microscope. The total cell area and GFP intensity, in addition to the nuclear area and its GFP intensity, was quantified per sample cell on a Leica confocal microscope. The nuclear GFP intensity was subtracted from the total cell GFP intensity for a given cell to obtain that cell's cytoplasmic GFP intensity. The same cell's nuclear area was subtracted from its total cell area to get its cytoplasmic area. Division of the cytoplasmic GFP intensity by its area yielded the cell's cytoplasmic signal. Similarly, the nuclear GFP intensity was divided by its area to get the cell's nuclear signal. Division of these two numbers gives the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of the cell. The sample size of cells chosen for each GFP-fused construct was as indicated in the figure legends. All the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios calculated per sample construct were averaged. Although these calculations do not take into account possible variations in protein expression levels of individual constructs, they do allow assessment of the relative efficiency of a signal as compared with background (GFP alone). Calculations for Myc-PK-fused construct-expressing cells were analyzed and quantified as described above and in conjunction with the Macintosh IPLab analysis program. Sample sizes are as indicated in the figure legends. All T7 promoter-containing constructs were in vitro transcribed and translated with the STP3-T7 kit as recommended by the supplier (Novagen). 2 μl of each translated sample was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Translated proteins were stored at −20 °C. BL21 cells (Novagen) were transformed with all GST-containing constructs and used to generate glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) bound to the proteins of interest by established procedures (29Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted from beads by boiling in SDS loading buffer, electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad), and stained with Gelcode Blue reagent (Pierce) to estimate the concentration and monitor the integrity of each immobilized protein preparation. 4 μl of 35S-translation products, equal protein concentrations of GST-immobilized beads, and binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 μm ZnCl2, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 3.4 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) was added to a final volume of 100 μl and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. 400 μl of binding buffer was added after 2 h, and beads were centrifuged at 4 °C for 2 min at 1000 rpm. Beads were washed three times with 500 μl of binding buffer, boiled in SDS loading buffer, and electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) along with 0.5 μl of in vitro transcribed and translated proteins (representing 12.5% of input). All gels were treated with EN3HANCE solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gels were exposed to film (Kodak X-AR) for 3–4 days at −80 °C. To assess the subcellular localization of the EKLF protein, full-length EKLF was fused in-frame to GFP, a freely diffusible protein (35Ogawa H. Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. Yasuda K. Umesono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and monitored for localization by confocal microscopy after transfection into K562 or CV1 cells. K562 is an erythroleukemic cell line, whereas CV-1 is an epithelial cell line. While GFP alone was relatively diffuse, GFP-EKLF was accumulated in the nucleus in both K562 cells and CV-1 cells (Fig.1B, panels a and b, and data not shown). To identify regions sufficient for nuclear accumulation within the EKLF protein, its two main functional domains were separately fused to GFP (Fig. 1A): the N-terminal, proline-rich transactivation domain (EKLFΔZn, amino acids 20–291) and the C-terminal, three C2H2 zinc finger-containing DNA binding domain (EKLFΔpro, amino acids 287–376). Both protein domains caused GFP to accumulate in the nucleus (Fig. 1B). However, many cells transfected with EKLFΔZn showed cytoplasmic staining (Fig.1B, panel c), whereas those transfected with EKLFΔpro did not (Fig. 1B, panel d). Signal quantitation followed by determination of the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios of K562 cells transfected with these truncations verified that the zinc finger region can cause more effective nuclear accumulation of GFP (Fig. 1C). Because both domains contain sequences sufficient for nuclear accumulation of GFP, these were further subdivided. Studies on the highly homologous GKLF protein have indicated that it contains an NLS within the portion of the protein just N-terminal to the zinc finger domain, within its transactivation domain (36Shields J.M. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18504-18507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Close analysis of the transactivation domain of EKLF indicated that this region could be a candidate for a classical NLS (because it contains a stretch of positive amino acids; Fig. 2B, panel b). This 5′ basic region alone directed nuclear accumulation of GFP (Fig. 2) to a level almost equal to that directed by the three zinc fingers together (compare quantitated data in Fig.1C with Fig. 2D). Disruption of two arginines at amino acids 282 and 283 in this peptide greatly reduced its effect, suggesting that this 5′ basic region plays a role in nuclear accumulation (Fig. 2C, panels b and f, and Fig. 2D). Each zinc finger was separately fused to GFP (Fig. 2A) to determine whether any one finger is sufficient to accumulate GFP in the nucleus. Of the three individual fingers, only Zinc finger 1 causes accumulation of GFP in the nucleus (Fig. 2C, panels c–e). Zinc finger 2 and Zinc finger 3 are very inefficient and cause only minimal nuclear accumulation when compared with control scrambled peptide (Fig. 2D). However, Zinc finger 1 did not fully reconstitute the nuclear accumulation effect seen by all three fingers together (Fig. 1C). The previous data demonstrate that, in isolation, the EKLF 5′ basic region and Zinc finger 1 exhibit the most efficient nuclear accumulation effects upon GFP. To further examine their role, alterations were made in these regions within the context of full-length EKLF to determine if their removal was sufficient to disrupt EKLF accumulation. The RR to GL mutation, although decreasing the efficiency of the signal of the 5′ basic region peptide (Fig.2D), had no effect on nuclear accumulation when present in the context of full-length EKLF (EKLF RR/GL; Fig.3B, panel a). Similarly, deletion of Zinc finger 1 in the context of the full-length protein showed no effect on nuclear accumulation (EKLF ΔZnF1; Fig.3B, panel b). Surprisingly, the ablation of both signals also did not significantly alter the nuclear accumulation of EKLF (Fig. 3B, line c). This indicates one of two possibilities: either that ZnF2/3 together, or a region in the N terminus of EKLF, may play a role in nuclear accumulation. Because the RR to GL mutation in the context of the EKLF N-terminal transactivation domain (EKLFΔZn) alone was sufficient to disrupt its nuclear accumulation (data not shown), we believe that the latter possibility is not likely. However, a concern follows from the observation that accumulation of proteins in the nucleus can also be caused by their selective retention through interactions with other nuclear targets (37Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although its size makes it unlikely, GFP-EKLF could have passively diffused into the nucleus and been retained by virtue of its association (specifically or nonspecifically) with DNA through its zinc finger domain. To eliminate this possibility, histidine to alanine mutations were made in Zinc fingers 2 (amino acid 343) and 3 (amino acid 371) in the context of the full-length protein that lacks Zinc finger 1 and contains the RR to GL mutation. Such a disruption of the C2H2structure eliminates one of the amino acids necessary to coordinate the Zn2+ ion and form the correct structure to bind DNA. However, this disruption does not influence the structure or DNA binding activity of nearby zinc finger domains (38Del Rio S. Menezes S.R. Setzer D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The results (Fig.3B, panel d) show that this construct accumulates in the nucleus as well as the unaltered protein. The cumulative GFP data suggests that the individually weak effects of Zinc fingers 2 and 3 (seen in Fig. 2) might still be playing a significant role in the context of full-length EKLF, where they are together and adjacent. The acetylation status of EKLF increases its transactivating ability (29Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and influences its protein-protein interactions (32Zhang W. Kadam S. Emerson B.M. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2413-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because one of the acetylated lysines (Lys-288) is located in the 5′ basic region, a site-directed mutation (to arginine) was made in GFP-fused full-length EKLF. This had no effect on EKLF localization because it remained accumulated in the nucleus. Abolishment of the positive charge altogether at Lys-288 through a mutation to alanine also had no effect on accumulation (data not shown). Therefore, the nuclear accumulation of EKLF is independent of charge or acetylation status of this lysine. To test for any cell-specific effects of our observations, the subcellular localization of all GFP fusion constructs was simultaneously monitored in transfected CV-1 cells, a kidney epithelial cell line. Expression of the constructs in CV-1 cells shows localization patterns identical to those obtained as when expressed in K562 cells, indicating that there is no erythroid-specific effect that directs nuclear accumulation of EKLF in K562 cells (data not shown). While GFP fusion is a common approach to visualize the nuclear or subcellular location of a protein, GFP can accumulate significantly to the nucleus on its own. Our quantitated data had yielded background (GFP-alone) nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios of ∼2–3. To address nuclear localization directly, we fused regions of the EKLF protein to pyruvate kinase (PK), an exclusively cytoplasmic protein that has been used to test the active nuclear import of proteins (34Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 39Lonberg N. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3661-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This provides a very stringent test because significant redistribution of the PK protein to the nucleus after fusion to a test protein can only occur in the presence of an efficientbona fide nuclear localization signal. To easily identify transfected cells that express the PK-fused EKLF constructs, a myc-tag/PK fusion served as the epitope for monoclonal antibodies for indirect immunofluorescence. All cells transfected with the empty pcDNA3 Myc-PK vector showed total nuclear exclusion of the PK protein (Fig.4A, panel a) with a quantitated nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of ∼0.3–0.4, verifying our initial premise in using this reporter. In contrast, all full-length EKLF-expressing cells showed complete nuclear localization of"

Here we have carried out biochemical studies to identify the necessities and/or advantages of this intriguing pentagonal structure. The structure indicated the presence of three neighboring residues (Glu-63, Arg-66, and Asp-69), participating in ionic interactions within unique dimer-dimer interfaces. We constructed three single mutant proteins (E63S, R66S, and D69S) and one triple mutant protein (E63S/R66S/D69S) by replacing the charged residues with serine. The wild type (WT) and all mutant proteins were purified and subjected to gel permeation chromatography at various temperatures. WT and D69S proteins were decameric at all temperatures examined between 30 and 90 °C. The majority of E63S and R66S were decamers at 30 °C but were found to gradually disassemble with the elevation in temperature. E63S/R66S/D69S was found in a dimeric form even at 30 °C. An interesting correlation was found between the subunit assembly and thermostability of the proteins. Circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry analyses indicated that the denaturation temperatures of dimeric enzymes (E63S, R66S, and E63S/R66S/D69S) were ∼95 °C, whereas those of the enzymes retaining a decameric structure (WT and D69S) were ∼110 °C. Disassembly into tetramer or dimer units did not alter the slopes of the Arrhenius plots, indicating that the decameric structure had no effect on catalytic performance per se. The results indicate that the decameric assembly of Tk-Rubisco contributes to enhance the thermostability of the enzyme. Taking into account the growth temperature of strain KOD1 (65–100 °C), the decameric structure of Tk-Rubisco can be considered essential for the stable presence of the enzyme in the host cells. This study provides an interesting example in which the thermostability of a protein can be enhanced by formation of a unique quaternary structure not found in mesophilic enzymes.

Harpel M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.-I. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 119-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Shively J.M. van Keulen G. Meijer W.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 191-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 4Watson G.M.F. Tabita F.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 146: 13-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxylase activity of this single enzyme is responsible for the carbon dioxide fixation in all plants, algae, and many bacteria, including cyanobacteria. Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, carbon dioxide, and water are converted to two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA),1 which is eventually utilized for the production of all organic cell materials. Besides the carboxylase activity, Rubisco also displays a competing oxygenase activity. In the oxygenase reaction, one molecule of 3-PGA and one molecule of 2-phosphoglycolate are produced from ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate and molecular oxygen. The oxygenase activity of Rubisco actually decreases the net fixation of carbon dioxide in the organism, and the physiological meaning of this reaction is yet to be clarified (1Hartman F.C. Harpel M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.-I. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 119-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Until recently, Rubiscos had been classified into two types (or forms) based on their quaternary and primary structures (1Hartman F.C. Harpel M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.-I. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 119-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 3Shively J.M. van Keulen G. Meijer W.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 191-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Type I Rubisco, found in higher plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and many other bacteria, is composed of eight large (L) subunits and eight small (S) subunits, forming a heterohexadecamer (L8S8). Four L2S2 heterotetramers are arranged around a 4-fold symmetry axis with local 422 symmetry. On the contrary, type II Rubisco from some bacteria consists of large subunits only (L2). This classification, based on subunit composition, coincides well with the relatedness of amino acid sequences among the large subunits (4Watson G.M.F. Tabita F.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 146: 13-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence similarity among large subunits of the same type is relatively high (>70%), whereas those among different types exhibit only 50% similarity. The large subunits of both types display a similar protein fold and comprise two domains, a small N-terminal domain and large C-terminal domain. A dimeric structure, containing two active sites, can be considered the minimal unit for Rubisco activity, as residues from both subunits contribute to form the active center (1Hartman F.C. Harpel M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 197-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.-I. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 119-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have previously discovered that Rubiscos are also present in hyperthermophilic Archaea (5Ezaki S. Maeda N. Kishimoto T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5078-5082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The physiological roles of archaeal Rubiscos are still unknown, and their primary structures are distinct to those of the type I and II Rubiscos described above. We have carried out gene analysis (5Ezaki S. Maeda N. Kishimoto T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5078-5082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), biochemical characterization (5Ezaki S. Maeda N. Kishimoto T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 293: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and three-dimensional structural analysis (8Kitano K. Maeda N. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Miki K. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) of the Rubisco fromThermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 (Tk-Rubisco). The enzyme harbored unprecedentedly high carboxylase activity and carboxylase specificity besides its extreme thermostability. Immunochemical studies indicated that the enzyme was composed solely of large subunits (7Maeda N. Kitano K. Fukui T. Ezaki S. Atomi H. Miki K. Imanaka T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure revealed that although the monomeric fold of the enzyme resembled those of type I and type II enzymes, the subunit assembly of the enzyme was unique. Tk-Rubisco proved to be an (L2)5 decamer harboring one 5-fold and five 2-fold symmetry axes perpendicular to each other. Compared with previously reported type I enzymes, each dimer was inclined ∼16° along its 2-fold symmetry axis, forming a toroid-shaped decamer. Therefore, the dimer-dimer interfaces found in Tk-Rubisco were distinct to those of previously known Rubiscos. These interfaces occupied only 3.3% of the solvent-accessible surface area of a dimer, but the structure suggested the presence of many ionic interactions within these interfaces (8Kitano K. Maeda N. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Miki K. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tk-Rubisco possessed one extra α-helix (helix αO, residues 64–70), and three neighboring residues located in or near this helix (Glu-63, Arg-66, and Asp-69) were supposed to mainly participate in these ionic interactions between adjacent dimers (8Kitano K. Maeda N. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Miki K. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we have constructed mutant proteins intending to disrupt the ionic interactions in the dimer-dimer interface of Tk-Rubisco. By characterizing these proteins, we addressed the following two subjects. First, we aimed to determine the residues and the interactions that contribute to the decameric structure of Tk-Rubisco. Second, we were interested in whether the decameric structure of Tk-Rubisco per se had any meaning in terms of the biochemical properties of the enzyme. Would a decameric structure have any advantages compared with a type II-like dimeric structure? As a result, this study provides clear evidence that the decameric structure of Tk-Rubisco, supported by intersubunit ionic interactions, is essential for the thermostability of the protein at the growth temperatures of its host, T. kodakaraensis KOD1. Escherichia coliDH5α and the vector pUC18 were used for cloning and gene manipulation. For overexpression of the Tk-Rubisco gene (Tk-rbc1) and its mutant genes, E. coli BL21(DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the vector pET21a (+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) were utilized. LB medium was used for cultivation of E. coli (9Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To substitute Glu-63, Arg-66, and Asp-69 with serine, sequences within the Tk-rbc1 gene (accession number AB018555), namely GAG (bases 187–189), AGA (bases 196–198), and GAC (bases 205–207), were replaced with AGC, respectively. The sequences of mutant genes were confirmed using the ABI PRISM kit and Model 310 capillary DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The mutant genes were inserted into pET21a (+) after digestion with NdeI and SalI. After insertion of the Tk-rbc1 and its mutant genes into pET21a(+), the plasmids were independently introduced intoE. coli BL21(DE3)CodonPlus. Gene expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. After harvesting, the cells were suspended in 100 mm Bicine/KOH (pH 8.3), 10 mm MgCl2(Buffer A) and disrupted by sonication. The soluble cell-free extracts were heat-precipitated for 30 min at 85 °C. The supernatant was applied to a ResourceQ column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl using ÄKTA explorer 10S (Amersham Biosciences). The salt gradients were varied to optimize the separation. The recombinant protein was then applied to Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) in Buffer A containing 0.25m NaCl. The eluted protein was dialyzed against Buffer A. Purified recombinant proteins were concentrated with Centricon 30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA), when necessary. Gel permeation chromatography at various temperatures was carried out using the chromatography system HLC-8220GPC (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan). The enzyme was applied to TSKgel GMPWxl column and eluted with 100 mm Bicine-KOH buffer (pH 8.3) containing 100 mmMgCl2. All proteins were applied at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. Concentration-dependent decamer/dimer transition of E63S was examined with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) in Buffer A containing 0.25 m NaCl. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis was carried out on a Nano II DSC (model 6100, Calorimetry Science, Spanish Fork, UT). Protein solutions were dialyzed overnight against Buffer A. The reference cell was filled with the final dialysis buffer. Samples were degassed before measurement and then scanned from 30 to 125 °C at 1 °C/min. The concentration of protein was adjusted to 1 mg/ml. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured with a J-820 spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) using a quartz cell of 1-mm optimal path. For measurements of far-ultraviolet (UV) CD spectra, purified wild type and mutant Rubiscos were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 at a concentration of ∼0.2 mg/ml. Thermal denaturation curves and the temperature of the midpoint of the transition (Tm) were determined by monitoring the change in the CD value at 220 nm. Data were collected every 0.5 °C. Temperature elevation was carried out with a 0.5 °C elevation during a 30-s period, and after incubation at the temperature for 1 min, measurements were carried out. This corresponds to a 1 °C/3-min elevation rate. Carboxylase activity was measured as described elsewhere (10Schloss J.V. Phares E.F. Long M.V. Norton I.L. Stringer C.D. Hartman F.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The enzyme solution contained 5 μg of enzyme in 80 μl of 100 mm Bicine-KOH (pH 8.3), 10 mm MgCl2 buffer (Buffer A). A 10-μl aliquot of 1 m NaHCO3 in Buffer A was added. After incubation at the desired temperature for 3 min, a 10-μl aliquot of 300 mm ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate in Buffer A was added, and incubation was continued for another 3 min. After stopping the reaction, the solution was appropriately diluted (5∼50 times), and 30 μl was added to a coupling reaction mixture to quantify the 3-PGA formed. The coupling reaction mixture contained 563 units/ml 3-phosphoglycerate phosphokinase, 125 units/ml glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 260 units/ml triose-phosphate isomerase, and 22.5 units/ml glycerophosphate dehydrogenase along with 0.8 mm NADH, 5 mm ATP, and 5 mmreduced glutathione in a 150 mm Bicine-KOH (pH 8.3), 15 mm MgCl2 buffer. The difference in absorbance at 340 nm before and after the coupling reaction was measured. A linear correlation was detected between the decrease in absorbance and the amount of 3-PGA at concentrations between 3 and 150 μm. We have previously determined the first crystal structure of an archaeal Rubisco from the hyperthermophile, T. kodakaraensis KOD1, at 2.8-Å resolution (8Kitano K. Maeda N. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Miki K. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The protein fold of the monomer highly resembled those of previously determined Type I Rubiscos from spinach (11Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), tobacco (12Duff A.P. Andrews T.J. Curmi P.M. J. Mol.

Kai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15655-15661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and Alcaligenes eutrophus (15Hansen S. Vollan V.B. Hough E. Andersen K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) along with the type II enzyme from Rhodospirillum rubrum (16Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Lundqvist T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 989-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, a significant structural difference was observed in its subunit assembly. Tk-Rubisco consisted of 10 large subunits and displayed a novel pentagonal structure with unique dimer-dimer (L2-L2) interfaces (8Kitano K. Maeda N. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Miki K. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). When 3.2 Å was applied as the cut-off criterion, 10 residues were presumed to be involved in dimer-dimer interactions, forming 1 hydrogen bond and 8 ionic bonds. The structure suggested that Glu-63, Arg-66, and Asp-69 were involved in 6 of these ionic interactions (Fig. 1, A and B). These residues are located in or adjacent to an extra α-helix (helix αO), present in Tk-Rubisco, spanning the region Gln-64 to Leu-70. Therefore, it was assumed that these charged residues were involved in maintaining the decameric structure of the enzyme. Thus, we constructed the following three single mutants and one triple mutant and investigated the properties of each mutant protein. The three single mutants, in which Glu-63, Arg-66, or Asp-69 was replaced with a serine residue were designated as E63S, R66S, and D69S, respectively. The triple mutant, in which all three charged residues were replaced with Ser, was named E63S/R66S/D69S. Wild type and mutant Rubisco genes were expressed inE. coli, and all mutant proteins were obtained in a soluble form. The cell-free extracts were heat-precipitated for 30 min at 85 °C, as carried out for the wild type enzyme. All mutant proteins were stable against this treatment and remained in their soluble forms. Anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography were performed to purify the proteins. In the anion exchange chromatography, the mutant D69S protein was eluted at the same salt concentration (∼0.3 m NaCl) as the wild type protein, but the triple mutant protein was eluted at a higher salt concentration (∼0.4m NaCl). Interestingly, E63S and R66S proteins were detected in two separated fractions, eluting at ∼0.3 mand 0.4 m NaCl concentrations (data not shown). This correlation was also observed with gel filtration chromatography. The molecular mass of D69S was equivalent to that of the wild type protein, indicating a decameric structure. In contrast, the elution profile of E63S/R66S/D69S suggested that the triple mutant protein was a protein with lower molecular mass. E63S and R66S proteins were predominantly decamers, but a small population of these proteins was also found in the lower molecular mass fractions (data not shown). We have previously reported that an extensive number of acidic residues occupy the inner surface of the pentagonal ring of Tk-Rubisco (8Kitano K. Maeda N. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Miki K. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A decameric structure maintains this region on the inner side of the enzyme, but disassembly of the decamer would allow the acidic surface to interact with the anion exchange matrix. Therefore, elution of the triple mutant at 0.4m NaCl concentration, elution of the wild type enzyme at 0.3 m, and elution of the E63S and R66S mutants at both 0.4 and 0.3 m coincide well with the results of gel filtration chromatography. When the decameric fractions were repeatedly applied to gel filtration chromatography, a small portion of the enzyme was detected in the lower molecular mass fraction, suggesting an equilibrium between these two states (see below). Decameric fractions of E63S and R66S were utilized for further experiments. After gel filtration chromatography, the purity of mutant proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The mutant proteins remained soluble after the heat treatment mentioned above, indicating that no drastic alteration in structure was introduced by the mutations. We further examined the effect of mutations on the secondary structure of each protein. Far-UV CD spectra of the mutant proteins were measured at 20 °C and compared with that of the wild type protein. The CD spectra of all proteins were virtually identical, suggesting that the mutations at the positions of 63, 66, and 69 (helix αO) did not induce major structural alterations (data not shown). We next investigated the subunit composition of mutant proteins at various temperatures using gel permeation chromatography. All proteins were applied at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Because denaturation of protein molecular mass marker at high temperatures was expected, various chain lengths of pullulan were utilized as molecular mass markers. The elution profiles of wild type, E63S, R66S, D69S, and E63S/R66S/D69S at 30 °C are shown in Fig.2A. At this temperature, the profiles of wild type, E63S, and D69S proteins were indistinguishable, eluting at a retention time corresponding to a decameric protein. The profile of the R66S protein displayed an additional shoulder peak corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼180 kDa or a tetrameric structure. In contrast, we found that the E63S/R66S/D69S triple mutant eluted as a single peak, corresponding to a dimer. We could also observe a concentration-dependent transition between decamers and dimers when we carried out gel filtration chromatography with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column. In the case of the E63S mutant protein, a decamer:dimer ratio of 61:39 was observed at an initial protein concentration of 11.6 mg/ml, whereas the ratio was 14:86 at 0.48 mg/ml (data not shown). To determine the stability of the decameric structure of each protein, gel permeation chromatography was then performed at elevated temperatures (Fig. 2B). The wild type enzyme retained a decameric structure at 30, 60, 80, and 90 °C (data not shown). The D69S mutant protein was also found to maintain a decameric structure even at 90 °C. The decameric structure of the E63S protein, which was found at 30 °C, gradually dissociated with the elevation in temperature. The majority of the protein was found to be a tetramer at 80 °C. As for the R66S protein, the majority was tetrameric at 60 °C and further dissociated into dimers at 80 °C. Experiments at 90 °C for the E63S and R66S proteins were not possible because denaturation of these proteins were observed (see below). These results strongly indicated that Glu-63 and Arg-66, particularly Arg-66, were involved in maintaining the decameric structure of Tk-Rubisco. The loss of the far-UV CD value at 220 nm was used to monitor the temperature dependence of thermal denaturation for each protein (Fig.3). In the cases of E63S, R66S, and the triple mutant protein, the proteins were completely denatured at temperatures below 100 °C. After normalizing the data, the melting temperatures (Tm) or the midpoint of denaturation of E63S, R66S, and the triple mutant protein were 92.8, 90.8, and 89.6 °C, respectively. In contrast, the wild type protein was stable, and denaturation was not detected even at 100 °C. Disruption of the D69S secondary structure initiates at temperatures above 90 °C, but the protein was not completely denatured at 100 °C. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments were also carried out to determine the irreversible denaturation temperature of each protein. The results revealed an interesting correlation between the subunit assembly and thermostability of the proteins. Wild type and D69S proteins, which maintained decameric structures at 90 °C, were found to denature at 113 and 109 °C, respectively (data not shown). In contrast, the Tk-Rubisco mutant proteins that disassembled to dimers or tetramers at 80 °C (E63S, R66S, E63S/R66S/D69S) shared similar denaturation temperatures of 95, 94, and 94 °C, respectively (data not shown). Because it is likely that the E63S mutant protein is in a dimeric form at 90 °C, it can be estimated that the disassembly of decameric Tk-Rubisco into dimers lowers the denaturation temperature by ∼20 °C. To compare the enzymatic properties of mutant proteins, the carboxylase activity of each protein was measured at various temperatures (Fig.4A). Measurements were carried out by quantifying the 3-PGA formed by Tk-Rubisco with a coupled reaction including 3-phosphoglycerate phosphokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose-phosphate isomerase, and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 10Schloss J.V. Phares E.F. Long M.V. Norton I.L. Stringer C.D. Hartman F.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). At all temperatures examined, wild type Rubisco showed the highest carboxylase activity among all enzymes. The carboxylase activity of wild type enzyme increased with increasing temperature, and the enzyme showed the highest carboxylase activity, 55.6 μmol of CO2 fixed/min/mg of protein, at 100 °C. As for the mutant proteins, activities were in the order of D69S, E63S, R66S, and E63S/R66S/D69S. The activities of R66S and the triple mutant protein were extremely low and were less than 1.6 μmol of CO2fixed/min/mg protein even at their optimal temperatures of 80 °C (Fig. 4A). Similar tendencies were observed when activity measurements were performed by directly quantifying 3-PGA with high performance liquid chromatography (data not shown). Arrhenius plots of WT, D69S, and E63S were constructed to investigate the relationship between temperature and activity (Fig. 4B). An Arrhenius plot of wild type Tk-Rubisco was linear throughout a temperature range of 50–100 °C, whereas linearity was observed between 50 and 90 °C for D69S and E63S. From these results, it is likely that drastic conformational changes do not occur in these three proteins between 50 and 90 °C (50–100 °C in the case of the wild type protein). The drastic decrease in activity of E63S at 100 °C indicates that the protein begins to denature at temperatures between 90 and 100 °C. The same tendency, but to a lesser extent, was also observed for D69S. These results agree well with the results of Fig. 3. Moreover, the Arrhenius plot of E63S revealed that there was no significant relationship between subunit assembly and enzymatic activity. The results of gel permeation chromatography at various temperatures clearly indicated the disassembly of E63S from a decameric structure to a tetrameric structure within the temperature range of 30- 80 °C. However, the slope of the Arrhenius plot of E63S was continuously linear throughout this temperature range, indicating that the pentagonal assembly of dimers per se had no effect on the catalytic performance of E63S. Rubisco from T. kodakaraensis KOD1, Tk-Rubisco, displays an unprecedented pentagonal decameric structure, (L2)5, and three-dimensional structural analysis of the enzyme suggested the presence of extensive ionic interactions within the interfaces of adjacent dimers (8Kitano K. Maeda N. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. Miki K. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The results of this study have clarified the importance of the ionic interactions in the maintenance of the pentaganol structure as well as identified the residues involved. Moreover, we were able to elucidate the necessity of the peculiar pentagonal structure of Tk-Rubisco. The four mutant proteins, E63S, R66S, D69S, and E63S/R66S/D69S, were all produced as soluble proteins, displayed similar CD spectra, and were resistant to heat treatment at 85 °C for 30 min, indicating that the introduction of mutations did not drastically alter the fold of the proteins. This was strongly supported by the fact that all mutant proteins harbored Rubisco activity. Nevertheless, each mutant protein exhibited distinct properties in terms of subunit composition, thermostability, and activity levels. Wild type Tk-Rubisco can be presumed to maintain its decameric structure until the protein is denatured at ∼113 °C. The triple mutant protein was a dimer at all temperatures examined. It was less stable than the wild type protein, and denaturation was observed at ∼90 °C. As for the single mutant proteins, the majority of E63S and R66S proteins were decamers at 30 °C. The decameric structures of the two proteins dissociated to tetramers or dimers at elevated temperatures, and their denaturing temperatures were similar to the triple mutant protein (∼90 °C). The results indicate that the dimeric structure of Tk-Rubisco itself denatures at ∼90 °C. This is also supported by the fact that the only mutant to maintain a decameric structure at 90 °C, D69S, displayed a denaturation temperature of 109 °C, comparable with the 113 °C of the wild type protein. Our results agree well with one another and commonly indicate that the pentagonal assembly of the Tk-Rubisco dimer units leads to an enhancement in thermostability. Concerning the carboxylase activity of the proteins, wild type Tk-Rubisco showed the highest activity among all enzymes examined. Activities were in the order of WT > D69S ≅ E63S ≫ R66S ≅ E63S/R66S/D69S. Although this order of activity coincided with the order of thermostability, or higher oligomerization states, it is unlikely that the activity level is strongly influenced by the oligomeric state of the protein itself. There is a large difference in activity between wild type and D69S mutant proteins from 70 to 90 °C, although both are decamers in this temperature range. Similarly, D69S and E63S display similar levels of activity from 60 to 80 °C, despite their different oligomeric states. The strongest evidence is provided by the Arrhenius plot of the E63S protein. Although the oligomeric state of E63S changes between 30 and 80 °C, the slope of the Arrhenius plot is constant throughout this temperature range. Activity levels seem to be influenced by alterations within the dimer and not by dimer-dimer interactions. This may be due to a local conformational change of an active site residue Thr-54 in the immediate vicinity of helix αO, where the mutations were introduced. Putative Rubisco and Rubisco-like orthologues have been identified on the complete genome sequences of numerous archaeal strains. Among these, the MJ1235 gene from Methanococcus jannaschii and the AF1638 gene from Archaeoglobus fulgidus have been shown to encode proteins with bona fide Rubisco activity (17Watson G.M.F., Yu, J.-P. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unique structure of Tk-Rubisco tempted us to search for the residues that participate in decamerization in other archaeal Rubisco sequences. The Rubisco from M. jannaschii has been reported to be a dimeric protein (17Watson G.M.F., Yu, J.-P. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1569-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and accordingly, conservation of the residues was very low, with only two presumable ionic interactions. Only three to four of the eight ionic interactions were conserved in the Rubiscos from A. fulgidus (AAB89603), Pyrococcus furiosus(AAL81280), Pyrococcus abyssi (CAB50122), and Pyrococcus horikoshii (BAA30036). Although none of these proteins have been subject to three-dimensional structural analysis, sequence comparison does not support the possibilities that archaeal Rubiscos are decamers in general. These Rubiscos may harbor high thermostability by strengthening and/or increasing atomic interactions within their respective dimers. The structural features that bring about the high thermostability of proteins from hyperthermophiles have attracted much attention. Structural comparison among protein counterparts from mesophiles, thermophiles, and hyperthermophiles has indicated some of the factors that lead to thermostability (18Hashimoto H. Inoue T. Nishioka M. Fujiwara S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Kai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A well studied example is triose-phosphate isomerase (19Delboni L.F. Mande S.C. Rentier-Delrue F. Mainfroid V. Turley S. Vellieux F.M.D. Martial J.A. Hol W.G.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2594-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 20Maes D. Zeelen J.P. Thanki N.

Siebers B. Hensel R. Taylor G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 745-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and it has been found that the thermostable triose-phosphate isomerase proteins have severe pruning of some helices along with truncation of some loop structures, leading to a more compact monomer than its mesophilic counterparts. A higher oligomerization state of the thermostable protein has also been suggested to contribute to extreme thermostability (21Walden H. Bell G.S. Russell R.J. Siebers B. Hensel R. Taylor G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 745-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A few other enzymes from hyperthermophiles have also been reported to take a higher oligomerization state than those of their mesophilic counterparts (22Vieille C. Zeikus G.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). These include dihydrofolate reductase (23Dams T. Auerbach G. Bader G. Jacob U. Ploom T. Huber R. Jaenicke R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase (24Hennig M. Sterner R. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6009-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) from Thermotoga maritima and methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase fromMethanopyrus kandleri (25Grabarse W. Vaupel M. Vorholt J.A. Shima S. Thauer R.K. Wittershagen A. Bourenkov G. Bartunik H.D. Ermler U. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1257-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The possibilities that the higher oligomerization states of these proteins contribute to enhance their thermostability have been discussed. The only study that has experimentally addressed this possibility was carried out with the phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase from T. maritima (26Thoma R. Hennig M. Sterner R. Kirschner K. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The results indicated that dimerization through hydrophobic interactions did indeed enhance the thermostability of phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase from T. maritima. The present study on Tk-Rubisco provides a clear case where a unique quaternary structure of an enzyme from a hyperthermophile contributes to stabilize the protein from thermal inactivation. Decamerization increased the denaturation temperature of the protein from ∼90 °C to 113 °C. Taking into account that the growth temperature ofT. kodakaraensis KOD1 ranges from 65 to 100 °C (27Morikawa M. Izawa Y. Rashid N. Hoaki T. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 4559-4566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the decameric structure of Tk-Rubisco can be considered essential for the stable presence of the enzyme in its native host cell."
https://openalex.org/W2146516525,"Detyrosination is an evolutionarily conserved post-translational modification of microtubule polymers that is known to be enhanced during early morphological differentiation of cultured myogenic cells (Gundersen, G. G., Khawaja, S., and Bulinski, J. C. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 2275–2288). We proposed that altering the C terminus of α-tubulin by detyrosination plays a role in morphological differentiation. To test our hypothesis, we treated L6 myoblasts with 3-nitrotyrosine (Eiserich, J. P., Estevez, A. G., Bamberg, T. V., Ye, Y. Z., Chumley, P. H., Beckman, J. S., and Freeman, B. A. (1999)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 6365–6375), a nontoxic inhibitor that resulted in high level inhibition of microtubule detyrosination and low level incorporation of nitrotyrosine into microtubules. Even though microtubule stabilization or modification by acetylation still occurred normally, morphological differentiation was blocked; myoblasts neither elongated significantly nor fused. Nitrotyrosine treatment prevented synthesis or activation of markers of myogenic differentiation, including muscle-specific myosin, α-actin, integrin α7, and myogenin. Consistent with this, myoblast integrin β1A remained highly expressed. In contrast, the increase in β-catenin level characteristic of early myogenesis was unaffected by treatment. These results show that the identity of the C-terminal residue of α-tubulin modulates microtubule activity, possibly because binding to or signaling from modified microtubules is required for the myogenic program.

The ability of MTs to quickly polymerize and depolymerize, a process known as dynamic instability, places regulation of MT dynamics at the center of active research (1Walczak C.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Tubulin undergoes a host of post-translational modifications, including detyrosination, acetylation, generation of Δ2-tubulin, phosphorylation, polyglutamylation, and polyglycylation (2Ludueña R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, detyrosination has been most extensively studied, yet its functions remain to be determined. Detyrosination is a unique modification involving cleavage of the C-terminal tyrosine residue of α-tubulin within MTs by a tubulin-specific carboxypeptidase (TCP), leaving Glu tubulin, named for its newly exposed C-terminal residue. Detyrosination is reversible: tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) adds a tyrosine residue to the C terminus of protomeric Glu-tubulin, re-forming tyrosinated (Tyr) tubulin (2Ludueña R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bulinski J.C. Gundersen G.G. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). MTs enriched in Glu tubulin (called Glu MTs) have been shown to be enhanced in cellular longevity or stability (4Bré M.H. Kreis T.E. Karsenti E. J.

Glu MTs are found in a distinct subset of MTs in undifferentiated cultured cells (9Gundersen G.G. Kalnoski M.H. Bulinski J.C.

Usually the Glu MT subset largely overlaps with the subset enriched in post-translationally acetylated subunits (10Schulze E. Asai D.J. Bulinski J.C. Kirschner M. J.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1213-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggesting that post-translationally modified subunits within a stable MT may function to establish functionally distinct MT populations. For example, modified MTs may function in cellular morphogenesis or cell polarization (3Bulinski J.C. Gundersen G.G. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Antibody microinjections suggest that Glu tubulin subunits anchor vimentin filaments to MTs in migrating 3T3 fibroblasts (12Gurland G. Gundersen G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1275-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and may be involved in directed organelle transport (13Kreitzer G. Liao G. Gundersen G.G. Mol. Biol.

The hypothesis that stable Glu MTs are involved in cellular morphogenesis is suggested by their increased abundance during differentiative events (3Bulinski J.C. Gundersen G.G. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 15Kirschner M. Mitchison T. Cell. 1986; 45: 329-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). However, to date no study has demonstrated that Glu MTs are necessary for differentiation. During myogenesis, cells undergo striking morphological changes; they elongate, align with neighbors, and finally fuse into multinucleated myotubes. In L6 cells, Glu MTs accumulate upon induction of myogenesis, coincident with formation of stable MTs and preceding myoblast fusion, accumulation of post-translationally acetylated MTs, and appearance of muscle-specific myosin (16Gundersen G.G. Khawaja S. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2275-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A test of the functional consequences of inhibiting MT detyrosination during myogenesis has not been straightforward, largely because no direct inhibitors of TCP are available. Eiserich et al. (17Eiserich J.P. Estevez A.G. Bamberg T.V., Ye, Y.Z. Chumley P.H. Beckman J.S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6365-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) showed that a modified amino acid, 3-nitrotyrosine (NO2Tyr), which is generated by reaction of tyrosine with nitric oxide-derived species, including nitrogen dioxide (⋅NO2) and peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (18Eiserich J.P.

Biophys. 1998; 356: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), may act as an indirect inhibitor of TCP. That is, NO2Tyr can be taken up by cells, where the tyrosinating enzyme, tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL), can incorporate it into the C terminus of Glu tubulin to yield nitrotyrosinated tubulin (21Kalisz H.M. Erck C. Plessmann U. Wehland J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 1131-1138Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Eiserich et al. (17Eiserich J.P. Estevez A.G. Bamberg T.V., Ye, Y.Z. Chumley P.H. Beckman J.S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6365-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) found that, when NO2Tyr was incorporated, Glu MTs were decreased, and in vitro studies with carboxypeptidase A suggested that the nitrotyrosinated MTs might work by blocking the generation of Glu MTs by TCP. In this study, we show that NO2Tyr-MTs inhibit TCP; consequently, NO2Tyr can be used as an indirect inhibitor of MT detyrosination during differentiation of L6 myoblasts. Perturbation of Glu MT formation prevents myogenic morphogenesis, and accumulation and activation of muscle-specific factors, revealing a link between MT modification and progression of the myogenic program. Unless noted, tissue culture supplies were from Invitrogen, and sera were from HyClone, Inc. Other chemicals and antibodies were from Sigma Chemical Co., immunochemicals were from Organon Teknika, and 4-methyl-2-nitrophenol was from Aldrich Chemical Co. Rat L6 myoblasts (ATCC), maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, were induced to differentiate by shifting to DMEM with 2% horse serum (heat-inactivated, 56 °C, 30 min), and the extent of differentiation was scored (16Gundersen G.G. Khawaja S. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2275-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To test media of various pH levels, proliferating cells were incubated in DMEM with serum, lacking sodium bicarbonate, containing 30 mm HEPES buffer at each pH. Note that the pH of each medium refers to the pH of the HEPES buffer added, and may not reflect the pH maintained in the incubator. The pH of unbuffered control media was ∼7.3. The pH shift protocol (see Fig. 1B) entailed adding pH 7.0 medium, at 37 °C (i.e. maximum Glu tubulin content, see Fig.1A) to sub-confluent plates of L6 cells for 10 h to increase Glu MT level. Plates were rinsed once in cold pH 7.8 medium and placed at 4 °C for 1 h to depolymerize Glu MTs. Next, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h at pH 7.8 (i.e.minimum Glu tubulin content) allowing TTL to re-tyrosinate Glu tubulin protomers, thus reducing Glu tubulin level significantly. Finally, differentiation medium was added. 400 μmNO2Tyr was present in half the plates (+NO2Tyr plates) throughout the experiment, and both control plates and those with added NO2Tyr underwent the pH shift protocol. To prevent overgrowth of cultures during the time course, differentiation-defective cells were killed at 2 days with 18 μm β-d-arabinofuranoside, which has been shown not to interfere with myogenesis (22Chiu C.P. Blau H.M. Cell. 1984; 37: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).

MF20 hybridoma against muscle-specific myosin heavy chain was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; undiluted culture supernatant was used.

Anti-Glu tubulin, SG (1:6000) was previously described (9Gundersen G.G. Kalnoski M.H. Bulinski J.C. Cell. 1984; 38: 779-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Preparation of cell lysates, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunostaining were described in Chapin and Bulinski (23Chapin S.J. Bulinski J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), blots were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin; bound antibodies were detected with SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Northern blots were performed exactly as described in Gruber et al. (24Gruber D. Faire K. Bulinski J.C. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 2001; 49: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), using actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes from Ambion (the latter for normalization of RNA loads). Immunofluorescence was performed as described in Gundersen et al. (16Gundersen G.G. Khawaja S. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2275-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Antibodies were diluted as follows: anti-β-tubulin, 3F3, 1:100; anti-Glu, SG, 1:400; and secondary antibodies, 1:100. Images, captured with an Orca-cooled charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) equipped with a Uniblitz Shutter (Vincent Associates), and attached to a Nikon Optiphot microscope, were processed with MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). Preparation of brain TCP, [14C]tyrosine-labeled MT substrate, and the TCP assay, were described previously (25Webster D.R. Modesti N.M. Bulinski J.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5849-5856Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Webster D.R. Oxford M.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, [14C]tyrosine-labeled tubulin dimers were self-assembled in MHM (25 mm MOPS, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2) for 20 min, stabilized by Taxol (20 μm, 5 min), and centrifuged, all at 37 °C (436,000 × g, 4 min, Optima TL centrifuge; Beckman Instruments) to yield a MT substrate pellet. For the first incubation step, i.e. binding of TCP to MT substrate, the pellet from the previous step was incubated in MHM (10 min, 37 °C) with 5 volumes of crude brain TCP and 20 μm Taxol (26Webster D.R. Oxford M.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the mixture was centrifuged as before, except at 25 °C. For the second incubation step, measuring TCP activity, the pellet from the previous step was resuspended in MHM (30 min, 37 °C), proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) at 4 °C, centrifuged (245,000 × g, Optima TL), and radioactivity of trichloroacetic acid-soluble (i.e.containing [14C]tyrosine cleaved by TCP), and insoluble fractions were counted. Nitrotyrosinated MT substrate was prepared by resuspending [14C]tyrosine MT substrate (above) in 100 mmTris, pH 8.2 (alkaline pH to allow tyrosine nitration but no cysteine oxidation), and incubating with 4 mm tetranitromethane, 4% ethanol (1 h, 37 °C). [14C]Nitrotyrosinated MTs (NO2Tyr content, 2 mol/mol tubulin dimer, quantified fromA430 nm), were centrifuged (436,000 × g, 4 min), washed with Tris buffer, centrifuged as before, and used in the TCP assay above. Release of [14C]NO2Tyr into the supernatant during the second incubation was measured. To ascertain the mechanism by which NO2Tyr inhibits generation of Glu MTs, we assayed its effects on TCP activityin vitro. MT substrate containing [14C]tyrosine-labeled α-tubulin was first incubated with TCP preparations to allow binding of enzyme to MT substrate. TCP·MT substrate complex was then incubated, and TCP activity was measured as [14C]tyrosine released from the C terminus of the substrate's α-tubulin (Refs. 24Gruber D. Faire K. Bulinski J.C. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 2001; 49: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar and 26Webster D.R. Oxford M.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, see “Experimental Procedures”). We first tested whether free NO2Tyr affected binding of TCP to MT substrate. Table I shows that adding NO2Tyr to the initial incubation of MT substrate with TCP did not affect TCP activity measured, suggesting that free NO2Tyr does not inhibit the binding of TCP to the MT substrate.Table IInhibition of TCP activity by NO2 TyrA) NO2 Tyr does not inhibit binding of TCP to MT substrate1-aNO2 Tyr was added to TCP-substrate mixture during the first incubation (the binding step; see “Experimental Procedures”).

Open table in a new tab Next, we added NO2Tyr during the second incubation, which quantified activity of TCP to generate Glu tubulin. We detected no difference without and with 1 mm NO2Tyr, indicating that, at a concentration of 1 mm(i.e. 2.5 times that used in vivo), free NO2Tyr did not interfere with activity of TCP once it was bound to MT substrate. However, in samples containing 10 mmNO2Tyr, 25 times the concentration used in vivo, we did measure a small but significant (<25%, p < 0.05) decrease in TCP activity (Table I). Because TCP activity was inhibited only at such high NO2Tyr concentrations, and TCP·MT substrate binding was not inhibited, it is unlikely that free NO2Tyr interferes significantly with detyrosinationin vitro or in vivo. Next, we tested whether nitrotyrosinated MT (NO2Tyr-MT) substrate (i.e. MTs with incorporated NO2Tyr) could inhibit detyrosination by TCP. NO2Tyr-MT substrate, prepared by reacting 14C-labeled MT substrate with tetranitromethane (see “Experimental Procedures”), inhibited TCP activity effectively (Table I), and this inhibition was due to nitrotyrosination, rather than denaturation, of MT substrate, because activity was unaffected by solvent alone (Table I). The facts that 1) TCP activity bound to and sedimented with NO2Tyr-MT substrate (data not shown) and 2) NO2Tyr-MT-bound TCP cleaved neither 14C-labeled-NO2Tyr nor14C-labeled Tyr suggested that TCP was effectively sequestered on NO2Tyr-MTs in the enzyme-substrate mixtures. One would expect similar inhibition in vivo; that is, TCP would bind NO2Tyr-MTs tightly and would neither cleave NO2Tyr from the MTs nor readily dissociate to cleave other Tyr-MTs in the cell. In addition, these results predict that the species inhibiting TCP in vivo would be NO2Tyr-MTs rather than free NO2Tyr. A suitable in vivo detyrosination inhibitor must satisfy three criteria: First, the inhibitor must be nontoxic to L6 cells during the experimental time course. Second, incorporation must be efficient enough either to block α-tubulin detyrosination completely or to prevent increased detyrosination during myogenesis. Third, the compound has to be incorporated only post-translationally and only into α-tubulin. Although all three criteria were met for use of NO2Tyr in undifferentiated cells (17Eiserich J.P. Estevez A.G. Bamberg T.V., Ye, Y.Z. Chumley P.H. Beckman J.S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6365-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), satisfying these criteria in differentiating cells demanded further efforts. For the first criterion, we examined possible toxicity by incubating either proliferating or differentiated L6 cells with NO2Tyr in culture medium for 10 days. No detectable effects on mitosis or other deleterious effects such as cell death were observed (data not shown), and proliferation and/or differentiation rates were nearly normal (≥90% of controls; data not shown). The second criterion, achieving efficient incorporation of the inhibitor, posed a significant challenge. Merely incubating L6 cells for 7 days in culture medium with 400 μm or even 800 μm NO2Tyr did not result in diminution of Glu tubulin level, or incorporation of NO2Tyr, as detected with Glu or NO2Tyr antibodies, respectively (data not shown). The inefficiency of NO2Tyr to perturb detyrosination was not surprising, because proliferating mammalian cells possess highly dynamic MTs (10Schulze E. Asai D.J. Bulinski J.C. Kirschner M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), Glu MTs compose only a small subset (<5%), and Glu tubulin resides exclusively in polymer (5Gundersen G.G. Khawaja S. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 23Chapin S.J. Bulinski J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), where it is unavailable to TTL. Thus, in proliferating cells <5% of the tubulin is available for detyrosination and subsequent re-tyrosination by TTL. To prevent the ∼20-fold increase in Glu MTs during myogenesis, we had to improve NO2Tyr incorporation into MTs and, thus, inhibition of TCP before inducing differentiation. One strategy for effecting increased NO2Tyr incorporation would be to perturb in vivo MT dynamics in NO2Tyr-containing culture medium, allowing TTL to incorporate NO2Tyr, in lieu of tyrosine, into Glu protomers (21Kalisz H.M. Erck C. Plessmann U. Wehland J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 1131-1138Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For example, transiently stabilizing MTs would generate Glu MTs (5Gundersen G.G. Khawaja S. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); destabilizing these Glu MTs in the presence of NO2Tyr would release Glu tubulin protomers that could be nitrotyrosinated by TTL. We initially attempted to develop a MT stabilization-destabilization protocol using Taxol to stabilize MTs (5Gundersen G.G. Khawaja S. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); however, Taxol treatments proved irreversible. Instead, we explored using pH to influence MT stability, based on reports that pH affects MT polymerization in vivo (27Watanabe K. Hamaguchi M.S. Hamaguchi Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1997; 37: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1A, lower extracellular pH enhanced detyrosination, reaching a maximum Glu tubulin level at pH 7.0. Glu tubulin level was lower at media pH levels of 7.2–7.5 and was not detected at media pH 7.6–8.0 (Fig.1A). Overexposure of blots revealed a nadir in Glu tubulin level at pH 7.8 (data not shown). Staining of blots with anti-acetylated tubulin, a standard indicator of stable MTs (10Schulze E. Asai D.J. Bulinski J.C. Kirschner M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), suggested that changes in Glu tubulin level were correlated with changes in MT stability (data not shown). Fig. 1B shows the pH shift protocol devised from these data, which satisfied the second criterion for use of NO2Tyr, that is, maximizing its incorporation into α-tubulin. Briefly, we first exposed L6 cell cultures to pH 7.0 medium for 10–12 h to stabilize MTs and increase Glu MT level. We then cold-treated the cells and incubated them in pH 7.8 medium for 12 h to destabilize MTs. Finally, we applied differentiation medium to start myogenesis. With or without added NO2Tyr, all cells underwent the pH shift protocol, which markedly improved NO2Tyr incorporation (Fig. 1C, lane a), compared with simply incubating cells in NO2Tyr (Fig. 1C, lane b). In fact, densitometry of anti-NO2Tyr-labeled blots revealed >8-fold more NO2Tyr incorporation in lane a than in lane b. Moreover, other means of reversibly stabilizing MTs, e.g. transient sodium azide treatment, also increased NO2Tyr incorporation into tubulin, and myogenesis was altered identically (data not shown). The third criterion, that the inhibitor must be incorporated strictly post-translationally, and only into α-tubulin, was met in nonmuscle cells (17Eiserich J.P. Estevez A.G. Bamberg T.V., Ye, Y.Z. Chumley P.H. Beckman J.S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6365-6375Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Likewise, in L6 cells we could not detect translational incorporation of NO2Tyr. However, concerned that the slightly slower cell growth rate (<10%) we observed in NO2Tyr-treated versus control cells could result from translational incorporation of NO2Tyr, albeit at a level not detectable even on the most sensitive Western blots (e.g. Fig. 1D), we treated cultures with an identical concentration (400 μm) of 2-nitro-p-cresyl (4-methyl-2-nitrophenol). This deaminated/decarboxylated version of NO2Tyr can neither be used in protein synthesis nor serve as a TTL substrate, and it was similarly nontoxic; we observed no mitotic defects or apoptosis. 2-Nitro-p-cresyl treatment yielded the same paltry inhibition of cell growth rate (<10%) as other nitrated phenol compounds that are incapable of translational incorporation (28Shiraishi F. Shimizu F. Kubota K. Kokuritsu Kogai Kenkyusho Kenkyu Hokoku. 1978; 5: 77-95Google Scholar). Thus, NO2Tyr appears to be incorporated only post-translationally. Exposing L6 cells to transient pH shifts in the continuous presence of NO2Tyr yielded incorporation only into α-tubulin; even the most sensitive Western blots revealed no other NO2Tyr-labeled species (Fig. 1D). We also noted that the severity of NO2Tyr effects on cell differentiation (see below) was strictly dependent upon the efficiency of NO2Tyr incorporation into tubulin. For example, proliferating or differentiated myoblasts or mature myotubes were all unaffected by a 10-day incubation with NO2Tyr if they were not first subjected to the pH shift protocol, and little NO2Tyr incorporation could be detected in cells that were NO2Tyr-treated without pH shift (Fig. 1C, lane b). The pH shift procedure changes MT dynamics (Fig.1B), heightening the incorporation of NO2Tyr by TTL into protomeric Glu tubulin; however, it is unlikely that changing the dynamics of MTs would change incorporation of NO2Tyr into nontubulin proteins. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that in our experiments NO2Tyr was added only post-translationally and only to α-tubulin. To inhibit Glu MT formation during myogenesis, we first subjected L6 myoblasts to the pH shift protocol and then placed them in differentiation medium and monitored their myogenesis for a 10-day period. Fig.2 documents the depletion of myogenesis-induced detyrosination. Note that a high level of Glu tubulin persisted throughout the pre-treatments with cold and pH 7.8, such that the Glu tubulin level was still elevated and NO2Tyr incorporation was undetectable at the time differentiation was induced (Fig. 2, lanes marked 0). However, by the 2-day time point, NO2Tyr incorporation could easily be detected and Glu tubulin level was greatly diminished (Fig. 2, lanes marked 2). Fig. 2 shows that NO2Tyr dramatically reduced Glu tubulin level (NO2Tyr lanes). In contrast, Glu tubulin was abundant in control cells (Fig. 2, C lanes) or cells exposed to NO2Tyr without prior pH shift (not shown). With or without NO2Tyr, cells commencing differentiation (Fig.2, 0 lanes) often contained a high Glu tubulin level, albeit markedly reduced in NO2Tyr-treated cells. Although NO2Tyr treatment markedly decreased Glu tubulin level for the first week of differentiation, the level of Glu tubulin increased during the time course, such that its level was similar in cells with or without NO2Tyr at the 10-day time point (Fig.2, 10 lanes, compare C and NO2Tyr). Eventual failure of the inhibitor could arise in one or both of two ways: First, even optimal incorporation efficiency would not result in nitrotyrosination of all tubulin molecules. Remaining Tyr tubulin, polymerized into Tyr MTs, could be detyrosinated during the differentiation time course. Second, Tyr tubulin synthesized and polymerized into Tyr MTs during the 10 days could also be detyrosinated. Detyrosination is a post-polymerization modification (5Gundersen G.G. Khawaja S. Bulinski J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); Glu MTs that appear during myogenesis in L6 cells represent a stable MT population, compared with their dynamic Tyr MT cou"
https://openalex.org/W2031236163,"Cartilage-derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein (CD-RAP) is a secreted protein expressed by chondrocytes; the expression is repressed by interleukin 1β (IL-1β). To investigate the transcriptional mechanism, by which CD-RAP expression is suppressed by IL-1β, deletion constructs of the mouse CD-RAP promoter were transfected into rat chondrocytes treated with or without IL-1β. The results revealed an IL-1β-responsive element located between −2138 and −2068 bp. As this element contains a CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) motif, the function of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ was examined. IL-1β stimulated the expression of C/EBPβ and -δ, and the direct binding of C/EBPβ to the C/EBP motif was confirmed. The −2251-bp CD-RAP promoter activity was down-regulated by co-transfection with C/EBP expression vectors. Mutation of the C/EBP motif abolished the inhibitory response to IL-1β. Additionally, C/EBP expression vectors were found to down-regulate the construct containing the promoter and enhancer of the type II collagen gene. Finally, the enhancer factor, Sox9, was shown to bind adjacent to the C/EBP site competing with C/EBP binding. Taken together, these results suggest that C/EBPβ and -δ may play an important role in the IL-1β-induced repression of cartilage-specific proteins and that expression of matrix proteins will be influenced by the availability of positive and negativetrans-acting factors.

Its physiological expression is primarily restricted to cartilage with transient expression in mammary buds and salivary glands (2Xie W.F. Zhang X. Sandell L.J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Pathologically, CD-RAP and its human homologue, melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA), are also expressed in various tumor tissues, such as chondrosarcoma, melanoma, and breast cancer (3Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Behl C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bosserhoff A.K. Moser M. Hein R.

Res. 1998; 16: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CD-RAP was originally cloned as a protein expressed in cartilage and down-regulated in chondrocytes that had been de-differentiated by treatment with retinoic acid (6Dietz U.H. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3311-3316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The protein structure of CD-RAP/MIA showed that it contains an Src homology 3 domain, which is unique for an extracellular protein. CD-RAP/MIA can interact with the type III repeat of fibronectin suggesting a model whereby CD-RAP/MIA binds to fibronectin and interferes with integrin binding (7Stoll R. Renner C. Zweckstetter M. Bruggert M. Ambrosius D. Palme S. Engh R.A. Golob M. Breibach I. Buettner R. Voelter W. Holak T.A. Bosserhoff A.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A recent study of CD-RAP-deficient mice showed that the mice have normal expression and distribution of type II collagen, aggrecan, and type X collagen but have increased density, increased diameter, and irregular arrangement of collagen fibrils (8Moser M. Bosserhoff A. Hunziker E.B. Sandell L.J. Fassler R. Buettner R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, CD-RAP may function to organize highly ordered ultrastructural fiber architecture. CD-RAP is regulated by various cytokines or growth factors; insulin and insulin-like growth factor I stimulate and basic fibroblast growth factor and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) suppress CD-RAP expression in bovine articular chondrocytes (9Kondo S. Cha S.H. Xie W.F. Sandell L.J. J. Orthop. Res. 2001; 19: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). IL-1β is one of the major cytokines that mediate inflammatory reactions. IL-1β promotes the arachidonic acid cascade resulting in production of prostaglandin (10Dinarello C.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and potentially osteoarthritis, IL-1β is thought to contribute to degradation of matrix proteins not only by the production of proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases but also by down-regulation of expression of the matrix proteins such as types II, IX, and XI collagen and aggrecan, resulting in the loss of the cartilage structure and prevention of repair (10Dinarello C.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 11Goldring M.B. Birkhead J. Sandell L.J. Kimura T. Krane S.M. J. Clin.

Adlam D.J. Woolley D.E. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Because CD-RAP is thought to be required for formation of the highly ordered ultrastructural fiber architecture (8Moser M. Bosserhoff A. Hunziker E.B. Sandell L.J. Fassler R. Buettner R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1438-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), down-regulation of CD-RAP gene may contribute further to loss of cartilage integrity. To date, little is known about the mechanism of IL-1β-induced repression of matrix proteins. IL-1β induces or activates many transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (14Vincenti M.P. Coon C.I. Brinckerhoff C.E. Arthitis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), Fos/Jun, early growth response-1 (15Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.F. Yamin R.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) families in chondrocytes (17Thomas B. Berenbaum F. Humbert L.

However, direct functions of these factors with respect to repression of matrix protein gene transcription have not been clearly determined. C/EBP is a family of basic leucine-zipper transcription factors with six known family members of C/EBPs as follows: C/EBPα, -β, -δ, -ε, -γ, and -ζ. Among these, C/EBPβ and -δ are known to be activated by IL-1β and TNF-α at the mRNA level (18Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T.

In response to these proinflammatory cytokines, C/EBPβ and/or -δ activate various genes related to inflammation, such as phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase-2 and manganese superoxide dismutase (17Thomas B.

C/EBPβ has two major isoforms, liver-enriched activator protein (LAP) and liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP). LAP is generally considered to be an activator, whereas LIP, which lacks most of trans-activation domain of LAP, can act as a dominant-negative inhibitor (18Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 33Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Thus, C/EBPβ can directly activate or inhibit the target gene. Here, we investigated the factors responsible for down-regulation of the CD-RAP gene by IL-1β, and we show that C/EBP plays a key role in this regulation. Furthermore, we show that C/EBP can down-regulate type II collagen gene transcription, thus suggesting that C/EBP might play an important role in down-regulation of various matrix proteins induced by IL-1β. We provide the first demonstration that C/EBP down-regulates the expression of a cartilage-specific matrix-associated gene and that it is a novel pathway mediating repressive effects of IL-1β.

Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4717-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The empty expression vectors were made by excision of cDNAs from the corresponding C/EBP expression vectors. All the plasmids were confirmed by sequencing or digestion with restriction enzymes. Rat chondrogenic cell line, RCJ 3.1C5.18, was maintained in αMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 nmdexamethasone, and 2% penicillin/streptomycin, as described before (34Xie W.F. Kondo S. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5026-5032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 2% penicillin/streptomycin (34Xie W.F. Kondo S. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5026-5032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For RNA or nuclear protein extraction, RCS cells were plated in 2 × 104/cm2 densities and cultured overnight. Human IL-1β was then added to the medium at the concentrations indicated. Primary chondrocyte culture was obtained from human articular cartilage. Full thickness slices of human cartilage were dissected from the normal knee joints of donors under aseptic conditions and subjected to sequential Pronase and collagenase P digestion to liberate chondrocytes from tissues. Isolate chondrocytes were plated at a density of 2 × 104/cm2 and cultured in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% FBS and 2% penicillin/streptomycin for 2 days. IL-1β was then added at a 2 ng/ml concentration, and cells were cultured for 24 or 48 h as indicated. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using Qiagen RNeasy mini kitTM, and 20 μg of total RNA/lane were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-NTM nylon membrane. The membranes were pre-hybridized for 5 h and then hybridized at 50 °C overnight in UltrahybTM hybridization medium with the various probes labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random priming procedure. To obtain specific probes for C/EBPβ and -δ, the sequences that have low homology with each other were chosen and digested from the corresponding expression vectors. Probe for CD-RAP was described before (34Xie W.F. Kondo S. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5026-5032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The hybridized membranes were then washed twice with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS buffer at 50 °C for 15 min and then by twice with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS buffer in 50 °C for 15 min. The specific signals from probes were obtained by autoradiography. DNA transfections of RCJ3.1C5.18 or RCS cells were performed using FuGENE 6TM transfection reagent. 1 × 105 of RCJ3.1C5.18 cells or 2.2 × 105 of RCS cells were cultured on a 12-well plate overnight or for 6 h, respectively. Transfection mixture containing 3 μl of FuGENE 6TM, 375 ng of various promoter constructs, and 125 ng of pCMV-βgal were then added, and the cells were cultured for 48 h with or without IL-1β as indicated. For co-transfection assay using C/EBP expression vector, 500 ng of expression vectors containing empty vector and C/EBP expression vector in various ratios were added to the transfection mixture. The cells were then harvested with Reporter Lysis BufferTM, and the lysate was analyzed for luciferase activity using Promega Luciferase Assay ReagentTM. The β-galactosidase activities were also measured to normalize variations in transfection efficiency. Each transfection experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. Nuclear extracts and cytoplasmic protein from RCJ3.1C5.15 or RCS cells were isolated using Nu-Clear Extraction KitTMaccording to the manufacturer's instructions. Sox9 and C/EBP-LIP proteins were synthesized using TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system with the Sox9 expression vector and the C/EBP-LIP expression vector, respectively. Fragment A (between −2138 and −2037 bp relative to the mouse CD-RAP translation start site) was amplified by PCR. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen, and complementary oligonucleotide was annealed to make double-stranded oligonucleotide. The fragment A or various double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP. Bandshifts were performed by incubating 4 μg of nuclear extracts in the mobility shift buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) or poly(dG-dC)) with the DNA probe at room temperature for 25 min.In vitro synthesized proteins were assayed as described before (35Xie W.F. Zhang X. Sakano S. Lefebvre V. Sandell L.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 42Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Zhou X. Sinha S. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the competition studies, the cold DNA fragments were added at a 100-fold molar excess compared with the probe and incubated for 15 min at room temperature before adding the DNA probe. For the antibody interference experiments, the nuclear extracts and 1 μl of antibody were preincubated in the buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The anti-Sox9 antibodies was generous gift from Dr. de Crombrugghe (43Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA protein complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 100 V for several hours. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. Thirty μg of cytoplasmic protein or nuclear extracts were denatured in SDS sample buffer contains 0.1 mdithiothreitol at 100 °C for 5 min and separated on a 4–20% Express GelTM in Tris/glycine/SDS buffer. The gels were then transferred to Hybond-C extraTM nitrocellulose membrane in Tris/glycine buffer, pH 8.3, containing 20% methanol. The membranes were saturated in 7% non-fat dry milk in PBS at room temperature for 1 h and hybridized with anti-C/EBP antibodies diluted to 1:2000 in PBS containing 1% dry milk. The hybridized antibodies were recognized by anti-rabbit IgG antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and the secondary antibodies were detected by autoradiograph using SuperSignalTM peroxidase substrate. Total RNA was isolated from the primary human articular chondrocytes, and 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed in the mixture of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (1.2 units/μl), oligo(dT)15(40 ng/μl), dNTP (1 mm each), and RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor (1.6units/μl) in 42 °C. Quantitative real time PCR was performed in the 50-μl reaction mixture containing 25 μl of SYBRTM Green PCR master mix, 1 μl of RT products, and 300 nm of primers using GeneAmpTM 5700 Sequence Detection System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The primer sequences are as follows: human GAPDH, 5′-TGGGCTACACTGAGCACCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGGTGTCGGTGTTGAAGTCA-3′ (antisense); human C/EBPβ, 5′-CTCGCAGGTCAAGAGCAAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCGTCGCTGTGCTTGTCC-3′ (antisense); human C/EBPδ, 5′-ATAGGAGCGCAAAGAAGCTACAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCGCAGTTTAGTGGTGGTAAGTC-3′ (antisense); human CD-RAP, 5′-CCTGGCAAAGTCGATGTGAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCACTGGCAGTAGAAATCCCATT-3′ (antisense); human COL2A1, 5′-TGGCTGGAGGATTTGATGAAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCTTGCATTACTCCCAACTGG-3′ (antisense). The cycle threshold (Ct) values for GAPDH and those of genes of interest were measured for each sample, and the relative transcript levels were calculated asx = 2−ΔΔCt, in which ΔΔCt = ΔIL − ΔC and ΔIL = CtIL-1β-CtGAPDH; ΔC = Ctctl − CtGAPDH. We have shown previously that the −2251-bp CD-RAP promoter contains elements sufficient for cartilage-specific expression in transgenic mice (2Xie W.F. Zhang X. Sandell L.J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that the expression of CD-RAP is down-regulated by IL-1β in primary chondrocyte cultures (9Kondo S. Cha S.H. Xie W.F. Sandell L.J. J. Orthop. Res. 2001; 19: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To identify the IL-1β-responsive element within CD-RAP promoter, three 5′-deletion constructs were transiently transfected into RCS cells and incubated in the absence or presence of IL-1β (Fig. 1). Regarding basal activities of the constructs in untreated RCS cells, −2251-bp promoter was stronger than −2138 bp, and −2138 bp was stronger than −2068 bp, suggesting there are activating elements between −2251 to −2138 bp and between −2138 to −2068 bp. The expressions of the −2251- and −2138-bp constructs were down-regulated by the IL-1β treatment, whereas the response was lost in the −2068 bp, thus suggesting that the IL-1β-responsive element is located between −2138 and −2068 bp. The expressions of C/EBPβ and -δ are known to be stimulated by IL-1β (18Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 20Tengku-Muhammad T.S. Hughes T.R. Ranki H. Cryer A. Ramji D.P. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As computer analysis revealed there was a potential binding site for C/EBPs between −2138 and −2068 bp, we examined whether IL-1β stimulates the expression of C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ in RCS cells (Fig.2, A and B). The expression levels of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were very low in steady state but were stimulated by IL-1β in 4–24 h increasing up to 48 h. The expression of CD-RAP was repressed by 48 h. Western blots for C/EBPβ revealed that in the absence of IL-1β treatment, a very small amount of C/EBPβ protein exists in the cytoplasm but not in nuclei (Fig. 2C). The treatment of IL-1β stimulated the expression of both of the isoforms of C/EBPβ, LAP (36 kDa), and LIP (20 kDa) that were localized in the nuclei. Protein expression of C/EBPδ was also stimulated by the IL-1β treatment (Fig.2C). To determine whether C/EBPβ functions within the IL-1β-responsive element, EMSA was carried out using nuclear extract from the RCJ3.1C5.18 cells. These cells were chosen because C/EBPβ is expressed in steady state (Fig.3A). Fragment A containing the sequence between −2138 and −2037 bp was used as a probe, and various cold oligonucleotides were used as competitors (Fig. 3B). Competitor 3, which has a potential binding site for C/EBPs at −2085/−2077 bp, competed with the binding of nuclear proteins and the probe (Fig. 3C). As expected, the mutant oligonucleotide 3, in which the C/EBP-binding site was mutated, did not compete with the binding, and supershift analysis confirmed that C/EBPβ bound to the sequence of native oligonucleotide 3 (Fig. 3D). The antibody for Ikaros, a transcription factor that is also a potent binding protein for the sequence of oligonucleotide 3, did not affect the band shift. EMSA for the nuclear extract of RCS cells treated with 10 ng/ml of IL-1β to induce C/EBPβ (see Fig. 2C) was also carried out using the oligonucleotide 3 as a probe to confirm that the IL-1β-induced C/EBPβ bound to the element (data not shown). The C/EBP-binding site was mutated in the −2251-bp construct using mutant oligonucleotide 3. The promoter activity of the mutant −2251-bp construct was about 2-fold stronger than that of wild type −2251-bp construct after transient transfection into RCJ3.1C5.18 cells, suggesting that C/EBPβ is acting as a repressor (Fig. 4). To investigate the C/EBP function in detail, the expression vectors for C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were co-transfected with wild type −2251-bp construct into RCS cells, in which endogenous C/EBP expression is very low (Fig.5A). Because C/EBPβ is known to act in different ways depending on the isoforms, we used the following three different expression vectors: pCMV-C/EBP-full-length, pCMV-LAP, and pCMV-LIP. The promoter activity of the −2251-bp construct was down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner by all three of the C/EBPβ expression vectors, no matter what isoform was expressed. C/EBPδ also down-regulated the activity of the −2251-bp construct. The presence of each expressed protein was confirmed by Western blot of lysate after the transfection (Fig.5B). The C/EBPβ or empty expression vectors (500 ng) and the −2251-bp construct were also co-transfected into undifferentiated ATDC5 mouse chondrogenic cell line. Interestingly, pCMV-C/EBP-FL and pCMV-LAP vectors stimulated promoter activity to 3.44 ± 0.57- and 30.2 ± 4.66-fold, respectively, whereas pCMV-LIP did not (1.03 ± 0.14). These data suggest that the repression induced by C/EBP expression vectors in RCS cells is neither because of nonspecific reaction nor poor function of these expression vectors.FIG. 5The promoter activity of the −2251-bp construct is down-regulated by co-transfection with C/EBP expression vectors.A, the −2251-bp construct was co-transfected into RCS cells with various C/EBP expression vectors. Expression vectors for C/EBPβ-full-length (FL), C/EBPβ-LAP, C/EBP-LIP, or C/EBPδ were added to the transfection mixture as indicated. Total amounts of expression vectors were adjusted to 500 ng using the empty expression vector in each transfection. The activity of −2251-bp constructs co-transfected with 500 ng of the empty expression vector is set at 100. Each bar represents the mean ± S.D.

https://openalex.org/W2143933896,"DsbA and DsbB are responsible for disulfide bond formation. DsbA is the direct donor of disulfides, and DsbB oxidizes DsbA. DsbB has the unique ability to generate disulfides by quinone reduction. It is thought that DsbB oxidizes DsbA via thiol disulfide exchange. In this mechanism, a disulfide is formed across the N-terminal pair of cysteines (Cys-41/Cys-44) in DsbB by quinone reduction. This disulfide is then transferred on to the second pair of cysteine residues in DsbB (Cys-104/Cys-130) and then finally transferred to DsbA. We have shown here the redox potential of the two disulfides in DsbB are −271 and −284 mV, respectively, and considerably less oxidizing than the disulfide of DsbA at −120 mV. In addition, we have found the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide of DsbB to actually be a substrate for DsbA in vitro. These findings indicate that the disulfides in DsbB are unsuitable to function as the oxidant of DsbA. Furthermore, we have shown that mutants in DsbB that lack either pair or all of its cysteines are also capable of oxidizing DsbA. These unexpected findings raise the possibility that the oxidation of DsbA by DsbB does not occur via thiol disulfide exchange as is widely assumed but rather, directly via quinone reduction.

In Escherichia coli, DsbA and DsbB1 catalyze the formation of disulfides (Dsb stands for DiSulfideBond) (1Collet J.F. Bardwell J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Mutations in either DsbA or DsbB lead to a severe defect in the oxidative folding of many secreted bacterial proteins as well as eukaryotic proteins expressed in the periplasm (2Hoshino K. Eda A. Kurokawa Y. Shimizu N. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). DsbA is a small periplasmic protein, which possesses an active site disulfide that rapidly reacts with unfolded proteins entering the periplasm, resulting in their oxidation. The disulfide in DsbA is very oxidizing with a redox potential of −120 mV (3Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). DsbA serves as a powerful relatively nonspecific oxidant. It has the potential of forming incorrect disulfides in proteins that possess more than two cysteines. These miss-oxidation events are thought to be resolved by the disulfide isomerase activity of two other periplasmic disulfide oxidoreductases, DsbC and DsbG. To be active as a catalyst, DsbA needs to be reoxidized. This is accomplished by an inner-membrane protein called DsbB. The novel catalytic activity of DsbB allows it to reoxidize DsbA by using the oxidizing power of the electron transport system (4Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 5Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi T.

Under aerobic conditions, DsbB reoxidizes DsbA and passes the electrons to ubiquinone. From ubiquinone, the electrons are passed on to cytochrome oxidases and then on to molecular oxygen (4Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 7Bader M.W. Xie T., Yu, C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Under anaerobic conditions, electrons are passed to menaquinone and then on to anaerobic electron acceptors. Thus, DsbB plays a central role in disulfide bond formation, because it uses the oxidizing power of quinones to generate disulfides de novo (4Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 7Bader M.W. Xie T., Yu, C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). DsbB is a 21-kDa inner-membrane protein with four transmembrane segments and two periplasmic loops (8Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Each loop contains a pair of cysteines, with each pair thought to form a disulfide bond (Fig.1). DsbB has also been shown to directly bind equimolar quantities of quinone with at least one high affinity-binding site (7Bader M.W. Xie T., Yu, C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). DsbB has the unique ability to generate disulfides via quinone reduction. The overall reaction scheme is shown below (SchemeFS1). Because this is the original source of disulfides in E. coli, identifying the mechanism of DsbB action is important for understanding disulfide bond formation and oxidative protein folding in vivo. A three-step model for the mechanism of DsbB has been proposed, which is depicted in Fig.2 (5Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). First, DsbA is directly reoxidized by the C-terminal disulfide (Cys-104/Cys-130) in DsbB. Thus, DsbA is released in an oxidized state and the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide is now in a reduced state. In the second step, the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide is reoxidized by the disulfide of the first domain (Cys-41/Cys-44), leaving the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide in an oxidized state while Cys-41/Cys-44 is in a reduced state. Finally, the Cys-41/Cys-44 cysteine pair is reoxidized by quinone. The disulfide exchange portion of this model was originally proposed by Kishigami and Ito (5Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is primarily supported by the following three findings: 1) When Cys-33 of DsbA is replaced by a serine, a mixed disulfide between Cys-104 of DsbB and Cys-30 of DsbA accumulates (5Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 9Guilhot C. Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Kishigami S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17072-17074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This mixed disulfide was assumed to represent a reaction intermediate stabilized by the DsbAC33S mutation, which led the authors to conclude that the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide directly reoxidizes DsbA. The actual reoxidation of DsbA by the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide was never directly observed (9Guilhot C. Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Kobayashi T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Kadokura H. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2354-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 2) The Cys-41/Cys-44 disulfide in DsbB appears to be required for the formation of the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide. When a mutant of DsbB in which the Cys-41 and Cys-44 residues have been substituted by serine residues is expressed, the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide is found in a reduced statein vivo. In contrast, wild type DsbB is found in a fully oxidized form with both disulfides formed after in vivothiol trapping (11Kobayashi T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). From these experiments the authors concluded that the Cys-41/Cys-44 disulfide directly oxidizes the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide. This again, has not yet been directly observed (11Kobayashi T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Kadokura H. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2354-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 3) The Cys-41/Cys-44 disulfide in DsbB is resistant to DTT-mediated reduction in vivo as long as electron transport is not impaired (11Kobayashi T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). From these results it was concluded that the electron transport chain causes the oxidation of the Cys-41/Cys-44 pair of cysteines, presumably directly via quinone. The overall mechanism depicted in Fig. 2 thus involves the formation of a disulfide in the first periplasmic domain via components of the electron transport pathway. This disulfide is then passed on to the cysteines in the second periplasmic domain and then on to DsbA.Figure 2Current model for the mechanism of DsbB. DsbB maintains DsbA in an oxidized state in vivo via its novel ability to generate disulfides in DsbA by reducing quinones. A three-step model for the mechanism of DsbB has been proposed and is depicted here (5Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 1, reduced DsbA is reoxidized by the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide of DsbB, releasing DsbA in an oxidized state and the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide of DsbB in a reduced state;2, the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide is then reoxidized by the Cys-41/Cys-44 disulfide, releasing the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide in an oxidized state and the Cys-41/Cys-44 in a reduced state; 3, finally, the Cys-41/Cys-44 disulfide is regenerated via quinone reduction. The arrows show the direction of electron flow, which is opposite that of disulfide flow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kadokura and Beckwith (12Kadokura H. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2354-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) recently investigated the mechanism of DsbB and propose a more complicated model of disulfide exchange within DsbB that is different from the model suggested by Ito and coworkers. To obtain this model, the authors split DsbB into two fragments (α and β), each fragment containing one pair of cysteines. DsbB-α contains the Cys-41/Cys-44 pair and DsbB-β contains the Cys-104/Cys-130 pair. When coexpressed, these two fragments can reconstitute DsbB activityin vivo. The authors isolated a disulfide-bonded ternary complex between DsbA, DsbB-β, and DsbB-α. These results could not be explained by the original model and led the authors to propose that the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide does not directly reoxidize DsbA itself, but cooperates with the Cys-41/Cys-44 disulfide in a more complex mechanism of thiol disulfide exchange that results in the oxidation of DsbA. These results suggest that the originally proposed model of DsbB function needs to be revisited. Key to both models is the assumption that the stable mixed disulfide bond that can be observed between the DsbACys-33 mutant and DsbB (9Guilhot C. Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9895-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,10Kishigami S. Kanaya E. Kikuchi M. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17072-17074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and between DsbB-α and DsbB-β (12Kadokura H. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2354-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), represent normal intermediates in the reaction mechanism. However, reaction intermediates generally are highly unstable. Therefore, themore stable the mixed disulfide is, the lesslikely it is that it represents a real intermediate (13Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). When studying disulfide exchange reactions within a multicysteine protein, removal of one cysteine may not completely block disulfide exchange, leading to the accumulation of the intermediate normally present prior to the block. Instead, the unstable reaction intermediates have the tendency to rapidly rearrange to the most stable configurations. Work on the folding pathway of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor has shown that so called “reaction intermediates” can as easily be products that lie off the folding pathway as real intermediates (13Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1386-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 14Bulaj G. Goldenberg D.P. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1825-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, if DsbB functions via a single obligatory disulfide exchange pathway, then removal of any one cysteine within DsbB should inactivate the pathway. Although the cysteines within DsbB are clearly important for the activity of DsbB, they appear not to be absolutely essential. Jander et al. (1994) carefully analyzed the phenotype of strains that contain mutations in cysteines of DsbB (8Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). They noted that strains containing mutations in Cys-44 or Cys-104 show a greater defect in disulfide bond formation in vivo than strains containing mutations in Cys-41 or Cys-130. Additionally, Kishigami and Ito report that in vivo, residues Cys-41 and Cys-44 of DsbB appear to be “dispensable to a certain extent” (5Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because none of the cysteines in DsbB appear to be absolutely essential, it now seems prudent to consider roles for these cysteines other than in direct disulfide exchange with DsbA. They could be involved in structural disulfides, metal, or other cofactor binding sites or in changing the reactivity of the quinone bound to DsbB or in the ability of DsbB to exchange oxidized quinone for reduced quinone. Cysteines, of course, have many functions within proteins apart from being involved in catalytic disulfides. Methanol dehydrogenase from Methylobacterium is a quinone binding protein that contains a disulfide near the active site that remarkably, like DsbB, is formed between two adjacent cysteines. This disulfide, although important for the catalytic activity of the enzyme, “does not appear to function as a redox component of the mechanism. Rather it may function in the stabilization or protection of the free radical semiquinone form of the prosthetic group from solvent at the entrance to the active site.” (15Avezoux A. Goodwin M.G. Anthony C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) These considerations and our desire to understand the mechanism of DsbB, which is central to the creation of disulfide bonds in the cell, made it clear that further study of this reaction mechanism is necessary. The results presented here suggest that DsbB can directly form disulfides in DsbA de novo in a reaction that does not depend upon direct thiol disulfide exchange. All proteins were purified as described previously (4Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 7Bader M.W. Xie T., Yu, C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In brief, DsbA was purified from periplasmic extracts of the DsbA-overproducing strain JCB607 via anion exchange chromatography using a 5-ml HiTrap Q-Sepharose HP column. Periplasmic extracts were loaded onto the column equilibrated with 10 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.0, and DsbA was eluted using a 500-ml gradient from 10 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.0, to 10 mm MOPS/NaOH, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Fractions containing DsbA were reduced with 20 mm DTT, pooled, and dialyzed against 2× 4 liters of 0.1 mm EDTA. The DsbA protein was then concentrated, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Mutant DsbB derivatives that just contain the Cys-41/Cys-44 cysteine pair where the other cysteines are substituted with serine (abbreviated DsbB[CCSS] a DsbB[SSCC] derivative that just contains the Cys-104/Cys-130 pair and a cysteine free derivative of DsbB, called DsbB[SSSS], have been previously described (4Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). His-tagged DsbB[CCSS], DsbB[SSCC], and DsbB [SSSS] were purified like His-tagged DsbB according to Bader et al. (4Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar,7Bader M.W. Xie T., Yu, C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Components of the DsbA-DsbB pathway were incubated at room temperature in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside for the specified time periods. The proteins were then precipitated with 12% trichloroacetic acid that contained a 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin carrier and pelleted at 15,000 rpm in a Taylor Scientific 1624VS microcentrifuge 20 min at 4 °C. Pellets were then washed with acetone and modified with an AMS trap solution (10 mm 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidystilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS), 100 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.7) as described previously (16Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 17Zander T. Phadke N.D. Bardwell J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The proteins were then subjected to non-reducing 14% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE (Novex) and visualized by a rapid Coomassie Blue stain (18Wong C. Sridhara S. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. BioTechniques. 2000; 28 (, 430, 432): 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). When required, the DsbB or DsbA proteins were reduced with 25 mm DTT on ice for 30 min. The DTT was then removed via gel filtration using Amersham Biosciences PD10 columns. To determine the redox potential of our mutants, purified DsbB was incubated with mixtures of oxidized and reduced DTT. To establish that these reactions were at equilibrium, the incubation reactions were performed for both 1 and 15 h and showed identical results. Samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and modified with AMS as described above. Quantification of band intensities was performed using National Institutes of Health IMAGE 1.62. The curves were generated using SigmaPlot. The redox potentials were calculated from the equilibrium constant with DTT as previously described (19Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The model for the mechanism of DsbB that is shown in Fig. 2(5Kishigami S. Ito K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) makes a number of specific predictions about the reactivity of the various components of the pathway when mixed and about the redox properties of the cysteine pairs in DsbB. First, when oxidized quinone is mixed with DsbB, it should directly oxidize the Cys-41/Cys-44 cysteine pair. This disulfide can then be transferred to the Cys-104/Cys-130 cysteine pair. Second, DsbB variants that contain only the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide should be sufficient to oxidize DsbA in a stoichiometric fashion. In addition, mutants in DsbB lacking the Cys-104/Cys-130 pair of cysteines or all of the cysteines should be inactive in oxidizing DsbA, even in a stoichiometric fashion. Third, the Cys-41/Cys-44 and the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfides formed within DsbB should both be substantially more oxidizing than the active site disulfide of DsbA (−120 mV) and less oxidizing than ubiquinone (+110 mV). Given that electron transport occurs down an electrochemical gradient, one should be able to rank the redox potentials of these components from the most oxidizing to the least oxidizing in the order: ubiquinone → Cys-41/Cys-44 (DsbB) → Cys-104/Cys-130 (DsbB) → DsbA. Finally, DsbA should be unable to oxidize DsbB. When DsbB reoxidizes DsbA, it passes the electrons directly on to quinone as part of its catalytic cycle (4Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 7Bader M.W. Xie T., Yu, C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We began our investigation into the mechanism of DsbB by seeking to determine which disulfide bond is directly formed by oxidized quinone. To do this, we used AMS/gel-shift experiments with a mutant of DsbB that only contained the first pair of cysteines (Cys-41/Cys-44), the second pair (Cys-104/Cys-130) were substituted with serines (abbreviated DsbB[CCSS]) or with the mutant DsbB[SSCC] that only contained the second pair of cysteines (Cys-104/Cys-130). Both of these proteins as well as the cysteine-free mutant DsbB[SSSS] used later, contained 50–70% quinone bound after purification, similar to the amount found to be bound to wild type DsbB. Because residues from both the first and second periplasmic domains of DsbB have been shown to be involved in quinone interaction (20Kadokura H. Bader M. Tian H. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10884-10899Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Kobayashi T. Takahashi Y. Ito K. Mol.

DsbB[CCSS]red and DsbB[SSCC]red were incubated at room temperature in the absence or presence of oxidized quinone. The reaction was stopped by trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidystilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS), modification. AMS is a maleimide derivative that specifically, rapidly, and irreversibly alkylates free thiols by the addition of a ∼0.5-kDa moiety per thiol group (17Zander T. Phadke N.D. Bardwell J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The resulting increase in mass of the modified protein can easily be visualized on non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels. This technique allows one to follow the redox status of a thiol-containing protein. Using this technique we found that quinone is able to oxidize the Cys-41/Cys-44 disulfide in DsbB and was unable to interact with the Cys-104/Cys-130 cysteine pair. To show that the oxidation of the Cys-41/Cys-44 disulfide pair is not due to air oxidation, we incubated 10 μmDsbB[CCSS]red and DsbB[SSCC]red in the absence of quinone for either 10 min (Fig.3a, lanes 2 and3 and Fig. 3b, lanes 2 and3), and up to 60 min (data not shown) and we observed no spontaneous oxidation. A 2-fold molar excess of oxidized quinone (20 μm of Q0C10) added to DsbB[CCSS] oxidized the protein completely within less than 1 min (Fig. 3a). In contrast DsbB[SSCC] remained reduced after 10 min (Fig. 3b) or even after 60 min (data not shown) in the presence of oxidized quinone. These results show that the Cys-41/Cys-44 motif in DsbB is completely and rapidly oxidized by Q0C10, whereas the Cys-104/Cys-130 cysteine pair is not. This experiment also directly shows the de novo formation of a disulfide by quinone reduction. These results are consistent with previous results and with the model for the mechanism of DsbB that is shown in Fig.2. In these figures we have observed uniform recovery of material after trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Some sample to sample variation in recovery was observed in some of the subsequent figures; fortunately, this can be easily compensated for simply by observing what the ratio of oxidized to reduced protein is rather than focusing on the total amount of protein present in each lane. Next we wanted to investigate whether the Cys-41/Cys-44 disulfide is able to directly oxidize the Cys-104/Cys-130 cysteine pair. To monitor this interaction we observed the reaction between wild type DsbB and quinone. 10 μmDsbB[CCCC]red (wild type) was incubated at room temperature for 10 or 60 min in the absence of added quinone, and no detectable spontaneous oxidation could be observed (Fig. 3c, lane 2, and data not shown). In contrast, the addition of a 2-fold molar excess (20 μm) of quinone to this reduced protein caused the oxidation of both disulfide bonds within 1 min of incubation (Fig. 3c). Because both disulfides of wild type DsbB are formed when quinone is added and because we showed previously that only the Cys-41/Cys-44 disulfide of DsbB is directly oxidized by quinone (Fig. 3, a and b), we conclude that the Cys-41/Cys-44 disulfide needs to be formed to allow for the oxidation of the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide. The simplest way that this could happen is for the Cys-41/Cys-44 disulfide to be transferred directly to the second pair of cysteines in DsbB, thereby oxidizing them. We favor this interpretation of the data, although it is conceivable that the formation of the first disulfide increases the reactivity of the quinone bound to DsbB in such a way that the quinone is then able to also directly oxidize the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide. Our results show that Q0C10 is able to completely oxidize wild type DsbB, despite the fact that only the Cys-41/Cys-44 cysteine pair of reduced DsbB can be directly oxidized by quinone. Our finding, that quinone is able to oxidize Cys-41/Cys-44, which in turn is capable of oxidizing the Cys-104/Cys-130 disulfide, shows that DsbB can self-oxidize and is consistent with the model for DsbB action as shown in Fig. 2. Next we wanted to determine which disulfide in DsbB is capable of oxidizing DsbA. We incubated 20 μm DsbAred with either 10 μm DsbB[CCCC]ox (wild type) or the single cysteine pair mutants DsbB[CCSS]ox or DsbB[SSCC]ox, and the cysteine-less mutant DsbB[SSSS] in the absence of added quinone, and followed the redox status of both DsbA and DsbB over time. We observed that wild type DsbB and all mutants of DsbB, including the cysteine-free variant, are able to oxidize DsbAred (Fig. 4,a–d). This shows that the cysteines in DsbB are not essential for its ability to oxidize DsbA. DsbA, which was added in an approximate 2-fold excess over DsbB, was only partially oxidized, suggesting that DsbB is acting in a stoichiometric fashion. To confirm that this was a stoichiometric process and not a very slow catalytic process, we simply reduced the amount of DsbB 5-fold to 2 μm but incubated five times longer. Under these conditions, DsbA was only partially oxidized and the amount did not increase over time. This indicated that, in the absence of added quinone, wild type DsbB as well as all the cysteine mutants act in a stoichiometric fashion (Fig. 4e). This oxidation of DsbA cannot be due to disulfide transfer between DsbB and DsbA, because the disulfide bonds of wild type DsbB and the CCSS and SSCC mutants of DsbB remain in an oxidized state throughout the time-course. In addition, the cysteine-free mutant of DsbB was at least as capable as wild type DsbB in oxidizing DsbA. If it is not the disulfides in DsbB that oxidize DsbA, then what is? We considered three possibilities: (a) a transition metal contaminant or other small molecule present in the solution oxidizes DsbA, (b) more interestingly, that the quinone bound to DsbB directly oxidizes DsbA in a stoichiometric fashion, or (c) that a small amount of chromosomally encoded wild type DsbB protein present in the DsbB mutant overproducing strains may have copurified with the DsbB mutants. The first possibility seems unlikely since (a) EDTA was present in the incubation mixture, which should act to chelate free metals; (b) the oxidizing activity is heat-labile; and (c) DsbA is very slowly oxidized by metal-mediated air oxidation in a catalytic fashion (3Zapun A. Bardwell J.C. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To test for the presence of other small molecules that might stoichiometrically oxidize DsbA, we concentrated the DsbB preparation, using a 10,000-Da cutoff Centricon spin column and showed that the material that flows through this spin column is completely inactive in DsbA oxidation (data not shown). We decided it was also important to test directly wh"

The aim of the current study was to determine the underlying mechanisms of age-associated increase in COX-2 gene expression. The results demonstrate that increased COX-2 mRNA expression in the old mice is due to a higher rate of transcription rather than increased stability of COX-2 mRNA. Furthermore, the results show that LPS-induced ceramide levels from the old mice are significantly higher than those of young mice, whereas there is no age-related difference in concentration of its down stream metabolite, sphingosine. The addition of ceramide in the presence or absence of LPS resulted in a significant increase in PGE2 production in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Inhibition of ceramide conversion to sphingosine had no effect on this ceramide-induced effect. The ceramide-induced up-regulation in PGE2 production was mediated through increase in COX activity and transcriptional up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA.

Since several lines of evidence indicated that LPS and ceramide share a common pathway(s) leading to induction of COX-2, we hypothesized that ceramide mediates the age-associated increase in COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Recent studies have indicated that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) intermediates such as extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38 (30Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) are involved in LPS- as well as ceramide-induced COX-2 gene expression. Moreover, several transcription factors, which bind COX-2 gene-regulatory regions such as AP-1, and cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein have been shown to be regulated by these MAPKs (30Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, we further hypothesized that ceramide mediates the age-associated increase in MØ COX-2 mRNA expression via MAPKs.DISCUSSIONPGE2 is a proinflammatory eicosanoid, which has been indicated in pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and inflammation. An age-related increase in PGE2 production has been demonstrated in animal models (8Hayek M.G. Mura C., Wu, D. Beharka A.A. Han S.N. Paulson K.E. Hwang D. Meydani S.N. J.

Nutr. 1999; 70: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Previously we showed that the increase in MØ PGE2production with aging contributes to a decline in T cell-mediated immune function. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the age-associated increase in MØ PGE2 production is due to increased COX-2 mRNA and protein levels, leading to an increase in COX enzyme activity. Age-related increases in COX-2 gene have implications for many age-associated diseases such as cardiovascular, inflammatory, and neoplastic diseases. Thus, determining causative factors for the up-regulation of COX-2 gene expression is imperative. The aim of our current study was to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the age-associated increase in PGE2production.The results demonstrated that the age-related increase in LPS-induced MØ COX-2 expression is due to an increase in transcription of COX-2 message rather than an increase in stability of COX-2 mRNA. COX-2 transcription is regulated by several factors such as cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-10), corticosteroids, and sphingolipids. Comparison of cytokine production between young and old MØ showed that IL-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-10 cannot account for the age-related difference in COX-2 mRNA, since there were no age-associated differences in MØ production of these cytokines (data not shown). Furthermore, we previously showed that the addition of recombinant IL-6 to MØ from young mice or that of anti-IL-6 antibody to MØ from old mice did not influence their ability to produce PGE2 (45Beharka A.A.

We did not test the role of glucocorticoids in our system, since glucocorticoids inhibit rather than induce COX-2 gene expression (46Masferrer J.L. Reddy S.T. Zweifel B.S. Seibert K. Needleman P.

Biol. 2001; 21: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and aging has been shown to be associated with increased glucocorticoid levels (49Oxenkrug G.F. McIntyre I.M. Gershon S. J. Pineal Res. 1984; 1: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 50Harris N.R. Rumbaut R.E. Pathophysiology. 2001; 8: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have also ruled out the age-related differences of MØ responsiveness to LPS treatment as a possible contributing factor, since the stimulation of MØ with other stimuli, including phytohemagglutinin and calcium ionophore A-23186, also resulted in age-related differences in PGE2 production (51Hayek M.G. Meydani S.N. Meydani M. Blumberg J.B. J. Gerontol. 1994; 49: B197-B207Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate that the age-related difference in PGE2 production might be mediated through the postreceptor events.Another factor that has been shown to increase COX-2 expression is ceramide. Our results suggest that ceramide mediates the age-related increase in COX-2 expression. First we showed that old MØ have significantly higher LPS-induced ceramide levels compared with young mice, whereas there is no age difference in ceramide downstream metabolite sphingosine. Second, using C2-ceramide, we demonstrated that increasing ceramide levels in the young mice significantly increases PGE2 production and COX activity. These effects of ceramide were not altered when ceramide conversion to sphingosine was blocked. Our results further showed that ceramide significantly enhances PGE2 production by increasing COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 7) and that this increase in COX-2 gene expression is coupled to increased transcription of the COX-2 gene (Fig. 8).Additive effects of LPS and ceramide in young MØ (Fig. 6, Aand B) strongly support our hypothesis that ceramide mediates the higher LPS-induced COX-2 expression in old MØ. From our previous study (8Hayek M.G. Mura C., Wu, D. Beharka A.A. Han S.N. Paulson K.E. Hwang D. Meydani S.N. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2445-2451PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that old mouse MØ have higher levels of LPS-stimulated COX-2 mRNA, protein, and PGE2production. In a time frame that is consistent with age-associated up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA, ceramide also accumulated at a significantly higher concentration in the old mouse MØ compared with the MØ of young mice (Table I). Based on these observations, we suggest that LPS-induced higher accumulation of intracellular ceramide results in increased COX-2 mRNA, COX-2 protein, and PGE2 production in old mice. Although LPS stimulation in MØ from SMase knockout mice would provide further support for our proposed mechanisms, unfortunately only knockout mice for one isoform of SMase (i.e. the acidic form) are available. These animals, however, develop Niemann-Pick disease and die by the age of 10 months and thus would not be suitable to address the role of ceramide in COX-2 up-regulation of aged mice (typically more than 20 months old). Furthermore, the neutral and not the acidic SMase has been indicated in the observed age-related increase of ceramide levels in other tissues.The underlying mechanism for higher ceramide levels in old MØ was not determined in this study. The age-associated increase in LPS-induced ceramide generation in the old animals may be due to an increase in the sphingomyelinase activity (28Petkova D.H. Momchilova-Pankova A.B. Markovska T.T.

Although MAPKs have been indicated in LPS- and ceramide-induced COX-2 expression (30Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol.

Although we were not able to differentiate the ERK-1 effects from that of ERK-2 or to determine the contribution of nuclear and cytosolic MAPKs separately, currently there is no evidence that these various types of MAPKs are differentially affected by age. Furthermore, our preliminary results indicate that the ceramide effect might be mediated through NF-κB activation. 2D. Wu, M. Marko, K. Claycombe, K. E. Paulson, S. N.

We further demonstrated that LPS-induced increases in ceramide, but not its down stream metabolite, sphingosine, mediate the age-associated up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA, leading to increased COX-2 protein, enzyme activity, and PGE2 production. Findings from this study may serve as useful information toward developing therapeutic interventions to inhibit or delay age-associated dysregulation of the immune and inflammatory responses.

PGE2 is synthesized from the precursor arachidonic acid by the two cyclooxygenase isoenzymes: cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), which is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme, and COX-2, which has a low basal expression but is rapidly induced by inflammatory stimuli such as LPS.

The effect of sphingosine, however, might be due to its retroconversion to ceramide (23Ballou L.R. Chao C.P. Holness M.A. Barker S.C. Raghow R. J. Biol.

Since several lines of evidence indicated that LPS and ceramide share a common pathway(s) leading to induction of COX-2, we hypothesized that ceramide mediates the age-associated increase in COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. Recent studies have indicated that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) intermediates such as extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and p38 (30Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) are involved in LPS- as well as ceramide-induced COX-2 gene expression. Moreover, several transcription factors, which bind COX-2 gene-regulatory regions such as AP-1, and cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein have been shown to be regulated by these MAPKs (30Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, we further hypothesized that ceramide mediates the age-associated increase in MØ COX-2 mRNA expression via MAPKs. DISCUSSIONPGE2 is a proinflammatory eicosanoid, which has been indicated in pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and inflammation. An age-related increase in PGE2 production has been demonstrated in animal models (8Hayek M.G. Mura C., Wu, D. Beharka A.A. Han S.N. Paulson K.E. Hwang D. Meydani S.N. J.

Nutr. 1999; 70: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Previously we showed that the increase in MØ PGE2production with aging contributes to a decline in T cell-mediated immune function. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the age-associated increase in MØ PGE2 production is due to increased COX-2 mRNA and protein levels, leading to an increase in COX enzyme activity. Age-related increases in COX-2 gene have implications for many age-associated diseases such as cardiovascular, inflammatory, and neoplastic diseases. Thus, determining causative factors for the up-regulation of COX-2 gene expression is imperative. The aim of our current study was to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the age-associated increase in PGE2production.The results demonstrated that the age-related increase in LPS-induced MØ COX-2 expression is due to an increase in transcription of COX-2 message rather than an increase in stability of COX-2 mRNA. COX-2 transcription is regulated by several factors such as cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-10), corticosteroids, and sphingolipids. Comparison of cytokine production between young and old MØ showed that IL-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-10 cannot account for the age-related difference in COX-2 mRNA, since there were no age-associated differences in MØ production of these cytokines (data not shown). Furthermore, we previously showed that the addition of recombinant IL-6 to MØ from young mice or that of anti-IL-6 antibody to MØ from old mice did not influence their ability to produce PGE2 (45Beharka A.A. Meydani M., Wu, D. Leka L.S. Meydani A. Meydani S.N. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2001; 56: B81-B88Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We did not test the role of glucocorticoids in our system, since glucocorticoids inhibit rather than induce COX-2 gene expression (46Masferrer J.L. Reddy S.T. Zweifel B.S. Seibert K. Needleman P.

Biol. 2001; 21: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and aging has been shown to be associated with increased glucocorticoid levels (49Oxenkrug G.F. McIntyre I.M. Gershon S. J. Pineal Res. 1984; 1: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 50Harris N.R. Rumbaut R.E. Pathophysiology. 2001; 8: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have also ruled out the age-related differences of MØ responsiveness to LPS treatment as a possible contributing factor, since the stimulation of MØ with other stimuli, including phytohemagglutinin and calcium ionophore A-23186, also resulted in age-related differences in PGE2 production (51Hayek M.G. Meydani S.N. Meydani M. Blumberg J.B. J. Gerontol. 1994; 49: B197-B207Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate that the age-related difference in PGE2 production might be mediated through the postreceptor events.Another factor that has been shown to increase COX-2 expression is ceramide. Our results suggest that ceramide mediates the age-related increase in COX-2 expression. First we showed that old MØ have significantly higher LPS-induced ceramide levels compared with young mice, whereas there is no age difference in ceramide downstream metabolite sphingosine. Second, using C2-ceramide, we demonstrated that increasing ceramide levels in the young mice significantly increases PGE2 production and COX activity. These effects of ceramide were not altered when ceramide conversion to sphingosine was blocked. Our results further showed that ceramide significantly enhances PGE2 production by increasing COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 7) and that this increase in COX-2 gene expression is coupled to increased transcription of the COX-2 gene (Fig. 8).Additive effects of LPS and ceramide in young MØ (Fig. 6, Aand B) strongly support our hypothesis that ceramide mediates the higher LPS-induced COX-2 expression in old MØ. From our previous study (8Hayek M.G. Mura C., Wu, D. Beharka A.A. Han S.N. Paulson K.E. Hwang D. Meydani S.N. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2445-2451PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that old mouse MØ have higher levels of LPS-stimulated COX-2 mRNA, protein, and PGE2production. In a time frame that is consistent with age-associated up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA, ceramide also accumulated at a significantly higher concentration in the old mouse MØ compared with the MØ of young mice (Table I). Based on these observations, we suggest that LPS-induced higher accumulation of intracellular ceramide results in increased COX-2 mRNA, COX-2 protein, and PGE2 production in old mice. Although LPS stimulation in MØ from SMase knockout mice would provide further support for our proposed mechanisms, unfortunately only knockout mice for one isoform of SMase (i.e. the acidic form) are available. These animals, however, develop Niemann-Pick disease and die by the age of 10 months and thus would not be suitable to address the role of ceramide in COX-2 up-regulation of aged mice (typically more than 20 months old). Furthermore, the neutral and not the acidic SMase has been indicated in the observed age-related increase of ceramide levels in other tissues.The underlying mechanism for higher ceramide levels in old MØ was not determined in this study. The age-associated increase in LPS-induced ceramide generation in the old animals may be due to an increase in the sphingomyelinase activity (28Petkova D.H. Momchilova-Pankova A.B. Markovska T.T.

We have also ruled out the age-related differences of MØ responsiveness to LPS treatment as a possible contributing factor, since the stimulation of MØ with other stimuli, including phytohemagglutinin and calcium ionophore A-23186, also resulted in age-related differences in PGE2 production (51Hayek M.G. Meydani S.N. Meydani M. Blumberg J.B. J. Gerontol. 1994; 49: B197-B207Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate that the age-related difference in PGE2 production might be mediated through the postreceptor events. Another factor that has been shown to increase COX-2 expression is ceramide. Our results suggest that ceramide mediates the age-related increase in COX-2 expression. First we showed that old MØ have significantly higher LPS-induced ceramide levels compared with young mice, whereas there is no age difference in ceramide downstream metabolite sphingosine. Second, using C2-ceramide, we demonstrated that increasing ceramide levels in the young mice significantly increases PGE2 production and COX activity. These effects of ceramide were not altered when ceramide conversion to sphingosine was blocked. Our results further showed that ceramide significantly enhances PGE2 production by increasing COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 7) and that this increase in COX-2 gene expression is coupled to increased transcription of the COX-2 gene (Fig. 8). Additive effects of LPS and ceramide in young MØ (Fig. 6, Aand B) strongly support our hypothesis that ceramide mediates the higher LPS-induced COX-2 expression in old MØ. From our previous study (8Hayek M.G. Mura C., Wu, D. Beharka A.A. Han S.N. Paulson K.E. Hwang D. Meydani S.N. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2445-2451PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that old mouse MØ have higher levels of LPS-stimulated COX-2 mRNA, protein, and PGE2production. In a time frame that is consistent with age-associated up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA, ceramide also accumulated at a significantly higher concentration in the old mouse MØ compared with the MØ of young mice (Table I). Based on these observations, we suggest that LPS-induced higher accumulation of intracellular ceramide results in increased COX-2 mRNA, COX-2 protein, and PGE2 production in old mice. Although LPS stimulation in MØ from SMase knockout mice would provide further support for our proposed mechanisms, unfortunately only knockout mice for one isoform of SMase (i.e. the acidic form) are available. These animals, however, develop Niemann-Pick disease and die by the age of 10 months and thus would not be suitable to address the role of ceramide in COX-2 up-regulation of aged mice (typically more than 20 months old). Furthermore, the neutral and not the acidic SMase has been indicated in the observed age-related increase of ceramide levels in other tissues. The underlying mechanism for higher ceramide levels in old MØ was not determined in this study. The age-associated increase in LPS-induced ceramide generation in the old animals may be due to an increase in the sphingomyelinase activity (28Petkova D.H. Momchilova-Pankova A.B. Markovska T.T.

Lipids. 1992; 27: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, GSH has been shown to inhibit neutral SMase activity and ceramide formation (57Yoshimura S. Banno Y. Nakashima S.

Blumberg J.B. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1987; 38: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 60Sasaki T. Senda M. Kim S. Kojima S. Kubodera A. Nucl. Med. Biol. 2001; 28: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it is feasible that the age-related decreases in GSH levels lead to increased neutral SMase activity, which in turn would result in higher ceramide levels in MØ from old mice. To determine signaling molecules responsible for the ceramide-induced age-associated increases in COX-2 mRNA, we tested the involvement of MAPKs. Although MAPKs have been indicated in LPS- and ceramide-induced COX-2 expression (30Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 39Chen C.C. Sun Y.T. Chen J.J. Chang Y.J. Mol.

Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), our results showed that the increase in LPS-induced ceramide generation leading to its subsequent up-regulation of COX-2 is unlikely to be due to increased activation of ERK, JNK, or p38 activities, because we found no differences in these MAPKs activity between young and old MØ. Although we were not able to differentiate the ERK-1 effects from that of ERK-2 or to determine the contribution of nuclear and cytosolic MAPKs separately, currently there is no evidence that these various types of MAPKs are differentially affected by age. Furthermore, our preliminary results indicate that the ceramide effect might be mediated through NF-κB activation. 2D. Wu, M. Marko, K. Claycombe, K. E. Paulson, S. N. Meydani, unpublished data. In conclusion, we have shown that increased MØ COX-2 gene transcription rather than increased COX-2 mRNA stability is responsible for the age-related increase in the rate of MØ COX-2 gene expression. We further demonstrated that LPS-induced increases in ceramide, but not its down stream metabolite, sphingosine, mediate the age-associated up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA, leading to increased COX-2 protein, enzyme activity, and PGE2 production. Findings from this study may serve as useful information toward developing therapeutic interventions to inhibit or delay age-associated dysregulation of the immune and inflammatory responses.

We show that GCN2 is phosphorylated by another kinase on serine 577, located N-terminal to the kinase domain. Mutation of Ser-577 to alanine produced partial activation of GCN2 in nonstarved cells, increasing the level of phosphorylated eIF2α, derepressing GCN4expression, and elevating the cellular levels of tryptophan and histidine. The Ala-577 mutation also increased the tRNA binding affinity of purified GCN2, which can account for the elevated kinase activity of GCN2-S577A in nonstarved cells where uncharged tRNA levels are low. Whereas Ser-577 remains phosphorylated in amino acid-starved cells, its dephosphorylation could mediate GCN2 activation in other stress or starvation conditions by lowering the threshold of uncharged tRNA required to activate the protein.

The degree of phosphorylation of a given protein is determined by a balance between the activities (or access) of the protein kinases and protein phosphatases that recognize it as a substrate. In many instances, protein kinases themselves are substrates for phosphorylation by other kinases. This strategy is used to relay activating signals from membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptors to intracellular kinases in signal transduction pathways. Kinase cascades also allow for the branching of a signal transduction pathway and for integration of regulatory signals at different steps in the cascade. A well studied example of protein kinase activation by phosphorylation in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae involves the MAP kinase cascades that regulate mating, filamentation, cell wall biosynthesis, and the response to osmotic shock (1Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The protein kinase GCN2 is a key regulator in the general amino acid control of S. cerevisiae. This system mediates increased transcription of more than 500 genes in response to starvation for an amino acid (2Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control.

The induced genes encode amino acid and purine biosynthetic enzymes and a variety of proteins involved peripherally in amino acid biosynthesis or in amino acid uptake or salvage (autophagy) (4Natarajan K.

GCN2 phosphorylates the α subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α),1 converting the eIF2 from a substrate to inhibitor of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. The inhibition of GDP-GTP exchange on eIF2 decreases formation of the ternary complex (eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAiMet) that transfers Met-tRNAiMet to the 40 S ribosome in the first step of translation initiation. A reduction in ternary complex levels decreases general protein synthesis but specifically increases translation of GCN4 mRNA, encoding the transcriptional activator of genes subject to general amino acid control. Four short open reading frames in theGCN4 mRNA leader function in a specialized reinitiation mechanism that represses GCN4 translation under nonstarvation conditions but derepresses it in response to a moderate reduction in ternary complex levels. Dominant activating mutations inGCN2 have been isolated that derepress GCN4translation even in nonstarved cells, and the strongest of theseGCN2c mutations also impair general translation and cell growth due to a severe reduction in ternary complex levels. GCN2 is activated in amino acid-starved cells by the binding of uncharged tRNA to a regulatory domain homologous to histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS), located C-terminal to the kinase moiety (9Wek S.A.

Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The HisRS domain is conserved in mouse GCN2 (12Berlanga J.J. Herrero S. de Haro C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32340-32346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,13Sood R.

Thus, activation by uncharged tRNA is likely to be an evolutionarily conserved feature of all GCN2 proteins. GCN2 contains other important regulatory domains besides the HisRS region. The extreme C-terminal segment of GCN2 (Cterm) also is needed for strong tRNA binding in vitro, suggesting that GCN2 contains a bipartite tRNA-binding surface (11Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The Cterm is additionally required for dimerization (15Qiu H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1808-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A degenerate kinase domain (ΨPK domain) located immediately N-terminal to the PK domain is required for GCN2 function in vivo (19Wek R.C. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4579-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), but its biochemical activity is unknown. The highly conserved extreme N terminus of GCN2 contains an important binding domain for the GCN1-GCN20 protein complex (20Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sattlegger Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Kubota H. Ota K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J.

The GCN1-GCN20 complex has ribosome binding activity (25Marton M.J. Aldana C.R.V.d. Qiu H. Chakraburtty K. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4474-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may interact with the decoding site on the ribosome (21Sattlegger Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the GCN1-GCN20 complex associates with GCN2 on translating ribosomes to facilitate transfer of uncharged tRNA from the decoding site to GCN2 (21Sattlegger Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The isolated Cterm can interact physically with the PK domain (Fig. 1), and this interaction was weakened by a mutation in the PK domain, GCN2c-E803V, that constitutively activates GCN2 function in vivo (16Qiu H. Dong J., Hu, C. Francklyn C.S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1425-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Jackson B.M. Freeman B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5801-5815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the E803V mutation increased the affinity of GCN2 for tRNA, it appeared that tRNA binding was inhibited by the PK-Cterm interaction. This inhibition could serve to restrict tRNA binding to amino acid-starved cells where the concentration of uncharged tRNA is high (11Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The N-terminal portion of the HisRS region (HisRS-N) also interacts with the PK domain (Fig. 1) and has a stimulatory effect on kinase function independent of its role in tRNA binding (16Qiu H. Dong J., Hu, C. Francklyn C.S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1425-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently, we discovered that the PK domain contains an autoinhibitory function that must be overcome to achieve high level kinase activity in vivo. Hence, we proposed that the wild-type PK domain in GCN2 has a defective active site that must be corrected by physical interaction with the HisRS-N region complexed with tRNA (45Qiu H., Hu, C. Dong J. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GCN2 autophosphorylates on threonine residues 882 and 887 in the activation loop between kinase subdomains VII and VIII, and mutation of these residues to alanine (Fig. 1) reduces or destroys, respectively, GCN2 function in vivo (32Romano P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C. Mathews M.B. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2282-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation in the activation loop can promote proper alignment of catalytic residues or induce the correct orientation of the two lobes of the kinase domain required for substrate binding or phosphoryl transfer (28Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 29De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 30Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 31Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation sites are critical forGCN2 function even in the presence of activating mutations that override the autoinhibitory mechanism in the PK domain. Thus, activation of GCN2 appears to be a two-step process wherein tRNA binding alters interactions between the PK and HisRS domains to eliminate the inhibitory structure in the PK domain, which in turn stimulates autophosphorylation of the PK activation loop (45Qiu H., Hu, C. Dong J. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although Thr882 and Thr887 were the only autophosphorylation sites used by GCN2 in vitro (32Romano P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C. Mathews M.B. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2282-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the protein is phosphorylated in vivo by one or more other kinases, since the catalytically inactive gcn2-K628R product is a phosphoprotein when purified from yeast cells (33Wek R.C. Ramirez M. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2820-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The sites of GCN2 phosphorylation by the unknown kinase(s) and the effects of these phosphorylation events on kinase activity have not been explored. Using mass spectrometry to identify phosphorylation sites in GCN2 purified from yeast, we have identified Ser-577 as a site of phosphorylation by another kinase in vivo. We show that this site is phosphorylated under nonstarvation conditions and that its replacement with alanine (S577A mutation) leads to partial activation of GCN2 in the absence of amino acid limitation. The S577A mutation increases the tRNA binding and eIF2α kinase activities of purified GCN2. These findings are consistent with the idea that Ser-577 phosphorylation impedes tRNA binding at low concentrations of uncharged tRNA and thereby promotes GCN2 latency in nonstarvation conditions. Since the level of Ser-577 phosphorylation was largely unchanged by histidine starvation, its dephosphorylation could provide the means to activate GCN2 when amino acid-replete cells are subjected to other forms of starvation or stress. Strains employed in this study are listed in Table I, and plasmids are listed in Table II. Plasmid pB107 was derived from p722 (26Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Jackson B.M. Freeman B.

Plasmid pDH101 was constructed in several steps.

This fragment was digested with PstI and BamHI and inserted between PstI and BamHI sites of pBluescript, resulting in pBS-FL. This plasmid was digested withSacI and MluI, and theSacI-MluI fragment encoding the FLAG and His6 tags was used to replace the corresponding fragment encoding the Myc tag in pB54 (20Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in pDH101. We verified that pDH101 and p722 (bearing wild-type GCN2 on the same vector) complemented the 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) sensitivity of agcn2Δ strain indistinguishably, indicating that the FLAG and His6 tags did not interfere perceptibly withGCN2 function in vivo. pDH115 was constructed by removing the 2.1-kb MluI-BspEI fragment of pDH103 and replacing it with the 2.1-kb MluI-BspEI fragment containing S577A produced by PCR using pB111 as template. The presence of S577A was verified by DNA sequencing.Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeSourceH1816a ura3–52 leu2–3 leu2–112 gcn2Δsui2Δtrp1-Δ63 p1108 (GCN4-lacZ, TRP1) p1097 (SUI2, LEU2)Ref. 41Dever T.E.

Immunoblot analysis of yeast wheat cell extracts (WCEs) using the latter three antibodies was conducted as described previously (20Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 50 ml of synthetic low phosphate medium containing dextrose (32Romano P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q.

The culture was grown to an A600 of ∼2.0, harvested, and resuspended in 2 ml of the same medium containing 2 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for an additional two cell doublings (3–4 h). Cells were harvested and washed with 5 ml of cold TN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 125 μm sodium orthovanadate) and complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (TN + PPI) and resuspended in 2 cell volumes of TN + PPI and 1 volume of glass beads. After vortexing eight times for 30 s each, detergents were added to the following final concentrations: 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. The lysate was vortexed once more and spun in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. The cleared lysate was immunoprecipitated by adding 2 μl of GCN2 antibodies (undiluted antiserum HL2523) prebound to protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed with TN + PPI, and the bound proteins were resolved by 6–12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed by autoradiography. The bound GCN2 was subjected to acid hydrolysis, and the peptides were resolved electrophoretically on thin layer chromatography plates as described previously (32Romano P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C. Mathews M.B. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2282-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG-, His6-tagged GCN2 (FL-GCN2) was purified from yeast strain GP3299 as described previously (11Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) except that the binding buffer BB contained 100 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 125 μm NaOVa4, 100 μm sodium molybdate, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 50 mmNaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Mass spectrometry analysis of peptides produced from FLAG-, His6-tagged GCN2 was carried out essentially as described previously (36Zhang X. Herring C.J. Romano P.R. Szczepanowska J. Brzeska H. Hinnebusch A.G. Qin J. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2050-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, following SDS-PAGE separation, FL-GCN2 was digested in gel with trypsin, and the peptides were extracted and, where appropriate, treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. A matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer was used to locate the phosphopeptides by measuring the masses of peptides and comparing them with the calculated theoretical masses of all tryptic peptides derived from GCN2. An electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer coupled to a monitor C18 column was used for on-line liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry sequence analysis of the phosphopeptide containing residues 577–583. Whole cell extracts were prepared and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (37Moehle C.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Yeast WCEs were prepared from cultures grown to midlog phase in either S.D. with minimal supplements or SC medium (38Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1974: 61-64Google Scholar) essentially as described (20Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that breaking buffer H-100 (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) 100 mm KCl), supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors, was used. The extracts were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads blocked with bovine serum albumin and immunoprecipitated with 1.2 μl of GCN2 antibodies (undiluted serum HL2523) prebound to protein A-Sepharose, all as described (20Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 4–12% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis using Ser(P)-577 antibodies, as follows. The antibodies were diluted 1:100 in 2% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing phosphatase inhibitors (125 mm β-glycerol phosphate and 100 mm NaF) and preabsorbed with a WCE from gcn2D strain H1894 at 150 μg of WCE/ml of diluted antiserum. After 1–2 h of incubation, the mixture was used to probe the membrane. The immune complexes were visualized using donkey anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro kinase assays and gel mobility shift assays were conducted essentially as described previously (11Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Purified GCN2 autophosphorylates only two residues, Thr-882 and Thr-886, located in the activation loop of the kinase domain (32Romano P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C. Mathews M.B. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2282-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the phosphoamino acid content of GCN2 in vivo, we labeled yeast cells expressing wild-type GCN2 or catalytically inactive gcn2-K628R (Fig.1) with [32P]orthophosphate, immunoprecipitated the GCN2 proteins, and conducted phosphoamino acid analysis on the immunopurified samples. The results shown in Fig.2 indicate that GCN2 and gcn2-K628R both were phosphorylated strongly on serine, to a small extent on threonine, and below the detection limit on tyrosine. These results are consistent with the previous finding that gcn2-K628R is a phosphoprotein in vivo (33Wek R.C. Ramirez M. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2820-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and indicate further that GCN2 is phosphorylated on multiple sites, both threonine and serine, by one or more additional kinases. In an effort to identify specific phosphorylation sites in GCN2, a FLAG epitope- and polyhistidine-tagged form of the protein (encoded byGCN2-FL) was expressed from a galactose-inducible (GAL) promoter and purified from yeast by affinity chromatography directed against the two tags. This doubly tagged protein (FL-GCN2) shows wild-type kinase activity in vivo"

We have compared the nuclear accumulation of partially and fully spliced mRNA for G6PD in the livers of mice fed diets highversus low in polyunsaturated fat. Consumption of a diet high in polyunsaturated fat decreased the accumulation of partially spliced forms of the G6PD pre-mRNA. Examining the fate of multiple introns within the G6PD primary transcript indicated that in mice fed a high fat diet, G6PD pre-mRNA containing intron 11 accumulated within the nucleus, whereas G6PD mature mRNA abundance was inhibited 50% or more within the same livers. Transient transfection of RNA reporters into primary hepatocyte cultures was used to localize the cis-acting RNA element involved in this regulated splicing. Reporter RNA produced from constructs containing exon 12 were decreased in amount by arachidonic acid. The extent of this decrease paralleled that seen in the expression of the endogenous G6PD mRNA. The presence of both exon 12 and a neighboring intron within the G6PD reporter RNA was essential for regulation by polyunsaturated fatty acid. Inhibition was not dependent on the presence of the G6PD polyadenylation signal and the 3′-untranslated region, but substitution with the SV40 poly(A) signal attenuated the inhibition by arachidonic acid. Thus, exon 12 contains a putative splicing regulatory element involved in the inhibition of G6PD expression by polyunsaturated fat.

Thus, exon 12 contains a putative splicing regulatory element involved in the inhibition of G6PD expression by polyunsaturated fat. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase cytomegalovirus Rous sarcoma virus chloramphenicol acetyltransferase precursor mRNA untranslated region Polyunsaturated fatty acids are potent regulators of cellular metabolism. As components of phospholipids, they are involved in signal transduction from specific plasma membrane receptors and are precursors for the synthesis of eicosanoids. When present in the diet of animals or the medium of cells in culture, polyunsaturated fats can both increase and decrease the activity or amount of specific cellular proteins. In this regard, polyunsaturated fatty acids have long been known to decrease the capacity of liver cells to synthesize fatty acidsde novo. The pathway of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for the conversion of energy substrates, such as glucose, which are in excess of immediate needs, to fatty acids that can be stored as triacylglycerols. This pathway is most active in liver and adipose tissue and involves a family of enzymes referred to as the lipogenic enzymes (for review, see Ref. 1Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). These enzymes include ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acids synthase, malic enzyme, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD).1 Consistent with their role in energy metabolism, the activities of these enzymes are induced when animals are fed a high carbohydrate diet and decreased during starvation. Likewise, lipogenic enzyme activity is decreased by a high fat diet, particularly a diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Regulation of the activities of ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and malic enzyme involves changes in the rate of transcription of these genes (2Blake W.L. Clarke S.D. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 1727-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 3Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Stapleton S.R.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18435-18441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general, these changes in transcription rate fail to account for the magnitude of change in the amount of mRNA for these enzymes. Thus, posttranscriptional regulation has been proposed as an additional mechanism to account for the regulation of the amount of some of these enzymes (6Katsurada A. Iritani N. Fukuda H. Matsumura Y. Nishimoto N. Noguchi T. Tanaka T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 8Dozin B. Rall J.E. Nikodem V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4705-4709Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Regulation of the expression of G6PD is in sharp contrast to other members of the lipogenic enzyme family in that starvation, refeeding, and dietary polyunsaturated fat result in large changes in the amount of G6PD mRNA but do not regulate the transcriptional activity of the G6PD gene (9Stabile L.P. Hodge D.L. Klautky S.A. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression can occur at multiple steps during RNA processing or by changes in the stability of the mature mRNA. The processing of the nascent transcript to the mature mRNA includes the addition of the 5′-m7GppG cap, splicing, and 3′-end formation. The correct processing of an mRNA is essential for its release from the site of transcription and export to the cytoplasm (10Hilleren P. McCarthy T. Rosbash M. Parker R. Jensen T.H. Nature. 2001; 413: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 11Antoniou M. Geraghty F. Hurst J. Grosveld F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Custodio N. Carmo-Fonseca M. Geraghty F. Pereira H.S. Grosveld F. Antoniou M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, the efficient and complete maturation of mRNA is a potential control point of gene expression. Previous studies in our laboratory have characterized the posttranscriptional regulation of G6PD by dietary factors. The dietary paradigm of starvation then refeeding causes a 15-fold or more increase in G6PD mRNA abundance. Regulation of G6PD mRNA abundance during the refeeding of starved mice is caused by an increase in the rate of spliced RNA accumulation in the nucleus (13Amir-Ahmady B. Salati L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10514-10523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The increase in spliced RNA accumulation cannot be accounted for by the rate of accumulation of polyadenylated RNA nor does it involve changes in the length of the poly(A) tail. Thus, the G6PD gene is transcribed at a continuous and unchanging rate, and the amount of mature G6PD mRNA produced is regulated during the splicing of the primary transcript to the mature mRNA. The absence of transcriptional regulation of G6PD makes it an ideal model to study this unique posttranscriptional mechanism. We asked if inhibition of G6PD expression by polyunsaturated fatty acids occurs at the same step as positive regulatory stimuli. In liver, G6PD activity and mRNA amount decrease 80% in mice consuming a diet high in polyunsaturated fat versus those fed a low fat diet (9Stabile L.P. Hodge D.L. Klautky S.A. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The decrease in cytoplasmic RNA is preceded by a similar decrease in the amount of mRNA in the nucleus (14Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This effect of dietary fat is recapitulated in hepatocytes in primary culture. In this regard, incubation of primary rat hepatocytes with arachidonic acid results in a parallel decrease in the amount of G6PD enzyme activity and mRNA abundance in the absence of a change in the transcriptional activity of the gene (15Stabile L.P. Klautky S.A. Minor S.M. Salati L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1951-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the inhibition by dietary fat, the decrease in G6PD mRNA by arachidonic acid is preceded by a decrease in the amount of mRNA in the nucleus (15Stabile L.P. Klautky S.A. Minor S.M. Salati L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1951-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of G6PD expression by polyunsaturated fatty acids occurs in the nucleus and is the result of the intracellular actions of fatty acids. Determining the molecular details of this regulation will provide new information on the breadth of mechanisms by which nutrients control gene expression. In this paper, we present data that define a new mechanism by which polyunsaturated fats inhibit gene expression. We demonstrate that inhibition of G6PD expression involves a decrease in the rate of splicing of the G6PD RNA transcript. Using intact mice, we have identified a slowly spliced intron, intron 11, in mice consuming a high fat diet. We have extended these results using primary rat hepatocytes and have demonstrated that transcripts from pre-mRNA reporters containing exon 12 and a neighboring intron are inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids in a manner quantitatively similar to the endogenous gene. Male C57BL/6 mice 4 weeks of age were obtained from Charles River Corp. Mice were adapted to reverse cycle room (lights on 7:00 p.m., lights off 7:00 a.m.) for 7 days while maintained on standard chow diet. Mice were switched to a purified basal diet containing 58.43% by weight glucose, 16.45% celufil, 4% salt mix, and 0.02% vitamin mix (Amersham Biosciences) supplemented with 1% (low fat) or 6% (high fat) by weight polyunsaturated fat in the form of safflower oil (Sigma) for 7 days. Mice were sacrificed, and nuclear RNA was isolated at the times indicated in the figures. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (∼200 g from Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) fed a standard chow diet (Harlan Teklad) were used for all experiments. Rats were starved for 16 h, refed the high glucose, fat free diet for 8 h, and then starved for 16 h before use as hepatocyte donors. Hepatocytes were isolated by a modification of the technique of Seglen (16Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 82: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) as previously described (15Stabile L.P. Klautky S.A. Minor S.M. Salati L.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1951-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes (3.3 × 106) were placed in 60-mm dishes coated with rat tail collagen in Hi/Wo/Ba medium (Waymouth's MB752/1 plus 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm serine, 0.5 mm alanine, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) plus 5% newborn calf serum (37 °C, 5% CO2). Cell viability in all experiments was 90% or greater as estimated by trypan blue (0.04%) exclusion. After 3–4 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium. After an additional 16 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with medium containing the treatments indicated in the figure legends and a Matrigel overlay (0.3 mg/ml; BD PharMingen) (17Shih H.M. Towle H.C. Biotechniques. 1995; 18: 813-816PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the medium was changed every 12–24 h to one of the same composition but without Matrigel. Arachidonic acid (Nu-Check Prep, West Elysian, MN) was bound to bovine serum albumin (18Mooney R.A. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11724-11733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fatty acid (4 mm), albumin (1 mm) stocks contained butylated hydroxytoluene (0.01%), and the medium contained α-tocopherol phosphate, disodium (10 μg/liter), to minimize oxidation of fatty acids. Transfection was done using Lipofectin following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) and using 2–4 μg of test DNA and 1 μg of RSV CAT to control for transfection efficiency. The ratio of DNA to liposome reagent was 1:6.7 in all experiments. Transfection was begun after 4 h of culture, and the transfection medium remained on the hepatocytes for 16 h. In transfection experiments the Matrigel overlay was added 4 h after the transfection began (17Shih H.M. Towle H.C. Biotechniques. 1995; 18: 813-816PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids used in the analysis of cis-acting elements in the G6PD primary transcript were made using pGL3-Basic (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) as the vector backbone. The luciferase gene was removed from this vector, and portions of G6PD genomic DNA or the G6PD cDNA were inserted in its place. Either the CMV promoter/enhancer sequences (1–640 bp from the pCMVβ vector, CLONTECH) or the G6PD promoter sequences (−780 to +3) were inserted into the multiple cloning site to drive expression of the test sequences. The plasmids contained either the SV40 polyadenylation signal provided in the plasmid or the G6PD polyadenylation signal. The RSV CAT plasmid used to control for transfection efficiency was constructed using the pCAT3 Basic vector (Promega) and inserting the RSV long terminal repeat from pRSV CAT (19Gorman C.M.

Total RNA from 2–3 plates per treatment was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2329-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This protocol results in the isolation of nuclear RNA that is in the processing pathway and is essentially devoid of cytoplasmic contamination (13Amir-Ahmady B. Salati L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10514-10523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In later experiments using probes with two introns (Figs. 3 and 4), the DNase I digestion and high salt extraction steps were eliminated because these probes permit the detection of pre-mRNA at two different steps in splicing. The absence of cytoplasmic contamination in this fraction was assessed as described (13Amir-Ahmady B. Salati L.M. J. Biol.

Cytoplasmic RNA in the nuclear RNA preparations was less than 1%.FIG. 4Pre-mRNA containing intron 11 selectively accumulates in mice fed the high fat diet. RNA isolation and the dietary protocol were as described in Fig. 3. The isolated RNA (30 μg) was analyzed by RNase protection assay using the pJW1 probe, depicted in Fig. 1.

The exon 2-intron 2 (E2-I2) and exon 8-intron 8-exon 9-intron 9 (pBG2) probes have been previously described (13Amir-Ahmady B. Salati L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10514-10523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Probes to intron 6-exon 7-intron 7-exon 8 (pBG1) and exon 10-intron 11 (p200) were constructed by subcloning G6PD genomic DNA into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). An additional probe, pJW1, was designed that hybridized to exon 10-intron 10-exon 11-intron 11 and exon 12. The template for this probe was synthesized from a genomic subclone by PCR amplification. The 5′ primer was 5′-CGGAATTCAACTTATGGCAACAG-3′; the underlined sequence is an EcoRI site for subcloning followed by G6PD exon 10 sequence. The 3′ primer was 5′-AAGGATTCCTCTCGATCAATCTTG-3′; the underlined sequence is a BamHI site for subcloning followed by G6PD exon 12 sequence. After amplification, the DNA was subcloned into pBluescript KS+, and the authenticity of these sequences was verified by sequencing. Two templates were designed for use in ribonuclease protection assays with RNA from transfected rat hepatocytes. Rat and mouse G6PD exon 13 templates were synthesized by PCR amplification of genomic DNA. These probes were targeted to a region of exon 13 that contains substantial mismatch between the rat and mouse sequences. In this way the rat probe detects mRNA produced from the endogenous G6PD gene but not the transfected gene, whereas the mouse probe detects mRNA produced from the transfected DNA and not the endogenous gene. The primer pairs for the rat template were 5′-CGGAATTCTGGAGGGACAATGACCAAACC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATTC¯¯CGGTTGGATGAGGCTGACTATGGAC-3′, where the single and double underline represent EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. The fragment was subcloned into pBluescript KS+ and sequenced. The mouse exon 13 template was as previously described (14Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Templates for probes to rat β-actin, CAT, and 18 S were purchased from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). All templates were linearized before use in thein vitro transcription reaction. Antisense RNA probes were synthesized in an in vitrotranscription reaction. The probe and RNA were hybridized at 45 °C overnight, and RNase digestion was as previously described (14Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The resulting hybridization products protected from RNase digestion were separated in a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and placed in a storage phosphor cassette for 1–3 days. Images were quantified using ImageQuant software by Molecular Dynamics (AmershamBiosciences). In FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4, the units obtained from the image analysis were expressed per number of cytosines in the protected fragment to permit comparison of the amount of RNA between fragments of different size. RNA from hepatocytes that had undergone transient transfection frequently contained significant amounts of residual plasmid DNA. Because this DNA would also bind to probes and result in protected fragments of the same size as the target RNA, the contaminating DNA was eliminated by digestion of the RNA with RNase-free DNase 1 (10 units/10-μg aliquot of hepatocyte RNA in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mmCaCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C before hybridization with the radioactive probes. To investigate if dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibit the efficiency of splicing of the G6PD transcript, we compared the amount of unspliced and spliced G6PD mRNA in the livers of mice fed the low fat versus the high fat diet. The amount of hepatic G6PD mRNA varies in amount in response to the normal feeding behavior of the mouse. Mice eat during the dark cycle and are relatively inactive during the light cycle. At the start of the dark cycle, the level of G6PD mRNA is very low. As the mice consume the low fat diet, the amount of G6PD mRNA increases 7-fold or more (14Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); this increase occurs after a lag of 2–4 h. As the light cycle begins, the amount of G6PD mRNA decreases, returning to a very low level. Consumption of a diet high in polyunsaturated fat results in a 50% decrease in the amount of hepatic G6PD mRNA at the beginning of the dark cycle, and an attenuation of the feeding induced increase to less than 2-fold (14Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the continued increase in G6PD mRNA in the livers of mice fed a high fat diet reflected the stimulation in gene expression due to the carbohydrate in the diet. Thus, to measure only gene expression effects due to dietary fat, we measured G6PD mRNA abundance during the first 4 h of the feeding cycle, a time before the major increase in mRNA accumulation. RNA was isolated from both the cytoplasm and the nuclear insoluble fractions of mouse liver after the animals were adapted to either a low fat or a high fat diet for 7 days. The nuclear insoluble fraction is enriched in nascent RNA being transcribed and undergoing RNA processing (22Ciejek E.M. Nordstrom J.L. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4945-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Zeitlin S. Parent A. Silverstein S. Efstratiadis A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Fey E.G. Krochmalnic G. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Two probes separated by 12 kilobases were used to detect G6PD RNA (Fig. 1, E2-I2 and p200 probes). Each probe hybridized across an exon/intron junction and, thus, measured G6PD RNA that contained that intron and RNA from which that intron had been spliced. The protected fragments are referred to as unspliced and spliced RNA, respectively, even though both protected fragments represent a mix of RNA containing one or more of the G6PD 12 introns. Feeding mice a high fat diet resulted in a 60–70% decrease in the amount of spliced G6PD RNA in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of mouse liver (Fig. 2, 0 h time point). Between 0 and 2 h of feeding, the amount of unspliced RNA (E2-I2 protected fragment) in the nucleus remained very low and was not different between mice fed the high fat and the low fat diet. This lack of difference in the amount of pre-mRNA is consistent with our previous data demonstrating that transcription of the G6PD gene is not regulated by polyunsaturated fat (9Stabile L.P. Hodge D.L. Klautky S.A. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By 4 h, the amount of G6PD unspliced mRNA had increased in mice fed the low fat diet, whereas in mice fed the high fat diet, the amount of unspliced mRNA remained at a low basal level. At all time points, the amount of spliced RNA (E2 protected fragment) in the nucleus was 5–10-fold greater than the amount of unspliced RNA; however, this increase in the amount of spliced RNA was attenuated at all time points by the high fat diet. The changes in the amount of spliced RNA in the nucleus were similar to the changes in the amount of mature mRNA in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the specific activity (phosphorimaging units/number of cytosines) of the spliced RNA was the same in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear pools, consistent with our previous results demonstrating that G6PD regulation by polyunsaturated fatty acids occurs in the nucleus (14Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with a probe (p200) that hybridizes to the exon 10-intron 10 splice junction of the G6PD RNA (data not shown). The decrease in the amount of spliced RNA in the nucleus could reflect a decrease in the rate of splicing of the primary transcript or a decrease in the stability of the fully spliced transcript. To discriminate between these possibilities, the amount of RNA early in the splicing process was measured using RNase protection assays and a probe that hybridized across two introns (exon 8, intron 8, exon 9, and intron 9, pBG2). Four protected fragments were detected representing G6PD pre-mRNA that contained both introns (unspliced), pre-mRNA that had only intron eight spliced (partially spliced), and two fragments representing G6PD RNA that had both introns removed (fully spliced). Protected fragments corresponding to spliced introns were not detected. At 0 h, the amount of unspliced RNA was similar in mice fed both the low fat and high fat diets despite a 50% decrease in the amount of fully spliced RNA (Fig.3A, overlapping circle and square, and data not shown). The amount of partially spliced RNA was greater at all time points than the amount of unspliced RNA. As the mice consumed the low fat diet, the amount of partially spliced RNA increased 7–8-fold, whereas only a 2–3-fold increase in partially spliced RNA was observed in mice fed the high fat diet. The attenuation of partially spliced mRNA accumulation with the high fat diet resulted in a decrease in the ratio of partially spliced to unspliced RNA between the two dietary groups (Fig.3B). Thus, dietary polyunsaturated fat caused a decrease in the accumulation of partially spliced RNA. These data are consistent with regulation at an early step in RNA processing rather than a change in stability of the mature mRNA in the nucleus. A decrease in the ratio of the amount of partially spliced to unspliced RNA in mice fed the high fat diet compared with the low fat diet could indicate that the splicing reaction itself is inhibited by dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids. In such a case the improperly spliced RNA would be targeted for degradation in the nucleus (11Antoniou M. Geraghty F. Hurst J. Grosveld F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Custodio N. Carmo-Fonseca M. Geraghty F. Pereira H.S. Grosveld F. Antoniou M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined other intron-exon boundaries to determine whether any intron was selectively retained in the G6PD transcript when mice were consuming a high fat diet. A probe to intron 6, exon 7, intron 7, and exon 8 (pBG1) detected RNA with both introns present, RNA from which intron only 7 has been spliced and RNA from which both introns are removed. Partially spliced RNA representing retention of intron 6 increased 3-fold in mice fed the low fat diet (Fig. 3C). Consumption of the high fat diet attenuated the accumulation of this partially spliced RNA, consistent with the previous results. A distinctly different result was obtained when a probe was used to the exon 10, intron 10, exon 11, intron 11, and exon 12 (pJW1) region of the pre-mRNA. Use of this probe with nuclear RNA resulted in protected fragments representing RNA containing both intron 10 and 11, RNA from which intron 10 had been spliced, RNA from which intron 11 had been spliced, and RNA from which both introns had been removed. Thus two partially spliced RNA intermediates were detected in contrast to the results with other probes where the partially spliced RNA consistently contained only one of the two introns represented in the probe (Fig. 4A). Even more striking was the increase in abundance of partially spliced RNA containing intron 11 in mice fed the high fat diet (Fig.4B, NoI/O HF bars). The increase in abundance of this partially spliced RNA occurred despite a decrease of 61% or more in fully spliced RNA detected in the nucleus (Fig. 4A, exon 11 and 12 bands, and data not shown for the other time points). Likewise, the amount of unspliced RNA increased with time in mice fed the low fat diet, and this increase was inhibited in mice fed the high fat diet. This result was reproducible both between mice within a single experiment and between different experiments with different groups of mice. In the mice fed the high fat diet, the pre-mRNA retaining intron 11 must ultimately be degraded since the amount of fully spliced RNA (protected fragments repre"

When over-expressed, BCSG1 significantly stimulates the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. The accumulated evidence suggests that the aberrant expression of BCSG1 in breast carcinomas is caused by transcriptional activation of theBCSG1 gene. However, the transcription factors that activate BCSG1 transcription have not been identified. In this study, we extensively investigated the role of AP1 in BCSG1 expression in breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that there are two closely located AP1 binding sites residing in the first intron of the BCSG1gene. Mutation of either AP1 motif on the BCSG1 promoter constructs markedly reduces the promoter activity. We further show that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) increases BCSG1 mRNA expression and up-regulates BCSG1 promoter activity through the intronic AP1 sites. The effect of TPA on BCSG1 transcription is also demonstrated under in vivo conditions in intact cells by using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that show the TPA-induced binding of c-Jun to the chromatin region encompassing the intronic AP1 sites. Finally, to examine the direct effect of AP1 transactivation on BCSG1 expression, we established stable cell lines of T47D that express the dominant negative mutant of c-Jun, TAM67. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses demonstrated that levels of BCSG1 mRNA and protein in TAM67 transfectants were drastically reduced as compared with mock-transfected cells. Furthermore, inhibition of BCSG1 expression by blocking AP1 transactivation produced a similar repressive effect on cell growth as that by expressing BCSG1 antisense mRNA. We show that the anchorage-independent growth of T47D cells expressing either TAM67 or BCSG1 antisense mRNA is significantly inhibited. Taken together, we provide strong evidence that AP1 plays an overriding role in the transcription of the BCSG1 gene and that blockade of AP1 transactivation down-regulates BCSG1 expression and suppresses tumor phenotype.

BCSG1 is not expressed in normal breast tissue or tissues with benign breast diseases but is highly expressed in the vast majority of stage III/IV breast carcinomas (1Ji H. Liu Y. Jia T. Wang M. Liu J. Xiao G. Joseph B. Rosen C. Shi Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 759-764PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bruening W. Giasson B. Klein-Szanto J. Lee V. Trojanowski J. Godwin A. Cancer. 2000; 88: 2154-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). BCSG1 expression in advanced breast carcinomas is not merely adventitious but plays a positive role in the process of invasion and metastasis. It has been demonstrated that exogenous expression of BCSG1 in breast cancer cells leads to a significant increase in cell motility and cell proliferation in cell culture (5Jia T. Liu Y. Liu J. Shi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 742-747PubMed Google Scholar, 6Liu J. Spence M.J. Zhang Y.L. Jiang Y. Liu Y. Shi Y. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000; 62: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), as well as a profound augmentation of metastasis in nude mice (5Jia T. Liu Y. Liu J. Shi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 742-747PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, BCSG1 gene mutations or amplifications have not been found by examination of breast carcinoma specimens and breast cancer cell lines. Therefore, it was suggested that the abundant expression of BCSG1 protein and mRNA in breast carcinomas is not caused by mutation or gene amplification but by transcriptional activation (3Ninkina N. Alimova-Kost M. Paterson J. Delaney L. Cohen B. Imreh S. Gnuchev N. Davies A. Buchman V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1417-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Bruening W. Giasson B. Klein-Szanto J. Lee V. Trojanowski J. Godwin A. Cancer. 2000; 88: 2154-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).To elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control BCSG1 transcription in breast cancer cells, we recently isolated a 2.2-kb fragment of human BCSG1 gene that includes 1 kb of the 5′-flanking region, exon 1, and intron 1 (7Lu A. Gupta A., Li, C. Ahlborn T.E., Ma, Y. Shi E.Y. Liu J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5173-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis indicates that the exon 1 region contains a CpG island. Invivo genomic bisulfite sequencing demonstrates that the BCSG1 CpG island is totally unmethylated in BCSG1-positive SKBR-3 and T47D cells but partially methylated in BCSG1-negative MCF-7 and HepG2 cells (7Lu A. Gupta A., Li, C. Ahlborn T.E., Ma, Y. Shi E.Y. Liu J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5173-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This suggests that DNA demethylation may be an important factor contributing to the aberrant expression of BCSG1 in breast cancer cells. However, treatment of MCF-7 or HepG2 cells with a specific methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine that demethylated the CpG island of BCSG1 only induced low levels of BCSG1 mRNA in these cells, suggesting that there are DNA methylation-independent mechanisms responsible for the abundant expression of BCSG1 in T47D and SKBR3 cells. It is possible that demethylation of cytosine of the CpG dinucleotide motifs within exon 1 may allow initiation of gene transcription. Upon release of transcriptional silencing, BCSG1 transcription is further activated by transcription factors that interact with the cis-acting elements residing in the regulatory regions of the BCSG1 gene.To identify the regulatory sequences we analyzed the promoter activities of the 2.2-kb genomic fragment of BCSG1 gene and its various deletion derivatives. Transient transfection assays showed that the luciferase reporter construct containing the 5′-flanking region and the exon 1 of the BCSG1 gene produced a low level of luciferase activity; this basal activity is mediated primarily through a GC-rich region located immediately upstream of the transcription initiation sites. However, the promoter reporter activity was markedly increased by inclusion of the intron 1 region of theBCSG1 gene. Further deletion analysis localized a consensus AP1 binding site (TGACTCA) in the intron that was largely responsible for the increased promoter activity (7Lu A. Gupta A., Li, C. Ahlborn T.E., Ma, Y. Shi E.Y. Liu J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5173-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These previous studies suggest that the activator protein AP1 may regulate BCSG1 transcription, possibly through the intronic AP1 binding site.Because BCSG1 expression stimulates breast tumor disease progression and AP1 has been demonstrated to play an important role in tumorigenesis (8Li J.-J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar, 9Li J.-J. Rhim J.S. Schlegel R. Vousden K.H. Colburn N.H. Oncogene. 1998; 21: 2711-2721Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Li J. Cao Y. Young M.R. Colburn N.H. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 29: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), activation of BCSG1 transcription might be one of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the promoting role of AP1 in breast cancer disease development and progression. Therefore, in this report, we extensively investigated the functional role of AP1 in BCSG1 transcription. Our studies clearly demonstrate thatBCSG1 is a new target gene of AP1 and that AP1 plays an overriding role in BCSG1 transcription in breast cancer cells.RESULTSOur previous study identified a consensus AP1 binding site (TGACTCA) at the region +612 to +618, relative to the translation start codon, within the first intron of the BCSG1 gene (7Lu A. Gupta A., Li, C. Ahlborn T.E., Ma, Y. Shi E.Y. Liu J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5173-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An in-depth sequence analysis identified a second AP1-like sequence (TGACCTC) at positions +605 to +598 on the reverse strand of the intron 1. These two AP1 motifs are separated by only six nucleotides. To determine whether these two AP1 sequences are both functionally involved in BCSG1 transcription, mutations were introduced individually on each site to block AP1 binding. The BCSG1 luciferase reporter constructs carrying the wild-type and the mutated AP1 sites are depicted in Fig. 1. These reporters were transiently transfected into SKBR-3, T47D, and HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, the promoter activity of BCSG1967 was 5–7-fold higher than BCSG1759 and BCSG1864, which do not contain the intronic AP1 sites. Mutation at either AP1 site markedly reduced the promoter activity of BCSG1967 in all three cell lines. It appeared that disruption of the consensus AP1 site (AP1-MU2) produced a stronger inhibitory effect on BCSG1 transcription than the mutation at the AP1 homologous sequence (AP1-MU1). To confirm that the decreased promoter activities of the mutant vectors were caused by disruption of the binding of AP1 to the intronic AP1 sites, we conducted a competition binding assay using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the AP1 motifs and nuclear extract of SKBR-3 cells (Fig.3). EMSA detected one specific DNA protein complex that was supershifted by anti-c-Jun antibody but not by anti-c-Fos, suggesting that the AP1 DNA complex is composed mainly of a c-Jun homodimer. Formation of AP1 complex was not inhibited by a 100-fold molar amount of an oligonucleotide containing a Sp1 binding site but was completely inhibited by competition from a 100-fold molar amount of unlabeled AP1 probe (lane 2). The AP1-MU2 mutation totally lost the ability of the mutated oligonucleotide to compete for the binding, whereas the binding capacity of the oligonucleotide AP1-MU1 was decreased to 30% of the wild-type sequence, suggesting that the change of nucleotides on AP1-MU1 has a less damaging effect on AP1 binding than that of AP1-MU2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that AP1 motifs located on the sense strand and the antisense strand of intron 1 are both required for BCSG1 transcription.FIG. 2Analysis of luciferase activities of BCSG1 promoter constructs containing wild-type or mutated AP1 sites in the first intron. BCSG1 promoter luciferase reporters were transiently transfected into SKBR-3 and T47D cells along with pRL-SV40 vector. 40 h after transfection, cells were harvested and dual luciferase activities were determined. In HepG2 cells, RSV-βgal was cotransfected with BCSG1 promoter vectors to normalize the transfection efficiency.

An EMSA using nuclear extract of T47D or other breast cancer cell lines showed similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We were interested in determining whether the intronic AP1 sites are involved not only in the basal transcription but also participate in the regulated transcription of BCSG1 by agents that induce AP1 transactivation. Because TPA is a well known AP1 activator (15Przybyszewski J. Yaktine A. Duysen E. Blackwood D. Wang W., Au, A. Birt D. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Steinmuller L. Cibelli G. Moll J. Vinson C. Thiel G. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of TPA on BCSG1 promoter activity. Treatment of cells with TPA for 24 h stimulated the BCSG1 promoter activity 3.1-fold in SKBR-3 cells, 2.3-fold in T47D, and 4.9-fold in HepG2 cells. Mutation of the AP1 site (AP1-MU2) completely abolished induction (Fig. 4A). EMSA showed that the elevated BCSG1 promoter activity was accompanied by increased AP1 DNA binding activity at the intronic AP1 sites in TPA-treated SKBR-3 and T47D cells (Fig. 4B). The stimulating effect of TPA on BCSG1 transcription was confirmed further by measuring the endogenous BCSG1 mRNA. RT-PCR analysis showed that TPA treatment increased BCSG1 mRNA 2.1-fold in SKBR-3 cells, whereas the mRNA level of GAPDH was not altered (Fig.4C).FIG. 4TPA stimulates BCSG1 transcription through the intronic AP1 sites. A, promoter luciferase reporter assays in untreated control cells and in cells treated with 100 nm of TPA for 24 h. The normalized luciferase activities in TPA-treated cells are expressed as fold of control cells.B, EMSA of AP1 binding to the intronic AP1 sites with and without TPA treatment. Total cell lysates were harvested from cells treated with 100 nm TPA or with an equal volume of Me2SO as control. Ten μg of protein was used in the EMSA.C, RT-PCR analysis of BCSG1 mRNA expression. Total RNA was harvested from untreated or TPA 24-h-treated cells or from cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) alone. An RT-PCR reaction was performed to detect BCSG1 mRNA or GAPDH mRNA. RT-PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To demonstrate that the induction of BCSG1 transcription by TPA is the direct result of increased c-Jun binding to the intronic AP1 sites under in vivo conditions in intact cells, we performed the ChIP assays, which directly examined the binding of c-Jun to the chromatin region encompassing the BCSG1 intronic AP1 sites. Control and TPA-stimulated SKBR-3 cells were treated briefly with formaldehyde to cross-link DNA-binding proteins to chromatin. The isolated chromatin was subjected to sonication followed by immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-c-Jun antibody or rabbit normal IgG as a negative control for nonspecific binding. DNA from the immunoprecipitate was isolated. From this DNA, a 200-bp fragment of the BCSG1 intron 1 region surrounding the AP1 sites was amplified. Fig.5A shows that the level of c-Jun cross-linked to the BCSG-AP1 sequence was increased ∼5-fold in TPA-stimulated cells as compared with the control after normalization with the input DNA.FIG. 5ChIP analysis for c-Jun association with BCSG1 intronic AP1 binding sites. A, anti-c-Jun was used in a ChIP analysis followed by PCR to amplify a 200-bp region surrounding the intronic AP1 sites from genomic DNA isolated from SKBR-3 cells with or without TPA treatment. A rabbit normal IgG was used in the assay to assess nonspecific interactions. The PCR product was separately on 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and quantified using a BioRad Fluro-S MultiImager system. Bound represents the DNA co-immunoprecipitated with antibody, and Input represents the starting material before immunoprecipitation. The normalized level of c-Jun bound to the AP1 region in TPA-treated cells is expressed as fold of control cells. B, SKBR-3 cells were transfected with vector BCSG1967-MU2, and thereafter TPA was added to the medium for 24 h. The ChIP assays were conducted with primers that amplified the endogenous BCSG1 intron 1 region (200 bp) as described in A and with primers that amplified the plasmid DNA surrounding the mutated intronic AP1 site (240 bp).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further examine the effect of AP1 mutation on TPA-induced binding of c-Jun to this intron 1 region in vivo, SKBR-3 cells were transiently transfected with BCSG1 promoter luciferase construct BCSG1967AP1-MU2. The transfected cells were untreated or treated with TPA for 24 h. The ChIP assays were conducted using two sets of primers, which amplified the plasmid DNA and the endogenous DNA separately. To amplify the intronic AP1 sites from the plasmid DNA, the primers AP1CHIP-5′ and AP1CHIP-3′E were used, which yielded a 240-bp PCR product containing the BCSG1 sequence (+549 to +707) plus 80-bp vector sequence. As shown in Fig. 5B, whereas the binding of c-Jun to the endogenous BCSG1 intronic AP1 region was increased 3.6-fold by TPA, the binding of c-Jun to the transfected DNA containing the mutated AP1 site was not significantly increased in TPA-treated cells. The results of ChIP assays clearly confirmed ourin vitro studies, demonstrating that the interaction of c-Jun with the intronic AP1 sites is important for the basal as well as TPA-induced transcription of the BCSG1 gene in breast cancer cells.To obtain direct functional evidence that AP1 controls BCSG1 transcription, we employed the approach of the dominant-negative mutant to inhibit the AP1 transcriptional activity. TAM67 is a deletion mutant of c-Jun that lacks the transactivation domain. TAM67 has been demonstrated to act as a potent inhibitor of AP1 transactivating activity by forming homodimers with full-length c-Jun and heterodimers with c-Fos and to quench the activity of AP1 complexes (17Brown P.H. Kim S.-H. Wise S.C. Sabichi A.L. Birrer M.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1013-1021PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection of pcDNA-TAM67 vector into T47D cells and selection of resistance to neomycin G418, several stable clones were established along with the control clones that were transfected with the empty vector pcDNA3.1. Western blot analysis using an anti-c-Jun antibody shows that the 29-kDa c-Jun mutant was expressed only in TAM67 clones but not in T47D or the control clones (Fig.6A). The inhibitory function of TAM67 on AP1 transactivation was examined by using an AP1 luciferase reporter, pAP1-Luc, which contains seven AP1 sites upstream of a basal promoter (Stratagene). Fig. 6B shows that compared with T47D and mock-transfected cells, the AP1 promoter activities in all three TAM67 clones were reduced to nearly the base-line level. These data clearly demonstrate that the AP1 transcriptional activity in T47D cells was greatly suppressed by expression of TAM67. Thus, RT-PCR assays were conducted to detect BCSG1 mRNA in TAM67 cells and in the control cells. Fig. 7A shows that a single band of 337 bp corresponding to the coding region of BCSG1 was readily detected in T47D cells as well as in the cells transfected with the empty vector. In contrast, this band was nearly undetectable in all clones that express TAM67, demonstrating that BCSG1 transcription in TAM67 cells was strongly inhibited. Western blot using specific anti-BCSG1 antibody shows that the amounts of BCSG1 protein expressed in TAM67 cells were decreased to levels below detection (Fig.7B). Moreover, we compared BCSG1 promoter activity in TAM67 cells with that in mock-transfected cells. Fig. 7Cshows that the promoter activity of BCSG1967 was markedly decreased in all three TAM67 clones as compared with the clones of empty vector, whereas the promoter activity of BCSG1864, which does not contain the intronic AP1 sites, was not significantly affected by expression of TAM67. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that AP1 is a critical transcription factor for BCSG1 transcription through interaction with its recognition sequences residing in the first intron.FIG. 6Expression of c-Jun mutant TAM67 in T47D cells. A, Western blot analysis to detect TAM67 expression in stable clones. Total cell lysates were harvested from T47D- and mock-transfected clones and from pcDNA-TAM67-transfected clones. 50 μg of protein from each sample was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the TAM67 protein expression was examined by Western blot analysis using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to c-Jun. A band at a molecular mass of 29 kDa, corresponding to the deletion mutant of c-Jun, was detected in TAM67 clones but not in T47D- or mock-transfected clones. A band with a molecular mass of 15 kDa, detected by this antibody in all of the samples, was nonspecific.

C, BCSG1 promoter analysis. BCSG1 promoter luciferase reporter BCSG1967 and BCSG1864 were transiently transfected into mock clones or TAM67 clones along with pRL-SV40 vector. 40 h after transfection, cells were harvested and dual luciferase activities were determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Previously we had shown that ectopic expression of BCSG1 in MCF-7 cells stimulated cell proliferation (6Liu J. Spence M.J. Zhang Y.L. Jiang Y. Liu Y. Shi Y. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000; 62: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of inhibition of BCSG1 expression by blocking AP1 transactivation on cell growth, the growth rates of TAM67 cells were compared with untransfected T47D and the mock-transfected cells in soft agar. Fig.8 shows that after 7 days of culture in soft agar, the number and size of the colonies in cells expressing TAM67 were reduced to 10–20% of T47D cells.FIG. 8Comparison of the growth rates of T47D-TAM67 and T47D-pcDNA cells in soft agar colony assays. Cells were plated in a 24-well plate in medium containing 5% FBS and 0.33% agar. The number of colonies at sizes large than 10 cells and between 6 and 10 cells was counted separately after 7 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The loss of BCSG1 expression in T47D-TAM67 cells may not solely account for the decreased cell growth in soft agar, as expression of TAM67 could inhibit other AP1-regulated genes that play roles in cell proliferation. To directly examine the effect of BCSG1 expression on the anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells, we constructed the vector pcDNA-BCSG1-As, which expresses the 5′ portion of the BCSG1 mRNA in an antisense orientation. As a negative control, the vector pcDNA-BCSG1-S was also made, which expresses the same mRNA sequence in a sense orientation. The plasmids pcDNABCSG-As and pcDNABCSG-S were transfected separately into T47D cells, and stable cloned were selected. Western blot analysis showed that the BCSG1 protein expression in the clones expressing BCSG1 antisense mRNA was significantly reduced to the levels of 25–40% of T47D (Fig.9A), indicating that BCSG1 translation was subverted by the antisense mRNA. Soft agar colony assays demonstrated that the anchorage-independent growth of T47D cells expressing BCSG1 antisense mRNA was significantly suppressed to a similar extent as in TAM67 cells (Fig. 9B), whereas the growth rate of the clone expressing BCSG1 sense mRNA was not statistically different from that in untransfected T47D cells.FIG. 9BCSG1 antisense mRNA blocked BCSG1 protein expression and suppressed the anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells. A, Western blot analysis using 50 μg of protein from each sample was performed to determine the BCSG1 protein levels in T47D stable clones that express BCSG1 antisense mRNA or sense mRNA. The membrane was stripped and probed with anti-β-actin antibody to normalize the variation in protein loading.B, the growth rates of T47D cells and stable clones of T47D-BCSG1-As and T47D-BCSG1-S were compared by conducting soft agar colony assays as described in the legend for Fig. 8 except that the colonies containing more than 10 cells were counted and colonies smaller than 10 cells were excluded. A statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between T47D and stable clones is indicated by an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONActivator protein AP1 is mainly composed of c-Jun homodimers or c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers. The AP1 complex mediates the transcriptional activation of a variety of genes through its specific binding to the DNA sequence TGACTCA, otherwise known as an AP1 site. It has been demonstrated that AP1 transcriptional activity is increased with the induction of the transformed phenotype and with neoplastic progression (8Li J.-J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H.

In this study, we have demonstrated that AP1 has an overriding role in the control of BCSG1 transcription in breast cancer cells through specific interaction with two closely located AP1 sites residing in the first intron.Although transcription of most of the mammalian genes is controlled by regulatory elements and enhancer sequences located in the 5′-flanking region, there are a number of genes that contain regulatory sequences in the first intron. For example, an active AP1 site present in the first intron of the p67 (phox) gene is critically important for its myeloid-specific expression (20Li S. Valente A. Wang L. Gamez M. Clark R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39368-39378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The lineage-specific expression of MRP14 gene is controlled by a potent enhancer element located in the first intron as well (21Melkonyan H. Hofmann H. Nacken W. Sorg C. Klempt M. J."

Aβ leads to neuronal cell death in vivo and in vitro, but recent evidence suggests that the property of the amnesic characteristic of Alzheimer's disease can be explained by a malfunction of synapses rather than a loss of neurons. Here we show that prolonged treatment with Aβ augments the glutamate clearance ability of cultured astrocytes and induces a dramatic decrease in glutamatergic synaptic activity of neurons cocultured with the astrocytes. Biotinylation assay revealed that the enhancement of glutamate uptake activity was associated with an increase in cell-surface expression of GLAST, a subtype of glial glutamate transporters, without apparent changes in the total amount of GLAST. This phenomenon was blocked efficiently by actin-disrupting agents. Thus, Aβ-induced actin-dependent GLAST redistribution and relevant synaptic malfunction may be a cellular basis for the amnesia of Alzheimer's disease.

Although numerous studies showed that exogenously applied or endogenously produced Aβ leads to neuronal cell death, the amnesic feature of AD cannot be explained by the neuronal loss alone (5Terry R.D. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 1118-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Indeed, accumulating evidence indicates that Aβ induces severe impairment of excitatory neurotransmission in the hippocampus (6Cullen W.K., Wu, J. Anwyl R. Rowan M.J.

Aβ-induced synaptic deterioration rather than neuronal loss is, therefore, likely to be a main cause of early AD dementia (5Terry R.D. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 1118-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Small D.H. Mok S.S. Bornstein J.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which Aβ causes such synaptic malfunction remain to be elucidated. Excitatory neurotransmission is tightly regulated by a rapid clearance of the neurotransmitter glutamate from the extracellular milieu through Na+-dependent l-glutamate transporters that are expressed on astrocytes, i.e. GLAST and GLT-1 (14Robinson M.B. Dowd L.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 37: 69-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of Aβ on glutamate uptake activity in cultured cortical astrocytes. Here we show for the first time that Aβ ending at 42 residues (Aβ (1–42)) induces an increase in the activity of GLAST. This work further demonstrates that Aβ (1–42) stimulates actin-dependent GLAST redistribution from subcellular compartment to the cell surface. Such up-regulation of GLAST function may attenuate glutamatergic synaptic efficacy. Chemically synthesized Aβ (1–40) and Aβ (1–42) were gifts from Dr. T. Shirasawa (Department of Molecular Genetics, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo, Japan). The Aβs were purified in basic conditions to avoid aggregation, with the reverse-phase HPLC so that 50 pmol of each of these molecules gave a single and sharp peak on HPLC. Their purity and amino acid composition were confirmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (16Fukuda H. Shimizu T. Nakajima M. Mori H. Shirasawa T.

Actinomycin D, dihydrokainate (DHK), immobilized avidin, peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, LY294002, nifedipine, threo-β-hydroxy aspartate (THA), and wortmannin were obtained from Sigma. Cycloheximide, cytochalasin D, latrunculin A, and thapsigargin were obtained from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). H-7, propidium iodide, sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin, U-126, and genistein were obtained from Calbiochem, Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), Pierce, Promega (Madison, WI), and Research Biochemicals (Natick, MA), respectively. Cortical astrocytes were prepared from postnatal 2-day-old rat pups (SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) as described previously (19Suzuki K. Ikegaya Y. Matsuura S. Kanai Y. Endou H. Matsuki N. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3717-3725PubMed Google Scholar). Cortical hemispheres were trypsinized (0.25%) and plated in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was exchanged every 3–4 days, and on reaching confluence the cells were trypsinized and replated once. The confluent cultures were treated with a serum-free medium for 24 h and used for experiments. In these cultures, more than 97% of cells were astrocytes, and <1% were microglial cell, as assessed by the astrocyte-specific marker GFAP and the microglial marker OX-42, respectively (data not shown). The number of microglia was not changed significantly by Aβ treatment. Cultures of embryonic neurons were prepared from E18 rat cerebral cortex (SLC) as described previously (20Shitaka Y. Matsuki N. Saito H. Katsuki H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6476-6489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For plating on a monolayer of astrocytes, cells were suspended in Neurobasal (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated at 500 cells/mm2. After 24 h, cells were maintained further with serum-free Neurobasal supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen). Experiments were performed at day 7 in vitro. Whole-cell voltage clamp (−70 mV) recordings were obtained from cultured hippocampal neurons. Recording solutions contained the following (in mm): 147 NaCl, 3 NaHCO3, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 25 μmd-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, and 10 μm picrotoxin, adjusted to pH 7.4. Patch recording pipettes (6 megohms) were filled with intracellular solutions containing the following (in mm): 120 CsMeSO3, 20 CsCl, 1 EGTA, 0.4 NaGTP, 4 MgATP, 5 QX314, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, with CsOH at 35 °C. Whole-cell recordings were made with Axopatch 200B amplifiers, digitized at 10 KHz by DIGIDATA 1320A interface, and acquisition and analysis were performed with the pCLAMP8 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Neurons with series resistances in the range of 8 to 17 megohms were selected for analyses. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were obtained by randomly selecting intervals of 200 s from the stored data for each neuron. The non-NMDA receptor antagonist CNQX blocked sEPSC completely (data not shown). l-[3H]Glutamate uptake of astrocytes was measured as described (19Suzuki K. Ikegaya Y. Matsuura S. Kanai Y. Endou H. Matsuki N. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3717-3725PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were washed for 30 min with a modified Hanks' balanced salt solution and exposed to a combination of 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]glutamate and 10 μm unlabeled glutamate for 7 min. Uptake was terminated by ice-cold Hanks' solution. Astrocytes were lysed in 0.5 n NaOH. Aliquots were taken for scintillation counting and for protein assays. Because Aβ aggregates spontaneously, the total amount of proteins was increased corresponding to the doses of Aβ. Because the number of astrocytes per well was relatively constant (data not shown), uptake rates were normalized per well (not per unit weight protein). Biotinylation of cell surface proteins was performed as described by Davis et al. (21Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Duanet al. (22Duan S. Anderson C.M. Stein B.A. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10193-10200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. After drug treatment, the astrocyte cultures were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated in sulfo-NHS-biotin solution (1.5 mg/ml in PBS) for 20 min at 4 °C. The cultures were washed twice with PBS containing 100 mm glycine to stop the reaction. After 45 min of incubation with the glycine-containing PBS at 4 °C, the cells were lysed in 300 μl/well of lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm iodoacetamide) for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 16,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove debris. Before the lysate was incubated with avidin-conjugated beads, the aliquot was taken for Western blot analysis as the “total cell lysate” fraction. The remaining lysates (150 μl) were incubated with equal volumes of avidin beads slurry and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were taken for Western blot analysis as the “intracellular” fraction. The pellets were washed four times with the lysis buffer with the protease inhibitors and resuspended in 300 μl of Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethnol) and then treated for 30 min at 70 °C. After centrifugation at 16,000 × gfor 15 min, the supernatants were taken as the “biotinylated (cell surface)” fraction. All three samples for Western blot analysis were diluted to be the same aliquot and frozen at −20 °C until analysis. The protein samples were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blotted with anti-GLAST or GLT-1 antibody (1:1000) and then with the peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After the treatment with Aβ, the astrocytes cultures in 35-mm dishes were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with 2% horse serum for 30 min. The cultures were incubated with anti-GLAST or GLT-1 antibody (1:2500) overnight at 4 °C and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide for 1 h at room temperature. The dishes were broken and settled on glass coverslips upside down. The fluorescence images were obtained with a laser scanning confocal system Micro Radiance 1000 (Bio-Rad). The initial set of experiments was designed to examine the effect of Aβ on synaptic transmission in primary cultures of cortical neurons. After day 7 in vitro neurons were exposed to 20 μm Aβ (1–42) for 12 h, and sEPSCs were recorded by whole-cell patch clamp techniques. Aβ-treated neurons exhibited a slight but significant decrease in both the mean amplitude and the frequency of sEPSCs (Fig. 1). This result is the first evidence that Aβ attenuates neuronal activity in culture. In the brain, however, neurons are surrounded by a larger number of astrocytes, which render physical and physiological supports for neurons (23Barres B.A. Barde Y. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To measure the Aβ effect under more physiological conditions, neurons were plated onto the monolayer of confluent astrocytes and processed for the same experimental treatment. In this coculture system, a similar decrease in sEPSC amplitude and frequency was produced by Aβ treatment, but surprisingly, the detrimental effect of Aβ was much larger in the presence of astrocytes (Fig.1C). Immunohistochemical staining for microtubule-associated protein-2 and glial fibrillary acidic protein revealed that the survival of neurons or astrocytes was unaffected by the exposure to Aβ; the number of surviving cells was 79.7 ± 4.7 (neurons) and 374.1 ± 13.4 (astrocytes) per mm2 in control cultures and 72.5 ± 3.3 (neurons) and 394.0 ± 15.5 (astrocytes) per mm2in Aβ-treated cultures (means ± S.E. of 8–11 cultures). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay also indicated that Aβ did not increase the activity of LDH released from astrocyte cultures; the percentages of released LDH to the total cellular LDH are 18.7 ± 5.4% in control cultures and 16.8 ± 4.8% in Aβ-treated cultures (n = 4). Similarly, Western blot analysis showed that glial expression of actin was unchanged by Aβ treatment (see Fig. 4C). Propidium iodide-labeled nuclei displayed no aberration in Aβ-treated astrocytes (see Fig. 5, C and D). All these results indicate that Aβ treatment did not affect the cell viability. Therefore, the result that Aβ-induced synaptic malfunction was aggravated by the presence of astrocytes suggests that the Aβ effect is mediated, at least in part, by an alteration of astrocytic physiological functions.FIG. 5Aβ alters the cellular distribution of GLAST immunoreactivity in astrocytes.Astrocytes were cultured in the absence (A and C) or presence (B and D) of 20 μm Aβ (1–42) for 48 h and then immunostained for GLAST (green). Propidium iodide (red) was used for counterstaining. Panels C and D show nonspecific signals of the secondary IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate in the absence of anti-GLAST antibody. Aβ-treated astrocytes displayed cluster-like GLAST spots at the outer margins of the cell body (arrowheads). Similar results were obtained in every such experiment conducted (n = 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because one of the major roles of astrocytes is to terminate neurotransmission by the uptake of extracellular glutamate through high affinity glutamate transporters, our data suggest that Aβ enhances astrocytic glutamate uptake activity. To address this possibility, sEPSCs were recorded at a low temperature, because hypothermal conditions can attenuate efficiently the activity of glial glutamate transporters (24Tong G. Jahr C.E. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1195-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 25Bergles D.E. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7709-7716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A significant difference in the Aβ effect between neuron-enriched cultures and neuroglial cocultures was no longer observed at a lower temperature (24 °C). We further attempted to determine whether the Aβ effect is blocked by THA, a potent inhibitor of glial glutamate transporters, but this inhibitor per se induced the swelling of Aβ-treated neurons and disturbed successful whole cell recordings. Nonetheless, the result at a low temperature implies Aβ-induced alteration in glutamate transporter activity. Thus, the following experiments have focused on the effect of Aβ on the glutamate clearance ability of astrocytes. Glutamate transport activity in pure cultures of cortical astrocytes was measured as uptake activity of l-[3H]glutamate. Baseline uptake activity was hindered completely in Na+-free medium and abolished by THA in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2A). These data indicate that the uptake activity was mediated by Na+-dependent secondary active transport via glutamate transporters. The uptake was unaffected by even a high concentration of DHK, a selective GLT-1 inhibitor (Fig. 2A), which suggests that GLAST is a predominant glutamate transporter in our cultures. Consistent with this, Western blot analysis could not detect apparent immunoreactivity for GLT-1 in our cultures (data not shown; see also Refs. 19Suzuki K. Ikegaya Y. Matsuura S. Kanai Y. Endou H. Matsuki N. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3717-3725PubMed Google Scholar and 26Matsuura S. Ikegaya Y. Yamada M.K. Nishiyama N. Matsuki N. Glia. 2002; 37: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus we consider that this culture system is useful in investigating the molecular behavior of GLAST, one of the major glutamate transporters of the adult forebrain (15Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar, 27Furuta A. Rothstein J.D. Martin L.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8363-8375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incidentally, when astrocytes were cocultured with neurons for 7 days, the uptake activity was unchanged: 47.9 ± 7.8 pmol/well/min in pure astrocyte cultures and 58.9 ± 11.8 pmol/well/min in cocultures with neurons (p > 0.1, Student'st test; means ± S.E. of four cases). These results suggest that neuronal contribution to the total activity of glutamate uptake assumed in the experiments of Fig. 1 is substantially low as compared with glial transport activity and that neurons do not cause a change in GLAST activity in astrocytes. As predicted by our electrophysiological data, continuous application of 20 μm Aβ (1–42) for 48 h induced a significant increase in the rate of glutamate uptake (Fig. 2A). This enhancement was inhibited efficiently by THA but not by DHK (Fig.2A), which suggests that the augmented uptake activity was unlikely because of the emergence of GLT-1 activity and that it was totally attributable to the enhancement of GLAST activity. The Aβ (1–42)-induced increase in glutamate uptake activity showed a concentration dependence in the range of 0.02 to 20 μm(Fig. 2B). More than 20 μm Aβ (1–42) severely deteriorated the viability of astrocytes (data not shown). The time dependence of the Aβ effect was investigated at a concentration of 20 μm. The facilitation of uptake was observed 3 h after exposure to Aβ and reached apparent steady state after 12 h (Fig. 2C). The shorter form Aβ (1–40), another type of endogenous Aβ, was virtually ineffective (Fig. 2, B and C). Although the difference in sequence between Aβ (1–42) and Aβ (1–40) is only two residues of C terminus, Aβ (1–42) aggregates more rapidly than Aβ (1–40) (28Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). Like Aβ (1–42), Aβ (25Bergles D.E. Jahr C.E. J.

Dis. 2000; 7: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a biologically active, hydrophobic fragment of Aβ (29Yankner B.A. Duffy L.K. Kirschner D.A. Science. 1990; 250: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar), is also highly prone to aggregation (30Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This subfragment could also reproduce the effect of Aβ (1–42) (data not shown). Because it is generally believed that aggregated Aβ is responsible for AD progression (1Small D.H. McLean C.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Emmerling M.R. Watson M.D. Raby C.A. Spiegel K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 158-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), fresh Aβ (1–40) was incubated at 37 °C for 7 days to allow aggregation (31Beckstrøm H. Julsrud L. Haugeto O. Dewar D. Graham D.I. Lehre K.P. Storm-Mathisen J. Danbolt N.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 55: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and then applied to astrocyte cultures. The preincubated Aβ (1–40) enhanced efficiently glutamate transport activity up to a level comparable with Aβ (1–42) (Fig.3). The control peptide Aβ (40-1), a reverse-sequence peptide that is stable and does not form aggregates, showed no effect even after preincubation (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the aggregation of Aβ is essential for the enhancement of glutamate uptake. Eadie-Hofstee plots of the uptake activity showed that 20 μm Aβ (1–42) produced a significant increase in theVmax value from 126.0 ± 6.8 to 202.0 ± 8.3 pmol/well/min with a minimal change in the Kmvalue (Fig. 4A), suggesting that Aβ (1–42) causes an increase in functional GLAST proteins. To determine whether Aβ-stimulated transport requiresde novo mRNA/ protein synthesis, we examined the effects of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D and the translational inhibitor cycloheximide. However, neither of these inhibitors affected the activity of glutamate uptake of intact or Aβ (1–42)-treated astrocytes (Fig. 4B), which suggests that Aβ increases the activity of GLAST without mRNA/protein synthesis. Indeed, Western blot analysis revealed that the Aβ (1–42) treatment induced no apparent change in the total amount of GLAST (Fig. 4C). This is consistent with the report showing that the expression level of EAAT1, a human GLAST homologue, is not altered in AD brain (32Qian Y. Galli A. Ramamoorthy S. Risso S. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 45-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the membrane trafficking system is known to regulate the activity of some transporters, e.g. the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 expressed in C6 glioma (21Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), serotonin transporters expressed in HEK293 cells (33Quick M.W. Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2967-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter GAT1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes (34Melikian H.E. Buckley K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7699-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and dopamine transporters expressed in PC12 cells (35Brera B. Serrano A. Ceballos M.L. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it is also possible that the Aβ effect is achieved by an increase in GLAST proteins on the cell surface. This possibility was addressed by a membrane-impermeant biotinylation assay. Biotinylated, cell surface protein fractions were separated from nonbiotinylated, intracellular protein fractions by using avidin-conjugated beads. The expression of GLAST in these two fractions was assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4C). In Aβ (1–42)-treated astrocytes, GLAST expression increased in the biotinylated (cell surface) fraction and decreased complementarily in the nonbiotinylated (intracellular) fraction. These results indicate that Aβ (1–42) caused GLAST translocation from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. The cellular distribution of GLAST in Aβ-treated astrocytes was examined further by immunohistochemical staining (Fig.5). The nuclei were labeled with propidium iodide to distinguish each cell. Aβ (1–42) caused apparent clustering of GLAST immunoreactivity along the edge of the soma and also slightly in the cytoplasmic part, whereas in control astrocytes, GLAST was distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 5). Although Breraet al. (36Rogers S.L. Gelfand V.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) reported that long term treatment with Aβ leads to cell death of astrocytes, we found no evidence for shrinkage or degeneration of propidium iodide-labeled nucleus at least after a 48-h treatment with 20 μm Aβ (1–42). Therefore, the possibility that Aβ (1–42)-evoked GLAST redistribution is merely because of cell damage could be ruled out. To determine whether Aβ-induced increase in glutamate uptake is mediated by GLAST translocation, we examined the effect of cytochalasin D and latrunculin A, inhibitors of actin polymerization, which is the cellular event known to be essential for subcellular membrane trafficking (37Dowd L.A. Robinson M.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The inhibitors attenuated significantly Aβ-induced up-regulation of glutamate uptake without affecting the baseline activity of control astrocytes (Fig.6). The microtubule disrupter colchicine had no influence on the Aβ (1–42)-stimulated transport (data not shown). These data suggest that the Aβ effect on glutamate uptake activity is mediated by GLAST redistribution dependent on actin rearrangement. Finally, we attempted a series of pharmacological investigations to clarify the signaling pathway underlying Aβ-induced increase in GLAST activity. EAAC1 translocation is regulated by protein kinase C (21Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,37Dowd L.A. Robinson M.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because GLAST possesses multiple phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (38Conradt M. Stoffel W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1244-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of H-7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C and A. However, 300 μm H-7 failed to prevent the Aβ (1–42) effect (the relative uptake activity to 20 μm Aβ (1–42)"
https://openalex.org/W2079823690,"Mutations in mouse and human patched1 (ptc1) genes are associated with birth defects and cancer. Ptc1 is a receptor for Hedgehog (Hh) signaling proteins. Hh proteins activate transcription of target genes, including ptc1, and Ptc1 represses those genes, both by regulating the activity of Gli transcription factors. We have established mammalian cell lines with reduced Ptc1 function and a lacZ reporter to investigate Hh signal transduction. Embryonic fibroblasts were derived from mice, heterozygous or homozygous for a ptc1 mutation that inserts lacZ under the control of the ptc1 promoter (ptc1-lacZ). In heterozygous ptc1 cells, ptc1-lacZ was expressed at low levels but could be induced by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and Gli-1. Homozygous ptc1 cells expressed high levels of ptc1-lacZ without Hh stimulation. ptc1-lacZ expression was dependent on cell density in ptc1 homozygotes and Hh-stimulated heterozygotes but was independent of density when Gli1 was used to activate ptc1-lacZ. A wild-type ptc1 transgene introduced into homozygous ptc1 cells greatly reduced ptc1-lacZ expression. Expression of either half of Ptc1 alone resulted in improper maturation of the protein and a failure to complement the ptc1(-/-) cells. When co-expressed, both Ptc1 halves matured and had an activity similar to that of the intact protein. Three missense PTCH1 mutations exhibited significant functions in homozygous ptc1 cells. The missense mutants retained activity when expressed at about 10-fold lower levels and appeared as stable as wild-type Ptc1. These studies suggest that some tumors and disease phenotypes may arise from small reductions in PTCH1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1976671658,"The phenotype of neurosecretory cells is characterized by clear vesicles and dense granules, both discharged by regulated exocytosis. However, these organelles are lacking completely in a few neurosecretion-incompetent clones of the pheochromocytoma PC12 line, in which other specific features are maintained (incompetent clones). In view of the heterogeneity of PC12 cells, a differential characterization of the incompetent phenotype based on the comparison of a single incompetent and a single wild-type clone would have been inconclusive. Therefore, we have compared two pairs of PC12 clones, studying in parallel the transcript levels of 4,200 genes and 19,000 express sequence tags (ESTs) by high density oligonucleotide arrays. After accurate data processing for quality control and filtration, a total of 755 transcripts, corresponding to 448 genes and 307 ESTs, was found consistently changed, with 46% up-regulated and 54% down-regulated in incompetent versus wild-type clones. Many but not all neurosecretion genes were profoundly down-regulated in incompetent cells. Expression of endocytosis genes was normal, whereas that of many nuclear and transcription factors, including some previously shown to play key roles in neurogenesis, was profoundly changed. Additional differences appeared in genes involved in signaling and metabolism. Taken together these results demonstrate for the first time that expression of neurosecretory vesicles and granules is part of a complex gene expression program that includes many other features that so far have not been recognized."

This increase in DAT activity was mirrored by an increase in the number of transporters expressed at the cell surface. In the present study, ethanol potentiated the function of DAT expressed in HeLa cells but inhibited the function of the related norepinephrine transporter (NET). Chimeras generated between DAT and NET were examined for ethanol sensitivity and demonstrated that a 76-amino acid region spanning transmembrane domains (TMD) 2 and 3 was essential for ethanol potentiation of DAT function.

J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). DAT regulates the spatial and temporal aspects of dopaminergic synaptic transmission and is an integral part of the mesostriatal DA system. This system plays a central role in mediating the rewarding and reinforcing effects of various drugs of abuse, including ethanol (2Brodie M.S. Appel S.B. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1998; 22: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Brodie M.S. Shefner S.A. Dunwiddie T.V. Brain. Res. 1990; 508: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 4Weiss F. Lorang M.T. Bloom F.E. Koob G.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 250-258PubMed Google Scholar). DAT is also the site of action for various psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine (1Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The function of monoamine transporters at the cell membrane is regulated by multiple second messenger systems; this regulation involves redistribution of the transporters at the cell surface rather than changes in rate of flux of substrate. For example, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and drugs of abuse such as amphetamine inhibit DAT function by causing internalization of cell surface transporters in a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent manner (5Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35794-357801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6Melikian H.E. Bucley K.M. J.

Experiments carried out in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells demonstrated that acute exposure to cocaine enhances DAT activity in a time-dependent manner by increasing the number of functional transporters at the cell surface (8Daws L.C. Callaghan P.D. Moron J.A. Kahlig K.M. Shippenberg T.S. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2002; 290: 1545-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cocaine also increases the number of DAT binding sites in neuro2A (N2A, derived from mouse neuroblastoma) cells by altering the intracellular trafficking of DAT (9Little K.Y. Elmer L.W. Zhong H. Scheys J.O. Zhang L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Ethanol has been shown to affect the function of several members of the Na+ and Cl−-dependent family of transporters. Experiments in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with glycine transporters (GLYT1 and GLYT2) have shown that relatively high concentrations of ethanol (100–200 mm) inhibit uptake of [3H]glycine by GLYT2 and potentiate [3H]glycine uptake by GLYT1 (10Nunez E. Lopez-Corcurea B. Martinez-Maza R. Aragon C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 802-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Also, acute exposure to ethanol has been shown to enhance serotonin transporter activity in rat cortical, hippocampal, and brainstem synaptosomes (11Alexi T. Azmitia E.C. Brain Res. 1991; 544: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Acute ethanol (10–100 mm) enhances DAT-mediated [3H]DA uptake and transporter-associated currents in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (12Mayfield R.D. Maiya R. Keller D. Zahnizer N.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This potentiation of transporter function was accompanied by an increase in the number of functional cell surface transporters, suggesting that ethanol affects transporter function by altering the steady state trafficking of DAT to the cell surface. In contrast, electrochemical experiments suggest that NET function is inhibited by ethanol (13Lin A.M. Bickford P.C. Palmer M.R. Gerhardt G.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 164: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). DAT shares a high degree of sequence homology with NET (14Buck K.J. Lorang D.L. Amara S.G. Lee T.H.H. Molecular Approaches to Drug Abuse Research. National Institute on Drug Abuse research monograph, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Rockville, MD1996Google Scholar), but results outlined above suggest that ethanol may have different effects on DAT and NET function. In the present study, we have used the contrasting effects of ethanol on DAT and NET function to identify critical amino acids in DAT that are important for ethanol action. DAT/NET chimeras were expressed in HeLa cells to identify discrete structural domains on DAT and NET that are important for ethanol regulation of transporter function. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments were then carried out, and mutant transporters were functionally analyzed to pinpoint individual amino acid residues that may be crucial for ethanol enhancement of DAT function. Chimeras between the human NET (15Pacholczyk T. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) and rat DAT (1Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) were constructed using a restriction site-independent method as previously described (16Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 17Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1030-1037PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis (partial) identified the precise location of each chimera junction and confirmed that the junction was in-frame. Previous data indicate that most junctions within conserved regions of DAT and NET are not disruptive of transporter function (18Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 19Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A graphic representation of each chimera is shown in Fig. 1. Wild type and chimeric transporter cDNA were expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia/T7 transient expression system as previously described (16Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 17Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1030-1037PubMed Google Scholar). This method employed a recombinant vaccinia virus strain that encodes a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and allows rapid high level expression of proteins encoded by plasmids bearing T7 promoters (18Fuerst T.R. Earl P.L. Moss B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar,19Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were plated (2 × 105cells/well) into 24-well tissue culture plates and infected the following day. The recombinant vaccinia virus strain VTF-7 was used to infect cells at 10 plaque-forming units/cell in 100 μl of growth medium. T7 promoter-driven plasmids with cDNA inserts encoding wild type NET, DAT, or chimeric transporters were added 30 min later as liposome suspensions (1 μg of DNA and 3 μg of Lipofectin; Invitrogen) in a total volume of 350 μl/well. Sixteen hours after transfection, the virus/liposome suspension was removed by aspiration, and the cells were washed once with 37 °C KRTH medium containing (in mm): 120 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 2.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH2PO4, 5 Tris, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were preincubated for 1 min at 37 °C in 500 μl of KRTH in the absence or presence of ethanol (20, 40, 60, or 100 mm). Uptake was initiated by the addition of [3H]DA or [3H]NE (10, 100, or 1000 nm) in KRTH containing l-ascorbate (100 μm final). Uptake was terminated after 20 min at 37 °C by washing twice with 1 ml of ice-cold KRTH medium. Cells were solubilized with 0.5 n NaOH, and the accumulated radioactivity was determined by scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific transport was determined by assays of cells transfected with the plasmid vector (pBluescript SKII) on the same plate and subtracted from total uptake. cDNA encoding the human DAT was provided by S. G. Amara and M. S. Sonders (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR). Capped cRNA were transcribed from linearized plasmids using standard in vitro transcription reactions (Stratagene). After manual isolation, Xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with water-diluted cRNA (∼10 ng/oocyte) and maintained in Frog Ringers Buffer (FRB) containing (in mm): 96 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.5, supplemented with 2.5 mm Na pyruvate, 0.5 mmtheophylline, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Uninjected or water-injected oocytes were used to define nonspecific uptake and binding in all experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis of DAT was performed on cDNA subcloned in pBK-CMV vector (Stratagene) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenesis was verified by sequence analysis. For [3H]DA uptake assays, DAT-expressing oocytes were incubated in 0.5 ml of FRB containing 100 nm[3H]DA for 10 min at 21 °C. Oocytes were exposed to 100 mm ethanol (12Mayfield R.D. Maiya R. Keller D. Zahnizer N.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for different time periods in tightly sealed 12-well plates. Oocytes were washed three times in FRB, and [3H]DA uptake into individual oocytes was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Whole cell radioligand binding was performed in 0.5 ml of FRB containing 4 nm [3H]WIN 35,428 for 15 min at 4 °C. Radioactivity was quantitated using liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Uninjected oocytes were used to specify nonspecific binding. Oocyte homogenates were prepared by sonicating six DAT (wild type or mutant)-expressing oocytes in 0.5 ml of ice-cold FRB. Binding to oocyte homogenates was performed in 0.5 ml of FRB containing 4 nm [3H]WIN 35,428. Nonspecific binding was determined using 3-PPP (R(+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-propylpiperidine hydrochloride). Binding was terminated by rapid filtration and washing using a vacuum manifold. Wild type DAT and NET were expressed in HeLa cells, and the effect of ethanol on [3H]DA and [3H]NE accumulation into these cells was measured. In DAT-expressing cells, ethanol (20–100 mm) significantly increased [3H]DA uptake in a concentration-dependent manner, with 60 mm ethanol producing an ∼50% increase in DA uptake (Fig. 2A). In contrast, in NET-expressing cells, ethanol (40–100 mm) inhibited [3H]NE uptake by as much as 22% (Fig.2B) but had no effect on NET-mediated [3H]DA uptake (Table I).Table IEffect of ethanol on [3H]DA uptake in HeLa cells expressing wild type DAT, NET, and chimeric transportersEnhancement of DA uptake by ethanolKmDAKm NE% of controlμmμmWT DAT178 ± 191-ap < .05 as compared to respective controls.3.05.0WT NET103 ± 50.20.4NET/DAT1147 ± 151-ap < .05 as compared to respective controls.3.03.0DAT/NET199 ± 50.20.4NET/DAT3101 ± 70.81.7DAT/NET3143 ± 161-ap < .05 as compared to respective controls.1.02.0NET/DAT10112 ± 200.60.9DAT/NET9172 ± 251-ap < .05 as compared to respective controls.2.02.0NET/DAT11116 ± 210.30.4DAT/NET10158 ± 181-ap < .05 as compared to respective controls.2.02.01-a p < .05 as compared to respective controls. Open table in a new tab DAT and NET chimeras were generated and eight chimeras (i.e. four sets of approximately reciprocal chimeras) with junctions in or near TMD 1, 3, 9, and 10 were used in this study (Fig.1). The chimeras were referred to as NET/DAT or DAT/NET according to their relative orientations and were numbered to indicate a TMD near their junction. Maximally effective concentrations of ethanol (40–100 mm) were chosen for each chimera. DA uptake was similar to that observed for wild type transporters (Vmax> 90% of wild type DAT) in most of the chimeras used in this study. However, chimeras NET/DAT3, DAT/NET1, and DAT/NET3 showed DA uptake that was 60–80% of that observed for wild type DAT (16Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 17Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1030-1037PubMed Google Scholar). Functional analyses of the chimeric transporters indicate that chimeras that possess DAT sequence elements within the region including TMD 1–3 all demonstrate enhancement of [3H]DA uptake by ethanol similar to DAT (Table I). In contrast, in chimeras with sequence elements within TMD 1–3 from NET, [3H]DA uptake was not enhanced by ethanol and thus resembled NET in this regard. These results indicate that ethanol enhancement of DAT function requires the TMD 1–3 region of DAT. Chimeras NET/DAT1 and DAT/NET1 with junctions in TMD1 (F78 and W63, respectively) were also tested for ethanol effects. The ethanol responsiveness of these two chimeras was similar to DAT and NET, respectively (Table I). Furthermore, we also tested chimeras DAT/NET9, DAT/NET10, NET/DAT10, and NET/DAT11 with junctions downstream of TMD3 (TMD9, TMD10, and TMD11, respectively) for ethanol effects. These chimeras demonstrated ethanol sensitivities comparable with that of NET/DAT3 and DAT/NET3 and further delineated the TMD 1–3 region to 76 amino acid residues spanning positions 78–154. Mutagenesis studies were carried out in human DAT to pinpoint sites of ethanol action within the TMD 1–3 region. Because intracellular loops are more accessible for proteins that modulate trafficking (20Quick M.W. Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2967-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we explored the intracellular loop between TMD 2 and TMD 3 for possible sites of ethanol action. The second intracellular loop differs between DAT and NET by only four amino acids, at positions 123, 130, 137, and 138. Each of these amino acids in DAT was replaced with the corresponding amino acid from NET. The resulting cDNA were transcribed in vitro and expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes expressing wild type and G130T mutant DAT were exposed to ethanol for 1 or 4 h, and [3H]DA uptake was measured. The time periods were chosen to examine the effects of ethanol on [3H]DA uptake as a function of ethanol exposure time. Basal [3H]DA uptake in this mutant was 1.2 fmol/sec/oocyte, which was comparable with that of wild type DA uptake (1.0 fmol/sec/oocyte). Wild type DAT-expressing oocytes showed a 50% potentiation of [3H]DA uptake after 4 h of ethanol exposure. In contrast, the potentiating effects of ethanol were abolished in the G130T DAT mutant after preincubation with ethanol for 4 h (Fig. 3). Amino acids phenylalanine at position 123, isoleucine at position 137, and leucine at position 138 were also mutated to the corresponding amino acids in NET (F123Y, I137F, and L138F, respectively). [3H]DA uptake in these mutants was comparable with that of wild type DAT (data not shown). Maximum potentiation of transporter function was observed after 1 h of ethanol exposure in oocytes expressing the wild type transporter (Fig. 4). After exposure to 100 mm ethanol for 1 h, potentiation of [3H]DA uptake was not observed in the mutant I137F (Fig.4). The mutant F123Y showed ethanol sensitivity comparable with that of wild type DAT (Fig. 4). Ethanol sensitivity of the mutant L138F was reduced but not significantly, compared with that of wild type DAT (Fig. 4).FIG. 4Effects of ethanol on F123Y, I137F, and L138F mutants. [3H]DA uptake was measured in oocytes expressing wild type versus mutant DAT. Oocytes expressing WT and mutant transporters were exposed to 100 mm ethanol for 1 h, and [3H]DA (100 nm) uptake was measured. Enhancement of [3H]DA uptake was observed in wild type (white bar) and F123Y (black bar)-expressing oocytes but not in the mutants I137F and L138F.

Maiya R. Keller D. Zahnizer N.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to ethanol for 1 and 4 h, [3H]WIN 35,428 binding was significantly increased by 40 and 53%, respectively (12Mayfield R.D. Maiya R. Keller D. Zahnizer N.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We investigated cell surface transporter numbers in the mutant G130T DAT in the presence and absence of ethanol by measuring [3H]WIN 35,428 binding. G130T DAT cell surface density was ∼20 fmol/oocyte. Ethanol had no significant effect on the number of cell surface transporters in the mutant G130T (Fig. 5). To test whether ethanol inhibits DAT function when the second intracellular loop is replaced with that of NET, we substituted the second intracellular loop of DAT with that of NET by sequentially mutating positions Phe-123, Gly-130, Ile-137, and Leu-138 to the corresponding amino acids in NET. This loop replacement mutant is termed IGLF. [3H]DA uptake and [3H] WIN 35,428 binding were measured in this mutant and compared with wild type. [3H]DA uptake was not observed in the mutant IGLF (Fig. 6A). [3H]WIN 35,428 binding in the mutant IGLF was significantly reduced as compared with that of wild type DAT (Fig.6B). We next carried out [3H]WIN 35,428 binding studies on oocyte homogenates (see “Experimental Procedures”). We found that the mutant IGLF is synthesized but not inserted to the cell surface (Fig. 6C). Previous studies carried out in the Xenopus oocyte expression system have shown that acute ethanol (10–100 mm) enhances [3H]DA uptake and transporter-associated currents in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Ethanol-induced increases in cell surface DAT were not associated with increased protein synthesis (12Mayfield R.D. Maiya R. Keller D. Zahnizer N.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) but were associated with increased cell surface binding. These results suggest that ethanol enhancement of transporter function may involve redistribution of DAT at the cell surface. The goal of this study was to determine regions on DAT that are critical for ethanol action. NET, which also belongs to the Na+ and Cl−-dependent family of neurotransmitter transporters, shares a high degree of homology (64%) with DAT (14Buck K.J. Lorang D.L. Amara S.G. Lee T.H.H. Molecular Approaches to Drug Abuse Research. National Institute on Drug Abuse research monograph, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Rockville, MD1996Google Scholar), but in vivo electrochemical studies have shown that ethanol inhibits rather than enhances NET function (13Lin A.M. Bickford P.C. Palmer M.R. Gerhardt G.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 164: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We used chimeras between DAT and NET and site-directed mutagenesis studies to define critical ethanol-sensitive sites in the second intracellular loop of the transporter. The kinetic parameters of DA uptake (Km and Vmax) in most of these chimeras were nearly identical to wild type DAT. These chimeras showed that ethanol enhancement of DAT-mediated [3H]DA uptake required the presence of TMD 1–3. Replacing this region of DAT with the corresponding region from NET resulted in abolition of ethanol effects. Chimeras NET/DAT1 and DAT/NET1 with junctions in TMD1 had ethanol sensitivities comparable with DAT and NET, respectively. In contrast, chimeras NET/DAT3 and DAT/NET3 with junctions at TMD3 have ethanol sensitivities comparable with NET and DAT. Also, chimeras with junctions downstream of TMD3 (NET/DAT10 and -11, DAT/NET9 and -10) resemble NET/DAT3 and DAT/NET3 in their ethanol sensitivities. Taken together, these results indicate that a 76-amino acid region spanning TMD 1–3, including the second intracellular loop, is critical for mediating ethanol enhancement of DAT function. Because intracellular loops are accessible at all times to modifying enzymes and accessory proteins that modulate trafficking (20Quick M.W. Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2967-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we explored the second intracellular loop between TMD2 and TMD3 for possible sites of ethanol action. This loop in DAT differs from that of NET by four amino acids. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to substitute glycine at position 130 for threonine, the corresponding amino acid in NET. [3H]DA uptake in this mutant was comparable with that of the wild type DAT. However, ethanol potentiation of [3H]DA uptake was abolished completely in this mutant. Using [3H]WIN 35,428 binding, we examined cell surface expression of this mutant before and after ethanol exposure. [3H]WIN 35,428 binding to the wild type DAT is Na+-dependent, and low intracellular concentrations of sodium ions in the oocyte prevent [3H]WIN 35,428 from binding to intracellular DAT (21Barish M.E. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1983; 342: 309-325Crossref Scopus (490) Google Scholar,22Reith M.E. Coffey L.L. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ethanol had no effect on the number of cell surface G130T mutant transporters, indicating that this amino acid is critical for ethanol-mediated increases in [3H]DA uptake. This suggests that ethanol affects DAT function by altering cell surface distribution of the transporters. We also mutated amino acids Phe-123, Ile-137, and Leu-138 to the corresponding amino acids in NET. We found that I137F abolished ethanol potentiation of [3H]DA uptake, whereas the other mutations demonstrated ethanol sensitivities comparable with the wild type DAT. Robust changes in ethanol sensitivities were observed in the G130T and I137F mutants, which are non-conservative amino acid changes. No change in ethanol sensitivity was observed in the F123Y mutant, which is a conservative amino acid change. However, the mutant L138F did not demonstrate significant attenuation of ethanol sensitivity despite being a non-conservative mutation. We generated the mutant transporter IGLF to investigate whether replacing the second intracellular loop of DAT with that of NET would result in ethanol inhibition of [3H]DA uptake. However, this mutant transporter does not demonstrate [3H]DA uptake and expresses a significantly lower number of functional transporters at the cell surface. Oocyte fractionation studies indicate that the transporters are synthesized but not trafficked to the cell surface. This result, though unexpected, supports the hypothesis that the second intracellular loop is important for steady state insertion of DAT to the cell surface. There is now an emerging literature on mutations that affect ethanol actions on ion channels, and it is of interest to compare our analysis of catecholamine transporters with studies of other proteins. Discrete amino acid residues located either in TMD or in the cytoplasmic regions are required for ethanol action on ion channels (23Harris R.A. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1999; 23: 1563-1570PubMed Google Scholar). For example, mutation of Ser-267 at TMD2 of the glycine receptor α1-subunit to isoleucine results in an alcohol-insensitive receptor (24Mihic S.J., Ye, Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). A transmembrane phenylalanine residue is important for ethanol inhibition of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (25Ronald K.M. Mirshahi T. Woodward J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44729-44735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Alcohol modulation of the G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying the potassium channel (GIRK) function requires a 48-amino acid region in the intracellular C-terminal region of the protein (26Lewohl J.M. Wilson W.R. Mayfield R.D. Brozowski S.J. Morrisett R.A. Harris R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1084-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Similarly, ethanol action on voltage-sensitive potassium channels (Kv1) requires the presence of a discrete amino acid residue in the putative cytoplasmic region of the protein (27Covarrubias M. Vyas T.B. Escobar L. Wei A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19408-19416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Ethanol indirectly affects the function of metabotrophic glutamate receptors (mGluR1) by enhancing PKC-mediated receptor phosphorylation (28Minami K. Gereau R.W., IV Minami M. Heinemann S.F. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mutation of a consensus PKC phosphorylation site, Ser-890, abolishes ethanol regulation of receptor function. None of these sites appears to be important for protein trafficking; in contrast, our results identify novel amino acid residues in the second intracellular loop of DAT that are necessary for ethanol modulation of DAT function by a mechanism that is consistent with altered trafficking of the protein to the cell surface. A common theme in the functional regulation of the Na+/Cl−-dependent family of transporters is the redistribution of cell surface transporters. Several agonists and antagonists of γ-aminobutyric acid and serotonin transporters have been shown to alter subcellular distribution of these transporters (29Whitworth T.L. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42932-42937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Whitworth T.L. Herndon L.C. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 22: RC1921Google Scholar). PKC activators such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate down-regulate DAT function by causing internalization of cell surface DAT (5Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35794-357801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6Melikian H.E. Bucley K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7699-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zhu S.J. Kavanaugh M.P. Sonders M.S. Amara S.G. Zahniser N.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 282: 1358-1365Google Scholar). Protein tyrosine kinase A inhibitors have been shown to inhibit DAT function by internalization of cell surface DAT (32Doolen S. Zahniser N.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 931-938PubMed Google Scholar). Drugs of abuse have also been shown to alter cell surface DAT densities in some but not all studies. For example, amphetamine decreases cell surface DAT levels by endocytosing the transporter in a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent manner in HEK-293 cells (7Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merrill G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Cravelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6850-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). More recently two independent studies have shown that cocaine causes an increase in cell surface DAT levels (8Daws L.C. Callaghan P.D. Moron J.A. Kahlig K.M. Shippenberg T.S. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2002; 290: 1545-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Little K.Y. Elmer L.W. Zhong H. Scheys J.O. Zhang L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These studies, carried out in N2A and HEK-293 cells, demonstrate that cocaine-induced enhancement in cell surface DAT levels is due to increased rates of insertion of DAT at the cell surface. Also, dopamine D2receptor activation affects DAT function by increasing the number of functional cell surface transporters (33Mayfield R.D. Zahniser N.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our results, which suggest that ethanol-mediated functional regulation of DAT involves redistribution of cell surface transporters and that this redistribution involves discrete regions on the transporter, fit very well with this common theme in transporter regulation. The absence of consensus sites for PKC or for protein tyrosine kinase A phosphorylation in the second intracellular loop suggests that ethanol regulation of DAT function may not be due to increased phosphorylation of the protein. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that direct phosphorylation of the transporter is not required for functional regulation by PKC (34Chang M.Y. Lee S.H. Kim J.H. Lee K.H. Kim Y.S. Son H. Lee Y.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is likely that accessory proteins aid in the functional regulation of DAT, but these remain largely unknown. Recent studies using yeast two-hybrid techniques have identified candidate proteins that interact with the C-terminal tail of DAT and regulate transporter function. For example, α-synuclein interacts with DAT in neurons, and the resulting DAT-α-synuclein complex has been shown to be essential for clustering of DAT at the cell surface and thereby accelerating cellular DA uptake and DA-induced apoptosis (35Lee F.J.S. Liu F. Pristupa Z.B. Niznik H.B. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 916-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tail of DAT also contains a conserved PDZ domain that interacts with the protein PICK1; this interaction is crucial for proper targeting and functioning of DAT (36Torres G.E. Yao W. Mohn A.R. Quan H. Kim K. Levey A.I. Staudinger J. Caron M.G. Neuron. 2001; 30: 121-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Based on our mutants, we hypothesize that ethanol modulates the interaction between DAT and a putative regulatory protein important for ethanol-induced trafficking of DAT and that this interaction occurs at the second intracellular loop. The ethanol-insensitive mutants described in the present work will aid in testing this hypothesis."

The potential role of this network in placing a water molecule to stabilize the hydroperoxy species and as a template for the condensation of the distal helix upon substrate binding are discussed. heme oxygenase human heme oxygenase rat heme oxygenase cyano-met myoglobin 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfanate two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy protohemin 2,4-dimethyldeuterohemin Mammalian heme oxygenase (HO)1 is a ∼300-residue, membrane-bound, non-heme enzyme that, using heme as cofactor and substrate, catalyzes the regiospecific conversion of heme to α-biliverdin, iron, and CO (1Tenhunen R.

Detailed studies have established that the reactive intermediate in HO catalysis is the hydroperoxy-heme (11Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 543-549Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar) rather than the ferryl heme common to peroxidases and cytochromes P450 (21Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (ed) (1995) Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry, 2nd Ed., pp. 245–304, Plenum Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Although the present structural information provides a ready interpretation of the stereoselectivity of the heme cleavage in terms of steric blocking of all but the α-meso position by the distal helix, the environmental influences that stabilize the Fe-O-OH rather than Fe=O species are incompletely understood. Recent studies with both hHO (22Koenigs Lightning L. Huang H. Moe¨nne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Schuller D.J. Poulos T.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Asp-140 is not oriented toward the heme iron and cannot directly interact with a heme ligand. However, the crystal structure (20Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) of hHO·PH·H2O (PH = protohemin, with R = vinyls in Fig. 1) identified a localized distal water molecule that bridges the ligated water and Asp-140 carboxylate and led to the proposals (22Koenigs Lightning L. Huang H. Moe¨nne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Schuller D.J. Poulos T.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

It is reasonable that such an important role for a distal water is based on an extensive network of interactions that maintain the optimal Asp-140 side chain orientation. The characterization of such a distal network of hydrogen bonds would identify additional sites for more subtly modulating HO activity by mutagenesis.

Thus, two distinct steric influences contribute to the regioselectivity of the heme cleavage: the placement of the distal helix so close to the heme as to block access to all but the α-meso positions (20Schuller D.J.

On the one hand, it was shown that the protohemin orientation is equilibrium (static) disordered about the α-γ-meso axis in a 55:45 ratio in rHO (24Hernández G. Wilks A. Paolesse R. Smith K.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and in a ∼3:1 ratio in hHO (25Gorst C.M. Wilks A. Yeh D.C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

This disorder has only marginal relevance for HO function, because the location of the α-meso position in the protein matrix is conserved. However, the alternate heme orientations induce sufficiently large differences in hyperfine shifts for a large number of the active site residue protons so as to severely complicate the resolution of one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra (24Hernández G.

Moreover, even the individual species with a given heme orientation exhibited a second, dynamic, equilibrium heterogeneity resulting from interconversion of two (or more) species (26La Mar G.N.

This latter interconversion is fast on the NMR chemical shift time scale but results in severe broadening or complete loss of the signals for numerous residues. Our interests here are to structurally characterize by NMR a unique HO complex free of heme disorder, which also exhibits significantly reduced line broadening from the dynamic equilibrium heterogeneity. Such a complex can serve as the reference for future solution NMR structural studies of hHO mutants, apo-hHO, and the ligand-free hHO-substrate complex, as well as for other natural genetic variants such as the bacterial HOs (33Chu G.C.

The more extensive and definitive assignments achievable with DMDH than PH, moreover, serve as a test of the predicted values of δdip generated from the magnetic axes on native hHO·PH·CN (26La Mar G.N.

The final hHO·DMDH·CN complex was ∼1.5 mm. 1H NMR data were collected on a Bruker AVANCE 600 spectrometer operating at 600 MHz. Reference spectra were collected in both 1H2O and2H2O over the temperature range 10–40 °C at a repetition rate of 1 s−1 using a standard one-pulse sequence with saturation of the water solvent signal. Chemical shifts are referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS) through the water resonance calibrated at each temperature. Non-selective T1 values were determined in both1H2O and 2H2O at 20, 25, and 30 °C from the initial magnetization recovery of a standard inversion-recovery pulse sequence.

The 600-MHz 1H NMR spectra of hHO·PH·CN immediately after preparation (Fig.2A) and at equilibrium (Fig.2B) are compared with that of hHO·DMDH·CN (Fig.2C), illustrating the significant improvement in spectral resolution with respect to both the number of resonances and the linewidths when the symmetric DMDH is utilized. The previously assigned (26La Mar G.N. Asokan A. Espiritu B. Yeh D.C. Auclair K. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Non-selective T1s for the paramagnetically relaxed, resolved signal were determined for hHO·DMDH·CN and yield theT1 values 110 ms (2-CH3), 140 ms (3-CH3), 40 ms (α-meso-H), 40 ms (143 NpH), 170 ms (Ala-28 CβH3), 70 ms, 42 ms (Ser-142 Cβ1H, Cβ2H). The values are essentially the same as the same signals in hHO·PH·CN (26La Mar G.N. Asokan A. Espiritu B. Yeh D.C. Auclair K. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

The target residues for assignment are all those with significant hyperfine shift and/or paramagnetic relaxation and for which scalar and dipolar connectivities can be uniquely confirmed over a range of temperatures despite the large size of the complex. Also emphasized are the residues that exhibit unusually large low field peptide NH shifts indicative of strong H-bonding (32Harris T.K. Mildvan A.S. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Because numerous target residues (the proximal helix and a portion of the distal helix) had been assigned previously for hHO·PH·CN (26La Mar G.N. Asokan A. Espiritu B. Yeh D.C. Auclair K.

The assignment of the prosthetic group in hHO·DMDH·CN follows standard procedures in low spin ferric hemins/hemoproteins containing native protohemin (27La Mar G.N. Satterlee J.D. de Ropp J.S. Kadish K. Smith K. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook. 5. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 185-298Google Scholar). Thus, NOESY spectra allow the detection of all expected dipolar contacts among TOCSY-connected pyrrole substituents and the meso-Hs in a circular fashion (data not shown) as reported for the metMbCN complex with the same symmetric heme (45La Mar G.N.

The substrate shifts at 25 °C are listed in Table I, where they can be compared with similar data for the same complex of native PH. It is important to note that the symmetric DMDH, unlike PH, does not have a unique numbering system.

CMFR1 is a putative CMF receptor necessary for CMF-induced G protein-independent accumulation of the SP70 prespore protein but not for CMF-induced G protein-dependent inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production. Using recombinant fragments of CMF, we find that stimulation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pathway requires amino acids 170–180, whereas SP70 accumulation does not, corroborating a two-receptor model. Cells lacking CMFR1 do not aggregate, due to the lack of expression of several important early developmentally regulated genes, including gp80. Although many aspects of early developmental cAMP-stimulated signal transduction are mediated by CMF, CMFR1 is not essential for cAMP-stimulated cAMP and cGMP production or Ca2+ uptake, suggesting the involvement of a second CMF receptor. Exogenous application of antibodies against either the region between a first and second or a second and third possible transmembrane domain of CMFR1 induces SP70 accumulation. Antibody- and CMF-induced gene expression can be inhibited by recombinant CMFR1 corresponding to the region between the first and third potential transmembrane domains, indicating that this region is extracellular and probably contains the CMF binding site.

The initiation of development in the simple eukaryoteDictyostelium discoideum provides a model system for this type of cell density sensing.

Starving cells secrete a diffusible 80-kDa glycoprotein called conditioned medium factor (CMF)1 (7Mehdy M.C. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell.

When there is a high percentage of starved cells, as indicated to the cells by a high concentration of CMF, they aggregate using relayed pulses of cAMP as a chemoattractant. The aggregated cells then form a fruiting body consisting of a mass of spore cells supported by a thin stalk. Because CMF can diffuse into the surrounding environment, the concentration of CMF is directly related to the density of the cells secreting it (11Yuen I.S. Gomer R.H. J. Theor. Biol. 1994; 167: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Considering starving cells as a subpopulation of the cells, CMF is thus a model for cell density sensing (13Gomer R.H. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 734-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Starved cells either at low cell densities or lacking CMF do not aggregate, but they can be rescued by the addition of recombinant CMF, suggesting that the function of CMF is to permit cAMP-mediated aggregation only when there is a high density of starving cells (9Jain R.

A cAMP-stimulated Ca2+ influx is mediated partly by a G protein-dependent pathway and partly by a G protein-independent pathway (34Milne J.L., Wu, L. Caterina M.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol.

Exposure of cells to CMF is required for cAMP activation of both cyclases and Ca2+influx (12Yuen I.S. Jain R. Bishop J.D. Lindsey D.F. Deery W.J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CMF modulates cAMP signal transduction by regulating the lifetime of the Gα2-GTP conformation (12Yuen I.S. Jain R.

GTPγS partially inhibits the binding of CMF to membranes, suggesting that some of the CMF signal transduction pathway involves a G protein-coupled receptor. Cells lacking Gα1 do not exhibit either GTPγS inhibition of CMF binding or CMF regulation of cAMP signal transduction, suggesting that a putative CMF receptor interacts with Gα1 (14Brazill D.T. Lindsey D.F. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have found that CMF-induced Gα1/βγ dissociation activates phospholipase C, which in turn inhibits a Gα2 GTPase, thereby prolonging the cAMP-activated Gα2-GTP configuration and promoting the cAMP signal transduction process (14Brazill D.T.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating cAMP signal transduction, CMF is important for the expression of early developmentally regulated genes including prestalk and prespore genes (7Mehdy M.C. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Gomer R.H. Yuen I.S. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 112: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R.

Cell Res. 2001; 266: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Expression of these genes requires cells to be exposed to both CMF and cAMP and can occur in cells lacking Gα1, Gα2, Gβ, phospholipase C, or the cytosolic regulator of adenylyl cyclase (14Brazill D.T. Lindsey D.F. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This suggested that, unlike the regulation of phospholipase C by CMF, the induction of prestalk and prespore gene expression by the combination of CMF and cAMP is G protein-independent. Scatchard plots of CMF binding to whole cells yielded a straight line, indicating a single class of binding kinetics (10Jain R. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9128-9136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether there was one type of CMF receptor activating both the G-dependent and G-independent CMF signal transduction pathways (40Deery W.J. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34476-34482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we used affinity chromatography to isolate membrane proteins that bind CMF. We identified a 50-kDa protein, CMFR1, which is sensitive to trypsin treatment of whole cells. We obtained partial amino acid sequence of CMFR1 and isolated the cDNA encoding it. The derived amino acid sequence has no significant similarity to any known receptor, although there is some similarity to thiamine biosynthesis enzymes and monooxygenases. CMFR1 has two or possibly three predicted transmembrane domains. Expression of CMFR1 in insect cells caused an increase in CMF binding, whereas disruption of cmfr1 inDictyostelium by homologous recombination resulted in the loss of ∼50% of CMF binding and all of its associated G-independent signal transduction. Although the cmfr1−cells do not aggregate, the G protein-dependent CMF signal transduction pathway for IP3 was functional incmfr1− cells, suggesting that cells sense the density-sensing factor CMF using two or more different receptors and that CMFR1 regulates some unknown mechanism necessary for aggregation (40Deery W.J. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34476-34482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify and characterize distinct properties of CMFR1 with respect to signal transduction and receptor membrane topography and show that a likely reason cmfr1−cells do not aggregate is that CMFR1 regulates the expression of adhesion proteins required for aggregation. Vegetative Dictyostelium Ax2 wild-type parental and cmfr1− cells were grown in suspension shaking culture with HL-5, antibiotics, and vitamins as described previously (41Brock D.A. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1960-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To obtain starved cells, midlog phase cells (2–5 × 106 cells/ml) were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 6 min, resuspended in either PB (3 mm Na2HPO4, 7 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.5) or PBM (20 mm KH2PO4, 0.01 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.1, with KOH), collected by centrifugation again, and resuspended at 1–10 × 106 cells/ml at 21 °C. Cells were then shaken as for growth conditions for 3–6 h. Conditioned starvation medium was made following Brock and Gomer (41Brock D.A. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1960-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Low cell density assays for CMF and cAMP-induced expression of the SP70 marker were carried out using immunofluorescence of 2500 cells/well seeded in eight-well slides as described previously (42Gomer R.H. Spudich J.A. Methods in Cell Biology. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1987: 471-487Google Scholar). CMF binding was measured as described previously (10Jain R. Gomer R.H. J. Biol.

For cAMP binding, starved cells were washed three times in cold PB and resuspended in this buffer to 2 × 107 cells/ml. The binding of [3H]cAMP was then assayed in ammonium sulfate as described previously (43Van Haastert P.J.M. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A PCR was performed using the primers 5′-GCCATATGCGTCCACTCAATTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAAGAAGTTATTGGAATGAG-3′ using the Advantage 2 PCR kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and Dictyostelium genomic DNA as the template. A product from 519 to 780 bp of the CMF gene encoding the region from amino acid (aa) 101 to 188 (fragment 1, F1) was obtained (Fig. 1). Similar reactions were performed to obtain fragments encoding aa 101–180 (F2), 120–188 (F3), 110–188 (F6), and 110–180 (F7). All of these DNA fragments contained a NdeI site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end. The DNA fragments were digested and ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI). After confirming insert sequences (Lone Star Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX), the expression constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen), and recombinant protein was expressed following the Novagen prokaryotic expression instructions. The expressed CMF fragments were purified with a B-PER His6 Spin Purification Kit (Pierce). To generate the shorter fragments F4 (aa 120–180), F5 (aa 120–170), F8 (aa 130–180), F9 (aa 130–170), F10 (aa 120–165), F11 (aa 120–159), and F12 (aa 120–153), similar PCRs were done except that 5′NdeI and 3′ XhoI cloning sites were added, and PCR products were digested and ligated into the expression/secretion vector pET-22b (Novagen). CMF peptides were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells following the same protocol as above. The growth medium containing the secreted proteins was clarified by centrifugation, and 49.42 g of ammonium sulfate was added per 100 ml of clarified growth medium at 0 °C. Precipitated CMF protein fragments were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then purified using the B-PER His6 spin purification kit. Potential O-linked glycosylation sites were searched for using the DictyOGlyc 1.1 server (available on the World Wide Web at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/DictyOGlyc/) (44Gupta R. Jung E. Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. Brunak S. Hansen J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A λYES vegetative Dictyostelium cDNA library was obtained from Dr. Eugeno De Hostos, and PCR was performed using Pfupolymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the primers 5′-GGAATTCCATATGAGAGAAGGTAGAAAAGTTGC and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTCGTGACCGAATTTAGCC containing the 5′ NdeI and 3′ XhoI cloning sites. A 999-bp DNA fragment was gel-purified using GeneClean III (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA), ligated into pET22b (Novagen), and cloned using the One Shot E. colitransformation system (Invitrogen). The resulting C-terminal His tag expression vector encoding aa 101–429 of CMFR1 was then used to transform BL21-DE3 cells (Novagen), and the transformants were induced in Terrific Broth containing 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C (45Pan S. Malcolm B. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 1234-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were extracted with B-PER, and the 37.5-kDa detergent-insoluble protein was solubilized in 8 m urea and purified on a nickel column following the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). Urea was removed, and the protein was renatured by dialyzing 3 ml of protein in 500 ml of PBM with four changes over 48 h at 4 °C. The production of intracellular IP3 in response to a 30-s pulse of CMF was determined following the procedure of Van Haastert (46Van Haastert P.J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using an IP33H assay system (Amersham Biosciences) to quantitate IP3 with the exception that 100-μl aliquots of neutralized cell supernatants were used. The production of cAMP in response to a pulse of the functional analog 2′-deoxy-cAMP was determined following Van Haastert (46Van Haastert P.J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells starved at 107 cells/ml for 6 h were collected by centrifugation and resuspended at 107 cells/ml. These were stimulated with 10 μm 2′-deoxy-cAMP in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol. At 0, 3, and 5 min after stimulation, the cells were lysed, and cAMP was quantitated using an isotope dilution assay kit (Amersham Biosciences). The production of cGMP in response to a 10-s pulse of 0.1 μm cAMP was determined in a similar manner following the procedure of Kesbeke et al.(47Kesbeke F. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), using a cGMP assay kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cellular Ca2+ uptake in response to a pulse of cAMP was determined as described by Milne and Devreotes (48Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were starved for 6 h at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml and were resuspended to a concentration of 107 cells/ml in HK buffer (20 mm Hepes, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.0). The cell suspension was incubated in uptake buffer for 30 s, stimulated with a 10 μmpulse of cAMP, and then incubated for an additional 40 s. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 1400 ×g for 30 s and washed with 1 ml of ice-cold HK buffer containing 10 mm Ca2+, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The generation of antibodies 672 (Ab1) and 673 (Ab2) against the CMFR1 epitopes used for Western blots and immunofluorescence has been described previously (40Deery W.J. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34476-34482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). IgG was enriched from antiserum using ammonium sulfate (49Garvey J.S. Cramer N.E. Sussdorf D.H. Methods in Immunology. 3rd Ed. W. A. Benjamin, Inc., Reading, MA1977: 218-219Google Scholar) and used for Western blots and immunofluorescence. The concentration of total IgG in antibody preparations Ab1 (2 mg/ml) and Ab2 (3.5 mg/ml) was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis comparing the antibody preparation to a series of known concentrations of purified rabbit IgG (R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Fab fragments of CMFR1 antibodies were generated and isolated from ammonium sulfate-fractionated IgG using an ImmunoPure Fab Preparation Kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's directions. The concentration of Fab fragments (0.4 mg/ml for both Ab1 and Ab2) was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay and purified rabbit IgG as a standard. Approximately 8 × 104 cells in 200 μl were placed in individual wells of an eight-well glass slide and were allowed to attach for 1–6 h in HL5 or PBM and then were fixed with 2% formalin, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 0.02% Triton X-100 in PBM for 5 min. Alternately, cells were fixed with 50% ethanol, 10% formalin, 6.5% acetic acid, 0.4% picric acid for 20 min. Slides were washed in PBM followed by 15-min washes in 1 mg/ml sodium borohydride at 4 °C and then PBS containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with Ab1 or Ab2 at a 1:75 dilution in the PBS/SDS/Nonidet P-40 buffer, washed with the same buffer for 30 min, and washed in PBS containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min. Slides were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at a 1:300 dilution in PBS-N for 45 min. Following two 30-min washes, the slides were mounted as previously described (42Gomer R.H. Spudich J.A. Methods in Cell Biology. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1987: 471-487Google Scholar). Cells were examined with a Nikon Microphot Fx with a 1.4 NA 60× lens, a Deltavision (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) deconvolution microscope with a Zeiss 1.4 NA 100× lens, or a Zeiss LSM-410 confocal microscope. RNA was isolated from 5 × 107 cells either at the vegetative stage or at various times during starvation in shaking culture with or without pulses of cAMP, essentially as previously described (40Deery W.J. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34476-34482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Electrophoresis of RNA (10 μg/lane) and transfer to Duralon UV membrane (Stratagene) were done following the manufacturer's directions. Equal loading was verified by ethidium bromide staining of rRNA in the gels. The cDNA probes for cAR1 (15Klein P.S. Sun T.J. Saxe III, C.L. Kimmel A.R. Johnson R.L. Devreotes P.N.

Microbiol. 1986; 132: 1043-1050PubMed Google Scholar) were labeled with [32P]dCTP by random hexamer-primed DNA synthesis (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with the blots in a 60 °C reaction containing 0.25 mNa2HPO4, 0.25 m NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 10% polyethylene glycol (Mr 8000), pH 7.2. Blots were then washed with 50 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5% SDS, pH 7.2, for 30 min at 25 °C and 15 min at 60 °C. Autoradiography on preflashed Kodak X-Omat AR5 film was done at −70 °C. Approximately 104glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with 1.6 μg of recombinant glutathione S-transferase-CMF, prepared as described (10Jain R. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9128-9136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for 30 min at 4 °C in 0.2 ml of PBS. The beads were then washed five times with 1-ml volumes of PBS, two times with PBM, and finally resuspended in 0.2 ml of PBM. To assay SP70 expression, Ax2 cells were starved in eight-well glass slides at 10, 7.5, and 5 × 103 cells per well, and after 6 h, either ∼1500, ∼1000, or ∼500 glutathioneS-transferase-CMF-Sepharose beads were added to the wells together with cAMP (300 μm). Cells were fixed and stained for SP70 12 h later, and positive cells were scored as described above. CMF stimulates both G protein-dependent and -independent signal transduction pathways (14Brazill D.T. Lindsey D.F. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We previously identified a putative receptor for CMF, CMFR1, which is necessary for CMF-stimulation of G protein-independent prestalk and prespore gene expression but not G protein-dependent IP3production (40Deery W.J. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34476-34482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This suggested, but did not prove, that there are two receptors for CMF. To test the hypothesis that there are two separate receptors for CMF, we first determined whether a difference could be detected between the two receptors with respect to CMF binding affinities by measuring the KD for125I-labeled CMF binding to parental and cmfr1− cells. As shown in Table I, there was no detectable difference in the KD between the two cell types. TheKD for both cell types was what we previously observed for wild-type cells (10Jain R. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9128-9136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Deery W.J. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34476-34482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas the number of CMF receptors for Ax2 cells was considerably less than that reported for Ax4. This sort of difference also occurs for cAMP receptors, with Ax2 cells having considerably less cAMP binding than Ax4. 2L. Tang and R. H. Gomer, unpublished results. As previously observed (40Deery W.J. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34476-34482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), there are about half the number of CMF receptors oncmfr1− cells compared with parental cells. The similar KD for CMF binding to parental and cmfr1− cells suggests that the G protein-coupled receptor (the only expected CMF receptor incmfr1− cells) has the sameKD as the mixture of CMFR1 and this receptor, so by this criterion we cannot demonstrate the existence of two different receptors.Table IBinding of CMF to cellsCellKDN, receptors/cellnmAx2 parental2.1 ± 0.3662 ± 38cmfr1−2.1 ± 0.1336 ± 36 Open table in a new tab We then determined whether differences in the two receptors could be detected with respect to the region of CMF that activates the receptor. Twelve different recombinant peptide fragments of the CMF active site were generated and examined for their ability to stimulate SP70 (a protein expressed in a subset of prespore cells) accumulation and IP3 production. As shown in Fig.1, a fragment encoding amino acids 120–180 of CMF (fragment 4) had essentially full activity for stimulating both pathways. We previously found that the EC50 of purified or recombinant CMF is ∼300 pg/ml (8Gomer R.H. Yuen I.S. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 112: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The EC50 of fragment 4 is considerably lower (indicating a much higher specific activity). This is in agreement with our observation that small breakdown fragments of CMF have a much higher specific activity than the entire protei"

This reaction is usually catalyzed by respiratory heme-copper oxidases, e.g. mitochondrial cytochrome coxidase, integral membrane proteins that couple the free energy of oxygen reduction to the translocation of protons. Members of the superfamily of respiratory heme-copper oxidases are represented in all domains of life and are readily identified by a highly conserved catalytic subunit (subunit I) (1Castresana J.

Acta. 2001; 1505: 185-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The majority of heme-copper oxidases found in eubacteria fall into one of two classes according to their immediate electron donor. This can be a quinol, as in the case of cytochrome bo3 fromEscherichia coli, or a c-type cytochrome, e.g.cytochrome c552, which is the electron donor for cytochrome aa3 of Paracoccus denitrificans. Quinol oxidases lack the dinuclear copper center CuA, which is located in the hydrophilic domain of subunit II and which serves as the immediate electron acceptor in cytochromec oxidases (4Hill B.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In recent years, a third highly diverged group of heme-copper oxidases, the cytochrome cbb3 oxidases, have been described in proteobacteria (5Myllykallio H. Liebl U. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 542-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cbb3oxidases are found only in proteobacteria and have been reported not only to have a very high affinity for oxygen (km ∼ 7 nm) (6Preisig O. Zufferey R. Thöny-Meyer L. Appleby C.A. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1532-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but also to retain the ability to conserve the energy liberated from the oxygen reduction reaction (7de Gier J.-W.L. Schepper M. Reijnders W.N.M. van Dyck S.J. Slotboom D.J. Warne A. Saraste M. Krab K. Finel M. Stouthamer A.H. van Spanning R.J.M. van der Oost J. Mol.

These properties give cbb3 oxidases an essential role in the specialized energy metabolism that allows proteobacteria to colonize microaerobic environments. For instance, acbb3-type enzyme is the only energy-conserving terminal oxidase whose sequence is represented in the genomes of two important human pathogens, Helicobacter pylori (10Tomb J.F. White O.

Moreover, expression of acbb3 oxidase is also necessary for symbiotic diazotrophs to fix dinitrogen. Here, the enzyme fulfills the dual roles of maintaining a very low oxygen tension, to protect the labile nitrogenase, and allowing aerobic respiration, to support the energetically demanding process of nitrogen fixation. Indeed, acbb3 oxidase was first identified inBradyrhizobium japonicum and designated fixNOQP(ccoNOQP) because expression of this gene cluster is required to support symbiotic nitrogen fixation (12Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3309-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the fixNOPQ (ccoNOPQ) operon has been identified in other proteobacteria, where it is always close to a second gene cluster, fixGHIS(ccoGHIS), whose expression is required for the assembly of a functional cbb3 oxidase (13Koch H.G. Winterstein C. Saribas A.S. Alben J.O. Daldal F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An analysis of the evolution of heme-copper oxidases based upon multiple sequence alignments of the catalytic subunits, represented incbb3 oxidases by CcoN (FixN), has recently been published (3Pereira M.M. Santana M. Teixeira M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 185-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). This suggests that the cbb3oxidases evolved independently of the functionally distinct, but structurally related bacterial nitric-oxide reductases (14Watmough N.J. Butland G. Cheesman M.R. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Spiro S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 456-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) to fulfill a specialized role in microaerobic energy metabolism (5Myllykallio H. Liebl U. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 542-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cytochrome cbb3 oxidases are predicted to contain four subunits, although in most preparations reported to date, there is only firm evidence for the presence of CcoNOP. Like subunit I in other heme-copper oxidases, CcoN has at least 12 transmembrane helices and contains the active site, a high-spin heme (heme b3) 1To aid comparison with other heme-copper oxidases, we have adopted the following notation for the metal centers in CcoN, which is structurally related to cytochromec oxidase subunit I. Heme b is the low-spin bishistidine-coordinated heme in CcoN that is a homolog of heme a in cytochrome c oxidase. Heme b3 is high spin in CcoN and equivalent to heme a3 in cytochrome coxidase and heme o3 in E. coli cytochromebo3-quinol oxidase. In cytochrome coxidase and quinol oxidases, this heme is magnetically coupled to a copper ion (CuB) to form a dinuclear center, which is the site of oxygen binding and reduction. CuB is probably ligated by three conserved histidine residues, which also serve as ligands to CuB in cytochrome c oxidase. 1To aid comparison with other heme-copper oxidases, we have adopted the following notation for the metal centers in CcoN, which is structurally related to cytochromec oxidase subunit I.

Wikström M. Nature. 1992; 356: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). A second heme (heme b), which serves to transfer electrons to the active site, is also contained within subunit I. Six absolutely conserved histidine residues (in helices II, VI, VII, and X) involved in ligating both heme irons as well as CuB are diagnostic of the entire superfamily (16Saraste M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 331-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Rather unusually, CcoN contains only heme B, which lacks the hydroxyethylfarnesyl substituent of the porphyrin macrocycle, found in hemes O and A, the cofactors that characterize the dinuclear centers of most classical heme-copper oxidases. The x-ray structures of a number of heme-copper oxidases reported over the past 5 years have proved useful in interpreting many years of biophysical experiments on mitochondrial cytochrome coxidase (17Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 18Tsukihara T. Aoyama H.

Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, few of the structural features that characterize the active site of typical heme-copper oxidases are conserved in the primary amino acid sequence in CcoN. The most notable difference is found in transmembrane helix VI, where, in cytochromec oxidase, post-translational modification of a tyrosine residue covalently links it to one of the histidine ligands of CuB to form a site capable of stabilizing a radical species during dioxygen reduction (21Gennis R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 241-248Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In the cbb3-type oxidases, this tyrosine residue is absent, and there is no obvious functional replacement. Two membrane-associated c-type cytochromes form part of the cbb3 oxidase complex. The first, CcoO, is a 23-kDa monohemeprotein that appears to be the functional homolog of NorC in the related bacterial nitric-oxide reductase. NorC probably fulfills the same role of the CuA-containing subunit II in the classical heme-copper oxidases in that it appears to serve as the immediate electron acceptor for soluble electron donors, e.g. pseudoazurin or a cytochrome c in abc1-dependent electron transfer chain (22Bell L.C. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The second, CcoP (35 kDa), has two heme c-binding sites clearly identified in the derived amino acid sequence. The function of this diheme cytochrome, for which there is no obvious homolog, is not yet clear. The cbb3 oxidase operon also includes a fourth gene: ccoQ. With the exception of the enzyme from B. japonicum (23Zufferey R. Preisig O. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), there is no evidence of the protein it encodes being present in purified complexes, and its function is uncertain. Understanding the mechanistic basis of energy conservation by bacteria living in microaerobic environments requires a preparation ofcbb3 oxidase that is stable and can be obtained in high yield. Such a preparation has recently been described inPseudomonas stutzeri, a facultative anaerobe with the capacity to denitrify (24Urbani A. Gemeinhardt S. Warne A. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We report here the first detailed spectroscopic characterization of this enzyme preparation, which we intend to underpin future mechanistic studies. To allow unambiguous spectroscopic assignments of each of the five heme groups, it was necessary to separately express in E. coli the diheme-containing subunit CcoP. Initially, the ccoNOQP operon of P. stutzeri was sequenced by amplifying short internal regions of the operon using degenerate primers based on multiple sequence alignments of the ccoNOQP operons of nine other proteobacterial species. All PCRs contained genomic DNA as template, 50 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.), and Extensor Hi-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Abgene) in a total volume of 50 μl. Reactions were initiated by 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 94 °C), annealing (30 s at 55 °C), and extension (1 min/1 kb at 72 °C). After the final cycle, completion of polymerization was ensured by an additional incubation at 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR products were sequenced using an automated sequencer (ABI Prism 377) at the School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia (Norwich, UK). Using this initial sequence as a template, primers were designed, and overlapping genomic DNA-derived PCR fragments were cloned into either pUC18 or pBluescript KS+ (Table I). DNA cloning techniques were performed according to standard protocols (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

DNA sequencing (MWG-BIOTECH AG) using standard T7 promoter/terminator primers or internal primers confirmed that the insert was identical in sequence to wild-type ccoP. A single colony was used to inoculate 50 ml of LB medium, and the flask was incubated overnight with agitation (200 rpm) at 37 °C. This culture was then used to inoculate 15 liters of LB medium, which was grown in a BioFlow IV fermentor (New Brunswick Ltd.) at 30 °C for 28 h with constant stirring (135 rpm.). Cells were harvested at 4 °C by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min and resuspended in cold 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) before being rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until required. A single colony of E. coli JM109 (DE3) cells transformed with pEC86 (26Reincke B. Thöny-Meyer L. Dannehl C. Odenwald A. Aidim M. Witt H. Ruterjans H. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and pCcoPall was selected onl-agar, supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml), and used to inoculate 50 ml of LB medium containing both antibiotics. From this culture, which was incubated overnight with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 °C, 1 ml was taken to inoculate 700 ml of TYP medium (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol) in a 2-liter flask. Typically, six 700-ml cultures were grown for 30 h with agitation (200 rpm) at 30 °C, yielding ∼50 g of cells (wet weight). The cells were harvested at 4 °C by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min and resuspended in cold 20 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.5) before being rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until needed. Previously frozen P. stutzeri cells were thawed, and the following additions were made (final concentrations given): 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml DNase. The cells were broken by a single passage through a French pressure cell (1200 p.s.i). Approximately 15 min after the cells were disrupted, EDTA (5 mm final concentration) was added to the cell-free extract, which was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove any unbroken cells. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C, and the pellet (which contained the cytoplasmic membranes) was resuspended in 40 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl and 2.5 mm EDTA (pH 7.5). To remove any peripheral membrane proteins, 100 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 0.08% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate (pH 7.5) was added dropwise with stirring. After stirring on ice for an additional 5 min, the washed membrane fraction was sedimented by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. Solubilization of the integral membrane proteins and subsequent purification were essentially as described by Urbani et al.(24Urbani A. Gemeinhardt S. Warne A. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Purified cytochrome cbb3 oxidase was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and both UV-visible and EPR spectroscopies prior to storage at −80 °C until needed. Previously frozen E. coli cells containing heterologously expressed CcoP were thawed, and the following additions were made (final concentrations given): 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml DNase. The cells were broken by a single passage through a French pressure cell (1200 p.s.i.). Approximately 15 min after breaking, EDTA (5 mm final concentration) was added to the cell-free extract, which was then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove any unbroken cells. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 31,000 × gfor 4 h at 4 °C. The pellet (which was enriched in cytoplasmic membranes containing CcoP) was resuspended in 20 mmsodium phosphate and 50 μm EDTA (pH 7.5), mixed with an equal volume of 10 m urea to remove any peripheral membrane proteins, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The cytoplasmic membranes were washed with ∼200 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate and 50 μm EDTA (pH 7.5), followed by centrifugation at 100,000× g for 90 min at 4 °C. The total amount of protein in the washed membranes was estimated by the BCA method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) as a standard. Solubilization of the membrane proteins was accomplished by stirring a suspension of the cytoplasmic membranes for 30 min at 4 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate and 50 μmEDTA (pH 7.5), to which dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM)2 had been added (2.5 g of detergent/g of total protein). The extracted membranes were sedimented at 160,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant (which contained CcoP) was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated 75-ml DEAE fast flow column (2.6 × 15 cm; Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 150 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 μm EDTA, and 0.02% (w/v) DM (pH 7.5) before eluting the bound CcoP with a stepwise salt gradient formed in the same buffer (140–260 mm NaCl in 20 mmincrements). At each step in the gradient, the column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer containing the appropriate salt concentration. After analysis by SDS-PAGE and both UV-visible and EPR spectroscopies, purified CcoP was stored at −80 °C until needed. Protein was analyzed on 15%-SDS-polyacrylamide gels essentially as described by Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206261) Google Scholar). Gels were stained to indicate the presence of c-type cytochromes (28Goodhew C. Brown K. Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 852: 288-294Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar) or with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The following buffer was used for sample preparation irrespective of the method of protein visualization: 6 m urea, 5% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue. Samples were incubated at 50 °C for 5 min directly before loading onto the gels. Masses of the individual subunits were determined in protein samples (∼5 μm) using a surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometer (Ciphergen) with H4 hydrophobic surface chips according to the manufacturer's protocol. Calibrations using horse heart myoglobin and horseradish peroxidase were done prior to each set of experiments, and the masses obtained are considered to be accurate to within 0.2%. The standard reaction medium (10 ml) consisted of air-saturated 20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 μm EDTA, and 0.02% DM (pH 7.5). Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically at 25 °C with a Clark-type electrode (EDT Instruments, Kent, UK) using 1 mm sodium ascorbate and 0.1 mm TMPD as the artificial electron donors. The amount of heme was determined by the pyridine hemochromogen method using an inverse matrix for simultaneous determination of concentrations of hemes A, B, and C as described by Berry and Trumpower (29Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). UV-visible electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U3100 spectrophotometer. Because cytochromecbb3 oxidase has a very high affinity for oxygen, totally anaerobic conditions are essential for spectroscopic work that requires the analysis of either partly or fully reduced enzyme. These conditions were obtained by allowing protein samples (prepared in a 3.5-ml five-sided cuvette (Hellma)) to stir overnight in an anaerobic (<1 ppm O2) cabinet (Belle Technology, Portesham, UK). The next morning, the magnetic follower was removed, and the cuvette was made airtight with a tight-fitting rubber suba-seal covered by Parafilm. All subsequent additions were made using gas-tight syringes. β-d-Glucose was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, followed by glucose oxidase/catalase (2 and 25 units/ml, respectively). The contents of the cuvette were mixed by inversion and left for ∼30 min to allow for the removal of any traces of oxygen. Reduction of cytochromecbb3 oxidase was achieved by the addition of small aliquots of either dithionite (∼50 μm final concentration) or 2 mm NADH plus 0.1 μmphenazine methosulfate (respective final concentrations). EPR spectra were recorded using an ER-200D X-band spectrometer (Spectrospin, Bruker) equipped with a liquid helium flow cryostat (ESR-9, Oxford Instruments) and interfaced to an ESP1600 computer. Spectra at 9.66 GHz were collected using 2.0-milliwatt (mW) microwave power with a modulation frequency and amplitude of 100 kHz and 1 millitesla, respectively. Room temperature magnetic circular dichroism (RT-MCD) spectra were recorded on either a Jasco J-500D (240–1000 nm) or a Jasco J-730 (800–2000 nm) circular dichrograph. An Oxford Instruments superconducting solenoid with a 25-mm room temperature bore was used to generate magnetic fields of up to 6 teslas. MCD spectral intensities depend linearly on the magnetic field at room temperature and are expressed as Δε per unit magnetic field (m−1 cm−1 T−1) (31Cuypers H. Zumft W.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7236-7246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All samples prepared for magneto-optical spectroscopy were dissolved in deuterated 50 mm HEPES and 50 μm EDTA (pH* 7.4), where pH* is the apparent pH of the deuterated buffer. Spectra were exported as ASCII files and replotted in Axum Version 6.0 (MathSoft Inc.). The first requirement of this study was to obtain an authentic DNA sequence of the ccoNOQP operon from P. stutzeri.The derived amino acid sequence was expected to inform as to the number of c-type hemes in the complex and their potential second axial ligands and to confirm the presence of the three conserved heme ligands in the catalytic subunit (CcoN). To this end, a series of degenerate primers based on multiple sequence alignments were designed that allowed the amplification and sequencing of ∼85% of the ccoNOQPoperon, but neither the 5′- or 3′-regions. The sequence of the 3′-end of the ccoNOQP operon was obtained as follows. Because ccoG, whose expression is required for the assembly of a functional cytochromecbb3, is located immediately downstream of theccoNOQP operon in Rhodobacter capsulatus, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, P. denitrificans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, B. japonicum, and Sinorhizobium meliloti, it was possible to design a degenerate primer in the 5′-region of ccoG with a high degree of confidence. The PCR product that we obtained clearly contained both the 3′-end of ccoP and some 300 bp ofccoG. The sequence of the 5′-end of the ccoNOQP operon was obtained by taking account of the similar organization of the upstream region in both P. stutzeri and P. aeruginosa(Fig. 1) (30Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D. Warrener P. Hickey M.J. Brinkman F.S. Hufnagle W.O. Kowalik D.J. Lagrou M. Garber R.L. Goltry L. Tolentino E. Westbrock-Wadman S. Yuan Y. Brody L.L. Coulter S.N.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7236-7246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aerotaxis receptor gene (aer) is located upstream of ccoNOQP inP. aeruginosa. A degenerate primer based on a multiple sequence alignment of four aer sequences was designed, which allowed amplification of both the 5′-end of ccoN and a 100-bp region immediately upstream. The size of the PCR product and the sequence data (Fig. 1) suggest that unlike P. aeruginosa, the ccoNOQP operon in P. stutzeri is not tandemly repeated. In total, a continuous region of 3579 bp was sequenced (data not shown). This region spans four open reading frames in close proximity (ccoN, ccoO, ccoQ, and ccoP) that together account for 3155 bp of sequence. The amino termini of CcoN, CcoO, and CcoP obtained by direct sequencing of the polypeptides (Ref. 24Urbani A. Gemeinhardt S. Warne A. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and data not shown) are in good agreement with the derived sequence from the corresponding genes.

https://openalex.org/W1978419843,"The APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) tumor suppressor protein has many different intracellular functions including a nuclear export activity. Only little is known about the molecular architecture of the 2843-amino acid APC protein. Guided by secondary structure predictions we identified a fragment close to the N-terminal end, termed APC-(129–250), as a soluble and protease-resistant domain. We solved the crystal structure of APC-(129–250), which is monomeric and consists of three α-helices forming two separate antiparallel coiled coils. APC-(129–250) includes the nuclear export signal NES-(165–174) at the C-terminal end of the first helix. Surprisingly, the conserved hydrophobic amino acids of NES-(165–174) are buried in one of the coiled coils and are thus not accessible for interaction with other proteins. We demonstrate the direct interaction of APC-(129–250) with the nuclear export factor chromosome maintenance region 1 (Crm-1). This interaction is enhanced by the small GTPase Ran in its activated GTP-bound form and also by a double mutation in APC-(129–250), which deletes two amino acids forming two of the major interhelical interactions within the coiled coil. These observations hint to a regulatory mechanism of the APC nuclear export activity by NES masking."
