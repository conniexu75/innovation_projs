https://openalex.org/W2090827556,"Cleavage in embryos of the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata consists of eight very rapid divisions that require continual protein synthesis to sustain them. This synthesis is programmed by stored maternal mRNAs, which code for three or four particularly abundant proteins whose synthesis is barely if at all detectable in the unfertilized egg. One of these proteins is destroyed every time the cells divide. Eggs of the sea urchin Lytechinus pictus and oocytes of the surf clam Spisula solidissima also contain proteins that only start to be made after fertilization and are destroyed at certain points in the cell division cycle. We propose to call these proteins the cyclins."
https://openalex.org/W1516816071,"beta-Aminopropionitrile (BAPN) is a potent irreversible inhibitor of lysyl oxidase, the enzyme which initiates cross-linkage formation in elastin and collagen. The initial interaction of BAPN with aortic lysyl oxidase is competitive with elastin or alkyl amine substrates. Irreversible inhibition develops in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion upon incubation of enzyme with BAPN in the absence of substrate with a limiting inactivation rate constant of 0.16 min-1 and a KI of 6 microM at 37 degrees C. The labeled carbons of [1,2-14C]BAPN and [3-14C]BAPN covalently bind to the enzyme to equivalent extents and in parallel with the development of inactivation, negating the possibility that the nitrile moiety is eliminated from BAPN by enzymatic action. The copper content of the enzyme is not significantly altered upon interaction with BAPN. The extent of labeling by [14C]BAPN is reduced by prior treatment of the enzyme with carbonyl-modifying reagents, suggesting the possibility of enzyme-inhibitor Schiff base formation. However, BAPN is not processed to a free aldehyde product upon incubation with lysyl oxidase. A mechanism of inhibition is postulated which involves the formation of a covalent bond between an enzyme nucleophile and a ketenimine formed from BAPN by enzyme-assisted beta-proton abstraction."
https://openalex.org/W1964162625,"The neuropeptide proctolin (H-Arg-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Thr-OH) is present in the nerve terminals of an identified slow skeletal motoneuron in the cockroach. Proctolin is released onto the target muscle, a coxal depressor, by neuron stimulation and by depolarization with potassium. The physiological action of the motoneuron suggests that proctolin acts as a cotransmitter. Proctolin and neural stimulation produce delayed and sustained contractile effects without muscle depolarization."

https://openalex.org/W2075879961,"A syndrome of spontaneous orofacial dyskinesia was identified in groups of rats treated for 6 months with a wide range of neuroleptic drugs. Phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and substituted benzamides were particularly likely to induce the syndrome. It was observed in the presence of a functional blockade of dopamine receptors and endured for at least 2.5 months after drug withdrawal. There was no relation between the syndrome and changes in striatal dopamine receptors, as indexed by the binding of tritiated spiperone and tritiated cis(Z)-flupenthixol. The syndrome parallels several of the features of clinical tardive dyskinesia, whose pathophysiology thus may not involve changes in the characteristics of striatal dopamine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1491871516,"The tetradecapeptide hormone somatostatin arises from proteolytic processing of a large precursor, pre-prosomatostatin. Studies of other hormone precursors predict that the NH2 terminus of pre-prosomatostatin comprises a leader, or signal, region which is cleaved during its translation. Such co-translational cleavage would generate prosomatostatin. In these studies, we present the complete sequence of rat pre-prosomatostatin, deduced from the nucleotide sequence of cDNAs derived from a somatostatin-rich medullary thyroid carcinoma. These findings indicate that rat pre-prosomatostatin contains 116 amino acids (12,737 daltons). Cell-free translations of medullary thyroid carcinoma mRNA with dog pancreas microsomal membranes were performed to identify the cleavage point of the leader region from prosomatostatin. Partial microsequencing data indicates that the cleavage occurs between the glycine and alanine at positions 24 and 25 of pre-prosomatostatin. Thus, rat prosomatostatin contains 92 amino acids (10,388 daltons). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the rat and human pre-prosomatostatins reveals only four amino acid substitutions. In view of the high degree of homology between rat and human pre-prosomatostatin, we expect a similar cleavage site and NH2-terminal structure for human prosomatostatin. The high level of conservation between rodents and humans of the entire pre-prosomatostatin molecule further suggests the possibility of biologic functions of the NH2-terminal portions of prosomatostatin."
https://openalex.org/W1531907422,"Incubation of intact rat adipocytes with physiological concentrations of catecholamines inhibits the specific binding of 125I-insulin and 125I-epidermal growth factor (EGF) by 40 to 70%. Affinity labeling of the alpha subunit of the insulin receptor demonstrates that the inhibition of hormone binding is directly reflective of a specific decrease in the degree of receptor occupancy. The stereospecificity and dose dependency of the binding inhibitions are typical of a classic beta 1-adrenergic receptor response with half-maximal inhibition occurring at 10 nM R-(-)-isoproterenol. Specific alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists have no effect, while beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists block the inhibition of 125I-insulin and 125I-EGF binding to receptors induced by beta-adrenergic receptor agonists. Further, these effects are mimicked by incubation of adipocytes with dibutyryl cyclic AMP or with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. The beta-adrenergic inhibition of both 125I-insulin and 125I-EGF binding is very rapid, requiring only 10 min of isoproterenol pretreatment at 37 degrees C for a maximal effect. Removal of isoproterenol by washing the cells in the presence of alprenolol leads to complete reversal of these effects. The inhibition of 125I-EGF binding is temperature dependent whereas the inhibition of 125I-insulin binding is relatively insensitive to the temperature of isoproterenol pretreatment. Scatchard analysis of 125I-insulin and 125I-EGF binding demonstrated that the decrease of insulin receptor-binding activity may be due to a decrease in the apparent number of insulin receptors while the inhibition of EGF receptor binding can be accounted for by a decrease in apparent EGF receptor affinity. The decrease in the insulin receptor-binding activity is physiologically expressed as a dose-dependent decrease of insulin responsiveness in the adipocyte with respect to two known responses, stimulation of insulin-like growth factor II receptor binding and activation of the glucose-transport system. These results demonstrate a beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated cyclic AMP-dependent mechanism for the regulation of insulin and EGF receptors in the rat adipocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2120507960,"tissue was much more difficult to detect, and only recently have reports appeared which demonstrate the presence of somatostatin receptors in preparations of rat brain (5-71, adrenal (8), and pituitary (9-11). One major problem was that the somatostatin analogs used as radioligands were readily degraded by proteolytic enzymes present in the tissue preparations. In addition to aminopeptidase and endopeptidase activities previously shown to inactivate somatostatin (12), we also considered the possibility that enzymatic reduction of the disulfide bond of somatostatin analogs such as N-'2'I-tyrosinyl-somatostatin and ['2'I-Tyr]somatostatin would also hinder their use as radioligands in binding studies. The conversion of these peptides to the linear, reduced form would lower their receptor affinity, based on the decreased biological activity of several noncyclizable somatostatin analogs (2). Nonreducible, cyclic analogs of somatostatin, in which methylene groups replace the sulfur atoms, were reported to retain high biological activity (13). In an effort to circumvent the possible problem of disulfide reduction, we have used in the present studies a tyrosylated dicarba analog of somatostatin, CGP 23996.' We demonstrated that 'I-labeled CGP 23996 was highly resistant to degradation, even at 37 C, and proved to be suitable for the identification and characterization of somatostatin receptors on synaptosomal membranes from rat cerebral cortex.

https://openalex.org/W1515235319,"delta-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA), the first committed precursor to the tetrapyrrole components of hemes and chlorophylls, is synthesized by two different routes in the photosynthetic phytoflagellate Euglena gracilis: directly from glutamate, mediated by a 5-carbon pathway, and via condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA, catalyzed by the enzyme ALA synthase. The physiological roles of the two pathways were determined by administration of specifically 14C-labeled ALA precursors to cultures growing under different physiological conditions. Relative activities of the ALA synthase and 5-carbon pathways were monitored by incorporation of radioactivity from [2-14C] glycine and [1-14C]glutamate into highly purified protoheme, heme a and chlorophyll a derivatives. Wild type cells grown photoautotrophically or photoheterotrophically synthesized chlorophyll and incorporated radioactivity from [1-14C]glutamate into the tetrapyrrole nucleus of the pigment. [2-14C]Glycine was incorporated primarily into the nontetrapyrrole-derived portions of chlorophyll. In the same cultures both [2-14C]glycine and [1-14C]glutamate were efficiently incorporated into protoheme, while only [2-14C] glycine was incorporated into heme a. In dark-grown wild type or light-grown aplastidic cells, no chlorophyll was formed, and both protoheme and heme a were labeled exclusively from [2-14C]glycine. These results indicate: (a) ALA synthase and the 5-carbon pathway operate simultaneously in growing green cells; (b) the 5-carbon pathway provides ALA for chloroplast protoheme and chlorophyll, and is associated with chloroplast development; (c) ALA synthase provides ALA only for nonplastid heme biosynthesis; and (d) the two ALA pathways are separately compartmentalized along with complete sets of enzymes for subsequent tetrapyrrole synthesis from each ALA pool. The protoheme that was synthesized from [1-14C] glutamate had a higher specific radioactivity than chlorophyll synthesized from the same precursor. This result together with calculated specific radioactivities of the products synthesized during the incubation period, suggest that both protoheme and heme a undergo metabolic turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1494049520,"Fibronectin purified from a plasma protein side fraction in the absence of denaturant contained 1.5 to 1.9 cryptic free sulfhydryl groups per 200- to 250-kDa subunit. Exposure of sulfhydryl groups in physiologic salt solutions required at least 1 M guanidine, and 3 M guanidine was required for optimal exposure. The sulfhydryl groups were not exposed by collagen, a fibronectin-binding collagen fragment, fibrinogen, heparin, hyaluronic acid, calcium ion, EDTA, deoxycholate, or methylamine. One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicated that a molecule of 40-60 kDa was disulfide-bonded to a minor portion of the fibronectin in whole human plasma and in preparations of purified fibronectin. In addition, traces of disulfide-bonded multimers were present in preparations of purified fibronectin. The proportion of fibronectin in disulfide-bonded multimers increased in guanidine-containing solutions. Compared to dimeric fibronectin, these multimers had limited solubility in physiologic buffers, could be readily cross-linked by Factor XIIIa, and exhibited altered tryptic susceptibility. In free sulfhydryl groups were blocked by prior alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide, fibronectin did not form disulfide-bonded multimers in guanidine-containing solutions. The patterns of altered tryptic susceptibility and cyanide cleavage suggested that multimer formation is mediated by both sulfhydryls of fibronectin. The transition from dimeric to multimeric fibronectin can serve as a model for the formation of disulfide-bonded fibronectin multimers in the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1492094611,"High affinity Ca2+-stimulated Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity of nerve ending particles (synaptosomes) from rat brain tissue appears to be associated primarily with isolated synaptic plasma membranes. The synaptic membrane (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity was found to exhibit strict dependence on Mg2+ for the presence of the activity, a high affinity for Ca2+ (K0.5 = 0.23 microM), and relatively high affinities for both Mg2+ and ATP (K0.5 = 6.0 microM for Mg2+ and KM = 18.9 microM for ATP). These kinetic constants were determined in incubation media that were buffered with the divalent cation chelator trans-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. The enzyme activity was not inhibited by ouabain or oligomycin but was sensitive to low concentrations of vanadate. The microsomal membrane subfraction was the other brain subcellular fraction with a high affinity (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity which approximated that of the synaptic plasma membranes. The two membrane-related high affinity (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activities could be distinguished on the basis of their differential sensitivity to vanadate at concentrations below 10 microM. Only the synaptic plasma membrane (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase was inhibited by 0.25-10 microM vanadate. The studies described here indicate the possible involvement of both the microsomal and the neuronal plasma membrane (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase in high affinity Ca2+ transport across membranes of brain neurons. In addition, they suggest a means by which the relative contributions of each transport system might be evaluated based on their differential sensitivity to inhibition by vanadate."

https://openalex.org/W1602095849,"Administration of leupeptin to rats induces the accumulation of numerous autophagic vacuoles in the liver. Furuno et al. (Furuno, K., Ishikawa, T., and Kato, K. (1982) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 91, 1485-1494) have recently devised a method for Percoll density gradient equilibrium fractionation of crude lysosomal fractions to isolate a highly enriched preparation of autophagic vacuoles. This system was used to determine whether cytoplasmic enzymes are normally sequestered into autophagic vacuoles in fed animals. Within 30 min following the administration of leupeptin to fed rats, several cytoplasmic enzymes could be demonstrated in vacuolar fractions heavier than mitochondria and normal lyosomes. The activities of tyrosine aminotransferase and lactic dehydrogenase as well as antigens of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase were detectable in fractions with densities of 1.115 to 1.15 g/ml containing cathepsins and acid phosphatase. The cytoplasmic enzymes in these fractions exhibited latency and were sequestered within membranous organelles. Six hours after the administration of leupeptin, the autophagic vacuoles gradually disappeared from these fractions concurrently with the loss of both cytoplasmic and lysosomal marker enzymes. For 6 h after injection of leupeptin the activities of cathepsin D and acid phosphatase increased in autophagic vacuoles and decreased in the postvacuolar lysosomal fraction. Administration of dexamethasone, which induces the synthesis of tyrosine aminotransferase and cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase, selectively increased the sequestration of these enzymes to proportional degrees. Cycloheximide administered simultaneously with leupeptin rapidly inhibited formation of autophagic vacuoles and the sequestrations of both cytoplasmic and lysosomal enzymes. However, when cycloheximide was administered 1 h after leupeptin, the formation of autophagosomes and the sequestration of cytoplasmic enzymes were inhibited but the vacuolar uptake of acid phosphatase and cathepsin D continued to increase for several hours. When cycloheximide was injected 1 h after leupeptin, losses of lactic dehydrogenase and aldolase proteins were observed in autophagic vacuoles isolated 1 and 2 h later."

https://openalex.org/W2095997287,"We have identified and characterized calcium transport and the phosphorylated intermediate of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase in plasma membrane vesicles prepared from rat liver. The calcium transport did not absolutely require the presence of oxalate and was completely inhibited by 1 microM of ionophore A23187. Oxalate, which serves as a trapping agent in calcium uptake of skeletal muscle and liver microsomes, was not absolutely required to maintain the net accumulation of calcium. The Vmax and Km for calcium uptake were 35.2 +/- 10.1 pmol of calcium/mg of protein/min, and 17.6 +/- 2.5 nM of free calcium, respectively. Ten mM magnesium was required for the maximal accumulation of calcium. Substitution of 5 and 10 mM ADP, CTP, GTP, and UTP for ATP could not support calcium uptake. The calcium uptake was not affected by 0.5 mM ouabain, 20 mM azide, or 2 micrograms/ml of oligomycin but was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by vanadate, with a Ki of approximately 20 microM for vanadate. The substrate affinities and specificities of this calcium-transport activity suggest that it is closely associated with the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase reported in the plasma membranes of liver (Lotersztajn, S., Hanoune, J., and Pecker, F. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11209-11215). A calcium-stimulated and magnesium-dependent phosphoprotein was also demonstrated in the same membrane vesicles. The free calcium concentration at which its phosphorylation was half-maximal was 15.5 +/- 5.6 nM. Sodium fluoride, ouabain, sodium azide, oligomycin, adriamycin, and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide did not affect its formation while vanadate at 100 microM inhibited the calcium-dependent phosphorylation by approximately 60%. The properties of this phosphoprotein suggest that it may be the phosphorylated intermediate of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase in the plasma membranes of rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W1968592613,"Conditions have been developed which allow for the efficient, accurate, and specific polyadenylation of exogenously added mRNA precursors in a whole-cell lysate derived from HeLa cells. Precursors are prepared by in vitro transcription using linear DNA templates in a HeLa whole-cell lysate, purified, and added to another lysate. Under optimal conditions (which are quite precise with respect to several variables), 70% or more of the precursor molecules become polyadenylated, and the length of the poly(A) segment added is controlled much as it is in vivo, giving rise to 150-300-nucleotide long stretches of poly(A). Under suboptimal conditions, both the fraction of precursor RNA that becomes polyadenylated and also the length of the poly(A) segment added are reduced. The in vitro polyadenylation reaction is also remarkably specific: Only in vitro-synthesized pre-mRNAs that contain a 3' end located at or slightly downstream from the corresponding in vivo mRNA 3' end site can be efficiently polyadenylated in vitro. These results suggest that the poly(A) polymerase requires one or more protein (or RNA) factors in order to bring about accurate and specific polyadenylation in vitro, and that the poly(A) polymerase complex must interact with a specific recognition signal at the 3' end of mRNA precursors in order to catalyze subsequent polyadenylation."
https://openalex.org/W1508427433,"The transport of L-glutamic acid has been studied in skin-derived diploid human fibroblasts. Competition analysis in the presence and absence of Na+ and mathematical discrimination by nonlinear regression indicated that L-glutamic acid enters the cell by at least three transport systems: 1) a high affinity Na+-dependent system which has been found to be identical to the previously described system for anionic amino acids (Gazzola, G. C., Dall'Asta, V., Bussolati, O., Makowske, M., and Christensen, H. N. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 6054-6059) and which is provisionally designated as System X-AG; this route was shared by L-aspartic acid; 2) a low affinity Na+-dependent system resembling the ASC System for neutral amino acids (Franchi-Gazzola, R., Gazzola, G. C., Dall'Asta, V., and Guidotti, G. G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9582-9587); its reactivity toward L-glutamic acid was strongly inhibited by L-serine, but not by 2-(methyl-amino)isobutyric acid; and 3) a Na+-independent system similar to System XC- described in fetal human lung fibroblasts (Bannai, S., and Kitamura, E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2372-2376). The XC- system served for L-glutamic acid and L-cystine, the latter amino acid behaving as a potent inhibitor of L-glutamic acid uptake. Amino acid starvation did not change the uptake of L-glutamic acid by the two Na+-dependent systems, but enhanced the activity of System XC- by increasing its Vmax. L-Glutamic acid transport was also affected by the density of the culture. An increased cell density lowered the uptake of the amino acid by Systems ASC and XC- and promoted the uptake by System X-AG. All these variations were dependent upon changes in Vmax."
https://openalex.org/W1571862891,"The mitochondrial matrix enzyme, ornithine aminotransferase, is induced in rat liver by the administration of a diet high in protein and by glucagon. The rate of synthesis of the enzyme is increased 100-fold in the livers of rats maintained on a 60% relative to a 0% protein diet, whereas the levels of functional and hybridizable mRNA measured by in vitro translation and through the use of a cloned cDNA probe increased by only 2- to 6-fold and 2- to 3-fold, respectively. Under conditions of glucagon induction that resulted in a 10- to 12-fold increase in the rate of enzyme synthesis, the relative level of functional ornithine aminotransferase mRNA increased by only 2-fold, and the level of hybridizable mRNA actually decreased. The rate of polypeptide chain elongation and the relative number of ornithine aminotransferase nascent chains on polysomes were 2-fold and 23-fold greater, respectively, in hepatocytes derived from 60% relative to 0% protein-fed rats. Using these data, a 23-fold increase in the translational efficiency of the mRNA was calculated. This increase, along with a 2-fold increase in the mRNA level, completely account for the 40-fold increase in the rate of ornithine aminotransferase synthesis observed in hepatocytes derived from 60% protein-fed rats. We conclude that ornithine aminotransferase synthesis is regulated at both a translational and a pretranslational level in rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W1548708480,"32P-labeled acetyl-CoA carboxylase was isolated from 32P-labeled rat epididymal fat pads by avidin-Sepharose affinity chromatography after exposure to epinephrine and insulin. Epinephrine led to an inactivation of the isolated enzyme by a reduction of Vmax, while the insulin stimulation observed in crude extracts did not survive enzyme purification. Both insulin and epinephrine caused only small increases in total 32P content of the enzyme. However, mapping of tryptic 32P-phosphopeptides by high performance liquid chromatography revealed that epinephrine and insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of 32P-peptides specific for each hormone. The major 32P-peptide phosphorylated by epinephrine co-migrated with the major 32P-peptide phosphorylated in vitro by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, while the 32P-peptide phosphorylated in response to insulin co-migrated with that phosphorylated by casein kinase-I and casein kinase-II. The effects of epinephrine on carboxylase activity and phosphorylation can thus be accounted for by the expected epinephrine-induced activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. While the increase in site-specific phosphorylation caused by insulin cannot be directly linked to insulin-induced activation in crude extracts, these data suggest that casein kinase-I and/or casein kinase-II may mediate the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1570103557,"The kinetics of ATP-induced dissociation of dynein from the dynein-microtubule complex has been investigated by stopped flow light scattering methods. The addition of ATP to the dynein-microtubule complex induced a large, rapid decrease in light scattering followed by a smaller and much slower decrease. The fast light scattering change was shown to be a measure of the ATP-induced dissociation of dynein from the dynein-microtubule complex and was distinguished from microtubule disassembly by several criteria. (i) The fast reaction occurred over a period of milliseconds and the rate was a function of the ATP concentration, whereas, the slow reaction occurred over a period of several seconds and was independent of ATP concentration; (ii) the amplitude of the fast reaction was directly proportional to the amount of dynein bound to the microtubule lattice; and (iii) only the slow phase was inhibited by the addition of the microtubule-stabilizing drug, taxol. The rate of ATP-induced dissociation of dynein from the microtubule increased linearly with increasing ATP concentration to give an apparent second order rate constant for ATP binding equal to k1 = 4.7 X 10(6) M-1 s-1 according to the following pathway: (formula; see text) where M X D represents the dynein-microtubule complex and D represents dynein. The loss of signal amplitude at high ATP concentration provided a minimum estimate for the rate of dissociation of the ternary complex (M X D X ATP) equal to kd greater than 1000 s-1. Thus, the dynein-microtubule system is similar to actomyosin in that ATP induces an extremely rapid dissociation of dynein from the microtubule."

https://openalex.org/W1512735491,"The mitochondria of rat intestinal mucosa were found to have an enzymatic activity that converts radioactive glutamate to pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) in the presence of ATP, NADPH, and MgCl2. The product of this enzyme was identified as P5C by the fact that it was converted to proline by chemical reduction with NaBH4 or by enzymatic reduction with NADH in the presence of purified yeast P5C reductase. The product was demonstrated to be P5C rather than pyrroline-2-carboxylate by thin layer chromatography. The presence of the activity in mitochondria prepared from intestinal mucosa of germ-free rats proved that this activity is of mammalian origin. Omission of either ATP, NADPH, or MgCl2 from the reaction mixture resulted in little or no activity. The optimal pH appeared to be about 7.0 under the conditions used. Substrate saturation curves in the presence of an ATP and an NADPH regeneration system gave apparent Km values of 2.5 mM for glutamate, 0.19 mM for ATP, and 6.5 microM for NADPH in the presence of 20 mM MgCl2.

The overall yield was 5%. The purified ATPase appears to consist of a single polypeptide component of Mr = 78,000. The Triton-solubilized purified enzyme has a specific activity of approximately 50 mumol of ATP hydrolyzed per min per mg, is dependent on phospholipids for activity, and is strongly inhibited by vanadate (I50 = 3 microM). Maximal ATPase activity is displayed at pH 7.3. Mg2+-ATP, for which the enzyme has a Km of 60 microM, is the best substrate. The ATPase forms an acylphosphate intermediate that can also be detected in native membranes as the major acylphosphate component. The purified ATPase, when reconstituted into soybean phospholipid vesicles, exhibits coupling, e.g. the ATPase activity can be stimulated at least 8-fold by valinomycin in the presence of potassium. Based on these observations we conclude that the enzyme we have purified is an ion-motive ATPase, most likely a K+-ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1521349370,"An ATPase/dATPase activity found associated with the nuclear matrix-pore complex-lamina fraction isolated from embryos of Drosophila melanogaster has been characterized. In the presence of either Ca2+ or Mg2+, this activity hydrolyzed either ATP or dATP to ADP or dADP, respectively, and Pi. Hydrolysis was optimal from pH 6.5-7.2, did not require either Na+ or K+, and was not significantly inhibited by NaF, ouabain, quercetin, Na3VO4, CTP, or GTP. In contrast, hydrolysis was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, EDTA, and cordycepin 5'-triphosphate. In all respects tested, hydrolysis of ATP was indistinguishable from that of dATP and when incubated in the same reaction mixture, each was linearly competitive with the other. Based upon these properties, a series of direct UV photoaffinity labeling experiments was performed. Using alpha-[32P]dATP, alpha-[32P]ATP, or gamma-[32P]ATP, only a single polypeptide (Mr approximately 174,000) was photolabeled in a manner completely consistent with the enzymology of ATP and dATP hydrolysis; cell fractionation studies revealed a predominantly or exclusively nuclear localization. A polypeptide with virtually the identical mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels was similarly identified as the major photolabeled species in nuclear envelope fractions obtained from chickens, opossums, rats, and guinea pigs.

Reduction of the free Ca2+ concentration or addition of trifluoperazine caused a slow reversal of binding. Nanomolar 125I-CaM required several hours to reach binding equilibrium, but the rate was much faster at higher concentrations. Scatchard plots of binding were curvilinear, and a class of high affinity sites was identified with a KD of 0.5 nM and estimated capacity of 400 sites per cell equivalent for inside-out vesicles (IOVs). The high affinity sites of IOVs most likely correspond to Ca2+ transporter since: (a) Ka of activation of (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase and KD for binding were nearly identical, and (b) partial digestion of IOVs with alpha-chymotrypsin produced activation of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase with loss of the high affinity sites. 125I-CaM bound in solution to a class of binding proteins (KD approximately 55 nM, 7.3 pmol per mg of ghost protein) which were extracted from ghosts by low ionic strength incubation. Soluble binding proteins were covalently cross-linked to 125I-CaM with Lomant's reagent, and 2 bands of 8,000 and 40,000 Mr (Mr of CaM subtracted) and spectrin dimer were observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis autoradiography. The 8,000 and 40,000 Mr proteins represent a previously unrecognized class of CaM-binding sites which may mediate unexplained Ca2+-induced effects in the erythrocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1486647359,"Treatment of rats with 3-methylcholanthrene leads not only to a marked accumulation in the liver of translatable mRNA coding for a 56-kilodalton polypeptide representing cytochrome P-450c, the major 3-methylcholanthrene-induced cytochrome P-450 of rat liver, but also to the accumulation of comparable amounts of mRNA encoding a 52-kilodalton polypeptide which is immunoprecipitated with antibodies prepared against rat liver cytochrome P-450c. Further electrophoretic and immunochemical characterization of the latter translation product demonstrates that it corresponds to cytochrome P-450d, the major isosafrole-induced form of rat liver cytochrome P-450. The mRNAs for cytochromes P-450c and P-450d can be completely separated by electrophoresis in denaturing agarose gels and have chain lengths of approximately 4000 and 2000 nucleotides, respectively. These two mRNAs do not show detectable sequence homology to the mRNAs coding for the major phenobarbital-induced forms of cytochrome P-450 (P-450b and P-450e) since in Northern blotting experiments they fail to hybridize under conditions of low to moderate stringency to cloned probes for the latter mRNAs."

No changes in postsynaptic sensitivity to transmitter were detected. The long-lasting potentiation shows little sensitivity to changes in extracellular calcium concentration and seems to be entirely presynaptic in origin.
https://openalex.org/W1511173672,"The effect of purified beef heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit on tyrosine aminotransferase activity in intact cultured rat H35 hepatoma cells was directly tested by micro-injection using human red blood cell ghosts as vehicles. Although the micro-injection procedure itself produced temporary fluctuations in protein synthesis and in tyrosine aminotransferase activity in H35 cells, after a recovery period of 8-12 h, these parameters returned to normal in parallel with restoration of full inducibility of the aminotransferase by both 8-Br-cAMP and dexamethasone. Eight to sixteen hours after fusion of H35 cells with unloaded ghosts, ghosts loaded with bovine serum albumin or mock-loaded with the partially purified protein kinase catalytic subunit, no significant change in the activity of the aminotransferase was detected. In contrast, fusion with ghosts loaded with the catalytic subunit at concentrations between 0.1-2 mg/ml caused reproducible 2-3-fold increases in enzyme activity. Homogeneous preparations of the catalytic subunit exhibited even greater potency as an inducer. The effect was both time- and concentration-dependent and was abolished by inactivation of the catalytic subunit with N-ethylmaleimide prior to loading. The partially purified inhibitor of protein kinase from beef heart, while not affecting basal tyrosine aminotransferase activity, selectively inhibited the ability of 8-Br-cAMP but not that of dexamethasone to stimulate the activity of this enzyme. In addition, micro-injection of the pure regulatory subunit of the kinase blocked the response of the aminotransferase to low concentrations of 8-Br-cAMP. These results provide strong support for the proposition that the catalytic subunit of protein kinase mediates the effects of cAMP on the synthesis of tyrosine aminotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1601110962,"Islet cell plasma membranes contain a calcium-stimulated and magnesium-dependent ATPase (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase) which requires calmodulin for maximum enzyme activity (Kotagal, N., Patke, C., Landt, M., McDonald, J., Colca, J., Lacy, P., and McDaniel, M. (1982) FEBS Lett. 137, 249-252). Investigations indicated that exogenously added calmodulin increases the velocity and decreases the Km for Ca2+ of the high affinity (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase. These studies routinely employed the chelator ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) to maintain Ca2+ concentrations in the submicromolar range. During the course of these investigations, it was found unexpectedly that increasing the concentrations of EGTA (0.1-4 mM) and total calcium in the media, while maintaining constant free Ca2+ levels, increased the velocity of the high affinity (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase. The free calcium concentrations under these conditions were verified by a calcium-sensitive electrode. The (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase maximally activated by 2-4 mM EGTA was not further stimulated by calmodulin, whereas camodulin stimulation increased as the concentration of EGTA in the media was decreased. A similar enhancement by Ca-EGTA was observed on active calcium transport by the plasma membrane-enriched fraction. Moreover, Ca-EGTA had a negligible effect on both active calcium transport as well as Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity by the islet cell endoplasmic reticulum, processes which are not stimulated by calmodulin. The results indicate that stimulation by Ca-EGTA may be used to differentiate calcium transport systems by these subcellular organelles. Furthermore, the concentration of EGTA routinely employed to maintain free Ca2+ levels may itself obscure effects of calmodulin and other physiological agents on calcium-dependent activities."
https://openalex.org/W2087826466,"Parasympathetic neurons, when cultured alone, lose sensitivity to acetylcholine, but if striated muscle is included in the culture, neuronal chemosensitivity is maintained. The membrane remnants of myotubes ruptured by osmotic shock also supported the responsiveness of the cultured neurons to transmitter, whereas muscle-conditioned medium or membrane remnants of nonmuscle embryonic skin cells did not support this responsiveness. The regulation of chemosensitivity by contact of neurons with the target cell membrane may be important in the formation and maintenance of neuronal circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W1577617347,"The demonstration of the ornithine biosynthesis from glutamate in cell-free homogenates of rat intestinal mucosa by Ross, G., Dunn, D., and Jones, M.E. (1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 85, 140-147 suggested that this tissue might have the capacity to convert glutamate to pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C). We have shown in the preceding paper (Wakabayashi, Y., and Jones, M.E. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3865-3872) that this is the case. The intracellular distribution of the P5C-synthesizing activity was investigated utilizing a newly developed procedure for subcellular fractionation of the rat intestinal mucosa. We found that the activity resided in the mitochondrial fraction as characterized by marker enzymes and an electron micrograph. The mitochondrial membrane fraction, freed of the soluble matrix and intermembrane space enzymes, retained all of the P5C-synthesizing activity. Addition of the soluble fraction to the membrane fraction did not affect the activity. P5C synthase, the name we have chosen for the protein(s) that catalyzes P5C synthesis from glutamate when ATP and NADPH are present, is susceptible to thermal inactivation in the presence of detergent. By lowering the incubation temperature to or below 20 degrees C, one can obtain a linear production of P5C with respect to time and protein concentration. Lower incubation temperatures are recommended for routine assay of this enzyme(s). Addition of 30% glycerol to the incubation mixture resulted in a linear formation of P5C with time at 30 degrees C; this and other data suggest that polyhydroxylic compounds may protect this protein against denaturation. Preliminary experiments suggest that P5C synthase can be extracted from a mitochondrial membrane in the presence of detergent, a high salt concentration, and glycerol. The possibility that the enzyme(s) is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1496199639,"A rapid Ca2+ release from Ca2+-loaded sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from fast skeletal muscle can be induced under conditions which permit the formation of a stable phosphorylated intermediate of the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase. Such a state can be achieved experimentally by phosphorylating the ATPase in the absence of Mg2+ ions, which otherwise would stimulate the dephosphorylation step(s). Also, quercetine stimulates the rapid release of Ca2+ if used in the concentration range which does not produce inhibition of phosphoenzyme formation, but which inhibits phosphoenzyme dephosphorylation. The rapid efflux of Ca2+ ions proceeds as long as the low affinity Ca2+-binding sites facing the lumen of the vesicles are saturated and as long as Ca2+ is removed from the catalytic sites facing the cytosol. A molecular mechanism of the phosphoenzyme-mediated Ca2+ release is proposed. This mechanism is based on a rapid shuttling of the ATPase molecules between an ADP-sensitive and an ADP-insensitive phosphorylated state."
https://openalex.org/W1563091780,"Reactions that generate and remove acetoacetyl-CoA and acetoacetate were measured in mitochondria and cytosol of rat liver. The activities surveyed include acetoacetyl-CoA hydrolase, acetoacetyl-glutathione hydrolase, acetoacetyl-CoA:glutathione acyl transferase, 3-ketothiolases I and II, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase and synthase, and acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase. Phosphocellulose chromatography shows that cytosol contains at least four acetoacetyl-CoA hydrolase activities, two of which do not coincide with 3-ketothiolases or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, while mitochondria contain at least three acetoacetyl-CoA hydrolase activities that overlap partially or completely with 3-ketothiolases and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA lyase. Two of the mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA hydrolase activities are not found in cytosol. Cytosol contains at least two and mitochondrial extracts at least six acetoacetyl-glutathione hydrolase activities. Mitochondria and cytosol both contain two isozymes of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (thiolases Ia and Ib). Chain length specificities show that the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of thiolase Ia differ from each other. We report a new isozyme of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (thiolase I) in rat liver cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1584230237,"Formation of a complex of D-amino acid oxidase (D-amino acid:O2 oxidoreductase (deaminating), EC 1.4.3.3) and benzoate, an enzyme-substrate complex model, was studied by measuring the fluorescence life-time of the coenzyme FAD of the complex by using a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser and a streak camera. The value of lifetime was 60 +/- 10 ps in the monomer of the complex and it was extremely short (much less than 5 ps) in the dimer of the complex. Since the values of fluorescence lifetime of the coenzyme are 130 ps in the monomeric form of free enzyme and 40 ps in the dimeric form of free enzyme, the decrease in the lifetime upon complex formation with benzoate is slight in the monomer (reduced to one-half) whereas marked in the dimer (reduced to less than 1/10). By analyzing the fluorescence decay curve, a dissociation constant of the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the complex was evaluated to be 0.4 +/- 0.3 microM, which is much smaller than that in free enzyme. Fluorescence analysis under steady state excitation revealed that the apparent dissociation constant (K) of FAD from the enzyme was decreased by 1:1000 upon the complex formation. Relative quantum yield of the fluorescence of FAD in the complex to that of free FAD exhibited appreciable dependence on the complex concentration: greater in the monomer and less in the dimer. These results suggest that a molecular interaction between FAD and amino acid residue(s) is strengthened by the complex formation, which contributes to a remarkable conformational change in the protein moiety of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1505019195,"The cytosol fraction of rat pancrease can bind [3H] estradiol specifically and extensively. In contrast to the rat uterus, the binding protein in pancreas requires an accessory factor as a coligand in the steroid-binding reaction. Removal of this accessory factor by passage of the cytosol through CM Affi-Gel blue columns renders eluate fractions virtually incompetent with respect to binding of [3H]estradiol (10 nM). Certain synthetic oligopeptides such as N-benzoyl-L-argininyl-p-nitroanilide, as well as an endogenous accessory factor, can reactivate binding of [3H]estradiol. Thus, localization of the protein that binds [3H]estradiol following chromatography with CM Affi-Gel blue columns can be determined readily by assaying eluate fractions in the absence and presence of either accessory factor or N-benzoyl-L-argininyl-p-nitroanilide. Addition of somatostatin (tetradecapeptide referred to as SRIF14; somatotropin release inhibiting factor) to the activatable, but incompetent, eluate fractions, also enhanced binding of [3H]estradiol. The effect of SRIF14 was biphasic. The threshold concentration required for activation of [3H]estradiol binding was about 1 microM, and maximal stimulation occurred at 25 microM. At higher concentrations of SRIF14, binding declined and reached basal levels at about 75 microM. The concentrations of somatostatin required for activation of binding of [3H]estradiol in vivo may be lower than those indicated above since 1) preparations containing [3H]estradiol-binding protein also contained an SRIF14 peptidase. Following incubation of [125I-Tyr1]SRIF14 with these preparations there was loss of binding of radiolabeled peptide with SRIF14 antiserum. 2) The biphasic nature of SRIF14 activation may reflect feedback inhibition of [3H]estradiol binding by a degradation product of SRIF14. Since SRIF14 has been identified in the delta- (or D-) islet cells of the pancreas, and in concentrations that may be in the microM range, the possibility is raised that these cells serve a paracrine function with respect to acinar cell secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1556372944,"Temporal patterns of biosynthesis and the rates of turnover of the 53,000- and 160,000-Da glycoproteins from the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane were determined and compared with the rates of biosynthesis of the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-dependent ATPase in the differentiating rat myogenic continuous cell line, L6. Cells were labeled at various stages of differentiation with [35S]methionine and sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins were isolated from Triton extracts of the cells by protein A-mediated immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the radioactivity incorporated into particular protein bands was recorded by autoradiography. The patterns of biosynthesis and the rates of degradation of the three intrinsic sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins were similar, even though two of them were glycosylated and one was not. The glycoproteins and the ATPase were found in the microsomal fraction obtained from the cell homogenate but not in the cytosol. This suggests that the synthesis and processing of these intrinsic sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins occurred in membrane systems."
https://openalex.org/W1557105861,"Rat hepatoma cells that have undergone stepwise selection in increasing concentrations of pyrazofurin have coordinately increased levels of both orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.10) and orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.23) activity. These two activities catalyze the conversion of orotic acid to UMP in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Cells selected in 50 microM pyrazofurin have over 40 times the wild type level for both activities. A single polypeptide of approximately 55,000 daltons is increased in the resistant cells in amounts corresponding to the increase in the two activities. Resistant cell lines that are grown for extended periods in the absence of pyrazofurin are unstable, losing their elevated levels of both enzyme activities and the increased specific protein. Antibody prepared against a purified protein containing both enzyme activities binds specifically to this increased protein. These results corroborate other evidence indicating the two enzyme activities are contained within a single polypeptide called UMP synthase. Poly(A+) mRNA isolated from wild type and resistant lines was analyzed by in vitro translation for production of UMP synthase protein. Immunoprecipitation of the translation products shows the resistant cells have a 17-fold increase in translatable mRNA activity coding for UMP synthase. The synthase accounts for 0.24% of the total in vitro translation products synthesized with poly(A+) mRNA from the pyrazofurin-resistant cells as opposed to 0.014% with wild type mRNA. A cloned UMP synthase cDNA sequence hybridizes strongly to a 1.8-kilobase mRNA in the resistant cells. This mRNA is only barely detectable in equivalent preparations from wild type cells. Quantitation of the mRNA by dot hybridization techniques indicates a 16-fold increase in UMP synthase mRNA in the resistant cells. Although this increase in mRNA for UMP synthase could explain most of the increased protein, it is not sufficient to totally account for the 40-fold increase in UMP synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1503442442,"Glycine and taurine conjugates of bile acids modulate gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase by interacting with the cysteinylglycine binding site (acceptor site) of the enzyme. These compounds stimulate hydrolysis of glutamine and S-methylglutathione and the rate of the inactivation of the enzyme by the gamma-glutamyl site-directed reagent, AT-125 (L-(alpha S,5S)-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid). Transpeptidation between S-methylglutathione and methionine was inhibited by these compounds. These effects resemble those caused by hippurate; the glycine derivatives of bile acids, however, exhibit a much greater affinity for transpeptidase than hippurate. Cholate, as shown previously for benzoate, also seems to bind to a portion of the acceptor site as indicated by its effects on S-methylglutathione utilization and AT-125-dependent inactivation of the enzyme. The Kd values for cholate and benzoate are, however, at least one order of magnitude larger than those for their respective glycine derivatives. The acceptor site-directed modulators increase the affinity of the enzyme for AT-125 and kinetic and binding studies show that binding of gamma-glutamyl site-directed reagents increases the affinity of the enzyme for cholate. These results thus indicate cooperative interactions between the gamma-glutamyl donor and acceptor binding domains of the transpeptidase active center."

The F6-dependent ATPase binding has an apparent association constant 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than that obtained with oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein. The oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein-dependent, membrane-bound ATPase activity is sensitive to rutamycin while the F6-dependent, membrane-bound ATPase activity is insensitive to rutamycin. F1-ATPase and Type II ATPase require F6 in addition to oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein and FB to reconstitute 32Pi-ATP exchange activity in silicotungstic acid particles. This F6 requirement for the 32Pi-ATP exchange is not related to the F6 effect on the ATPase binding. The Type I ATPase and therefore the 26,500-dalton subunit associated with it requires F6 and FB to reconstitute 32Pi-ATP exchange activity in silicotungstic acid particles. Oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein can be interchanged with the 26,500-dalton ATPase binding protein in the binding of the ATPase and the 32Pi-ATP exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1522468072,"A single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase from monkey kidney tissue culture cells (CV-1) has been found associated with SV40 chromatin. This ATPase activity is distinguishable from the ATPase activity of T-antigen by the following properties: the Km for ATP, elution from phosphocellulose, and stimulation of the ATPase activity by single-stranded DNA but not by double-stranded DNA. The ATPase has been isolated and characterized from the nuclei of uninfected cells. ATP hydrolysis is dependent on single-stranded DNA and a divalent cation. The km values for ATP and single-stranded DNA are 0.024 mM and 0.09 microgram/ml, respectively. The affinity of the ATPase for single-stranded DNA is sufficiently high that the enzyme co-sediments with single-stranded DNA in glycerol gradients. The binding of single-stranded DNA is independent of ATP and MgCl2; however, ATP hydrolysis increases the exchange of enzyme between different DNA molecules. Form I (superhelical) SV40 DNA is also a substrate for ATPase binding, but relaxed Form I, Form II (nicked circular), and double-stranded linear SV40 DNAs are not substrates. Because the DNA helix within chromatin is not under the same kind of tortional strain as Form I DNA, we hypothesize that the ATPase is bound to the single-stranded regions of replication forks in the SV40 chromatin."
