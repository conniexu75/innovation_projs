https://openalex.org/W1979305117,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is expressed at high levels in hippocampal neurons, and its expression is modulated by neural activity. Knockout mice can be used to study the roles of molecules like BDNF in synaptic plasticity with more molecular specificity than is possible using pharmacological approaches. Because in conventional knockouts the disrupted gene product is absent in all tissues throughout the life of the animal, developmental effects may complicate the interpretation of deficits in the adult. Rescue experiments can help to distinguish between developmental and acute requirements for the missing gene product. We here demonstrate that treatment of hippocampal slices from BDNF knockout mice with recombinant BDNF completely reverses deficits in long-term potentiation and significantly improves deficits in basal synaptic transmission at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse. Thus, BDNF has an acute role in hippocampal synaptic function."

In this study, we report structural features of the HIF-1α subunit that are required for heterodimerization, DNA binding, and transactivation. The HIF-1α and HIF-1β (ARNT; aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) subunits were coimmunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts, indicating that these proteins heterodimerize in the absence of DNA. In vitro-translated HIF-1α and HIF-1β generated a HIF-1/DNA complex with similar electrophoretic mobility and sequence specificity as HIF-1 present in nuclear extracts from hypoxic cells. Compared to 826-amino acid, full-length HIF-1α, amino acids 1-166 mediated heterodimerization with HIF-1β (ARNT), but amino acids 1-390 were required for optimal DNA binding. A deletion involving the basic domain of HIF-1α eliminated DNA binding without affecting heterodimerization. In cotransfection assays, forced expression of recombinant HIF-1α and HIF-1β (ARNT) activated transcription of reporter genes containing EPO enhancer sequences with intact, but not mutant, HIF-1 binding sites. Deletion of the carboxy terminus of HIF-1α (amino acids 391-826) markedly decreased the ability of recombinant HIF-1 to activate transcription. Overexpression of a HIF-1α construct with deletions of the basic domain and carboxy terminus blocked reporter gene activation by endogenous HIF-1 in hypoxic cells.

Multiple developmental and physiological mechanisms exist to provide each cell in the human body with sufficient O2 to meet its metabolic demands. Essential to the maintenance of O2 homeostasis is the production of adequate numbers of erythrocytes to transport O2 from the lungs to peripheral tissues. Reduced O2 delivery, whether due to anemia, acute hemorrhage, decreased ambient O2 tension, or decreased O2-hemoglobin dissociation, is sensed by cells in the liver and kidney, which increase their synthesis of erythropoietin (EPO 1The abbreviations used are: EPOerythropoietinbpbase pair(s)HIF-1hypoxia-inducible factor 1AHRaryl hydrocarbon receptorARNTAHR nuclear translocatorbHLHbasic helix-loop-helixPASPER-ARNT-SIMGSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIPimmunoprecipitationEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseβgalβ-galactosidaseFLfull length. ), the glycoprotein hormone/growth factor that stimulates the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of bone marrow erythroid progenitor cells (reviewed in 1Jelkmann W.

Analysis of EPO expression in the human hepatoblastoma line Hep3B has demonstrated that in cells subjected to hypoxia by incubation in 1% O2, EPO transcription is increased relative to nonhypoxic cells cultured in 20% O2 (4Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Google Scholar, 5Fandrey J. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1993; 81: 617-623Google Scholar). DNA sequences in the human EPO gene 3′-flanking region functioned as a hypoxia-inducible enhancer in transient expression assays (reviewed in 6Semenza G.L. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 1994; 8: 863-884Google Scholar). A 50-bp 3′-flanking sequence mediated a 7-fold higher level of reporter gene expression in cells cultured at 1% compared to 20% O2 (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar). Mutational analysis indicated that the 50-bp enhancer was functionally tripartite (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar). Mutations at site 1 or site 2 eliminated enhancer function (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar, 8Beck I. Weinmann R. Caro J. Blood. 1993; 82: 704-711Google Scholar). The first 33 bp of the enhancer (containing sites 1 and 2 only) functioned at one-half the level of the 50-bp element, but full activity could be restored by the presence of two copies of the 33-bp element, indicating that factors binding at site 3 amplified the induction signal but were not absolutely required for transcriptional activation (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar). The orphan receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 may bind at site 3 (9Galson D.L. Tsuchiya T. Tendler D.S. Huang E. Ren Y. Ogura T. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2135-2144Google Scholar), the factor binding at site 2 is uncharacterized, and site 1 is bound by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that HIF-1 plays a key role in EPO gene transcriptional activation in hypoxic cells. (a) A 3-bp substitution at site 1 eliminated enhancer activity and binding of HIF-1 (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar). (b) Exposure of cells to 1% O2, cobalt chloride, or desferrioxamine induced both EPO expression and HIF-1 activity with similar kinetics (10Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Google Scholar, 11Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Google Scholar, 12Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Google Scholar). (c) Treatment of hypoxic cells with the protein kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide blocked induction of EPO RNA and HIF-1 activity (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar, 10Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Google Scholar). In a variety of non-EPO-producing lines, including Chinese hamster ovary and human embryonic kidney 293 cells, HIF-1 was induced by hypoxia and EPO 3′-flanking sequences functioned as hypoxia-inducible enhancers (11Wang G.L.

Expression of genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor and glycolytic enzymes was induced by exposure of EPO-producing and nonproducing cells to 1% O2, cobalt chloride, or desferrioxamine, and these genes contained HIF-1 binding sites within sequences mediating transcriptional activation in hypoxic cells (14Firth J.D.

Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Google Scholar). These results indicate a general role for HIF-1 in O2 homeostasis. Purification of HIF-1 by DNA affinity chromatography (20Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Google Scholar) and characterization of amino acid and cDNA sequences revealed that HIF-1 was a heterodimeric transcription factor of the bHLH-PAS family (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar). The bHLH domain, present in a large number of transcription factors, mediates DNA binding and protein dimerization (reviewed in 22Kadesch T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 49-55Google Scholar and 23Murre C. Baltimore D. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto Y.R. Transcriptional Regulation.

The PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domain was described previously in the PER and SIM proteins of Drosophila melanogaster (24Citri Y. Colot H.V. Jacquier A.C. Yu Q. Hall J.C. Baltimore D. Rosbash M. Nature. 1987; 326: 42-47Google Scholar, 25Nambu J.R. Lewis J.O. Wharton K.A. Crews S.T. Cell. 1991; 67: 1157-1167Google Scholar) and the AHR and ARNT proteins, which constitute the mammalian dioxin receptor (26Burbach K.M. Poland A. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hankinson O. Science. 1992; 256: 1193-1195Google Scholar). PAS domains contain two internal homology units, the A and B repeats, and are implicated in protein-protein interactions (29Huang Z.J. Edery I. Rosbash M. Nature. 1993; 364: 259-262Google Scholar, 30Lindebro M.C. Poellinger L. Whitelaw M.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3528-3539Google Scholar). The HIF-1α subunit, consisting of 826 amino acids, was identified as a novel bHLH-PAS protein, whereas HIF-1β was identical to ARNT (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar). ARNT, which is expressed as isoforms of 774 and 789 amino acids (27Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.-F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Google Scholar), can heterodimerize with HIF-1α, AHR, or SIM and can also homodimerize (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HIF-1α and HIF-1β mRNA and protein expression were induced in Hep3B cells exposed to 1% O2 and rapidly decayed when cells were returned to 20% O2, consistent with the proposed role of HIF-1 in mediating transcriptional responses to hypoxia (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar). Here we report a functional analysis of HIF-1α and the identification of protein domains required for HIF-1 heterodimerization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation. Recombinant plasmids containing a HIF-1α cDNA fragment (encoding amino acids 329-531) cloned into pGEX-3X and a HIF-1β (ARNT) cDNA fragment (encoding amino acids 496-789) cloned into pGEX-2T were constructed as described previously (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar). Transformed Escherichia coli DH5α cells were cultured in 50 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 µg/ml ampicillin at 37°C at 200 rpm overnight, inoculated into 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 50 µg/ml ampicillin, and cultured at 37°C at 200 rpm until A600 = 1.0. GST/HIF-1α fusion protein synthesis was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to 0.1 mM and shaking at 200 rpm at 30°C for 1 h. The fusion protein was isolated as described (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar), except that elution of protein was in 20 mM instead of 5 mM reduced glutathione. GST/HIF-1β fusion protein was induced and isolated as described (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar). The affinity-purified fusion protein was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and quantitated with a commercial kit (Bio-Rad). Purified fusion protein was coupled to hydrated cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B resin (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 9.0) and 0.5 M NaCl for 1 h at room temperature, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coupling efficiency was greater than 95%, as determined by analyzing the unbound protein in the supernatant. Purified HIF-1β fusion protein (4.5 mg) was coupled to 2.5 ml of resin (0.71 g of freeze-dried powder), purified HIF-1α fusion protein (0.82 mg) was coupled to 1 ml of resin (0.3 g of freeze-dried powder), and purified GST protein (2.5 mg) was coupled to 2.5 ml of resin (0.71 g of freeze-dried powder). After blocking with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and washing with 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 0.5 M NaCl, followed by 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 M NaCl, the gel was equilibrated and stored in Tris-buffered saline (TBS = 2.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl), supplemented with 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, at 4°C. A 1:1:10 mixture (by volume) of anti-GST/HIF-1β antiserum:TBS:DH5α cell lysate containing GST/HIF-1α (with a total protein concentration of 8.9 µg/µl) was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with agitation. A volume of GST-coupled Sepharose 4B equal to the volume of antiserum was added and incubated at 4°C for 4 h. After centrifugation at 1500 × g for 3 min, the supernatant was combined with a volume of GST/HIF-1β-coupled Sepharose 4B equal to the volume of antiserum and incubated at 4°C for 4 h with agitation. The resin was washed twice with 10 volumes of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, and 0.1% Triton X-100, then washed twice with 10 volumes of 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6. The adsorbed protein was eluted with 0.2 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.0, 0.1 M NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 15 min with agitation and collected in a tube containing 0.1 volume of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, then dialyzed twice at 4°C in 100 volumes of TBS for a total of 4 h. Anti-GST/HIF-1α antiserum (1.2 ml) was incubated with 10.8 ml of TBS and 1.2 ml of GST-coupled Sepharose 4B for 4 h at 4°C. After centrifugation at 1500 × g for 3 min, the supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of GST/HIF-1α-coupled Sepharose 4B at 4°C for 4 h. The resin was washed twice with 12 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, and 0.1% Triton X-100; once with 12 ml of 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, and 0.1% Triton; and once with 12 ml of 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6. The adsorbed protein was eluted and dialyzed as described above. Nuclear extracts were prepared from human Hep3B cells as described (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar, 20Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 400 µg of nuclear extracts from cells exposed to 1 or 20% O2 for 4 h were brought to a total volume of 1000 µl with immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40). Ten µl of preimmune serum were added and incubated for 2 h at 4°C, followed by the addition of 200 µl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) in IP buffer for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4°C and split into two tubes. Five µl of preimmune serum or 25 µl of affinity-purified HIF-1α polyclonal antibodies were added and incubated for 2 h at 4°C, followed by incubation with 100 µl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose 4B as described above. The IP of HIF-1 by HIF-1β antibodies was performed as above using 11 µl of affinity-purified HIF-1β polyclonal antibodies. Pellets were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 × g at 4°C, washed five times with 900 µl of IP buffer, resuspended in 160 µl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 µg/ml bromphenol blue), heated at 98°C for 5 min, and fractionated by electrophoresis through an SDS 7%-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblot assay was performed as described (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar), except that a 1:200 dilution of affinity-purified HIF-1α antibodies or a 1:400 dilution of affinity-purified HIF-1β antibodies was used. Plasmid pBluescriptSK/HIF-1α3.2-3 (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar) was digested with StuI, HindIII, AccI, AflII, or PstI and blunt-ended using Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Religation created a stop codon at the StuI, HindIII, AccI, AflII, or PstI site to generate the derivatives HIF-1αΔStuI, ΔHindIII, ΔAccI, ΔAflII, and ΔPstI, respectively. The basic domain of HIF-1α was deleted by the replacement of an NcoI/BglII fragment in pBluescriptSK/HIF-1α3.2-3 with a double-stranded oligonucleotide (sense and antisense strand sequences, 5′-CATGGAGGGGATCGATG-3′ and 5′-GATCCATCGATCCCCTC-3′, respectively) to generate HIF-1αΔNB. The KpnI/NotI fragment encompassing the complete coding sequence of HIF-1α cDNA or its derivative was ligated into KpnI/NotI-digested pCEP4 (Invitrogen) using T4 DNA ligase (Stratagene). HIF-1αΔNBΔAB was created by transfer of the HIF-1αΔNB sequences to pCEP4 and deletion of an AflII-BamHI fragment. The HIF-1α cDNA and its mutant derivatives in pBluescriptSK contained either the T7 or T3 polymerase promoter in the appropriate orientation for in vitro expression. pBM5/Neo/M1-1 (27Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.-F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Google Scholar, 34Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Google Scholar), provided by Dr. Oliver Hankinson (University of California at Los Angeles), contained the T7 polymerase promoter for in vitro expression. In vitro transcription and translation was carried out using the TNT T7 or T3 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence or absence of L-[35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EMSA using Hep3B nuclear extracts was performed with oligonucleotide probe W18 (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar, 20Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Google Scholar). Unlabeled HIF-1α, its mutant derivatives, and HIF-1β (ARNT) were synthesized in vitro as described above. EMSA using in vitro-translated proteins was performed as for nuclear extracts, except that binding reactions contained equal volumes of in vitro translation reactions and 2 × buffer Z+ (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 40% glycerol, 200 mM KCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.2 mM sodium vanadate), 100 ng of calf thymus DNA, and 1 × buffer Z+ (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.2 mM sodium vanadate) added to a final volume of 39 µl. After preincubation for 5 min at room temperature, 1 µl of labeled probe W18 (104 cpm) was added and incubated on ice for 15 min. Oligonucleotide competition experiments were performed with 1 ng or 10 ng of unlabeled W18 or M18 oligonucleotides. The sense strand sequences of the double-stranded W18 and M18 oligonucleotides are 5′-GCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′ and 5′-GCCCTAAAAGCTGTCTCA-3′, respectively. Supershift analysis was performed with the incubation of 1 µl of preimmune serum or antiserum (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar) against HIF-1α at 1:3 dilution or HIF-1β at 1:6 dilution for 20 min on ice after probe addition. pBluescriptSK/HIF-1α3.2-3 and its mutant derivatives were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham). Aliquots (13 µl) of labeled in vitro translation reactions of HIF-1α or its derivatives were mixed with 13 µl of unlabeled in vitro translation reactions programmed with pBM5/Neo/M1-1 and 26 µl buffer Z+ and incubated at 30°C for 15 min. At the end of the incubation, the reaction mixture was placed on ice for 30 min, incubated with 2 µl of affinity-purified HIF-1β antibodies for 2 h at 4°C, and then incubated with 13 µl of 50% protein A-Sepharose 4B in IP buffer for 1 h. The pellets were washed five times with IP buffer and then heated for 5 min at 98°C in SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates and supernatants were analyzed by SDS 14%-PAGE. Plasmid DNA was prepared using commercial kits (Qiagen). The construction of pSVcat reporter plasmids WT50, MUT50, and 2xWT33 has been described previously (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar, 11Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Google Scholar). Cell culture of 293 cells and Hep3B cells was as described previously (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar, 11Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar). For cotransfection assays with reporter plasmids WT50 and MUT50, 1 µg of pSVβgal plasmid (Promega) and 0, 0.5, or 5 µg each of pCEP4/HIF-1α and pBM5/Neo/M1-1 were mixed with 5 µg of reporter plasmid, and total plasmid DNA was adjusted to a total of 16 µg with pGEM4 (Promega). To study dose-response effects, 1 µg of pSVβgal and 0-8 µg each of pCEP4/HIF-1α and pBM5/Neo/M1-1 were mixed with 5 µg of reporter plasmid 2xWT33, and total plasmid DNA was adjusted to 22 µg with pGEM4. Cells were cultured in 20 or 1% O2 for 36 h as described (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar). HIF-1α mutant derivatives were analyzed using 1 µg of pSVβgal, 5 µg of 2xWT33, and 10 µg of expression plasmid (5 µg of pBM5/Neo/M1-1 and 5 µg of pCEP4/HIF-1α, pCEP4/HIF-1αΔPstI, or pCEP4/HIF-1αΔAflII) or 10 µg of pGEM4. Cells were cultured in 20 or 1% O2 for 40 h. Data were obtained from two independent experiments with three replications each. CAT and βgal values were determined as described (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar). To test the dominant-negative form of HIF-1α, Hep3B cells were transfected with 5 µg of pSVβgal, 10 µg of 2xWT33-luciferase reporter and 0-40 µg of pCEP4/HIF-1αΔNBΔAB, and total expression plasmid DNA was adjusted to 40 µg with pCEP4 DNA. Cells were incubated at 20% O2 for 24 h, followed by 24 h at 1% O2. Luciferase activity was determined using 20 µg of cell extract and 100 µl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega). We have demonstrated previously that antiserum raised against recombinant HIF-1α or HIF-1β (ARNT) could supershift the HIF-1/DNA complex present in nuclear extracts of hypoxic Hep3B cells, suggesting that these proteins bind to DNA as a heterodimer (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar). To demonstrate that HIF-1α and HIF-1β associate in the absence of DNA, crude nuclear extracts from Hep3B cells were tested for coimmunoprecipitation of HIF-1α and HIF-1β. Nuclear extracts were prepared from hypoxic and nonhypoxic Hep3B cells and incubated with affinity-purified antibodies against HIF-1α or HIF-1β (ARNT). HIF-1·antibody complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose 4B and fractionated by SDS-PAGE; HIF-1α or HIF-1β protein was identified by immunoblot assay. As shown in Fig. 1 (top panels), HIF-1α was immunoprecipitated from hypoxic nuclear extracts using antibodies raised against either HIF-1α (Fig. 1, lane 4) or HIF-1β (Fig. 1, lane 8). HIF-1α was detected as a series of isoforms as described previously (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar) with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 113-131 kDa. HIF-1α was undetectable by this assay when extracts from nonhypoxic cells were immunoprecipitated with HIF-1α (Fig. 1, lane 2) or HIF-1β (Fig. 1, lane 6) antibodies, consistent with the extremely low levels of HIF-1α detected in nonhypoxic Hep3B cells by direct immunoblot assay (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar). No HIF-1α was precipitated from hypoxic (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 7) or nonhypoxic (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 5) extracts using preimmune sera from the rabbits used for preparation of HIF-1α and HIF-1β antibodies, demonstrating that the coimmunoprecipitation of HIF-1α by HIF-1β antibodies was specific. As shown in Fig. 1 (bottom panels), HIF-1β was also immunoprecipitated from hypoxic nuclear extracts using either HIF-1α (Fig. 1, lane 4) or HIF-1β (Fig. 1, lane 8) antibodies. HIF-1β was detected as isoforms with apparent molecular masses of approximately 100-107 kDa. After immunoprecipitation with HIF-1α antibodies, HIF-1β was detected in hypoxic (Fig. 1, lane 4) but not in nonhypoxic (Fig. 1, lane 2) extracts. Preimmune serum precipitated small amounts of a protein from nonhypoxic (Fig. 1, lane 1) and hypoxic (Fig. 1, lane 3) extracts that was of similar mobility to HIF-1β and which cross-reacted with the anti-immunoglobulin conjugate used for detection of antibody·antigen complexes as it was visualized, even when the HIF-1β antibody was omitted from the immunoblot reaction (data not shown). HIF-1β was more easily detected when HIF-1β antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, lane 8) and a small amount of HIF-1β could be detected in immunoprecipitates from nonhypoxic extracts (Fig. 1, lane 6), consistent with previous direct immunoblot assays (21Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Google Scholar). HIF-1β was not immunoprecipitated by the preimmune serum from nonhypoxic (Fig. 1, lane 5) or hypoxic (Fig. 1, lane 7) nuclear extracts. Taken together, the results of these immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that HIF-1α and HIF-1β are present as a heterodimer in nuclear extracts from hypoxic cells and suggest that not all HIF-1β exists as a heterodimer with HIF-1α, especially in nonhypoxic nuclear extracts. We next tested whether in vitro translation of HIF-1α and HIF-1β proteins could reconstitute HIF-1 DNA binding activity. We performed EMSA using as probe a double-stranded oligonucleotide (W18) containing the HIF-1 binding site from the EPO enhancer (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar). When unprogrammed reticulocyte lysates were assayed, a nonspecific DNA binding activity was detected by the probe (Fig. 2, lane 1). A similar pattern was seen when lysates were programmed with cDNA encoding HIF-1α (Fig. 2, lane 2) or HIF-1β (Fig. 2, lane 3). However, when lysates were programmed with both HIF-1α and HIF-1β (ARNT) cDNA (Fig. 2, lane 4), a new DNA binding activity was detected with mobility similar to that of HIF-1 present in nuclear extracts from hypoxic Hep3B cells (Fig. 2, lane 14). The recombinant HIF-1·DNA complex comigrated with the slower-migrating endogenous HIF-1·DNA complex. Glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis suggested that the faster- and slower-migrating complexes contain HIF-1α/HIF-1β heterodimers and heterotetramers, respectively (20Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Google Scholar). As previously demonstrated for endogenous HIF-1 (7Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Google Scholar), binding of recombinant HIF-1 to the probe could be competed by increasing amounts of unlabeled W18 oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6) but not by unlabeled M18 oligonucleotide containing a 3-bp substitution within the HIF-1 binding site (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). The addition of antisera raised against HIF-1α (Fig. 2, lane 10) or HIF-1β (Fig. 2, lane 12) to binding reactions containing in vitro-translated HIF-1 resulted in disruption of HIF-1·DNA complexes, whereas the respective preimmune serum had no effect (Fig. 2, lanes 9 and 11). Thus, antisera specifically disrupted complexes containing recombinant HIF-1 rather than resulting in the supershift p"
https://openalex.org/W2055374196,"A readily releasable pool of quanta, tentatively identified with docked synaptic vesicles, has been defined by analysis of the neurotransmitter release caused by application of hypertonic solutions. The goal of this work is to determine the relationship of this functionally defined readily releasable pool to the one drawn upon by action potential-evoked release. We find that hypertonic solutions do not act through changes in intracellular calcium. Since the release produced by action potentials and hypertonic solutions varies in parallel as the pool size is changed, we conclude that the same pool is shared by both mechanisms. This conclusion, taken together with other observations in the literature, means that the synaptic release probability depends on the size of the readily releasable pool."
https://openalex.org/W2106828113,"We have characterized the phosphorylation of the glutamate receptor subunit GluR1, using biochemical and electrophysiological techniques. GluR1 is phosphorylated on multiple sites that are all located on the C-terminus of the protein. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase specifically phosphorylates SER-845 of GluR1 in transfected HEK cells and in neurons in culture. Phosphorylation of this residue results in a 40% potentiation of the peak current through GluR1 homomeric channels. In addition, protein kinase C specifically phosphorylates Ser-831 of GluR1 in HEK-293 cells and in cultured neurons. These results are consistent with the recently proposed transmembrane topology models of glutamate receptors, in which the C-terminus is intracellular. In addition, the modulation of GluR1 by PKA phosphorylation of Ser-845 suggests that phosphorylation of this residue may underlie the PKA-induced potentiation of AMPA receptors in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2000054304,"Voltage-activated ion channels respond to changes in membrane voltage by coupling the movement of charges to channel opening. A K+ channel-specific radioligand was designed and used to determine the origin of these gating charges in the Shaker K+ channel. Opening of a Shaker K+ channel is associated with a displacement of 13.6 electron charge units. Gating charge contributions were determined for six of the seven positive charges in the S4 segment, an unusual amino acid sequence in voltage-activated cation channels consisting of repeating basic residues at every third position. Charge-neutralizing mutations of the first four positive charges led to large decreases (approximately 4 electron charge units each) in the gating charge; however, the gating charge of Shaker delta 10, a Shaker K+ channel with 10 altered nonbasic residues in its S4 segment, was found to be identical to the wild-type channel. These findings show that movement of the NH2-terminal half but not the CO2H-terminal end of the S4 segment underlies gating charge, and that this portion of the S4 segment appears to move across the entire transmembrane voltage difference in association with channel activation."
https://openalex.org/W1970264142,"The activation of Shaker K+ channels is steeply voltage dependent. To determine whether conserved charged amino acids in putative transmembrane segments S2, S3, and S4 contribute to the gating charge of the channel, the total gating charge movement per channel was measured in channels containing neutralization mutations. Of eight residues tested, four contributed significantly to the gating charge: E293, an acidic residue in S2, and R365, R368, and R371, three basic residues in the S4 segment. The results indicate that these residues are a major component of the voltage sensor. Furthermore, the S4 segment is not solely responsible for gating charge movement in Shaker K+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1881108429,"It is well known that porphyrins cause a toxic light-mediated effect due to their capability to generate free radicals. Several reports have proved that melatonin is a potent free radical scavenger. The aim of this work has been to study the ability of melatonin to prevent the cell damage caused by porphyrins in the Harderian gland of female Syrian hamsters. Cell injury was evaluated estimating the percentage of damaged cells found in the gland and analyzing the degree of this damage at ultrastructural level. To explain the mechanism by which this hormone could prevent the cell damage caused by porphyrins, its capability to both decrease porphyrin synthesis and increase the mRNA levels for antioxidant enzymes was evaluated. Our results demonstrate that melatonin administration decreases the percentage of damaged cells, porphyrin synthesis, and aminolevulinate synthase (ALA-S) mRNA levels and increases the mRNA levels for manganese superoxide-dismutase and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase. When observed under an electron microscope, the lesions in the clear cells of the treated females were much less severe than in the corresponding cells of the control animals. Melatonin exerts a cytoprotective effect by inhibiting the ALA-S gene expression (and so porphyrin synthesis) and by raising the mRNA levels for several antioxidant enzymes."

Here, we show that Mch2 is processed from its zymogen form to a proteolytically active dimeric species during execution of the apoptotic program and by the cytotoxic T cell death protease granzyme B. Additionally, like Yama and LAP3, Mch2 functions downstream of the death inhibitors Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and CrmA.

Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12826) Google Scholar). Dysregulated apoptosis can result in cancer, autoimmune diseases, or neurodegenerative disorders (2Kerr J.F.R. Winterford C.M.

In an attempt to identify which members of the CED-3/ICE family are involved in apoptosis, we have used, as a criterion, activation of the endogenous zymogen upon receipt of an apoptotic signal from a single polypeptide to a proteolytically competent, active dimeric species. Since proteolytic activation of zymogen forms of the CED-3/ICE family into active p20/p10 subunits involves cleavage following aspartate residues, it follows that the convertase must be either another CED-3/ICE family member or granzyme B, an aspartate-specific serine protease. Indeed, two of the three Ced-3/Yama subfamily members (Yama and LAP3) are rapidly activated upon receipt of a death stimulus; the inactive endogenous zymogen being cleaved to generate an active (p20/p10) dimeric species (10Duan H.

Finally, both of these proteases can be proteolytically processed to the active dimeric form by granzyme B, a protease used by cytotoxic T cells to engage the death pathway (10Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M.

We now demonstrate that the third member of this subfamily, Mch2, is similarly activated during apoptosis and that granzyme B processes it to a functionally active protease. Most important, however, is the finding that Mch2 is a laminase that cleaves lamin A to a signature apoptotic fragment.

Custom rabbit antipeptide antibodies (Lampire) were raised against the p20 subunit of Mch2 (ADRDNLTRRFSDLGFEVKC). cDNAs encoding Mch2, Yama, PARP, and lamin A were cloned into pET 15b (Invitrogen) and used as templates for in vitro transcription/translation reactions (TNT reticulocyte lysate kit, Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham).

The sample was then resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblotting to detect cleaved PARP as described previously (13Tewari M. Quan L.T.

Naive Jurkat cell extracts were prepared as described previously (26Martin S.J. Newmeyer D.D. Mathias S. Farschon D.M. Wang H. Reed J.C. Green D.R.

Reaction products were then resolved on a 14% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to immunoblotting to detect processed Mch2. Apoptotic extracts were prepared from Jurkat cells treated with 100 ng/ml α-Apo1 (IgG3 (24Trauth B.C. Klas C. Peters A.M.J. Matzku S. Moller P. Falk W. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) were incubated with either apoptotic extract, recombinant active Yama, LAP3, or Mch2 (∼10-40 pmol) in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2 for 2 h at 37°C. Following recovery by pulse centrifugation, the nuclei were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting to detect cleaved PARP or lamin A. Alternatively, 35S-labeled in vitro translated PARP or lamin A was directly cleaved by incubation with recombinant active Yama, LAP3, or Mch2 (∼10-40 pmol) for 2 h at 37°C, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Fas is a cell surface receptor that, upon activation by cognate ligand or agonist antibody, engages the death pathway, resulting in the activation of Yama and LAP3 death proteases. To investigate the possible activation of Mch2 from its pro-form to a p20/p10 active species upon receipt of a death signal, a rabbit antipeptide antibody was generated that was specific for the p20 subunit. As expected, in naive untreated Jurkat T cells, only the pro-form of Mch2 was observed (Fig. 1A). However, upon engagement of the Fas death receptor, the zymogen form converted to the p20 subunit form, indicative of activation (Fig. 1A). A similar transition was observed in BJAB cells. Exposure of cells (Jurkat, HeLa, or BJAB) to an alternative death stimulus, staurosporine, similarly led to the processing of Mch2, implying that activation of Mch2 was not specific for any particular inducer of apoptosis (Fig. 1B). As Mch2 appeared to be activated in a manner analogous to other members of the CED-3 subfamily, we asked if it, like Yama and LAP3, functioned downstream of the general mammalian death inhibitors (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and the cowpox virus encoded serpin CrmA, a potent inhibitor of certain ICE family members (22Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). It had been shown previously that while Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL could inhibit staurosporine-induced apoptosis in leukemic cell lines, they did not attenuate Fas-induced death. Conversely, CrmA potently inhibited Fas-induced cell death, but not staurosporine-induced apoptosis, implying that Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and CrmA have different target specificities. In cells overexpressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, Mch2 was not activated on exposure to staurosporine (Fig. 2A). However, when the apoptotic stimulus was mediated through the Fas/Apo1 receptor (which is not inhibited by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL), Mch2 was clearly activated (Fig. 2A). In contrast, CrmA was unable to inhibit Mch2 activation in response to staurosporine, but effectively attenuated Mch2 processing in response to activation of the Fas/Apo1 receptor (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data suggest that upstream of Mch2 activation in the Fas death pathway is a CrmA-inhibitable protease that is not inhibited by either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. This CrmA-inhibitable protease is presumably lacking, bypassed, or not essential in the staurosporine-induced death pathway (and hence the inability of CrmA to inhibit staurosporine-induced cell death). The staurosporine pathway, however, must contain a Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibitable step that is upstream of Mch2 activation as they completely block staurosporine-mediated Mch2 activation. Therefore, Mch2, like Yama and LAP3, is activated at a point in the death pathway that is downstream of both mammalian and viral inhibitors of cell death. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes trigger cell death by either introducing granzyme B into target cells through perforin channels and/or by expressing Fas ligand that engages the Fas/Apo1 death receptor on the surface of target cells. Despite being a serine protease, granzyme B, like CED-3/ICE family members, possesses the ability to cleave substrates following aspartate residues. Previous studies have demonstrated that granzyme B proteolytically processes and activates pro-Yama and pro-LAP3 (10Duan H. Chinnaiyan A.M. Hudson P.L. Wing J.P. He W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 35013-35035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Chinnaiyan A.M. Hanna W.L. Orth K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Froelich C.J. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6 (in press)Google Scholar), ICE family members most related to the C. elegans death gene ced-3. However, this does not represent indiscriminate activation as, when ICE itself is proteolytically processed by granzyme B, it does not reconstitute a functional enzyme. As shown in Fig. 3A, granzyme B proteolytically processed both endogenous pro-Mch2 (in naive cell extracts) and recombinant pro-Mch2 to a dimeric species, indicating that it could potentially be activated by granzyme B. This was confirmed when granzyme B-processed Mch2 was found to be proteolytically competent, capable of cleaving the death substrate PARP to its signature apoptotic fragment (Fig. 3B). Therefore, all known members of the CED-3 subfamily are proteolytically processed by granzyme B to generate active proteases. CED-3/ICE proteases have been implicated in the cleavage of a number of apoptotic substrates including PARP (28Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar), SREBP (29Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

A. 1996; 93: 2234-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that cleavage of a single substrate represents a lethal hit. Rather, it is more appealing to consider that it is the coordinated, concerted, and hierarchical cleavage of a number of different substrates that leads to the eventual demise of a cell. Nevertheless, monitoring the cleavage of specific substrates provides a useful biochemical marker for the apoptotic process. The picture that is beginning to emerge is that certain CED-3/ICE members demonstrate marked substrate preference and that they are probably less promiscuous than previously thought. For example, Yama and LAP3 cleave PARP, but are unable to proteolytically process pro-IL-1β, the substrate for ICE (13Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1825-1828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Likewise, ICE will effectively cleave pro-IL-1β, but at physiological concentrations is unable to cleave PARP (13Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). The protease responsible for the cleavage of lamin A, however, has remained elusive (33Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R. Goldman R. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Mch2, like Yama and LAP3, is able to cleave either endogenous PARP or recombinant PARP to a signature apoptotic fragment (Fig. 4A). In stark contrast, Mch2, but not Yama or LAP3, cleaved endogenous lamin A and recombinant lamin A to the signature apoptotic form (Fig. 4B). An identical lamin A cleavage profile was observed when HeLa nuclei were incubated with apoptotic extract (Fig. 4B). Additionally, Mch2-mediated lamin A cleavage was inhibited by TLCK, a characteristic of the putative laminase described by Lazebnik et al. (27Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Therefore, Mch2 possesses an unique substrate specificity, distinct from other subfamily members. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Mch2, like Yama and LAP3, functions downstream of the mammalian cell death inhibitors, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and of the viral serpin, CrmA. Further, granzyme B can functionally activate Mch2, supporting the contention that granzyme B kills cells by activating downstream components of the CED-3/ICE death machinery. Finally, Mch2, unlike Yama or LAP3, can cleave lamin A to its signature apoptotic fragment, demonstrating substrate specificity within the CED-3-like subfamily.

Brief application of phorbol ester (PMA) enhances depolarization-evoked exocytosis severalfold while actually decreasing the Ca2+ current. Ca2+ metabolism is unchanged. Three different protocols were used to show that PMA increases the size of the readily releasable pool of secretory granules. PMA treatment leads to a large increase in amplitude, but little change in the time course of the exocytic burst that results from rapid elevation of [Ca2+]i upon photolysis of DMI-Nitrophen. Thus, PKC appears to affect a late step in secretion but not the Ca2+ sensitivity of the final step."

We have identified a human cDNA, TRPC1A, from a human fetal brain cDNA library. TRPC1A is homologous to the cation channels trp and trpl in Drosophila and is a splice variant of the recently identified cDNA Htrp-1. Expression of TRPC1A in CHO cells induced nonselective cation currents with similar permeabilities for Na+, Ca2+, and Cs+. The currents were activated by intracellular infusion of myo inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate or thapsigargin. Expression of TRPC1A significantly enhanced increases in the intracellular free calcium concentration induced by Ca2+ restitution after prolonged depletion. Similar results were obtained in Sf9 cells. We conclude that TRPC1A encodes a Ca2+-permeable cation channel activated by depletion of intracellular calcium stores."
https://openalex.org/W2147111725,"We relate the ultrastructure of the giant bipolar synapse in goldfish retina to the jump in capacitance that accompanies depolarization-evoked exocytosis. Mean vesicle diameter is 29 +/- 4 nm, giving 26.4 aF/vesicle, so the maximum evoked capacitance (150 fF within 200 ms) represents fusion of about 5700 vesicles. Two terminals contained, respectively, 45 and 65 ribbon-type synaptic outputs, and a fully loaded ribbon tethers about 110 vesicles. Thus, the tethered pool, about 6000 vesicles, corresponds to the rapidly released pool. Further, the difference between small and large terminals in number of tethered vesicles matches their difference in capacitance jump. This suggests, within a ""fire and reload"" model of exocytosis, that the ribbon translocates synaptic vesicles very rapidly to membrane docking sites, supporting a maximum release rate of 500 vesicles/active zone/s, until the population of tethered vesicles is exhausted."

This receptor is distinctive in its preferential affinity for the polypeptide PP over NPY. A complete understanding of the role of NPY and the related polypeptides in mammalian physiology will require the isolation and characterization of all of the NPY receptor subtypes. In the present report, we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel murine G protein-coupled receptor. This receptor shares homology with the cloned NPY Y1 receptor subtype and has similar affinity for NPY receptor-specific ligands. We conclude that this receptor is a member of the NPY receptor family. The pharmacology of this receptor is distinct from that described for the NPY Y2, Y3, or Y4 receptors and is similar to that described for the NPY Y1 and “atypical Y1” receptors. We have designated this novel NPY Y1-like receptor as NPY Y5. A mouse genomic library derived from 129SvEv ES cells (J1) (1 × 106 clones) in the cosmid sCOS vector (kindly provided by Dr. John Mudgett, Merck and Co., Inc.) was screened with 1 × 106 cpm/ml of a polymerase chain reaction-labeled radioactive probe containing coding sequences for the human NPY Y1 receptor transmembrane domains 2 to 6. Hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 42°C with radiolabeled probe in 35% formamide hybridization solution, (5 × SSC, 0.02% SDS, 0.1% n-lauroyl sarcosine, 0.02% (w/v) blocking buffer (Boehringer Mannheim)). Positive colony pools were subjected to a second round of screening under the same conditions, and single colony isolates were identified. Cosmid DNA was prepared, and a single 2.2-kb fragment hybridizing to the probe was observed following digestion by PstI and Southern hybridization under the same conditions. This PstI fragment was cloned into the PstI site of vector PGEM3ZF (Promega) to generate plasmid pVE2841. The PstI fragment was sequenced on both strands using an ABI 373A automated sequencer (Perkin Elmer). DNA sequences were analyzed with GCG sequence analysis software (Genetics Computer Group). The PstI fragment containing the coding sequences for the murine NPY Y5 receptor was blunted with DNA polymerase and cloned into the EcoRV site of the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3 to yield pVE2863 and introduced into COS-7 cells by electroporation. Membranes were prepared 72 h post-transfection as described previously (19Cascieri M. Ber E. Fong T. Sadowski S. Bansal A. Swain C. Seward E. Frances B. Burns D. Strader C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 458-463PubMed Google Scholar). For saturation binding, membranes (50 µg of protein) were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-PYY in the presence or absence of 1 µM unlabeled PYY (nonspecific binding). For competition binding, membranes (50 µg of protein) were incubated with 125I-PYY (90 pM) in the presence or absence of 1 µM unlabeled PYY or serial dilutions of other competing peptides. Binding reactions were performed in 0.25 ml of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, containing 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 10 µM phosphoramidon, 4 µg/ml leupeptin, and 40 µg/ml bacitracin (Peninsula Laboratories). After 2 h at room temperature, the binding reaction was terminated by filtration over GF/C filters, and the radioactivity bound to the filters was quantified with a Packard γ counter. IC50 values were determined using nonlinear regression performed by PRISM (GraphPad), and Ki values were calculated using the equation Ki = (IC50/(1 + ([L]/Kd))) where [L] is defined as the concentration of radiolabeled ligand in the reaction. Four 2-month-old mice (C57 BL/6J) were euthanized, and the brains were rapidly removed, frozen in isopentane in dry ice, and kept frozen at −80°C until coronal sections (6 µm) in a rostral-caudal plane could be cut in a cryostat for in situ hybridization histochemistry. A detailed protocol for the in situ hybridization method has been described previously (20Sirinathsinghji D.J.S. Dunnett S.B. Sharif N.A. Molecular Imaging in Neuroscience: a Practical Approach.

The antisense oligonucleotide probe for the NPY Y5 receptor was 43 bases long and complementary to nucleotides of the Y5 receptor gene (see Fig. 1). It was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer (Model 394) and purified on an 8% polyacrylamide-8 M urea preparative sequencing gel. The Y5 receptor oligonucleotide was 3′-end-labeled with [35S]deoxyadenosine 5′-thiotriphosphate (1300 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) in a 30:1 molar ratio of 35S-labeled isotope:oligonucleotide using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Boehringer) for 15 min at 37°C in reaction buffer containing 0.5 M potassium cacodylate (pH 7.2), 10 mM cobalt chloride, and 1.0 mM dithiothreitol. Radiolabeled oligonucleotide was separated from unincorporated nucleotides using Sephadex G-50 spin columns. The specific activity of the labeled probe in several labeling reactions varied from 1-2 × 106 cpm/µg. A total of 3000 cpm/µl in 100 µl of hybridization buffer (50% deionized formamide, 4 × saline sodium citrate (SSC), 5 × Denhardt's, 200 mg/ml acid/alkali-cleaved salmon sperm DNA, 100 µg/ml long chain polyadenylic acid, 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10% dextran sulfate, and 40 mM dithiothreitol) was applied to each slide. To define nonspecific hybridization, adjacent sections were incubated with radiolabeled antisense probe in the presence of an excess (100×) concentration of unlabeled antisense probe. Parafilm coverslips were gently placed over the sections which were then put in humidified containers and incubated overnight (16 h) at 37°C. Following hybridization, the sections were washed for 1 h in 1 × SSC at 55°C (two changes of 30 min), rinsed in 0.1 × SSC, dehydrated in an alcohol series, dried, and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm βmax for 8 days. For high resolution cellular analysis, the sections were later dipped in Ilford K5 nuclear track photographic emulsion and D19, and sections were counterstained with methylene blue and examined by light- and dark-field microscopy. Pseudocolor images of the intensity of the hybridization signal in the various nuclei as seen on x-ray film were generated using a MCID computerized image analysis system (Imaging Research Inc., Ontario, Canada). A murine genomic cosmid library was screened with a probe encoding transmembrane domains 2 to 6 of the human NPY Y1 receptor under low stringency conditions. One of the genomic clones, MC4, contained an approximately 31-kb insert, including a 2.2-kb PstI fragment that hybridized to the probe.

We have designated this sequence the murine NPY Y5 gene because of the sequence homology to previously cloned NPY receptors and because of its high affinity for NPY when expressed in COS-7 cells (see below). The murine Y5 gene encodes a predicted 371-amino acid polypeptide which hydropathy analysis indicates has seven transmembrane-spanning regions typical of G protein-coupled receptors and two extracellular sites for N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 1). The predicted Y5 polypeptide shares 57% identity in the transmembrane regions and 56% overall identity with the rat NPY Y1 receptor, 47% overall identity to the rat NPY Y4 receptor, and only 33% identity to the rat NPY Y2 receptor. The greatest regions of homology between Y5 and Y1 occur in TM regions 2, 3, 6, and 7 which are 68-74% identical. Interestingly, the NPY receptors are unusual among G protein-coupled receptors in that they lack the highly conserved DRY after TM3 (22Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar): Y1 and Y4 have a ERH while Y5 has a ERY and Y2 a DRH. To investigate the ability of the NPY Y5 receptor to bind NPY and its analogs, we subcloned the 2.2-kb genomic segment into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3 to yield pVE2863 and introduced the DNA into COS-7 cells by electroporation. Membranes prepared from cells transfected with this construct bound 125I-PYY specifically. In contrast, membranes from mock-transfected cells exhibited less than 5% of the specific binding for 125I-PYY observed in transfected cell membranes. Binding of 125I-PYY to membranes from NPY Y5-transfected COS-7 cells was to a single class of sites with a Kd of 0.3 nM± 0.07 nM and a Bmax of 100 ± 6 fmol/mg (Fig. 2). In order to determine the pharmacology of the NPY Y5 receptor, we measured the affinities of various ligands for the NPY Y5 receptor and compared them to the human NPY Y1 receptor stably expressed in CHO cells and a human NPY Y2-expressing cell line, SKN-BE2. The NPY Y1 receptor demonstrated roughly equal affinities for the ligands NPY and PYY in agreement with previous reports (14Herzog H. Hort Y.J. Ball H.J. Hayes G. Shine J. Selbie L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5794-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The NPY Y5 receptor also showed equal affinity for NPY and PYY, although the affinity for both ligands was reduced compared to the human NPY Y1 receptor. This high affinity of the NPY Y5 receptor for PYY does not agree with the profile of pharmacologically defined NPY Y3 (rank order potency NPY ≫ PYY) and suggests that this receptor is not NPY Y3. To further define the profile of the NPY Y5 receptor, several NPY analogs were tested (Table I). The rank order of affinity of the various ligands for the murine NPY Y5 receptor were as follows: NPY = PYY ≥ NPY2-36 = [Leu31,Pro34]NPY > NPY13-36 > PP. It should be noted that the nonhydrolyzable guanosine nucleotide Gpp(NH)p inhibited 38% of the specific binding of 125I-PYY to the NPY Y5 receptor with an IC50 = 3 µM, confirming that this is a G protein-coupled receptor. In addition, this suggests that the NPY Y5 receptor expressed in COS-7 cells is predominantly uncoupled from G protein and thus is in a low affinity state for agonist binding. Efforts to obtain expression in a more highly coupled state have so far been unsuccessful. Overall, the pharmacological profile for the NPY Y5 receptor most closely resembles that of the NPY Y1 receptor. Measurements of ligand potency on NPY-induced feeding behavior have led to the suggestion of an atypical NPY Y1 receptor that has not been pharmacologically characterized in isolated tissues (7Stanley B.G. Magdalin W. Seirafi A. Nguyen M.M. Leibowitz S.F. Peptides. 1992; 13: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The pharmacology of atypical Y1 is similar to that of the NPY Y1 receptor, although slight differences between the rank order potency of NPY analog-induced feeding behavior, in particular NPY2-36 > NPY1-36, and ligand binding affinities for the NPY Y1 receptor were noted. It is not clear at present whether these differences reflect the binding affinity of a subtype separate from NPY Y1 or some other aspect of the in vivo biology, hence the designation atypical Y1.Table I.Pharmacological profile of NPY receptor-expressing cellsKi (nM)CHO-NPY1 cells (Y1)SKN-BE2 cells (Y2)Murine Y5aTransiently expressed in COS-7 cells.

These studies measured the effects of intracerebroventricular or hypothalamic injections of NPY and NPY analogs, NPY antibodies, or antisense oligonucleotides directed against NPY (7Stanley B.G.

Bristow P.K. Bue-Valleskey J.M. Burgett S.G. Craft L. Hale J. Hoffmann J. Hsiung H.M. Kriauclunas A. MacKellar W. Rosteck P.R.J. Schoner B. Smith D. Tinsley F.C. Zhang X. Heiman M. Nature. 1995; 377: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Chronic administration of leptin to ob/ob hyperphagic mice caused a reduction of feeding and a concomitant reduction of NPY synthesis and release within the hypothalamus. Therefore, we examined the brain localization of NPY Y5 mRNA by in situ hybridization. Mouse brain coronal sections were hybridized to an oligonucleotide specific for the NPY Y5 receptor. These studies revealed expression localized discretely to regions within the hypothalamus (Fig. 3). These regions included the suprachiasmatic nucleus, anterior hypothalamus, bed nucleus stria terminalis, and the ventromedial nucleus with no localization apparent elsewhere in the brain. Expression of the NPY Y5 receptor within this region of the brain would be consistent with a role for the NPY Y5 receptor in mediating the orexigenic effects of NPY. The use of antisense oligonucleotides and the development of subtype-specific antibodies and ligands should help address the precise physiologic role of this receptor subtype. In summary, we have identified a gene encoding a novel NPY receptor from mouse genomic DNA. This receptor, which we have named NPY Y5, shares 56% amino acid identity to the murine NPY Y1 receptor. The NPY Y5 receptor has a pharmacological profile distinct from that described for the NPY Y2, NPY Y3, or NPY Y4/PP1 receptors and most closely resembles that of the NPY Y1 receptor. Northern analysis of mouse tissues demonstrated significant mRNA expression only within the kidney (data not shown), and in situ hybridization studies revealed expression within the discrete regions of the hypothalamus. The role of this receptor in the complex biology of NPY remains to be explored. We thank Drs. Fred Hess and XiaoMing Guan for providing useful suggestions and comments during the course of this work, and Sandy Hobbis and Ron Maturo for preparation of the figures."

Five weeks of oral dosing confirmed that ethynyl estradiol, tamoxifen, and raloxifene are potent inhibitors of the loss in volumetric bone mineral density (BMD, mg/cc) induced by ovariectomy, as measured by computed tomography. In the metaphysis of distal femora from ovariectomized rats, analysis showed a significant 12-20% decrease (P< 0.01) in the BMD. Linear regression analysis was used to calculate half- maximal efficacious doses for ethynyl estradiol ED50 = 0.04 mg/kg, which was threefold more potent than tamoxifen, which in turn was threefold more potent than raloxifene, which was knore efficacious than nafoxidine. In the uterus, raloxifene had minimal effects on the endometrium and smaller effects on uterine eosinophil peroxidase activity than nafoxidine, tamoxifen, or estrogen, respectively. Estrogen was the most potent in reducing cholesterol levels in ovariectomized rats, whereas tamoxifen and nafoxidine were more effective than raloxifene in blocking gain in body weight. Distinct Compounds had advantages in the management of bone, uterine, serum cholesterol, and adipose tissues after ovariectomy. The distinct pattern of pharnjiacological effects may be best understood in terms of their respective chemical structure, specifically estrogens, ben- zothiophenes (raloxifene), dihydronapthylenes (nafoxidine), and triphenylethylenes (tamoxifen). These data point to advantages of Separate compounds in the management of bone, uterine, serum cholesterol, and adipose tissues after estrogen deficiency, and show that the benzothiophene raloxifene has potentially important advantages over estrogen, tamoxifen, or nafoxidine in the uterus.—Sato, M., Rippy, M.

https://openalex.org/W2025899545,"In brain glial cells, expression of calcium independent nitric-oxide synthase (NOS-2) is induced following stimulation with bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) and/or pro-inflammatory cytokines. We have investigated the effects of heat shock (HS), which can reduce inflammatory responses in several cell types, on the induction of glial NOS-2 expression. Preincubation of cells for 20-60 min at 43°C decreased subsequent levels of NOS-2 induction, with a maximal 80% reduction after 60 min of HS. Following HS, cells were refractory to NOS inducers for up to 4 h, after which time little or no suppression was observed. HS reduced cytosolic NOS-2 enzymatic activity (3-fold), steady state mRNA levels (2-3-fold), and gene promoter activity (by 50%). HS also reduced LPS-induced nuclear accumulation of transcription factor NFκB p65 subunit, suggesting perturbation of NFκB activation. A role for HS protein (HSP) 70 in NOS-2 suppression by HS is supported by the demonstration that 1) transfection with human HSP70 cDNA partially replicated HS effects; 2) antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides directed against rat HSP70 partially blocked HS effects; and 3) rat fibroblasts stably expressing human HSP70 did not express NOS-2 in response to LPS plus cytokines. As with heat-shocked cells, HSP70-expressing cells also exhibited decreased NFκB p65 subunit nuclear accumulation. These results demonstrate that in glial cells, as well as other cell types, NOS-2 induction can be modulated by the HS response, mediated at least in part by HSP70 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2072633855,"The modulatory neurotransmitters that trigger biochemical cascades underlying olfactory learning in Drosophila mushroom bodies have remained unknown. To identify molecules that may perform this role, putative biogenic amine receptors were cloned using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. One new receptor, DAMB, was identified as a dopamine D1 receptor by sequence analysis and pharmacological characterization. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses revealed highly enriched expression of DAMB in mushroom bodies, in a pattern coincident with the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase. The spatial coexpression of DAMB and the cyclase, along with DAMB's capacity to mediate dopamine-induced increases in cAMP make this receptor an attractive candidate for initiating biochemical cascades underlying learning."

However, ras(12V,37G) retained activity that complemented the transformation defect of a different ras mutant, ras(12V,35S). ras(12V,35S) could bind Raf1 and activate MAP kinase, but was presumably defective in other target interactions preserved by ras(12V,37G). The cooperativity between ras(12V,37G) and ras(12V,35S) suggested the presence of a novel pathway mediating Ras-induced cellular transformation in parallel to Raf activation (3White M.A. Nicolette C.

Reactions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Protein expression from exogenously introduced cDNAs was determined by Western blot analyses of cell lysates. raf-BXB expression was detected, from 20 µg of total protein, using the anti-Raf1 C-20 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Endogenous, activated forms of ERK1 and ERK2 were detected, from 20 µg of total protein, by using the 759B (Promega Corp.) antibody that selectively recognizes activated MAP kinase. Total ERK1/ERK2 levels were detected using the anti-ERK1 C-16 antibody. RalA was detected, from 20 µg of total protein, using a mouse anti-RalA monoclonal antibody from Transduction Laboratories. To identify the effector molecule(s) that may mediate signaling from ras(12V,37G), we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen cDNA libraries for clones that interact with ras(12V,37G) but not ras(12V,35S). In this way, the previously characterized ras-binding protein RalGDS was isolated from libraries derived from mouse embryo and PC12 cells. RalGDS was originally identified as a guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (GDS) for the Ral GTPase (19Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Human and rodent RalGDS interact directly with Ras in a GTP-dependent manner (11Spaargaren M. Bischoff J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The two-hybrid interactions of full-length RalGDS with ras(12V,37G) versus other ras effector-domain mutants are shown in Fig. 1. Although ras(12V,35S) does not interact with full-length RalGDS, a truncated version of RalGDS, expressing amino acids 703-814, was isolated from the mouse embryo library which interacts with both ras(12V,37G) and ras(12V,35S) (data not shown). This suggests that the specificity of the RalGDS-Ras interaction is affected by residues outside of the minimal ras interaction domain (12Hofer F. Fields S. Schneider C. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A different ras effector mutant rasV12C40 did not interact with any form of RalGDS isolated (Fig. 1 and data not shown). ras(12V,37G) is defective in Raf1 binding, but retains a function that cooperates with Raf1 to transform cells (3White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The binding of RalGDS with ras(12V,37G) suggests the possibility that RalGDS may partially or fully mediate this function. To test this, we compared the abilities of RalGDS and ras(12V,37G) to enhance focus formation induced by activated raf. raf-BXB is a Raf1 variant with a deletion of the amino-terminal regulatory domain containing the Ras-binding site (14Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar, 21Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This results in a mutationally activated protein that signals constitutively to downstream components (21Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with rasV12, raf-BXB, ras(12V,37G), and wild-type RalGDS alone and in the indicated combinations (Fig. 2). raf-BXB alone induced a low level of focus formation. Both RalGDS and ras(12V,37G) had no focus forming activity when expressed alone or together. However, ras(12V,37G) acted synergistically with raf-BXB to transform cells, resulting in an approximately 8-fold induction of focus formation above the level observed with raf-BXB alone. Similarly, RalGDS acted synergistically with raf-BXB to transform cells, resulting in an approximately 12-fold induction of focus formation above the level observed with raf-BXB alone. raf-BXB expression levels, as determined by Western blotting of pooled G418-resistant colonies, were equivalent in cells transfected with raf-BXB alone and in combination with ras(12V,37G) or RalGDS (data not shown). The activation of MAP kinase is an important step in cellular transformation induced by Ras and Raf (9Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 10Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kinch M.S. Burridge K. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). It is possible that the cooperativity in focus formation between ectopically expressed RalGDS and raf-BXB converges at the level of MAP kinase activation. To test this, the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 were immunoprecipitated from pooled G418-resistant colonies derived from cells transfected with pDCR-ras(12V) or pSRα-raf-BXB alone and in combination with pCEP4-RalGDS. The number of colonies derived from individual transfections were equivalent (∼250/plate). Activity of the immunoprecipitated ERK1 and ERK2 was assayed by in vitro phosphorylation of MBP. The level of MAP kinase activation in cells expressing raf-BXB was similar to that in cells expressing ras(12V). Coexpression of RalGDS with raf-BXB resulted in no detectable induction of MAP kinase above the level observed with raf-BXB alone (Fig. 3A). Transient transfection assays yielded similar results. To detect activation of endogenous MAP kinase in transiently transfected cells, it was necessary to use the 759B antibody which selectively recognizes the activated phosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2. Cells transiently expressing RalGDS or ras(12V,37G) showed no increase in the levels of activated MAP kinase as compared to cells transfected with empty vectors. Importantly, RalGDS and ras(12V,37G) did not significantly enhance the level of activated MAP kinase induced by raf-BXB. Total levels of cellular MAP kinase were equivalent among transfections (Fig. 3B). RalGDS stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange on the Ras-related GTPase Ral (19Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, the promotion of cellular transformation by RalGDS may be a consequence of Ral activation. To test this, we examined the contribution of Ral to focus formation by Ras and Raf. ralA(23V) has a mutation resulting in a defective intrinsic GTPase activity homologous to the ras(12V) activating mutation (22Frech M. Schlichting I. Wittinghofer A. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6353-6359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of pCEP4-ralA(23V) resulted in a 3-fold elevation of total RalA protein but did not cooperate with raf-BXB to transform cells (Fig. 4). This lack of cooperativity suggests that RalGDS may contribute to raf-BXB-induced focus formation through a RalA-independent mechanism. Alternatively, the 23V mutation may not result in the same degree of functional activation of RalA as ectopic expression of RalGDS. ralA(26A) contains a mutation with structure and sequence homology to the dominant negative mutant ras(15A) (23Chen S.-Y. Huff S.Y. Lai C.-C. Der C.J. Powers S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2691-2698PubMed Google Scholar). ras(15A) has been shown to form unproductive complexes with Ras guanyl nucleotide exchange factors and is predominantly in the GDP-bound state (24Powers S.K. O'Neill K. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Chen S.-Y. Huff S.Y. Lai C.-C. Der C.J. Powers S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2691-2698PubMed Google Scholar). We hoped that expression of ralA(26A) would inhibit cellular Ral function by sequestering Ral guanyl nucleotide exchange factors in a manner analogous to the block of cellular Ras function that occurs upon expression of ras(15A). Expression of pCEP4-ral(26A) resulted in a 2.5-fold elevation in total detectable RalA protein. ralA(26A) had no significant effect on focus formation induced by raf-BXB. ralA(26A) expression did result in a small but reproducible reduction in foci induced by ras(12V) and by coexpression of raf-BXB and ras(12V,37G) (Fig. 4). This reduction may be a result of sequestration of RalGDS through unproductive binding to ralA(26A). Consistent with this, ralA(26A) interacts with RalGDS in the yeast two-hybrid system whereas wild-type RalA and ralA(23V) give no detectable interaction (data not shown). ras(12V,37G) is defective in Raf1 interaction and cellular transformation. However, ras(12V,37G) does retain an activity that complements the transformation defect of a different Ras mutant, ras(12V,35S). ras(12V,35S) binds Raf1, but is presumably defective in other target interactions that mediate cellular transformation. The transformation defect of ras(12V, 37G) is rescued by coexpression of a Raf1 mutant that rescues binding to ras(12V,37G). We have interpreted this as evidence that Ras transforms cells through the activation of Raf1 as well as other, as yet unidentified, molecules (3White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the ras-binding protein RalGDS interacts with ras(12V,37G) but not ras(12V,35S), suggesting that it may mediate the complementary transformation activity of ras(12V,37G). Consistent with this, RalGDS, like ras(12V,37G), cooperates with mutationally activated raf to transform cells. While the results described here establish RalGDS as a positive regulator of transformation, it remains to be demonstrated that this activity is mediated by Ras interaction. In addition, RalGDS is not the only candidate Ras effector other than Raf which may mediate Ras-induced cellular transformation. Additional Ras-binding proteins have been identified, including phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (2Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroek B. Gout I. Fry M.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The complementary transforming activity of RalGDS does not appear to converge at the level of MAP kinase activation, as it does not activate MAP kinase and does not enhance activation of MAP kinase by activated Raf. This suggests that RalGDS contributes to cellular transformation by activating a pathway that is distinct from the Raf-MAP kinase cascade. Obvious candidates for targets that mediate RalGDS transforming activity are the Ral GTPases (30Chardin P. Tavitian A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The use of “activated” and “dominant negative” mutants of RalA was unsuccessful in revealing a role for Ral GTPases in Ras-induced cellular transformation. Similar experiments with RalB mutants were also negative (data not shown). However, while this manuscript was in preparation, Urano et al. (31Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) published observations that ralA(72L) cooperated with ras(12V) to transform cells, and ralA(28N) interfered with cellular transformation by both ras(12V) and v-raf. Parallel studies with these same reagents have not been done by us, and we cannot rule out a role for RalA in mediating the activities we observe with RalGDS. Further studies are underway, using mutants of RalGDS that effect Ral binding and guanyl nucleotide exchange, as well as RalGDS mutants that restore interaction with ras mutants, that should clarify the roles of RalGDS and Ral in mediating Ras-induced cellular transformation.

NO-stimulated release was found to be inhibited by Botulinum neurotoxins that inactivate the core complex of synaptic proteins involved in the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles. In experiments using recombinant proteins, NO donors increased formation of the VAMP/SNAP-25/syntaxin 1a core complex and inhibited the binding of n-sec1 to syntaxin 1a. The combined effects of these activities is predicted to promote vesicle docking/fusion. The sulfhydryl reagent NEM inhibited the binding of n-sec1 to syntaxin 1a, while beta-ME could reverse the NO-enhanced association of VAMP/SNAP-25/syntaxin 1a. These data suggest that post-translational modification of sulfhydryl groups by a nitrogen monoxide (likely to be NO+) alters the synaptic protein interactions that regulate neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity."

When the adenovirus Adex1CAlacZ was applied at a multiplicity of infection of 200-300 pfu/cell, lacZ gene expression was observed in more than 90% of 3T3-L1 adipocytes on postinfection day 3 (data not shown). Infection with Adex1CAlacZ or Adex1CAp110α resulted in no apparent differences in extent of differentiation into adipocytes, numbers of differentiated adipocytes, or morphological features in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as compared with untreated cells on postinfection day 3. In addition, 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with Adex1CAlacZ exhibited no significant differences in glucose transport activity as compared with noninfected cells on postinfection day 3 (data not shown). Therefore, in the present study, recombinant adenoviruses were applied at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 200-300 pfu/cell, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes infected with Adex1CAlacZ virus were used as a control. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were lysed and boiled in Laemmli buffer containing 10 mM dithiothreitol and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide (7.5% for p110αPI3K and 10% for glucose transporters) gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were incubated with antisera, subsequently with 125I-protein A (Amersham), and subjected to autoradiography. 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a 12-well culture dish were serum-starved for 3 h in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and glucose-free incubation was performed for 45 min in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (14Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated with or without various concentrations of insulin for 15 min, and 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose uptake was measured as described previously (23Asano T. Takata K. Katagiri H.

The cells were serum-starved, as described above, and solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 µM sodium orthovanadate. Lysates were extracted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min and incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or anti-p85α antibody. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). PI 3-kinase activity was assayed in the immunoprecipitates as reported previously (12Pons S. Asano T. Glasheen E. Miralpeix M. Zhang Y. Fisher T.L. Myers Jr., Sun X.J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4453-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The results were quantitated using an image analyzer BAS2000 (Fujix). Fractionation of subcellular membranes from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was done essentially as described (27Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C571-C580Crossref Google Scholar). Aliquots of subcellular membrane fractions containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted as described above. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts plated on sterile glass coverslips were induced to differentiate into adipocytes. Plasma membrane sheets were prepared by sonication as described (28Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. Davis D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Adherent plasma membranes were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using anti-GLUT4 antiserum (1:100 dilution) followed by rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. Overexpression of p110αPI3K was achieved utilizing an adenovirus-mediated gene transduction system in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as demonstrated by immunoblotting with the antibody against the tagged epitope (Fig. 1A). Control (LacZ-expressing) and p110αPI3K-overexpressing 3T3-L1 (p110α-L1) adipocytes were incubated with or without insulin for 15 min, and the PI 3-kinase activity was measured. In control cells, insulin stimulated the coimmunoprecipitation of PI 3-kinase activity with tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (maximum approximately 35-fold) (Fig. 1, B and C) and that with the regulatory subunits of PI 3-kinase (maximum approximately 2-fold) (Fig. 1D) in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained in parental 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Overexpression of p110αPI3K induced only a very modest elevation of PI 3-kinase activity in precipitates with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in the basal condition (Fig. 1C). Thus, a very small portion of exogenously expressed p110αPI3K bound to the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in the basal state. Insulin addition to p110α-L1 adipocytes markedly and dose-dependently increased the PI 3-kinase activity in the precipitates with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and activity was significantly greater than that observed in insulin-stimulated control adipocytes (Fig. 1C). In marked contrast, even without insulin stimulation, PI 3-kinase activity was greatly increased in precipitates with the regulatory subunits of PI 3-kinase, an increase exceeding that of the maximally insulin-stimulated control cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, exogenously expressed p110αPI3K bound to its regulatory subunits and exhibited its activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Incubation of p110α-L1 adipocytes with insulin further stimulated the PI 3-kinase activity measured in precipitates with the regulatory subunits of PI 3-kinase, and the increment was greater than that observed with insulin in control adipocytes (Fig. 1D). Thus, exogenously expressed p110αPI3K contributed to the insulin-induced increment in PI 3-kinase activity, indicating that insulin stimulated the PI 3-kinase activity in the complex of the endogenous regulatory subunits with not only endogenous catalytic subunits but also exogenously expressed p110αPI3K. 2-Deoxy-[3H]glucose uptake in response to a 15-min incubation with 10−10-10−6M insulin was measured in control and p110α-L1 adipocytes. Insulin dose-dependently stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in control 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2), and the maximally stimulated values were similar (approximately 12-fold) in control and parental 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Overexpression of p110αPI3K induced a marked increase (approximately 14-fold) in the basal glucose transport rate. Insulin further stimulated the glucose uptake in p110α-L1 in a dose-dependent manner (maximum approximately 1.4-fold) (Fig. 2). To begin addressing the mechanism whereby overexpression of p110αPI3K stimulated hexose transport activity, cellular expression levels of the two glucose transporter isoforms (GLUT1 and GLUT4), known to be expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, were determined. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, no apparent differences in cellular expression levels of GLUT1 and GLUT4 were observed between control and p110α-L1 adipocytes. We next tested whether overexpression of p110αPI3K affected the subcellular distribution of glucose transporters by immunoblot analysis of the plasma membrane (PM) fraction and the intracellular low density microsome (LDM) fraction (Fig. 3, C and D). Insulin caused 4- and 6-fold increases in the amounts of plasma membrane GLUT1 and GLUT4, respectively, in control adipocytes. Corresponding decreases in GLUT1 and GLUT4 were observed in the LDM fraction of these cells. Strikingly, p110αPI3K overexpression induced translocation of GLUT1 and GLUT4 from the LDM fraction to the PM fraction, in a fashion similar to the insulin effect in control cells. Insulin addition to p110α-L1 adipocytes had no apparent effects on the subcellular distributions of either GLUT1 or GLUT4. We further confirmed the translocation of GLUT4 protein to the plasma membrane using the membrane sheet assay method. Fig. 4 demonstrates cell surface GLUT4 expression in control and p110α-L1 adipocytes treated in the absence or presence of insulin (100 nM) for 15 min. In control cells, very little GLUT4 staining was observed on the plasma membrane, whereas insulin treatment increased surface GLUT4 staining substantially (Fig. 4). On the other hand, cell surface GLUT4 expression in p110α-L1 adipocytes was already intense in the basal state, and insulin appeared to have virtually no further effects, consistent with the results obtained by the subcellular fractionation method. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of p110αPI3K exerts stimulatory effects on the translocation of glucose transporters from intracellular to plasma membranes. In this study, overexpression of p110αPI3K, using an adenovirus-mediated gene transduction system, induced translocation of glucose transporters from intracellular low density microsomes to the plasma membrane and, thus, increased the glucose transport rate without changing the total amount of glucose transporter protein. Recently, several findings on the relationship between PI 3-kinase activity and glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes have been reported. PDGF caused no significant stimulation of glucose transport activity in 3T3-L1 aidipocytes, despite increasing PI 3-kinase activity to a level approaching that elicited by insulin (18Wiese R.J. Mastick C.C. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3442-3446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 19Isakoff S.J. Taha C. Rose E. Marcusohn J. Klip A. Skolnik E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We obtained similar results in PDGF-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown). In addition, introduction of a thiophosphotyrosine peptide into permeabilized 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated PI 3-kinase to the same extent as insulin, while having little stimulatory effect on glucose transport activity (29Herbst J.J. Andrews G.C. Contillo L.G. Singleton D.H. Genereux P.E. Gibbs E.M. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26000-26005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These authors concluded that another signaling pathway, in addition to the activation of PI 3-kinase, might be required for the stimulation of GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport activity. However, the results of the present study indicate that PI 3-kinase activation alone stimulates translocation of GLUTs and, thus, activates glucose transport activity. One interpretation of these findings is that activation of PI 3-kinase by insulin is qualitatively different from that by either PDGF or the thiophosphotyrosine peptide, including the possibility that insulin activates PI 3-kinase in different subcellular locations than do the peptide and PDGF. A previous study (30Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that activated PI 3-kinase has the same intracellular location as tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 in insulin-stimulated adipocytes, whereas the thiophosphotyrosine peptide appears to inhibit the association of PI 3-kinase activity with IRS1. The tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS1-p85 complex formed in response to insulin was demonstrated to be localized in a very low density vesicle subpopulation. These vesicles could be distinguished from vesicles containing the insulin receptor which was endocytosed from the plasma membrane (30Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, tyrosyl-phosphorylated PDGF receptors, the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, and activated PI 3-kinase are all found in isolated clathrin-coated vesicles after PDGF stimulation in 3T3-L1 cells, indicating that both receptor and activated PI 3-kinase enter the endocytic pathway (31Kapellar R. Chakrabarti R. Cantley L. Fay F. Corvera S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6052-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the subcellular redistribution of PI 3-kinase activity in response to PDGF is different from that induced by insulin. Increased PI-3 kinase activity was observed in every LDM subpopulation, including a very low density vesicle subpopulation, when p110α-L1 adipocytes were homogenized and fractionated on a sucrose gradient (data not shown). Subcellular redistribution of PI 3-kinase activity may be the key determinant in signal generation. The increase in PI-3 kinase activity induced by overexpressing p110αPI3K is due to an increased amount of the protein, whereas insulin stimulates enzyme activity. In this respect, the increased activity resulting from overexpression is quantitative, rather than qualitative and, thus, might be nonphysiological. Overexpression of Ras (32Kozma L. Baltensperger K. Klarlund J. Porras A. Santos E. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4460-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) or Raf-1 (33Fingar D.C. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10127-10132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also increased the glucose transport activity. However, levels of total GLUT4 and GLUT1 expression were changed in stable cell lines of 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing Ras and Raf-1, respectively. In contrast, in the present study, overexpression of p110αPI3K in 3T3-L1 adipocytes exerted essentially no effect on the total expression level while having a marked effect on the subcellular distribution of glucose transporters, which is qualitatively similar to the physiological effect of insulin. Overexpression of p110αPI3K induced greater glucose transport activity than that observed in maximally insulin-stimulated control cells. A slightly larger amount (1.3-fold) of GLUT1 glucose transporter protein was observed in the PM fraction of p110α-L1 cells as compared with that in insulin-stimulated control cells. However, it may be difficult that the small difference in the amount of GLUT1 protein in the PM fraction can entirely explain the difference in glucose transport activity between basal p110α-L1 cells and insulin-stimulated control cells. Furthermore, insulin produced no apparent increase in the amount of glucose transporter protein in the PM fraction of p110α-L1 cells, despite further stimulating glucose transport activity in these cells. These findings suggest that insulin and/or an increment in PI 3-kinase activity may also stimulate the intrinsic activity of glucose transporters. One of the advantages of transient expression using an adenovirus-mediated gene transduction system is that long-term effects of gene transduction are much smaller than those in cells stably expressing the gene product. Furthermore, transient expression is not hampered by the problem of cell selection. Long-term selection of stable cell lines can lead to the establishment of specific cell lines which express many other genes necessary for survival during the selection period. We achieved expression of the intended protein in almost all 3T3-L1 adipocytes, while avoiding the selection process, using the adenovirus-mediated gene transduction system. The downstream components of the pathway from PI 3-kinase through glucose transport have yet to be elucidated. Recently, several downstream targets of PI 3-kinase have been identified, such as Akt (34Franke T.F. Yang S. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar) and the small G-protein Rac (35Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson-Welsh L. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, Rac does not couple PI 3-kinase to insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (36Marcusohn J. Isakoff S.J. Rose E. Symons M. Skolnik E.Y. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1296-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2038900140,"The myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) has been shown to be inhibitory for certain neurons in vitro (Mukhopadhyay et al., 1994; McKerracher et al., 1994). To investigate whether MAG is an inhibitory component in peripheral myelin in vivo, MAG-deficient mutant mice were cross-bred with C57BL/Wlds mice that have delayed lesion-induced myelin degeneration and axon regrowth. While in crushed nerves of C57BL/Wlds mice expressing MAG, only 16% of myelin sheaths were associated with regrowing axons, this number was doubled in MAG-deficient C57BL/Wlds mice. These observations suggest that the absence of MAG may contribute to the improved axonal regrowth in the double mutants. Therefore, degeneration of MAG-containing myelin might be an important prerequisite to optimize axonal regrowth after peripheral nerve injury."

PLC-γ(s) are unique among the PLC isozymes in that they have two Src homology domains and are activated via tyrosine phosphorylation by growth hormone receptors, such as platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor (2Rhee S.G.

Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). The involvement of PLC-δ isozymes in transmembrane signaling is not clear, although the PLC-δ1 subtype is widely distributed and is more abundant than PLC-β1 (2Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol.

Recently, PLC-δ1 has been implicated in thrombin-mediated transmembrane signaling using a coexpression system (14Banno Y. Okano Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15846-15852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the course of studying the α1B-adrenoreceptor signaling mechanism, we have identified a 69-kDa PLC that is activated by a new class of GTP-binding protein, Gαh (transglutaminase II) (9Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 69-kDa PLC was initially purified by complex formation with Gαh by incubating the bovine liver membranes with α1-agonist and GTP (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total reconstitution of the α1B-receptor, Gh, and the 69-kDa PLC demonstrated that the three components effectively coupled to each other (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding was further confirmed by coexpression of α1B-adrenoreceptor and Gαh in various cells (9Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the 69-kDa PLC remains to be clarified.Recently, we have shown that a peptide (Leu661-Lys672) derived from the COOH-terminal region of human heart Gαh inhibited coimmunoprecipitation of PLC by Gαh7 antibody as well as guinea pig transglutaminase II antibody (16Hwang K.-C. Gray C.D. Sivasubramanian N. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27058-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), indicating that the peptide binds to PLC with high affinity. Moreover, systematic deletion mutation studies with Gαh revealed that the region corresponding to this peptide of Gαh is responsible for interaction and activation of PLC. Using a peptide from this region, we sought to determine whether the 69-kDa PLC is unique or is a known PLC isozyme. A 20-amino acid peptide (Leu654-Leu673) from Gαh, which contains the PLC binding region, was used to create an affinity resin. The identity of the PLC that bound to this peptide was characterized. We present, for the first time, evidence that PLC-δ1 is structurally similar to the 69-kDa PLC and that PLC-δ1 is stimulated by Gh.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have shown previously that a stretch of 12 amino acids (P4, Leu661-Lys672) near the COOH terminus of Gαh contained the high affinity PLC binding site (16Hwang K.-C. Gray C.D. Sivasubramanian N. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27058-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This observation was further applied to identify the PLC isozyme activated by Gαh. We synthesized four peptides (P3-P6) (Fig. 1) and cross-linked P5 and P6 to CNBr-Sepharose 4B for use as peptide-affinity resins. A partially purified PLC preparation from rat liver membranes was incubated with the peptide affinity resins and their ability to bind PLC was determined (Fig. 2A). The P6 affinity resin bound 3-6 times more PLC activity than the P5 affinity resin or resin alone did, consistent with P6 containing the PLC binding site. The partially purified PLC preparation was then loaded onto a P6-Sepharose column, and the bound proteins were eluted and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the 69-kDa PLC (Fig. 2B). The antibodies recognized two proteins with molecular sizes of ∼69 and 85 kDa (lane 2) as well as the purified 69-kDa PLC (lane 3). The antibodies did not recognize any proteins in the eluate from the P5 affinity resin (lane 1). Furthermore, nonimmune serum did not recognize the ∼69- and 85-kDa proteins in the eluate from the P6 affinity column (data not shown). These results suggested that the 85-kDa protein, which has approximately the same molecular size as PLC-δ1, is structurally similar to the 69-kDa PLC. PLC activity measurements revealed that both purified 69-kDa PLC and PLC-δ1 bound to the P6 affinity resin (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, both purified proteins were recognized by a monoclonal antibody to PLC-δ1 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the 69-kDa PLC is structurally similar to PLC-δ1 and may be a proteolytic fragment of this enzyme. The polyclonal antibodies to the 69-kDa PLC cross-reacted with PLC-δ1 (data not shown). The 69- and 85-kDa proteins present in the partially purified preparations that bound to the P6 affinity resin were recognized by the monoclonal antibody to PLC-δ1 but not by monoclonal antibodies to PLC-β1 or PLC-γ1.Fig. 3Structural and functional similarity of PLC-δ1 and the 69-kDa PLC. A, the P6 affinity resin (30 µl) was incubated with 20 ng of either 69-kDa PLC or PLC-δ1 at 4°C for 1 h. Bovine serum albumin (1 µg) was included in the incubation mixture to prevent nonspecific binding. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1,900 × g for 5 min, the pellets and supernatants were collected, and the pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of HSD buffer containing 0.05% SM. The pellets and supernatants were assayed for PLC activity in a final volume of 100 µl. Data shown are the means of two independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.

PLC-δ1 was incubated with P5 or P6 affinity resins in the presence or absence of P4 (Fig. 4A). PLC-δ1 did bind to the P6 affinity resin but not to the P5 affinity resin, and the peptide P4 blocked the PLC-δ1 binding to the P6 resin. In addition, peptide P3 did not inhibit the binding of PLC-δ1 to the P6 affinity resin, showing that the P4 region contributes to the binding of PLC to Gαh (data not shown). Since this P4 region of Gαh interacts with and activates PLC (16Hwang K.-C. Gray C.D. Sivasubramanian N. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27058-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we investigated whether peptide P4 activates PLC-δ1. Indeed, the peptide P4 did activate PLC-δ1 in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of ∼50 µM, and a maximal activation was reached at ≥150 µM (Fig. 4B). Peptide P3 did not stimulate PLC-δ1 (Fig. 4B), indicating that stimulation of PLC-δ1 by P4 is specific.Fig. 4Specificity of PLC-δ1 binding to P6 (A) and stimulation of PLC-δ1 by P4 (B). A, PLC-δ1 (20 ng) was incubated with P5 or P6 affinity resins (30 µl) in the presence and absence of 100 µM P4, and PLC activity in the pellet and supernatant was assayed after centrifugation, as described in the legend to Fig. 3A. B, PLC-δ1 (7 ng) was incubated at 4°C for 2 h with various concentrations of P3 or P4 in HSD buffer containing 0.02% SM. PLC activity was determined in the presence of 3.74 nM free Ca2+ at 30°C for 8 min, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Data in A and B are means of three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, coupling between PLC-δ1 and Gh reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles was investigated. We have previously reported that EGTA inhibits the coupling of Gh with 69-kDa PLC (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, coupling between Gh and PLC-δ1 was not observed in the presence of chelator. Therefore, coupling was assessed in the absence of chelator under the conditions described previously (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Im M.-J. Gray C. Rim A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8887-8894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution of PLC-δ1 with Gh reduced basal PLC activity by two-thirds (data not shown). Activated (GTPγS-bound) Gh increased PLC-δ1 activity in a Ca2+ concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A); the activity was maximal at ≤ 12 µM Ca2+, similar to the concentration required for maximal activation of the 69-kDa PLC by Gh (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was less sensitive to Ca2+ in the presence of GDP or buffer alone; under these conditions, PLC-δ1 was not fully activated at ≥16 µM Ca2+. Thus, activation of PLC-δ1 by Gh resulted in an increase in the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+, as observed when Gh and the 69-kDa PLC were coupled (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also showed that antibodies to Gαh coimmunoprecipitated PLC-δ1 when the enzyme was reconstituted with GTPγS-bound Gh (Fig. 5B); PLC-δ1 was not coimmunoprecipitated in the absence of GTPγS. Antibodies from nonimmune serum coupled to protein A-agarose did not coprecipitate PLC-δ1 in the presence or absence of GTPγS (data not shown).Fig. 5Reconstitution of PLC-δ1 with Gh. A, activation of PLC-δ1 by GTPγS-bound Gh. PLC-δ1 (200 ng) was reconstituted with Gh (6 pmol) in phospholipid vesicles in a final volume of 150 µl. Portions (10 µl) were subsequently assayed for the PLC activity in the presence of various concentrations of Ca2+ in a final volume of 100 µl at 30°C for 8 min. B, coimmunoprecipitation of PLC-δ1 by antibodies to Gαh that were coupled to protein A-agarose. PLC-δ1 (50 ng) was reconstituted with Gh (2 pmol) in HSD buffer containing 0.02% SM. Immunoprecipitation was then performed with antibodies to Gαh as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and PLC activity in the precipitates and supernatants was assayed. PLC activity in the original samples was taken as 100%. Data in A and B are means of three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been suggested that low molecular mass PLCs might be proteolytic fragments of PLC-β, γ, and δ isozymes (2Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Taylor G.D. Fee J.A. Silbert D.F. Hofmann S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1176-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that the 69-kDa PLC is probably a proteolytic fragment of PLC-δ1. Thus, the elution profile of 69-kDa PLC is similar to PLC-δ1 on ion exchange chromatographic resins, particularly on heparin-agarose (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion of PLC-δ1 by proteases yields fragments of 52-68 kDa (25Taylor G.D. Fee J.A. Silbert D.F. Hofmann S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1176-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); in the presence of PIP2, trypsin generates a 68-kDa fragment from PLC-δ1 (26Cheng H.-F. Jiang M.-J. Chen C.-L. Liu S.-M. Wong L.-P. Lomasney J.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5495-5505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, the original purification of the 69-kDa PLC-Gh complex may have contributed to an increased sensitivity of PLC-δ1 to proteases, because the complex was induced by α1-adrenoreceptor activation in the presence of GTP (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which increases the binding of PIP2 to PLC-δ1. On the other hand, we previously stated that the purified 69-kDa PLC did not cross-react with antibodies to PLC-δ1 and that Gh did not stimulate PLC-δ1 activity (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for the failure to stimulate PLC-δ1 or to detect the 69-kDa PLC by PLC-δ1 antibody is not clearly understood. It is probably due to the viability of the purified enzymes and affinity of the antibody for the 69-kDa PLC, since we previously used a polyclonal antibody to PLC-δ1. For the previous reconstitution studies, PLC-δ1 was purified from the cytosolic fraction of bovine brain. Although it is not known whether cytosolic PLC-δ1 is functionally different from membrane associated enzyme, the source of the enzyme could be another factor. Nonetheless, our present studies clearly indicate that 69-kDa PLC is a proteolytic fragment of PLC-δ1 and that PLC-δ1 is the effector of Gh signaling.

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20519-20524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLC-γ(s) are unique among the PLC isozymes in that they have two Src homology domains and are activated via tyrosine phosphorylation by growth hormone receptors, such as platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor (2Rhee S.G.

Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). The involvement of PLC-δ isozymes in transmembrane signaling is not clear, although the PLC-δ1 subtype is widely distributed and is more abundant than PLC-β1 (2Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rhee S.G. Kim H. Suh P.-G. Choi W.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, PLC-δ1 has been implicated in thrombin-mediated transmembrane signaling using a coexpression system (14Banno Y. Okano Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15846-15852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the course of studying the α1B-adrenoreceptor signaling mechanism, we have identified a 69-kDa PLC that is activated by a new class of GTP-binding protein, Gαh (transglutaminase II) (9Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 69-kDa PLC was initially purified by complex formation with Gαh by incubating the bovine liver membranes with α1-agonist and GTP (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total reconstitution of the α1B-receptor, Gh, and the 69-kDa PLC demonstrated that the three components effectively coupled to each other (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding was further confirmed by coexpression of α1B-adrenoreceptor and Gαh in various cells (9Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the 69-kDa PLC remains to be clarified.Recently, we have shown that a peptide (Leu661-Lys672) derived from the COOH-terminal region of human heart Gαh inhibited coimmunoprecipitation of PLC by Gαh7 antibody as well as guinea pig transglutaminase II antibody (16Hwang K.-C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27058-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), indicating that the peptide binds to PLC with high affinity. Moreover, systematic deletion mutation studies with Gαh revealed that the region corresponding to this peptide of Gαh is responsible for interaction and activation of PLC. Using a peptide from this region, we sought to determine whether the 69-kDa PLC is unique or is a known PLC isozyme. A 20-amino acid peptide (Leu654-Leu673) from Gαh, which contains the PLC binding region, was used to create an affinity resin. The identity of the PLC that bound to this peptide was characterized. We present, for the first time, evidence that PLC-δ1 is structurally similar to the 69-kDa PLC and that PLC-δ1 is stimulated by Gh.

In the course of studying the α1B-adrenoreceptor signaling mechanism, we have identified a 69-kDa PLC that is activated by a new class of GTP-binding protein, Gαh (transglutaminase II) (9Nakaoka H.

Recently, we have shown that a peptide (Leu661-Lys672) derived from the COOH-terminal region of human heart Gαh inhibited coimmunoprecipitation of PLC by Gαh7 antibody as well as guinea pig transglutaminase II antibody (16Hwang K.-C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27058-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), indicating that the peptide binds to PLC with high affinity. Moreover, systematic deletion mutation studies with Gαh revealed that the region corresponding to this peptide of Gαh is responsible for interaction and activation of PLC. Using a peptide from this region, we sought to determine whether the 69-kDa PLC is unique or is a known PLC isozyme. A 20-amino acid peptide (Leu654-Leu673) from Gαh, which contains the PLC binding region, was used to create an affinity resin. The identity of the PLC that bound to this peptide was characterized. We present, for the first time, evidence that PLC-δ1 is structurally similar to the 69-kDa PLC and that PLC-δ1 is stimulated by Gh. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have shown previously that a stretch of 12 amino acids (P4, Leu661-Lys672) near the COOH terminus of Gαh contained the high affinity PLC binding site (16Hwang K.-C. Gray C.D. Sivasubramanian N. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27058-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This observation was further applied to identify the PLC isozyme activated by Gαh. We synthesized four peptides (P3-P6) (Fig. 1) and cross-linked P5 and P6 to CNBr-Sepharose 4B for use as peptide-affinity resins. A partially purified PLC preparation from rat liver membranes was incubated with the peptide affinity resins and their ability to bind PLC was determined (Fig. 2A). The P6 affinity resin bound 3-6 times more PLC activity than the P5 affinity resin or resin alone did, consistent with P6 containing the PLC binding site. The partially purified PLC preparation was then loaded onto a P6-Sepharose column, and the bound proteins were eluted and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the 69-kDa PLC (Fig. 2B). The antibodies recognized two proteins with molecular sizes of ∼69 and 85 kDa (lane 2) as well as the purified 69-kDa PLC (lane 3). The antibodies did not recognize any proteins in the eluate from the P5 affinity resin (lane 1). Furthermore, nonimmune serum did not recognize the ∼69- and 85-kDa proteins in the eluate from the P6 affinity column (data not shown). These results suggested that the 85-kDa protein, which has approximately the same molecular size as PLC-δ1, is structurally similar to the 69-kDa PLC. PLC activity measurements revealed that both purified 69-kDa PLC and PLC-δ1 bound to the P6 affinity resin (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, both purified proteins were recognized by a monoclonal antibody to PLC-δ1 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the 69-kDa PLC is structurally similar to PLC-δ1 and may be a proteolytic fragment of this enzyme. The polyclonal antibodies to the 69-kDa PLC cross-reacted with PLC-δ1 (data not shown). The 69- and 85-kDa proteins present in the partially purified preparations that bound to the P6 affinity resin were recognized by the monoclonal antibody to PLC-δ1 but not by monoclonal antibodies to PLC-β1 or PLC-γ1.The specificity of PLC-δ1 binding to the P6 affinity resin was then evaluated. PLC-δ1 was incubated with P5 or P6 affinity resins in the presence or absence of P4 (Fig. 4A). PLC-δ1 did bind to the P6 affinity resin but not to the P5 affinity resin, and the peptide P4 blocked the PLC-δ1 binding to the P6 resin. In addition, peptide P3 did not inhibit the binding of PLC-δ1 to the P6 affinity resin, showing that the P4 region contributes to the binding of PLC to Gαh (data not shown). Since this P4 region of Gαh interacts with and activates PLC (16Hwang K.-C. Gray C.D. Sivasubramanian N. Im M.-J. J. Biol.

Indeed, the peptide P4 did activate PLC-δ1 in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of ∼50 µM, and a maximal activation was reached at ≥150 µM (Fig. 4B). Peptide P3 did not stimulate PLC-δ1 (Fig. 4B), indicating that stimulation of PLC-δ1 by P4 is specific.Fig. 4Specificity of PLC-δ1 binding to P6 (A) and stimulation of PLC-δ1 by P4 (B). A, PLC-δ1 (20 ng) was incubated with P5 or P6 affinity resins (30 µl) in the presence and absence of 100 µM P4, and PLC activity in the pellet and supernatant was assayed after centrifugation, as described in the legend to Fig. 3A. B, PLC-δ1 (7 ng) was incubated at 4°C for 2 h with various concentrations of P3 or P4 in HSD buffer containing 0.02% SM. PLC activity was determined in the presence of 3.74 nM free Ca2+ at 30°C for 8 min, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Data in A and B are means of three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, coupling between PLC-δ1 and Gh reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles was investigated. We have previously reported that EGTA inhibits the coupling of Gh with 69-kDa PLC (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, coupling between Gh and PLC-δ1 was not observed in the presence of chelator. Therefore, coupling was assessed in the absence of chelator under the conditions described previously (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Im M.-J. Gray C. Rim A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8887-8894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution of PLC-δ1 with Gh reduced basal PLC activity by two-thirds (data not shown). Activated (GTPγS-bound) Gh increased PLC-δ1 activity in a Ca2+ concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A); the activity was maximal at ≤ 12 µM Ca2+, similar to the concentration required for maximal activation of the 69-kDa PLC by Gh (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was less sensitive to Ca2+ in the presence of GDP or buffer alone; under these conditions, PLC-δ1 was not fully activated at ≥16 µM Ca2+. Thus, activation of PLC-δ1 by Gh resulted in an increase in the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+, as observed when Gh and the 69-kDa PLC were coupled (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also showed that antibodies to Gαh coimmunoprecipitated PLC-δ1 when the enzyme was reconstituted with GTPγS-bound Gh (Fig. 5B); PLC-δ1 was not coimmunoprecipitated in the absence of GTPγS. Antibodies from nonimmune serum coupled to protein A-agarose did not coprecipitate PLC-δ1 in the presence or absence of GTPγS (data not shown).Fig. 5Reconstitution of PLC-δ1 with Gh. A, activation of PLC-δ1 by GTPγS-bound Gh. PLC-δ1 (200 ng) was reconstituted with Gh (6 pmol) in phospholipid vesicles in a final volume of 150 µl. Portions (10 µl) were subsequently assayed for the PLC activity in the presence of various concentrations of Ca2+ in a final volume of 100 µl at 30°C for 8 min. B, coimmunoprecipitation of PLC-δ1 by antibodies to Gαh that were coupled to protein A-agarose. PLC-δ1 (50 ng) was reconstituted with Gh (2 pmol) in HSD buffer containing 0.02% SM. Immunoprecipitation was then performed with antibodies to Gαh as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and PLC activity in the precipitates and supernatants was assayed. PLC activity in the original samples was taken as 100%. Data in A and B are means of three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been suggested that low molecular mass PLCs might be proteolytic fragments of PLC-β, γ, and δ isozymes (2Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Taylor G.D. Fee J.A. Silbert D.F. Hofmann S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1176-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that the 69-kDa PLC is probably a proteolytic fragment of PLC-δ1. Thus, the elution profile of 69-kDa PLC is similar to PLC-δ1 on ion exchange chromatographic resins, particularly on heparin-agarose (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion of PLC-δ1 by proteases yields fragments of 52-68 kDa (25Taylor G.D. Fee J.A. Silbert D.F. Hofmann S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1176-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); in the presence of PIP2, trypsin generates a 68-kDa fragment from PLC-δ1 (26Cheng H.-F. Jiang M.-J. Chen C.-L. Liu S.-M. Wong L.-P. Lomasney J.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5495-5505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, the original purification of the 69-kDa PLC-Gh complex may have contributed to an increased sensitivity of PLC-δ1 to proteases, because the complex was induced by α1-adrenoreceptor activation in the presence of GTP (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which increases the binding of PIP2 to PLC-δ1. On the other hand, we previously stated that the purified 69-kDa PLC did not cross-react with antibodies to PLC-δ1 and that Gh did not stimulate PLC-δ1 activity (15Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27398-27405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for the failure to stimulate PLC-δ1 or to detect the 69-kDa PLC by PLC-δ1 antibody is not clearly understood. It is probably due to the viability of the purified enzymes and affinity of the antibody for the 69-kDa PLC, since we previously used a polyclonal antibody to PLC-δ1. For the previous reconstitution studies, PLC-δ1 was purified from the cytosolic fraction of bovine brain. Although it is not known whether cytosolic PLC-δ1 is functionally different from membrane associated enzyme, the source of the enzyme could be another factor. Nonetheless, our present studies clearly indicate that 69-kDa PLC is a proteolytic fragment of PLC-δ1 and that PLC-δ1 is the effector of Gh signaling. We have shown previously that a stretch of 12 amino acids (P4, Leu661-Lys672) near the COOH terminus of Gαh contained the high affinity PLC binding site (16Hwang K.-C. Gray C.D. Sivasubramanian N. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27058-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This observation was further applied to identify the PLC isozyme activated by Gαh. We synthesized four peptides (P3-P6) (Fig. 1) and cross-linked P5 and P6 to CNBr-Sepharose 4B for use as peptide-affinity resins. A partially purified PLC preparation from rat liver membranes was incubated with the peptide affinity resins and their ability to bind PLC was determined (Fig. 2A). The P6 affinity resin bound 3-6 times more PLC activity than the P5 affinity resin or resin alone did, consistent with P6 containing the PLC binding site. The partially purified PLC preparation was then loaded onto a P6-Sepharose column, and the bound proteins were eluted and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the 69-kDa PLC (Fig. 2B). The antibodies recognized two proteins with molecular sizes of ∼69 and 85 kDa (lane 2) as well as the purified 69-kDa PLC (lane 3). The antibodies did not recognize any proteins in the eluate from the P5 affinity resin (lane 1). Furthermore, nonimmune serum did not recognize the ∼69- and 85-kDa proteins in the eluate from the P6 affinity column (data not shown). These results suggested that the 85-kDa protein, which has approximately the same molecular size as PLC-δ1, is structurally similar to the 69-kDa PLC. PLC activity measurements revealed that both purified 69-kDa PLC and PLC-δ1 bound to the P6 affinity resin (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, both purified proteins were recognized by a monoclonal antibody to PLC-δ1 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the 69-kDa PLC is structurally similar to PLC-δ1 and may be a proteolytic fragment of this enzyme. The polyclonal antibodies to the 69-kDa PLC cross-reacted with PLC-δ1 (data not shown). The 69- and 85-kDa proteins present in the partially purified preparations that bound to the P6 affinity resin were recognized by the monoclonal antibody to PLC-δ1 but not by monoclonal antibodies to PLC-β1 or PLC-γ1. The specificity of PLC-δ1 binding to the P6 affinity resin was then evaluated. PLC-δ1 was incubated with P5 or P6 affinity resins in the presence or absence of P4 (Fig. 4A). PLC-δ1 did bind to the P6 affinity resin but not to the P5 affinity resin, and the peptide P4 blocked the PLC-δ1 binding to the P6 resin. In addition, peptide P3 did not inhibit the binding of PLC-δ1 to the P6 affinity resin, showing that the P4 region contributes to the binding of PLC to Gαh (data not shown). Since this P4 region of Gαh interacts with and activates PLC (16Hwang K.-C. Gray C.D. Sivasubramanian N. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27058-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we investigated whether peptide P4 activates PLC-δ1.

https://openalex.org/W1992514146,"A recent study demonstrated that rat DNA polymerase β (β-pol) releases 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) termini from preincised apurinic/apyrimidinic DNA, a substrate generated during certain types of base excision repair. This catalytic activity resides within the amino-terminal, 8-kDa domain of β-pol and occurs via β-elimination as opposed to hydrolysis (Matsumoto, Y., and Kim, K. (1995) Science 269, 699-702). The latter finding suggested that the dRP excision reaction might proceed via an imine intermediate. In order to test this hypothesis, we attempted to trap β-pol on preincised apurinic/apyrimidinic DNA using NaBH4 as the reducing agent. Both 8-kDa domain-DNA and intact β-pol-DNA complexes were detected and identified by autoradiography coupled to immunoblotting. Our results indicate that the chemical mechanism of the β-pol dRpase reaction does proceed through an imine enzyme-DNA intermediate and that the active site residue responsible for dRP release must therefore contain a primary amine.

Specifically, in vitro experiments indicate that β-pol can perform two of the five reactions involved in base excision repair, excision of a 5′-terminal dRP from a preincised AP site (1Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Google Scholar) and DNA synthesis to fill the single-nucleotide gap (2Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5842-5845Google Scholar, 3Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Google Scholar, 4Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell.

The overall pathway for base excision repair that has been initiated by simple N-glycosylases (glycosylases lacking a concomitant AP lyase activity) is believed to proceed according to the following scheme. (i) A damage-specific DNA N-glycosylase creates an AP site by cleaving an N-C glycosyl bond, thereby releasing a modified base; (ii) a class II AP endonuclease incises the DNA 5′ to the AP site; (iii) β-pol or another dRpase excises the 5′ dRP terminus to leave a single-nucleotide gap; (iv) β-pol or another polymerase fills in the single-nucleotide gap; and (v) DNA ligase seals the gap (6Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kühn R. Hua G. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky C. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Google Scholar). 5′-Terminal dRP might eventually undergo an uncatalyzed β-elimination reaction to generate a single-nucleotide gap (half-life ≈ 2 h) (7Bailly V. Sente B. Verly W.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 751-759Google Scholar), but this reaction is probably too slow to be relied upon in vivo. Coordination of steps (iii) and (iv) by β-pol presumably would lead to more efficient DNA repair. Thus, reaction (iii) assures an adequate substrate for β-pol, an enzyme without an intrinsic 5′-exonuclease activity.

Proteolysis studies have revealed a two-domain structure for rat β-pol; independent digestions with four proteases resulted in the cleavage of the enzyme within a protease-sensitive region between residues 82 and 86 (8Kumar A. Widen S.G. Williams K.R. Kedar P. Karpel R.L. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2124-2131Google Scholar). Treatment with trypsin, for example, yielded an 8-kDa amino-terminal fragment (residues 3-75) and a 31-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment (residues 87-334). In addition to its recently discovered dRpase activity, the 8-kDa domain (residues 1-87) is known to bind single-stranded DNA with an affinity similar to that of the intact enzyme (8Kumar A. Widen S.G. Williams K.R. Kedar P. Karpel R.L. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2124-2131Google Scholar). The 31-kDa domain (residues 88-334) binds double-stranded DNA but not single-stranded DNA and retains <2% of the polymerase activity of the intact protein. Circular dichroism experiments revealed that the 8-kDa domain is essentially α-helical in nature (9Casas-Finet J.R. Kumar A. Morris G. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19618-19625Google Scholar), and the predominance of this secondary structural motif has since been confirmed by NMR (10Liu D. DeRose E.F. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9537-9545Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (11Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Google Scholar, 12Sawaya M.R. Pelletier H. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1930-1935Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal domain of β-pol comprises helix-1 (residues 15-26), a long loop (27-35), helix-2 (36-47), turn-1 (48-51) plus a segment of loop (52-55), helix-3 (56-61), turn-2 (62-65) plus a segment of loop (66-68), and helix-4 (69-78). Helix-1 and helix-2 lie antiparallel to each other as do helix-3 and helix-4, with the two pairs of antiparallel helices crossing at an 80° angle. Matsumoto and Kim (1Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Google Scholar) found that β-pol releases 5′-terminal dRP via β-elimination, as opposed to hydrolysis. This finding suggested that the dRP excision reaction likely proceeds via an imine or Schiff base intermediate. Fischer et al. (13Fischer E.H. Kent A.B. Snyder E.R. Krebs E.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 2906-2907Google Scholar) first demonstrated in 1958 that an imine intermediate formed between a substrate and an enzymatic amino group can be trapped by reduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). In subsequent years, this chemical technique helped to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of acetoacetate decarboxylase (14Fridovich I. Westheimer F.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962; 84: 3208-3209Google Scholar, 15Warren S. Zerner B. Westheimer F.H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 817-823Google Scholar) and aldolase (16Speck J. Rowley P. Horecker B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 1012-1013Google Scholar). In both cases, the ε-NH2 group of a lysine was involved in the formation of the imine intermediate. More recently, several N-glycosylase/AP lyase DNA repair enzymes have been shown to proceed via Schiff base intermediates; NaBH4 trapping has enabled the identification of bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V-DNA (17Dodson M.L. Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8284-8290Google Scholar), Escherichia coli endonuclease III-DNA (18Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

Antipeptide antisera were generated in rabbits using standard immunization protocols (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

Free [α-32P]ddATP and transferase were separated from the duplexed DNA by passage of the mixture over a Nensorb-20 column as per the supplier's instructions. Column fractions containing the substrate DNA were evaporated to dryness in a Savant SC110 SpeedVac and resuspended in UDG reaction buffer (70 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mMβ-ME). Recovery of DNA from the column was assessed by chromatography of pre- and post-column samples of the kinase mixture on Whatman DE-81 paper with 0.3 M NH4COOH as the solvent. The chromatograph was scanned on a PhosphorImager 450 machine (Molecular Dynamics), and the counts remaining at the origin (i.e. radioactivity associated with labeled substrate) were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Substrate was incubated for 20 min at 37°C with excesses of UDG (0.25 units/pmol uracil) and APE (10-fold molar excess) to sequentially remove uracil from the DNA backbone and then incise the DNA backbone 5′ to the resultant AP site. Due to the inherent instability of preincised AP DNA, trapping experiments were started immediately following preparation of the substrate. Therefore, when called for, pretreatments of β-pol were carried out during the same 20-min interval in which the 49-mer duplex was being incubated with UDG and APE. Pretreatments included: (i) inactivation of intact β-pol or 8-kDa domain by heating at 90°C for 20 min, (ii) exposure of the 8-kDa domain to 150 mM NaBH4 for 20 min on ice, and (iii) preincubation of the 8-kDa domain with pre- or postimmune antiserum against a 32-amino acid peptide for 20 min on ice. For (ii), a highly concentrated stock of 8-kDa domain was used so that the enzyme plus NaBH4 could be diluted 100X into enzyme dilution buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mMβ-ME, 100 µg/ml acetylated BSA) before addition into the trapping reaction ([residual NaBH4 from pretreatment]f = 1.5 mM). Dilutions of untreated β-pol and 8-kDa domain were prepared using the same dilution buffer. Trapping reactions were initiated by the almost simultaneous addition of varying amounts of either intact or 8-kDa β-pol enzyme and either NaBH4 or NaCl into a reaction mixture containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mMβ-ME, 10 mM MgCl2, preincised AP substrate (1.5 ng = 95 fmol of damaged strand DNA), and 125 ng of poly(dI-dC) (80-fold excess (w/w) over damaged strand DNA). In one inhibition experiment, 32-amino acid peptide was present in the reaction mixture at a 4000-fold (1.1 µg = 370 pmol) or a 40,000-fold (11 µg = 3.7 nmol) molar excess over substrate. In another experiment, trapping of the 32-amino acid peptide was attempted in the absence of any intact β-pol or 8-kDa domain. All reactions were allowed to proceed for 60 min at 37°C before they were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer (95% (v/v) formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.02% (w/v) xylene cyanol). The samples were heated for 3 min at 80°C, loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea, and subjected to electrophoresis at 800 V for 3 h. Alternatively, the reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) β-ME, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue). The samples were then heated for 3 min at 95-100°C, loaded onto either 10% (intact β-pol samples) or 15% (8-kDa domain samples) SDS-PAGE gels containing 10% glycerol, and subjected to electrophoresis at 175 V for 5 h. Labeled substrate and substrate-β-pol complexes were visualized by autoradiography of the wet gels with Hyperfilm-MP film (Amersham Corp.) at −70°C, typically for several hours with two DuPont Quanta III intensifying screens enclosed in the cassette. Following development of the films, autoradiographs were overlaid on the gels, and, for SDS-PAGE gels, the positions of the prestained molecular size markers were recorded. In order to obtain quantitative results, the wet gels also were scanned on a PhosphorImager 450 machine and the data analyzed using ImageQuant software. Whether the β-pol protein was intact, truncated in the form of the 8-kDa domain, or complexed to substrate, it was detected by immunoblotting of the SDS-PAGE gels. Specifically, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a Transblot apparatus for 4 h at 290 mA. The membrane was then blocked overnight with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline before being probed with affinity-purified anti-β-pol (1:10,000 dilution). Goat anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:10,000 dilution) served as the secondary antibody and was detected with the ECL chemiluminescence system (DuPont). The nitrocellulose membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the positions of the prestained molecular size markers and the uncomplexed β-pol proteins were noted. As outlined in the Introduction, the dRpase reaction of β-pol is hypothesized to proceed via an imine intermediate. Accordingly, once the α- or the ε-amino group of the active site residue has engaged in a nucleophilic attack on the sugar C-1′ of an AP nucleoside, it should be possible to trap the β-pol-DNA intermediate by reduction with NaBH4. The covalent nature of the resultant complex can be tested by subjecting it to denaturing polyurea gel electrophoresis or SDS-PAGE. Although β-pol can release dRP from both single-stranded and double-stranded substrate, duplexed substrate was chosen as a matter of convenience; human APE incises double-stranded DNA more efficiently than single-stranded DNA. Magnesium was included in the reaction buffer to ensure that the 8-kDa domain would be able to bind to double-stranded DNA with a gap of only one nucleotide (24Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Google Scholar, 1Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Google Scholar). Upon exposure to NaBH4 but not NaCl, β-pol (Mr = 39,000) was expected to be bound covalently to the 3′-labeled 28-mer (Mr = 9,000) produced by sequential UDG and APE treatments of 3′-labeled 49-mer containing uracil at position 21. Indeed, polyurea gel electrophoresis revealed a slow-migrating band (Fig. 1A, lane 4), presumably the covalent β-pol-DNA complex. In order to determine the molecular mass of the presumed intact β-pol-DNA complex and to identify it via immunoblotting, a more extensive version of the same experiment was carried out using SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1 (B and C) shows the autoradiograph and the corresponding immunoblot from SDS-PAGE trapping experiments on intact β-pol, respectively. As predicted, the most prominent product band on the autoradiograph migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa (39,000 + 9,000 = 48,000). This complex, highlighted by asterisks, was easily identified by its immunoreactive and radioactive properties. Minor bands at 62 and 67 kDa on the autoradiograph also had counterparts on the immunoblot. Since SDS-PAGE does not necessarily denature DNA, these bands probably corresponded to complexes of (β-pol + 28-mer + 49-mer) (calculated Mr = 64,000) and (β-pol + 28-mer + 49-mer + 20-mer) (calculated Mr = 71,000). They would not have been observed in Fig. 1A because polyurea electrophoresis completely denatures DNA. Unlabeled 20-mer would have been produced along with the labeled 28-mer during the APE preincision reaction. Secondary enzyme-DNA complexes and β-pol breakdown products were not observed when less β-pol was introduced into the reactions (data not shown), and heat inactivation of β-pol completely eliminated the formation of covalent complexes (lane 5). Finally, there was no evidence to indicate that any of the protein-DNA complexes were derived in whole or in part from APE (Mr = 30,000), UDG (Mr = 26,000), or contaminating bacterial dRpases (RecJ Mr = 60,000, Fpg Mr = 30,000). Analogous to intact β-pol, 8-kDa domain was expected to be bound covalently to the 3′-labeled 28-mer (Mr = 9,000) by NaBH4 reduction of an imine intermediate. A single product did survive polyurea gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A, lane 4) and possessed a mobility in between that of the 28-mer substrate and the intact β-pol product seen in Fig. 1A (Figs. 1A and 2A were derived from the same gel). Fig. 2 (B and C) shows the autoradiograph and the corresponding immunoblot from trapping experiments on the 8-kDa domain of β-pol, respectively. The primary product band on the autoradiograph migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 17 kDa (8,000 + 9,000 = 17,000). This product, highlighted by asterisks, was both immunoreactive and radioactive. Again, a protein doublet appeared on the autoradiograph, but this time it accounted for 50% of the complexed protein. The protein pair was not detected on the immunoblot shown in panel C but was seen on other occasions. With observed molecular masses of 30 and 37 kDa, the secondary bands probably corresponded to complexes of (8-kDa domain + 28-mer + 49-mer) (calculated Mr = 33,000) and (8-kDa domain + 28-mer + 49-mer + 20-mer) (calculated Mr = 40,000). Importantly, as demonstrated in lanes 7 and 8, NaBH4 trapping occurred in a substrate-dependent manner. Pre-exposure of the 8-kDa domain to NaBH4 failed to significantly reduce the enzyme's ability to become trapped to substrate upon re-exposure to NaBH4. As illustrated by the amounts of free versus complexed β-pol or 8-kDa domain that were transferred to the Western blots (compare arrows versus asterisks on panel C in Fig. 1, Fig. 2), only a small fraction of either protein was trapped. Although autoradiography was adequate to detect β-pol-DNA complexes when substrate was incubated with as little as a 20-fold molar excess of β-pol, immunodetection became extremely difficult (data not shown). PhosphorImager/ImageQuant analysis of the polyurea gel shown in Fig. 1A revealed that NaBH4 mediated the incorporation of 0.9 ng of the intact β-pol (23 fmol, approximately 0.04% of the protein) into enzyme-DNA complexes. In Fig. 1B, the 49-kDa bands in lanes 4 and 7 contained 0.5 ng (13 fmol) and 0.6 ng (15 fmol) of intact β-pol, respectively. Overall, <0.09% of the β-pol protein in lane 4 or <0.04% of the β-pol protein in lane 7 was trapped in the form of a 49-, 62-, or 67-kDa complex. In Fig. 2A, 0.1 ng of the 8-kDa domain (18 fmol, approximately 0.03% of the protein) was incorporated into enzyme-DNA complexes. More clearly than Fig. 1B, Fig. 2B demonstrates quantitative trapping of β-pol protein: 0.02 ng (2.3 fmol) and 0.07 ng (8.8 fmol) of the 16-kDa product were trapped with 150- and 600-fold molar excesses of enzyme over substrate, respectively. Overall, <0.03% of the 8-kDa domain protein in lanes 4 or 7 was trapped in the form of a 16-, 30-, or 37-kDa complex. A comprehensive comparison of the quantitative results from Fig. 1, Fig. 2 suggests that intact β-pol was trapped somewhat more readily than the 8-kDa domain. Reproducible trapping of the β-pol-DNA and 8-kDa domain-DNA complexes was accomplished by rigorous adherence to the protocols outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Pilot studies established that our substrate preparation achieved complete conversion of the duplex 49-mer to the intended product. When preincised AP DNA was run on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea, it co-migrated as expected with a 28-mer oligonucleotide sizing marker (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2, panel A, lanes 1 and 2). On SDS-PAGE gels, the uracil-containing 49-mer, AP-containing 49-mer, and preincised AP 28-mer DNAs could be distinguished from each other because each ran as a distinct series of bands. The complex banding patterns varied slightly from gel to gel and were influenced by several factors: the polyacrylamide and glycerol contents of the gels, the type (NaCl versus NaBH4) and concentration of salt in the samples, and the presence or absence of poly(dI-dC). The most critical element of the experimental design proved to be the order in which the reaction components were combined. Since β-pol cannot liberate dRP from reduced AP sites (1Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Google Scholar), a form of AP site that is resistant to β-elimination, NaBH4 was added into the reaction mixture last. Preliminary experiments had indicated that 150 mM NaBH4 could reduce virtually all of the reaction substrate in under 1 min. Pre-NaBH4 exposure of the substrate to even a 20-fold molar excess of enzyme was also problematic. During even a 1- or 2-min lag period between the introductions of β-pol enzyme and NaBH4, enough substrate was consumed to prevent the formation of any β-pol-DNA complexes. Thus, there exists a very short time frame in which trapping of the β-pol-DNA complexes can occur. A 32-amino acid peptide that corresponds to β-pol residues 27-58 served as a tool to probe the potential role of helix-2 in catalysis. Historically, this region of the protein (originally generated by proteolysis of the 8-kDa domain with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease) has been studied for its single-stranded DNA-binding properties (22Prasad R. Kumar A. Widen S.G. Casas-Finet J.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Google Scholar). Three variations on the NaBH4 trapping experiment were attempted: (i) inhibition by the peptide of 8-kDa domain-DNA complex formation, (ii) inhibition by antipeptide antisera of 8-kDa domain-DNA complex formation, and (iii) trapping of a peptide-DNA complex (data not shown). In (i), peptide was allowed to prebind to the substrate prior to the addition of 8-kDa domain and NaBH4 to the reaction mixture. However, this treatment did not interfere with trapping. In (ii), 8-kDa domain was preincubated with pre- or postimmune antiserum before it was added into the trapping reaction. Preincubation of the enzyme with post- versus preimmune antiserum reduced the level of 8-kDa domain-DNA trapping by 1%. In (iii), trapping reactions were started by the addition of varying amounts of peptide in place of β-pol and either NaBH4 or NaCl. A covalent complex was not seen at the predicted 12-kDa position. Presented with these generally negative results, it appears unlikely that the active site residue for the β-pol dRP excision reaction resides within helix-2 or its adjacent loop segments. In summary, this report has shown that the dRpase reaction of rat β-pol proceeds via an imine intermediate. This intermediate arises when the nitrogen atom of a primary amine forms a bond with the C-1′ atom of an AP nucleoside. Our results would tend to support the recent finding of Matsumoto and Kim (1Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Google Scholar) that the 8-kDa domain of β-pol is necessary and sufficient to release 5′-deoxyribose phosphate termini from preincised AP DNA. The 8-kDa domain contains 15 lysine residues at the following amino acid positions: 3, 5, 27, 35, 41, 48, 52, 54, 60, 61, 68, 72, 81, 84, and 87. Six of these lysines (at positions 27, 35, 41, 48, 52, and 54) are located within helix-2 or its adjacent loops and can probably be eliminated as serious candidates for the active site role. A new crystal structure of human DNA β-pol complexed to gapped DNA shows Lys-35, Lys-68, Lys-72, and Lys-84 clustered around the 5′-phosphate at the upstream end of the gap (25Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Given this finding and the knowledge that pyridoxal 5′-phosphate modification of K72 inactivates the DNA synthesis function of β-pol (26Basu A. Kedar P. Wilson S.H. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6305-6309Google Scholar), preliminary work was carried out on the K72A mutant of β-pol. As assayed by a shift in mobility of the labeled substrate, the mutant seemed unable to release dRP from preincised AP DNA. 3P. Strauss, unpublished observation. K72A could be trapped on the substrate, however, albeit to a lesser extent (≈30%) than wild-type β-pol (data not shown). These results were not definitive because if K72 truly acts as the catalytic nucleophile, substitution of lysine with an alanine would be predicted to completely inactive the enzyme. Perhaps another residue substituted for K72, or the conformation of the mutant was altered to such an extent that the dRpase activity had been compromised. Alternatively, instead of the ε-amino group of a lysine residue, the α-amino group of the amino terminus may catalyze the dRpase reaction. Precedent for this mechanism exists; two N-glycosylase/AP lyase enzymes, T4 bacteriophage endonuclease V (17Dodson M.L. Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8284-8290Google Scholar, 21Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 880-886Google Scholar, 27Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

Verdine, personal communication. employ their amino-terminal α-NH2 to form isolatable, enzyme-DNA intermediates. Clearly, further study will be required to identify the active site residue that catalyzes the dRP excision reaction of β-pol. We thank Dr. M. L.

https://openalex.org/W1970780414,"Interferon (IFN)-γ induces the expression of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (INDO) gene in human cells, which plays a role in the inhibitory effect of IFN-γ on intracellular pathogens and on cell proliferation. Earlier studies established that the IFN-γ-inducible expression of the INDO gene was dependent on two upstream elements: (i) a 14-base pair sequence homologous to an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) sequence found in IFN-α-inducible genes and (ii) a 9-base pair palindromic sequence (palindromic element (PE) II) homologous to an interferon-γ-activated site (GAS) element found in IFN-γ-inducible genes. A second GAS element (PE I), between ISRE and PE II, was ineffective in supporting a response to IFN-γ. Studies were carried out to determine the distinction between the two GAS elements and the relative role of the two elements (ISRE and PE II) required for a response to IFN-γ. The PE I element was able to form a complex with IFN-γ-activated p91 (STAT1) factor but with lower efficiency than the complex formed with PE II sequence. However, switching the positions of PE I and II sequences in reporter plasmid constructs (containing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene) showed that both PE I and PE II were able to support a response to IFN-γ if located at the position of PE II but not at the position of PE I. Increasing the distance between the ISRE and PE II also affected the level of response, suggesting that the relative position of the two elements is important for optimal stimulus. To explore whether an interaction between the IFN-γ-regulated factors (IRF-1 and p91) binding to the ISRE and PE II might be important, we tested whether the ISRE sequence could be replaced by another response element, NF-κB. The plasmid construct with NF-κB element in place of the ISRE was responsive to IFN-γ, indicating that an interaction between the IRF-1 and p91 factors was not required. The results indicate that the response of INDO gene to IFN-γ depends on a cooperative role of IFN-γ-responsive factors binding to the ISRE and GAS elements."

L-AP4-sensitive, but not insensitive, cells responded to a brief tetanus with a sustained potentiation in the synaptic responses. The induction of this LTP appeared identical to that observed in hippocampal mossy fiber synapses in situ, in that it required a rise in presynaptic Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase A. Its expression also appeared to be presynaptic and was due, at least in part, to events that occurred after the entry of Ca2+ and to the switching on of previously silent release sites."

https://openalex.org/W2013683059,"In adult ferrets, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) responsive to increased (On) or decreased (Off) illumination convey information to different cellular layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). These dLGN sublaminae emerge during development when RGCs are found to undergo correlated spontaneous bursting activity. Using Ca2+ imaging and intracellular dye-filling techniques, we demonstrate here that in ferret neonates, morphologically identified On and Off beta RGCs have similar burst frequencies prior to the segregation of their inputs in the dLGN, but during the segregation period, they develop distinct burst frequencies. Although the bursts of On cells and Off cells occur synchronously, On cells burst only 25%-35% of the time that Off cells do. This change in the temporal bursting patterns of On and Off RGCs may underlie the segregation of their inputs on dLGN neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2026041941,"Vertebrate myelin contains two proteins that mediate compaction: protein zero (P0), an immunoglobulin gene superfamily member, or proteolipid proteins, 4-hydrophobic domain–motif proteins biogenetically unrelated to P0. The prevailing view has been that expression of P0 and proteolipid proteins is mutually exclusive; P0, which mediates myelin compaction in fish, is thought to be completely replaced by the newer proteolipid proteins in the terrestrial vertebrate CNS. However, we now find that proteolipid proteins are actually major myelin constituents in bony fish and amphibia, and so are coexpressed with P0. Clearly, myelin proteolipids are not new additions to the myelin protein repertoire, but instead were ancestral sheath components, expressed ∼440 million years ago in the first myelinated fish that existed at least ∼100 million years before the origin of amphibians. In conclusion, P0 and the proteolipid proteins are evolving in parallel in myelinating cells of most vertebrate species."
https://openalex.org/W1991167580,"For in vitro LTD to remain viable as a model for synaptic weakening in visual cortical plasticity, it is crucial that it display a critical period for its induction within layer IV. A complicating factor, however, is that LTD in layer IV is modulated by inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs); postsynaptic responses characterized as containing IPSPs do not depress in response to 1 Hz afferent stimulation. By blocking IPSPs intracellularly, we find that the ability to induce LTD in layer IV neurons is restored in juvenile, but not in mature animals. This developmental down-regulation of LTD induction is specific for layer IV when compared with LTD induction in layers II/III. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that an LTD-like phenomenon is involved in critical period plasticity and is apparently independent of developmental changes in inhibitory circuitry."

Although much attention has been devoted to the tyrosine kinases involved in Stat activation, the role of tyrosine phosphatases in IFNα/β signal transduction is less understood. Evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that tyrosine phosphatases can act as positive as well as negative regulators of the IFNα/β-induced Jak/Stat pathway (17David M. Romero G. Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6593-6599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Igarashi K. David M. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell.

Recently, we were able to demonstrate that the SH2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase PTP1C (SHPTP1, HCP, or SHP) functions as a suppressor of IFNα/β signal transduction in hematopoietic cells by specific down-modulation of Jak1 tyrosine phosphorylation (23David M. Chen H.E. Goelz S. Larner A.C. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7050-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Studies of Stat activation by IFNα/β in cell homogenates provided evidence that a tyrosine phosphatase is also required to initiate signal transduction (17David M. Romero G. Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6593-6599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IFNα/β-induced formation of ISGF3 could be inhibited if the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate was added to a cell membrane fraction prior to IFNα/β. However, if vanadate was added a few minutes after IFNβ, then no inhibition of ISGF3 formation was observed. In contrast, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein was able to abolish Stat activation when added either before or after IFN. These results suggested that a tyrosine phosphatase activity was required to initiate the signaling cascade but not to maintain its activity. Several reports have implicated the SH2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase PTP1D as a positive (signal-enhancing) mediator of growth factor signaling (24Rivardi N. McKenzie F.R. Brondello J.

PTP1D, also known as SHPTP2, PTP2C, and Syp, is ubiquitously expressed as is the homologue in Drosophila, csw (28Freeman R.M. Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PTP1D is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation of appropriate cells with the growth factors (31Lechleider R.J. Robert M. Freeman J. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13434-13438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an event that has been shown to lead to the activation of the enzyme (32Feng G.-S. Hui C.-C. Pawson T.

We therefore wanted to explore the possible involvement of PTP1D in the regulation of the IFNα/β-induced Jak/Stat pathway. U266 cells were grown as a suspension culture in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (UBI). Primary human diploid fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum. After treatment, cells were diluted with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4°C, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 10 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mM vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (all from Sigma). For some experiments, 1% digitonin was substituted for Triton X-100. The lysate was vortexed, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h prior to the addition of Protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and incubation for an additional hour. All antibodies used for immunoprecipitation have been described (12David M. Petricoin III, E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C.

In either case, the beads were pelleted at 15,000 × g for 2 min and washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer (1 ml) (12David M. Petricoin III, E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 4–16% SDS-PAGE gels (Novex) and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore). Membranes were probed with monoclonal antibodies against PTP1D (Transduction Laboratories) or the α-chain of the IFNα/β receptor (generously provided by Susan Goelz and Christopher Benjamin) or phosphotyrosine (PY20, ICN) using concentrations and conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Immunoblots were developed using appropriate secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). Phagemid pBluescript SK-PTP1D was obtained by screening a λZAP human fetal brain cDNA library. Single-stranded DNA of pBluescript SK-PTP1D was made from an Escherichia coli strain CJ236 and used for site-directed mutagenesis (Muta-Gene In Vitro Mutagenesis Kit, Bio-Rad). The BamHI and HindIII fragments encoding human PTP1D and PTP1D (Cys459→ Ser) were cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector pCMV5 digested with BglII and HindIII to generate pCMV5-PTP1D and pCMV5-PTP1D (Cys → Ser), respectively. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to construct pCMV5-PTP1D (N-SH2) and pCMV5-PTP1D (C-SH2). The PCR primers for PTP1D (N-SH2) were 5′-AACTATGACATCGCGGAGATGGTTTC and 5′-GTCATTACC-TTTCAGAGGTAGG. The PCR primers for PTP1D (C-SH2) were 5′-AACT-GCAGATCCTACCTCTG and 5′-GTCGTTATTTGACTTT-ATCTGTGGTC. The underlined BamHI and EcoRI sites were used for cloning the PCR product. The EcoRI fragments encoding PTP1C and PTP1C (Cys → Ser) were cloned into the pCMV5 EcoRI site to generate pCMV5-PTP1C and pCMV5-PTP1C (Cys → Ser), respectively. Primary human fibroblasts were transfected as described with an ISRE derived from the interferon-stimulated responsive gene ISG15 linked to a thymidine kinase minimal promoter-luciferase reporter. In addition to the reporter construct, plasmids containing cDNAs corresponding to either a phosphatase-inactive PTP1C or PTP1D or the NH2- or COOH-terminal SH2 domains of PTP1D were cotransfected. These plasmids all contained a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. To normalize for DNA in the transfection, a CMV-driven β-galactosidase cDNA was included when the PTP1D plasmids were not present. Twenty hours after transfection, IFNβ (103 units/ml) was added to the cells for 6 h before preparation of cell lysates and assay of luciferase activity. We had previously noted that the initiation of Stat activation by either IFNα/β or IFNγ in an in vitro signaling system requires the catalytic activity of a tyrosine phosphatase (17David M. Romero G. Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6593-6599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Igarashi K. David M. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1634-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase PTP1D has been implicated as a positive regulator of mitogenic responses in many growth factor signal transduction pathways (24Rivardi N. McKenzie F.R. Brondello J. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Xiao S. Rose D.W. Sasaoka T. Maegawa H. Burke Jr., T.R. Roller P.P. Shoelson S.E. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21244-21248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its involvement in cytokine receptor signaling had remained unclear. We therefore wanted to investigate whether the tyrosine phosphatase required for signal transduction through Stat proteins was PTP1D. In order to determine whether PTP1D would associate with the IFNα/β receptor, affinity precipitations were performed using lysates derived from untreated or IFNβ-treated U266 cells. GST-fusion proteins containing either the entire 100-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of the α-subunit of the IFNα/β receptor, or the 50-amino acid membrane-proximal or the 50-amino acid carboxyl-terminal region were bound to glutathione agarose and incubated with the cell lysates for 2–12 h. Bound proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon, and the membrane was probed with a monoclonal antibody against PTP1D. PTP1D was found to associate with GST fusion proteins representing either the entire cytoplasmic domain of the IFNα/β receptor or the membrane-proximal 50-amino acid region (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6), but did not bind to the construct containing the carboxyl-terminal 50 amino acids (lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, the binding of PTP1D to the GST fusion proteins occurred whether or not cells were incubated with IFNβ prior to preparation of the lysates. To confirm the association of PTP1D with the IFNα/β receptor, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed using a monoclonal antibody directed against the α-subunit of the receptor. As observed in the affinity precipitations with the GST fusion proteins, PTP1D associated independently of IFN stimulation with the IFNα/β receptor (Fig. 1). PTP1D has been shown to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to treatment of cells with various growth factors, which correlates with an increase in its enzymatic activity (32Feng G.-S. Hui C.-C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 33Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To investigate whether treatment of cells with IFN would also result in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1D, we performed antiphosphotyrosine blots on immunoprecipitated PTP1D. As shown in Fig. 2, although a basal tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1D was detected, this phosphorylation increased as a consequence of IFN stimulation (lane 1 versus 2). The fact that an association between PTP1D and the IFNα/β receptor was detected, and it became tyrosine-phosphorylated as a consequence of IFNα/β treatment, suggested that the phosphatase might regulate the activation of the Jak/Stat pathway. To examine the role of PTP1D in IFN induction of early response genes requiring activation of the Jak-Stat pathway, we used transient transfection assays to determine whether expression of catalytically inactive, dominant negative PTP1D affected IFNβ activation of a luciferase reporter containing the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) (Fig. 3). These experiments were done with primary human fibroblasts since U266 cells could not be efficiently transfected. Fibroblasts were either transfected with the luciferase construct alone or with plasmids encoding either a PTP1D with a cysteine to serine mutation in the catalytic domain rendering the protein phosphatase-inactive, or the NH2-terminal or the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of PTP1D. A vector corresponding to PTP1C with the same cysteine to serine mutation as in PTP1D was also used as a control for specificity. After transfection, fibroblasts were incubated with or without IFNβ for 5 h, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was assayed. IFNβ consistently stimulated a 6- to 7-fold increase in luciferase activity in cells transfected with the ISRE-containing luciferase reporter. Expression of the phosphatase-inactive PTP1D as well as the COOH-terminal SH2-domain resulted in a 50–60% decrease in IFNβ-induced luciferase activity, whereas expression of the NH2-terminal SH2 domain or a dominant negative PTP1C was without effect. Similar results were obtained when a luciferase reporter construct with a GRR enhancer was used (data not shown). Thus, it appears that PTP1D can function as a positive regulator of IFNα/β stimulation of early response genes that require activation of the Stat transcription factors. In summary, our results indicate that induction by IFNα/β of early response genes through Stat binding enhancers requires the catalytic activity of PTP1D. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this SH2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase is constitutively associated with the IFNα/β receptor and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to ligand binding. PTP1D has been established as a positive regulator of several growth factor-activated signal transduction pathways which are believed to ultimately cause mitogenesis and to bind to the corresponding receptors by interacting with specific receptor tyrosine phosphorylation sites via its SH2 domains (31Lechleider R.J. Robert M. Freeman J. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13434-13438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lechleider R.J. Sugimoto S. Bennett A.M. Kashishian A.S. Cooper J.A. Shoelson S.E. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21478-21481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the case of the IFNα/β receptor, PTP1D was found to associate even with the unphosphorylated receptor or with a GST fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic region of the IFNα/β receptor, suggesting that mechanisms other then phosphotyrosine/SH2 domain interaction can account for PTP1D binding to a receptor. Whether the interaction is direct or involves intermediate docking proteins remains to be clarified. The target proteins that become dephosphorylated by PTP1D also remain unclear. With respect to the activation of the Jak/Stat pathway by IFNα/β, we suspect that Tyk2 is a possible target of PTP1D as we and others consistently observed this member of the Jak family of tyrosine kinases to be constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated (34Colamonici O.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3518-3522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that Tyk2 becomes activated via a similar mechanism as Src-like tyrosine kinases, namely by undergoing dephosphorylation of an inhibitory phosphotyrosine residue. Experiments to identify the site of basal Tyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation and to determine whether this site is indeed the target for PTP1D are currently in progress. We would like to thank Oscar Colamonici for generously providing the GST fusion protein constructs of the IFNα/β receptor, as well as Susan Goelz and Christopher Benjamin for supplying antibodies to the IFNα/β receptor."

Cell surface biotinylation using an impermeant biotinylating reagent confirmed the immunocytochemistry results. Thus, SERT and NET in MDCK cells were labeled more efficiently from the basolateral medium than the apical medium, and DAT in MDCK cells was labeled more efficiently from the apical side than the basolateral side. Transport measurements in transfected MDCK cells agreed with the immunocytochemistry and biotinylation results.

The neuronal plasma membrane is traditionally divided into axolemmal and somatodendritic domains, while that of epithelial cells is divided into apical and basolateral domains. Dotti and Simons (11Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Google Scholar) showed that some viral glycoproteins were sorted preferentially in both virally infected neurons and epithelial cells, and that those proteins that are sorted to the apical or basolateral membranes of infected epithelial cells were found, respectively, in axons or dendrites of infected neurons. Moreover, Thy-1, a GPI-linked protein which is delivered to the apical membranes of epithelial cells, was reported to be exclusively located on the axonal surface of cultured hippocampal neurons (12Dotti C.G. Parton R.G. Simons K. Nature. 1991; 349: 158-161Google Scholar). Therefore, they proposed that the sorting mechanisms in neurons and epithelial cells share common features and that the same mechanisms responsible for axonal targeting in neurons may result in apical sorting in epithelial cells (11Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Google Scholar, 12Dotti C.G. Parton R.G. Simons K. Nature. 1991; 349: 158-161Google Scholar). Because neurotransmitter transporters are known to be sorted to axons, we have used them to test the proposal that similar mechanisms mediate sorting in neuronal and epithelial cells. We observed that the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter GAT-1, which is known to be axonal in neurons (13Radian R. Ottersen O. Stormmathisen J. Castel M. Kanner B. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1319-1330Google Scholar), was sorted to the apical membranes of MDCK cells (14Pietrini G. Suh Y.J. Edelmann L. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 4668-4674Google Scholar), while a homologous non-neuronal protein, the betaine transporter expressed in kidney (15Yamauchi A. Kwon H.M. Uchida S. Preston A.S. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F197-F202Google Scholar), was sorted to the basolateral membranes. Recently, we examined the sorting behaviors of two isoforms of GABA transporters, GAT-2 and GAT-3 (16Ahn J. Mundigl O. Muth T.R. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6917-6924Google Scholar). GAT-3, like GAT-1, is expressed in brain and retina and is expected to be exclusively neuronal and involved in GABA reuptake, but GAT-2 mRNA is found also in liver and kidney, and might not function in neurotransmitter reuptake (17Borden L. Smith K. Hartig P. Branchek T. Weinshank R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21098-21104Google Scholar). Expression of these two transporters in MDCK cells led to apical localization of GAT-3 and basolateral localization of GAT-2 (16Ahn J. Mundigl O. Muth T.R. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6917-6924Google Scholar). Therefore, data from GABA transporter expression were consistent with a common sorting mechanism in neurons and epithelial cells. Recently, the β-amyloid precursor protein has been shown to be sorted to and secreted from the basolateral membranes of MDCK cells despite its axonal localization in neurons (18Haass C. Koo E. Teplow D. Selkoe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1564-1568Google Scholar). In light of this result with a secreted protein and the relatively limited amount of data on sorting in neuronal versus epithelial cells, we examined the sorting behavior of three biogenic amine transporters, the human norepinephrine transporter (NET), the rat serotonin transporter (SERT), and the human and rat dopamine transporters (DAT), in epithelial cells. Biogenic amine transporters are targeted to the axonal domain of neuronal plasma membranes. Thus, the transporters have been localized by ligand binding (19De Souza E. Kuyatt B. Synapse. 1987; 1: 488-496Google Scholar, 20Tejani-Butt S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 260: 427-436Google Scholar, 21Richfield E. Brain Res. 1991; 540: 1-13Google Scholar, 22Little K. Kirkman J. Carroll F. Breese G. Duncan G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1996-2006Google Scholar) and immunocytochemistry (23Qian Y. Melikian H. Rye D. Levey A. Blakely R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1261-1274Google Scholar, 24Ciliax B. Heilman C. Demchyshyn L. Pristupa Z. Ince E. Hersch S. Niznik H. Levey A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1714-1723Google Scholar) to brain regions quite distant from the cell bodies where they are synthesized. Immunoreactivity and binding activity are also observed in cell bodies of these monoaminergic neurons, but are likely to represent intracellular biosynthetic precursor forms of the mature axonal transporters. Recent electron microscopic evidence supports the idea that the DA transporter is absent from cell bodies, but also provides evidence for DAT near sites of dendritic DA release (25Hersch S. Yi H. Ciliax B. Levey A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1995; 21: 781Google Scholar, 26Nirenberg M.J. Vaughan R.A. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J. Pickel V.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 436-447Google Scholar). Although many studies have supported dendritic release and transport of amines in the nervous system (27Cheramy A. Leviel V. Glowinski J. Nature. 1981; 289: 537-542Google Scholar, 28Geffen L. Jessell T. Cuello A. Iversen L. Nature. 1976; 260: 258-260Google Scholar), quantitatively, most of the transporter protein is believed to be localized to axonal varicosities and synaptic terminals (23Qian Y. Melikian H. Rye D. Levey A. Blakely R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1261-1274Google Scholar, 24Ciliax B. Heilman C. Demchyshyn L. Pristupa Z. Ince E. Hersch S. Niznik H. Levey A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1714-1723Google Scholar). Based on the proposal of Dotti and Simons (11Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Google Scholar), these transporters would be expected to be sorted to the apical membranes of epithelial cells as we observed for the GABA transporters GAT-1 and GAT-3. However, the current study shows that NET and SERT are sorted primarily to the basolateral domain of epithelial plasma membranes (in both MDCK and LLC-PK1 cell lines). In contrast, DAT is sorted to the apical membranes of MDCK cells and the basolateral membranes of LLC-PK1 cells. LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin transporters (LLC-DAT, LLC-NET, and LLC-SERT) were previously generated in this laboratory (29Gu H. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7124-7130Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the rat DA transporter was a generous gift from Dr. George Uhl, NIDA Addiction Research Center, Baltimore, MD. Human DAT was kindly supplied by Dr. Aaron Janowsky, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR. NET cDNA, encoding the human NE transporter, was graciously supplied by Dr. Susan Amara, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR. SERT cDNA, coding for the rat 5-HT transporter, was kindly contributed by Dr. Beth Hoffman, NIMH, Bethesda, MD. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-sera N430, CT2B, and mouse monoclonal antibody 6H, recognizing human NE transporter, rat serotonin transporter, and the Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit, respectively, were described elsewhere (23Qian Y. Melikian H. Rye D. Levey A. Blakely R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1261-1274Google Scholar, 30Melikian H. McDonald J. Gu H. Rudnick G. Moore K. Blakely R. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 8414-8418Google Scholar). Purified antibody against human DAT is described in a separate publication. 2Hersch, S. M., Yi, H., Heilman, C. J., Edwards, R. H., and Levey, A. I. (1996) Neuron, in press. Vector pRC/CMV was from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Radiolabeled substrates 3,4-[7-3H]-dihydroxyphenylethylamine (DA), 5-[1,2-3H]-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and N-methyl-4-[methyl-3H]phenylpyridinium (MPP+) were purchased from DuPont NEN Research Products. PNGase F was purchased from New England Biolabs. All other reagents were purchased from commercial sources. The parental LLC-PK1 cells were maintained in α modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mML-glutamine at 37°C, 5% CO2. The transfected LLC-PK1 cell lines were maintained in the same medium except that G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added at a concentration of 1.8 g/L. The MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mML-glutamine at 37°C, 5% CO2. The MDCK cell lines expressing transporters were maintained in the same medium plus 0.9 g/L G418. cDNAs encoding the transporters were subcloned into vector pRC/CMV which has a bacteriophage T7 promoter sequence and enhancer/promoter sequences from the immediate early gene of human cytomegalovirus (CMV). The pRC/CMV vectors carrying the neomycin-resistant gene for selection and the transporter cDNAs were used to generate clonal LLC-PK1 cell lines expressing DAT, NET, or SERT (LLC-DAT, LLC-NET, and LLC-SERT) as described elsewhere (29Gu H. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7124-7130Google Scholar). Using a similar procedure, we transfected MDCK cells with the same plasmids. After selection in 0.9 g/L G418 for 10-15 days, single colonies were picked with cloning cylinders and tested for transport activities. The MDCK cell lines stably expressing DAT, NET, and SERT are termed MDCK-DAT, MDCK-NET, and MDCK-SERT. Parental or transfected LLC-PK1 or MDCK cells were plated at 50% confluence on Transwell tissue culture inserts (0.4-µm filter pore size, Costar Co., Cambridge, MA) and grown for 7 days. Cells were then rinsed with PBS (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) plus 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM CaCl2 (PBS/Mg/Ca), fixed for 10 min in methanol, and stored in PBS at 4°C. After rehydration for 5 min in PBS/Mg/Ca, the cells were permeabilized for 15 min in PBS/Mg/Ca plus 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (permeabilization buffer) and blocked for 30 min in GSDB buffer (16% goat serum (Sigma), 0.3% Triton X-100, 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.45 M NaCl). The cells were then incubated for 1 h in GSDB with anti-transporter antibodies (rat anti-DAT, 1:200 dilution; rabbit anti-NET (N430), 5 µg/ml; or rabbit anti-SERT (CT2B), 5 µg/ml) and anti-Na+/K+-ATPase α subunit antibodies (6H, mouse), 1:100 dilution. After three 5-min washes with permeabilization buffer, goat anti-rat, anti-rabbit, or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with fluorescent dyes (FITC, rhodamine, or Texas Red, Sigma) were added to the cells at 1:100 dilution and incubated for 1 h. Different dyes were used for staining the transporters and the Na+/K+-ATPase α subunit as described in each figure legend, so that they could be distinguished during microscopy. At the end of the incubation, the cells were again washed three times with permeabilization buffer and once with 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, for 5 min. The cells on filters were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence was observed and photographed with a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence photomicroscope. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope. Confocal images were line averaged eight times. Contrast and brightness settings were chosen to ensure that all pixels were within the linear range. Confocal X-Z cross sections were generated using a 0.2-µm motor step. Cells were plated at 50% confluence on 0.4-µm pore size 6.5-mm Transwell cell culture filter inserts and grown for 7 days. A cell monolayer growing on the porous membrane of the cell culture filter insert effectively separates each well in the cell culture plate into two chambers. The apical membranes of epithelial cells plated on these filters faces the chamber above the cells and the basolateral membranes face the lower chamber through the filter. After one wash each of the apical (upper chamber) and basolateral (lower chamber) sides of the monolayer with PBS/Ca/Mg, the cells were incubated in PBS/Ca/Mg containing 3H-labeled substrate either in the upper or the lower chamber at 22°C. At the end of the incubation cells were washed either three times from the apical side and once from the basolateral side (when 3H-labeled substrate was present in the upper chamber) or once from the apical side and three times from the basolateral side (when substrate was present in the lower chamber). The apical side of the cells were washed by adding 0.2 ml of ice-cold PBS to the upper chamber and aspirating. The basolateral side of the cells were washed by pipetting ice-cold PBS over the bottoms of the filter inserts. After the washes, the filters with cells attached were excised from the insert cups, submerged in 3 ml of Optifluor scintillation fluid (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, IL), and counted in a Beckman LS-3801 liquid scintillation counter. Transport assays on 48-well plates were described previously (29Gu H. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7124-7130Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 50% confluence on 0.4-µm pore size 25-mm Transwell cell culture filter inserts for 6-well plates and grown for 7 days. After two washes with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS/Ca/Mg, the surface proteins of either the apical or the basolateral domains of cell plasma membrane were biotinylated (35Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M. Graeve L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 107: 277-286Google Scholar) by exposing that side of cell monolayer to 1 ml of NHS-ss-biotin (Pierce) (1.5 mg/ml in 10 mM triethanolamine adjusted to pH 9.0 with HCl, containing 2 mM CaCl2 and 150 mM NaCl) for 20 min on ice. The biotinylation process was repeated with a fresh addition of NHS-ss-biotin solution. Cells were then washed with 2 ml of PBS/Ca/Mg plus 100 mM glycine and incubated in the same solution for 20 min on ice to make sure all the biotinylation reagent was quenched. After two more washes with PBS/Ca/Mg, filters were excised and cells were lysed with 1 ml lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5) for one hour on ice. The cell lysates were clarified by sedimentation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Biotinylated proteins were recovered by adding one half volume of a 50% slurry of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) to a portion of the cell lysates and incubating overnight with gentle agitation at 4°C. After three washes with 1 ml of lysis buffer, two washes with 1 ml of high ionic strength buffer (500 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5) and one wash with 1 ml of low ionic strength buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5), the proteins bound to the beads were eluted by boiling 5 min in an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Biotrace NT, Gelman Sciences). The filters were then probed with antibodies recognizing the transporter proteins (1:200 dilution for anti-DAT and 1 µg/ml for N430 and CT2B) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). The films were then quantitated with a Digital Imaging System model IS-1000 from Alpha-Innotech Corporation. We previously reported the stable expression and characterization of DAT, NET, and SERT in the LLC-PK1 cell line which is derived from pig kidney and resembles proximal tubules (29Gu H. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7124-7130Google Scholar). These cells grow in a polarized fashion, with distinct apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains. MDCK cells, which are derived from canine kidney and resemble distal tubules, were also transfected with transporter cDNAs carried in the vector pRC/CMV using the same procedure as used previously with LLC-PK1 cells (29Gu H. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7124-7130Google Scholar). The transfected MDCK cells demonstrated cocaine-sensitive biogenic amine transport similar to LLC-PK1 cells transfected with the same cDNA. Table I lists the kinetic parameters for DA and MPP+ uptake by MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells transfected with human DAT cDNA.Table IKinetic parameters determined for MDCK-DAT and LLC-DAT with DA or MPP+ as substratesTransporterSubstrateKmVmaxDAMPP+DAMPP+µMpmol/min/mg proteinMDCK-DAT3.5 ±0.411.3 ±0.80.47 ±0.020.24 ±0.08LLC-DAT4.3 ±0.59.0 ±0.10.50 ±0.20.49 ±0.01 Open table in a new tab To study the sorting properties of biogenic amine transporters in these epithelial cells, we stained the transfected cells with primary antibodies specific for each transporter and secondary antibodies, conjugated with fluorescent dyes, and examined their localization by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Cells were double labeled with antibodies recognizing the α-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase. It has been established that Na+/K+-ATPase is sorted to the basolateral membranes of both LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells (36Caplan M. Anderson H. Palade G. Jamieson J. Cell. 1986; 46: 623-631Google Scholar) which provides an internal marker for the basolateral membrane. In separate control experiments, anti-transporter antibodies demonstrated a very low background staining in untransfected LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells. Moreover, preimmune serum did not stain the transfected cells (data not shown). The MDCK cell lines expressing the transporters were not clonal. Thus, not all cells in a given field express the transporters nor are all cells labeled by anti-transporter antibodies. Figs. 1, 2, 3 show immunofluorescence micrographs of LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells expressing SERT, NET, and DAT. In each case, the same cells were stained with antibodies against both the specific transporter expressed (right panels) and the α-subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase (left panels). An X-Z cross section representative of each field was generated, and is shown below each en face view. Previous studies with GABA transporters (14Pietrini G. Suh Y.J. Edelmann L. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 4668-4674Google Scholar, 16Ahn J. Mundigl O. Muth T.R. Rudnick G. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6917-6924Google Scholar) were in agreement with the prediction of Dotti and Simons (11Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Google Scholar) that axonal proteins should be sorted apically in epithelial cells.Fig. 2Immunocytochemical localization of the norepinephrine transporter in epithelial cells. Immunocytochemistry was performed on LLC-PK1 cells (panels A-D) and MDCK cells (panels E-H) expressing NET as described in the legend to Fig. 1 using affinity-purified rabbit antibody N430 recognizing human NET and mouse antibody 6H recognizing the α-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase.

Secondary antibodies were Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rat and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast, however, biogenic amine transporters expressed in LLC-PK1 cells are restricted to the basolateral domain of the plasmalemma. Panels B and D of Figs. 1, 2, 3 show a distribution of SERT, NET, and DAT, respectively, that is essentially identical to the distribution of Na+/K+-ATPase (panels A and C). In MDCK cells, expression of SERT and NET results in a similar distribution, with essentially all of the transporter localized to the basolateral membrane (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, panels F and H) as is the Na+/K+-ATPase (panels E and G). To our surprise, the dopamine transporter was sorted differently in the two epithelial cell lines. The same DAT cDNA was transfected into the LLC-PK1 and MDCK cells using the same procedure, but the expressed dopamine transporter was sorted predominately to the apical domain of MDCK cell plasma membranes (Fig. 3, panels F and H), while it was excluded from the apical membrane domain of LLC-PK1 cells (panels B and D). Human DAT was also transfected into MDCK cells, and its localization was identical to that of rat DAT (data not shown). The level of expression of DAT, as judged by immunofluorescence, biotinylation, and transport assays (see below) was not significantly different from that of NET or SERT in MDCK cells. To confirm the immunocytochemistry results described above, and to evaluate the approximate molecular sizes of the transporters expressed on the surface of these cells, we used cell surface biotinylation and Western blot analysis to estimate the relative expression levels of biogenic amine transporters on the apical or basolateral membranes of MDCK cells (Fig. 4) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The right panel of Fig. 4 shows that SERT expressed in MDCK cells was labeled when the biotin reagent was present at the basolateral cell surface and was detected as a strong 75-kDa band (lanes B) similar to the band observed in platelet membranes detected with the same antibody (23Qian Y. Melikian H. Rye D. Levey A. Blakely R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1261-1274Google Scholar). When cells were biotinylated from the apical surface (lanes A), little or none of the serotonin transporters were labeled, and the band is correspondingly weak or absent. The middle panel of Fig. 4 indicates that, in MDCK-NET cells, the norepinephrine transporter was readily biotinylated from the basolateral side of cell monolayer (lanes B). In contrast to NET and SERT, DAT was found to be more abundant in the apical membrane of MDCK-DAT cells (left panel). These results are consistent with the immunocytochemical data presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3. All three transporter proteins appeared on Western blots as broad bands, probably due to heterogeneous glycosylation. The surface biotinylated band observed with NET was similar in mobility to the band previously detected in total extracts from LLC-NET cells (30Melikian H. McDonald J. Gu H. Rudnick G. Moore K. Blakely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12290-12297Google Scholar). The mobility of the biotinylated DAT band also was similar to that previously observed in brain membranes and transfected cells (24Ciliax B. Heilman C. Demchyshyn L. Pristupa Z. Ince E. Hersch S. Niznik H. Levey A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1714-1723Google Scholar). For biotinylation of DAT in MDCK cells, human DAT cDNA was used, since the monoclonal antibody reacted less well with rat DAT. This lack of sensitivity was not a problem for immunofluorescence (Fig. 3), but it proved problematic for the biotinylation experiments. Although the results are not shown, independent experiments confirmed that rat and human DAT behaved identically in immunofluorescence and transport experiments in MDCK cells. The results of these biotinylation experiments were quantitated by video densitometry using briefly exposed films of the Western blots to avoid film saturation. Fig. 5 shows the relative densities of the protein bands as shown in Fig. 4, determined using two or more independent Western blots for each cell line. This quantitation suggests that 90% or more of plasmalemmal NET and SERT are expressed on the basolateral surfaces of MDCK cells, and about 80% of plasmalemmal DAT on apical membranes of MDCK-DAT c"

https://openalex.org/W1577795454,"In addition to the ubiquitously expressed form of nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain-B (MHC-B), the existence of a neuron-specific MHC-B isoform, which contains a 30-nucleotide inserted sequence near the ATP binding region, has been reported (Takahashi, M., Kawamoto, S., and Adelstein, R. S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 17864-17871). In this study, the genomic location of the neuron-specific inserted 30-nucleotide sequence found in the cDNA is determined to be a single cassette type exon, N30, in the human nonmuscle MHC-B gene. Inclusion or exclusion of exon N30 is cell type-specific, with inclusion being restricted to neuronal cells and being regulated during cell differentiation. Expression of a minigene construct that contains the alternative exon N30 along with the flanking introns and exons was studied in human neuronal retinoblastoma Y79 cells. Inclusion of the N30 exon in the mRNA from the transfected minigene occurs in differentiated Y79 cells that have been treated with butyrate but not in the undifferentiated Y79 cells and non-neuronal cell lines. Systematic deletion and mutation analysis of the minigene construct established that neuron-specific N30 exon recognition requires a cis-acting RNA sequence located ∼1.5 kilobases downstream of the N30 exon. In addition to the ubiquitously expressed form of nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain-B (MHC-B), the existence of a neuron-specific MHC-B isoform, which contains a 30-nucleotide inserted sequence near the ATP binding region, has been reported (Takahashi, M., Kawamoto, S., and Adelstein, R. S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 17864-17871). In this study, the genomic location of the neuron-specific inserted 30-nucleotide sequence found in the cDNA is determined to be a single cassette type exon, N30, in the human nonmuscle MHC-B gene. Inclusion or exclusion of exon N30 is cell type-specific, with inclusion being restricted to neuronal cells and being regulated during cell differentiation. Expression of a minigene construct that contains the alternative exon N30 along with the flanking introns and exons was studied in human neuronal retinoblastoma Y79 cells. Inclusion of the N30 exon in the mRNA from the transfected minigene occurs in differentiated Y79 cells that have been treated with butyrate but not in the undifferentiated Y79 cells and non-neuronal cell lines. Systematic deletion and mutation analysis of the minigene construct established that neuron-specific N30 exon recognition requires a cis-acting RNA sequence located ∼1.5 kilobases downstream of the N30 exon."

Addition of lactate brings about a decrease of O2 affinity (i.e. an increase of P50) in sperm whale and horse heart myoglobins. Accordingly, lactate shows a different affinity for the deoxygenated and oxygenated form, behaving as a heterotropic modulator. The lactate effect on O2 affinity appears to differ for sperm whale and horse heart Mb, δlogP50 being ≈1.0 and ≈0.4, respectively. From the kinetic viewpoint, the variation of O2 affinity for both myoglobins can be attributed mainly to a decrease of the kinetic association rate constant for ligand binding.

Proteoglycans, especially heparan sulfate (HS)-substituted species, are known to be associated with the amyloid deposits (1Snow A.D. Mar H. Nochlin D. Kimata K. Kato M. Suzuki S. Hassell J. Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 456-463PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, we found that heparan sulfate isolated from afflicted brains, and from control subjects, differed minimally in quantity and structure (2Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Keratan sulfate (KS), originally demonstrated in cornea and cartilage, was more recently identified in brain (3Krusius T. Finne J. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8237-8242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KS is a linear polymer of β1,3-linked N-acetyl-lactosamine (Galβ1,4GlcNAc) disaccharide units that are sulfated to a variable degree on the C-6 positions of either the glucosamine or galactose residues (Fig. 1). While a limited number of KS-proteoglycans have since been isolated from brain (4Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), there are no reports to our knowledge concerning the distribution or characteristics of KS or KS-proteoglycans in AD. Alzheimer's disease glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate keratan sulfate monoclonal antibody. Here we report that contrary to HS, KS, isolated together with the HS glycosaminoglycan fraction, is dramatically decreased in cerebral cortex of Alzheimer patients. This finding is paralleled by the loss of epitopes recognized by a monoclonal antibody with specificity for highly sulfated KS. The specific staining of normal neurons and the lack of these highly sulfated KS structures in afflicted neurons may reflect a specific functional defect of the neurons in AD. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were isolated as described (2Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) from samples of cerebral cortex obtained at autopsy of control subjects and of individuals with the clinical diagnosis and typical neuropathological findings (2Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 5Khachaturian Z.S. Arch. Neurol. 1985; 42: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar) of AD. Briefly, the procedure involved lipid extraction, proteolytic digestion, and anion-exchange chromatography. Material more retarded on the ion-exchanger than a hyaluronan standard was recovered and digested with chondroitinase ABC and nuclease (2Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Residual polysaccharide (15-25 µg of hexuronic acid, as determined by the carbazole reaction (6Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar)) was radiolabeled as described (2Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem.

The products showed a specific activity of (1Snow A.D. Mar H. Nochlin D. Kimata K. Kato M. Suzuki S. Hassell J. Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 456-463PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) × 106 dpm of 3H/µg of hexuronic acid (however, see heterogeneity of labeled material under “Results”). Heparitinase I (EC) from Flavobacterium heparinum, and keratan sulfate 1,4-β-D-galactanohydrolase (keratanase) (EC) from Pseudomonas sp. were purchased from Seikagaku. Samples of N-[acetyl-3H]glycosaminoglycans (∼100 × 103 dpm) were digested with 5 milliunits of heparitinase I in 150 µl of 50 mM Hepes, 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.0, at 43°C for 9 h, or with 50 milliunits of keratanase in 100 µl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 37°C for 15 h. The digestion products were separated by gel chromatography on a column (1 × 96 cm) of Sephadex G-100, equilibrated with 0.2 M NH4HCO3, and effluent fractions were analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. The mouse anti-KS monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 2-D-3, 5-D-4, and 8-C-2, were as described (7Sorrell J.M. Caterson B. Histochemistry. 1990; 94: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two of these mAbs, 2-D-3 and 8-C-2, recognize low sulfated KS, 2B. Caterson, unpublished observation. whereas mAb 5-D-4 binds to highly sulfated KS sequences (8Mehmet H. Scudder P. Tang P.W. Hounsell E.F. Caterson B. Feizi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Brain tissue was recovered at autopsy and fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution. Deparaffinized tissue sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibody, mAb 5-D-4, in dilution 1:50, and were then stained using a secondary, biotinylated, rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:200; Dakopatts), followed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) as substrate/chromogen. The sections were then briefly counter stained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Samples of cerebral cortex were obtained at autopsy of individuals with AD and of control subjects. The pathological specimens were selected on the basis of the clinical diagnosis of AD, verified by the typical neuropathology at autopsy with neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques with a central core of amyloid, and amyloid deposits in the vessel walls (5Khachaturian Z.S. Arch. Neurol. 1985; 42: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar). Individuals without dementia and without these histopathological findings were used as controls. Sulfated GAGs were isolated from the tissues as described under “Materials and Methods.” Following removal of galactosaminoglycans by digestion with chondroitinase ABC, the polysaccharides were radiolabeled by partial N-deacetylation followed by re-N-[3H]acetylation. Fractionation of such N-[acetyl-3H]polysaccharide preparations by anion-exchange chromatography yielded two major peaks, one of which emerged slightly after a hyaluronan standard, whereas the other one appeared immediately before chondroitin sulfate (Fig. 1). The more retarded of the separated 3H-labeled components was susceptible to deaminative cleavage with HNO2 (pH 1.5) and to digestion with bacterial heparitinase (type I; F. heparinum) (2Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The less retarded component was resistant to these treatments, but was instead degraded upon incubation with Pseudomonas sp. keratan sulfate 1,4-β-D-galactanohydrolase (keratanase) and with Bacillus sp. keratan sulfate endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (keratanase II) (data not shown). The two N-[acetyl-3H]GAGs thus were identified as HS and KS. Preliminary observations based on anion-exchange chromatography suggested that the amounts of KS, as related to those of HS, were decreased in cortex from AD brains as compared with control material (Fig. 1). To verify this finding, unfractionated samples of chondroitinase-resistant, 3H-labeled GAGs were digested with either heparitinase I or with keratanase, and the products were separated by gel chromatography (Fig. 2). The heparitinase-susceptible components derived from control tissue eluted as a retarded peak, which was consistently smaller than the peak of enzyme-resistant polysaccharide (shown for three independent brain samples; Fig. 2, a-c). Conversely, after digestion of the same samples with keratanase most of the 3H label emerged as degradation products (g-i). When [3H]GAGs from AD brains were subjected to the same treatment the picture was reversed, with relatively large proportions of heparitinase-sensitive as compared with keratanase-sensitive material (compare d-f with j-l). Heparitinase-resistant components were completely degraded to labeled oligosaccharides upon subsequent incubation with keratanase (data not shown). Quantitative estimates of [3H]KS/[3H]HS ratios, based on relative peak areas, indicated that KS accounted for 70 ± 8% (n = 3) of the 3H-labeled control polysaccharide, but only for 45 ± 11% (n = 6; samples derived from five brains, one of which provided two samples from different locations) of the AD material. Thus, the ratio of labeled KS to HS would be ∼2.3:1 in controls, whereas ∼0.8:1 in AD samples. Since the concentration of HS in dry, defatted cortex was almost the same in AD (∼110 µg of hexuronic acid/g) as in control material (∼90 µg of hexuronic acid/g) (2Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we conclude that the concentration of KS in AD cerebral cortex is reduced to less than half of that in control tissue. The decrease in KS contents of AD cortex would appear to be related to the pathological state of the tissue, and not to the age of the individuals, since all control subjects, regardless of age, yielded highly similar HS/KS profiles (Fig. 2). Three mouse anti-KS mAbs with different saccharide epitopes (see “Materials and Methods”) were used in immunohistochemical characterization of AD and control cerebral cortex. Two of the mAbs, 2-D-3 and 8-C-2, which recognize low sulfated KS, stained neurons in control as well as in AD specimens (data not shown). mAb 5-D-4, on the other hand, which binds to highly sulfated KS sequences, generally differentiated normal (control) from diseased cortex. The extracellular matrix of control (Fig. 3, a and b), but not of AD (Fig. 3, c and d), tissue thus gave a faint but significant reaction with the antibody. More conspicuously, mAb 5-D-4 also gave a positive reaction for most neurons in control brains (n = 6) (Fig. 3, a and b) and in a case with dementia of the multiinfarction type (not shown). By contrast, the majority of neurons in 9 out of 11 AD brains failed to bind mAb 5-D-4 (examples shown in Fig. 3, c and d), and, in fact, could not be distinguished from those of control sections that had been stained in the absence of the primary antibody (mAb 5-D-4) (Fig. 3e). All specimens gave a strong positive reaction in the corpora amylacea (9Liu H.M. Anderson K. Caterson B. J. Neuroimmunol. 1987; 14: 49-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (not shown). The radiochemical experiments demonstrate that the amounts of KS are decreased in cerebral cortex from AD as compared with control individuals, but do not directly indicate the absolute concentrations of KS in the tissue. However, this parameter may be indirectly assessed, using HS, previously quantified (see “Results” and 2Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), as an internal reference compound. Control experiments with purified preparations of 3H-labeled KS and HS (separated by anion-exchange chromatography) ascertained that the rate of N-deacetylation during hydrazinolysis was the same for both polysaccharides (data not shown). The extent of N-deacetylation achieved before re-N-[3H]acetylation was ∼40% (data not shown) for both HS and KS; hence, the N-acetyl groups of the resultant radiolabeled polysaccharides would exhibit similar specific radioactivity. Calculations based on the distribution of the 3H label between HS and KS, and the estimated abundance of N-acetyl groups in HS (∼50% of all disaccharide units) and KS (100% of all disaccharide units), thus indicated a KS content for normal cerebral cortex approximately equal to that of HS. The cause of the selective loss of KS in AD is not known. The highly similar results seen for differently aged controls (Fig. 2) argue against a general effect of age on the chemical composition of KS in brain. A structural difference between AD and control KS was suggested by immunohistochemical analysis using antibody 5-D-4, whereas antibodies against less sulfated structures did not reveal any alterations. 3It should be noted that the radiochemical analysis was restricted to the fraction of sulfated GAGs emerging after hyaluronan on anion-exchange chromatography and thus would not provide any information about less sulfated poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine species. However, a general impairment of sulfation reactions during GAG biosynthesis appears unlikely in view of previous findings regarding HS structure in AD (2Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). While we cannot exclude that defective KS sulfation is a secondary effect of neuronal degeneration, it is noted that neurons from a case of advanced vascular dementia stained strongly with mAb 5-D-4 (not shown). Moreover, and in accord with the previously recognized heterogeneity of the disease, so did 2 out of 11 cases that had been diagnosed as AD by clinical and histopathological criteria. KS belongs to the poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine family, which shows remarkable changes during development and differentiation (10Feizi T. Nature. 1985; 314: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 11Bertolotto A. Manzardo E. Iudicello M. Guglielmone R. Riccio A. Brain Res. Dev.

Trans. 1991; 19: 871-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Also KS-containing proteoglycans in the nervous system exhibit developmental changes (4Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the distribution of mAb 5-D-4 in control samples (Fig. 3b) points to a largely intracellular location of the epitope. It is therefore of interest that a neuron-specific KS-substituted protein has been demonstrated in the Torpedo electric organ and in rat brain (13Scranton T.W. Iwata M. Carlson S.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This protein (“synaptoglycan” (4Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Experientia (Basel). 1993; 49: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar)) is located intracellularly in synaptic vesicles and has been implicated with the transport of acetylcholine (14Bahr B.A. Noremberg K. Rogers G.A. Hicks B.W. Parsons S.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5778-5784Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Conceivably, binding of the positively charged neurotransmitter to highly sulfated regions of KS may be critical to normal transport, which thus would be perturbed in AD. After submission of this communication, we became aware of a recent report by Snow et al. (Snow, A. D., Nochlin, D., Sekiguchi, R., and Carlson, S. S. (1996) Exp. Neurol. 138, 305-317) that demonstrates the presence of the KS-containing SV2 proteoglycan in normal human brain and at sites of amyloid plaques in AD."

The mechanism of RF radiation cell proliferation modulation, as well as mechanisms for effects on other cell physiologic endpoints, are not well understood. To obtain insight regarding interaction mechanisms, we investigated effects of RF radiation exposure on interleukin 2 (IL-2) -dependent proliferation of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLL-2). After exposure to RF radiation in the presence or absence of IL-2 cells were cultured at various physiological concentrations of IL-2. Treatment effects on CTLL-2 proliferation were determined by tritiated thymidine incorporation immediately or 24 h after exposure. Exposure to 2450 MHz RIF radiation at specific absorption rates (SARs) of greater than 25 W/kg (induced E-field strength 98.4 V/m) induced a consistent, statistically significant reduction in CTLL-2 proliferation, especially at low IL-2 concentrations. At lower SARs, 2450 MHz exposure increased CTLL-2 proliferation immediately after exposure but reduced 24 h postexposure proliferation. RF radiation effects depended on the mitotic state of the cells at the time of exposure. Comparison of the effects of temperature elevation and RF radiation indicated significant qualitative and quantitative differences."

Alternative oxidase protein and activity were detected both in spheroplasts and isolated mitochondria, indicating that the enzyme is expressed in a functional form and confers cyanide-resistant respiration to S. pombe, which is sensitive to inhibition by octyl-gallate. Protein import studies revealed that the precursor form of the alternative oxidase protein is efficiently imported into isolated mitochondria and processed to its mature form comparable to that observed with potato mitochondria. Western blot analysis and respiratory studies revealed that the alternative oxidase protein is expressed in the inner mitochondrial membrane in its reduced (active) form. Treatment of mitochondria with diamide and dithiothreitol resulted in interconversion of the reduced and oxidized species and modulation of respiratory activity. The addition of pyruvate did not effect either the respiratory rate or expression of the reduced species of the protein.

Treatment of mitochondria with diamide and dithiothreitol resulted in interconversion of the reduced and oxidized species and modulation of respiratory activity. The addition of pyruvate did not effect either the respiratory rate or expression of the reduced species of the protein. To our knowledge this is the first time that the alternative oxidase has been effectively targeted to and integrated into the inner mitochondrial membrane of S. pombe, and we conclude that the expression of a single polypeptide is sufficient for alternative oxidase activity."

A high degree of sequence similarity is shared between the NF-κB/c-Rel family of transcription factors and the Drosophila Dorsal protein as well as between its cytoplasmic inhibitor, IκBα, and the Drosophila Cactus protein. Genetic analyses of Dorsal have defined components of a signaling pathway for Dorsal activation, including a serine/threonine kinase, Pelle, placed upstream of Dorsal and Cactus. We demonstrate that this pathway is likely to be conserved in mammals by the isolation of a cDNA that encodes a novel mouse protein highly related to Pelle, mPLK (mouse Pelle-like protein kinase). Expression of mPLK mRNA is developmentally regulated in the mouse and in adult tissue mPLK expression is greatest in the liver, a tissue that expresses a high level of NF-κB.

Acquisition of immune competence in adult mammals depends on a series of developmentally-linked changes in gene expression. How these changes are coordinated during development is unknown. Insight into these processes in mammals can be gained from an understanding of related events in other model developmental systems. The NF-κB/c-Rel family of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors are key mediators of genes expressed during activation of immune and inflammatory responses (1Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Google Scholar, 2Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Google Scholar, 3Israël A.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1827-1832Google Scholar), but under basal conditions, NF-κB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm in a complex with IκBα (7Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

In response to cellular stimulation, IκBα becomes phosphorylated (1-3,10-13) and in some instances subjected to proteolytic degradation through a ubiquitin-dependent pathway (14Chen A. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Google Scholar, 15Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Orian Ciechanover A. Ben-Neriah Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Removal of IκBα unmasks a nuclear localization sequence (17Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Google Scholar, 18Ganchi P.A.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 201-211Google Scholar), thus allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, bind to its cognate cis-acting element, and transcriptionally activate a variety of genes. IκBα has been shown to be a substrate for several kinases including protein kinase C, eIF-2 kinase, casein kinase II and a newly described monocyte-specific kinase (1Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Google Scholar, 2Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Google Scholar, 3Israël A.

Rice N.R. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27914-27919Google Scholar). Several of these kinases phosphorylate IκBα on serine and threonine residues present in the COOH terminus. Phosphorylated serine residues have also been detected in the NH2-terminal region of IκBα. Phosphorylation of NH2- and COOH-terminal residues has been linked to changes in IκBα protein stability. Currently, it is unclear whether other kinases are also responsible for IκBα phosphorylation and whether different NF-κB/c-Rel activators operate via distinct kinases. A high degree of sequence similarity is shared between the NF-κB/c-Rel family of transcription factors and the Drosophila Dorsal protein as well as IκBα and the Drosophila Cactus protein (20Shelton C.A. Wasserman S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 515-525Google Scholar). In response to activation of the Toll receptor by Spatzle, a serine/threonine protein kinase encoded by the pelle gene is activated and is believed to phosphorylate Cactus, resulting ultimately in activation of Dorsal. Given the striking parallel between the NF-κB/c-Rel and Dorsal pathways, we set out to determine whether a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila Pelle protein existed. Primers, 20 and 21 nucleotides long, were designed to anneal to DNA sequences that encode two regions of the Pelle protein kinase catalytic domain and included degenerate nucleotides of up to 2048-fold degeneracy to ensure efficient priming of unidentified sequences. The sequence of the primer designed to recognize kinase subdomain I: 5′-GGIGG(T/A/C/G)TT(C/T)GGIGA(C/T)GT(A/T/C/G)TA(C/T)-3′ and the sequence of the primer designed to recognize kinase subdomain VIb: 5′-AT(A/G)TTIGCIGG(C/T)TT(A/G/T)AT(A/G)TC-3′. PCR amplifications were performed with mouse embryonic cDNA (1 ng; Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) as a template and 100 µM of each degenerate primer. After 40 cycles of PCR, products with expected size (400 base pairs) were purified from 1.2% agarose gel using GeneClean II kit (Bio 101, Vista, CA) and cloned using TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). cDNA inserts were sequenced with Sequenase according to manufacture's specifications (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A 400-base pair cDNA fragment was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by primer extension with a multiprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Corp.). Probes were purified with Quickspin columns (Boehringer Mannheim) and used to screen approximately 1 × 106 plaques from a λgt11 mouse embryo 5′-stretch cDNA library according to the manufacturer's specifications (Clontech Laboratories). After a third round of library screening, 20 positive clones containing inserts ranging from 1500 to 2700 base pairs were isolated. All clones were partially sequenced over the putative catalytic domain, and amino acid sequence comparisons to all available data bases were made with the program BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). Both strands of the longest clone were sequenced using the Fmol DNA sequencing system (Promega, Madison, WI). Northern blots were purchased from (Clontech) and hybridized according to the manufacturer's specifications with a mPLK cDNA radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by primer extension with a Multiprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham). Autoradiograms were prepared by exposing washed membranes to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham) in the presence of intensifying screens at −70°C for 2 days. The mPLK cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pET-28a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI), which generated a His tag at the NH2 and COOH termini plus an NH2-terminal T7 tag to allow for immunodetection. The resulting fusion construct was verified by DNA sequencing and used to transform into E. coli strain BL21 (DE-3; Novagen). Induction of mPLK expression and purification of the fusion protein was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications, except that protein production was induced at 30°C overnight with 0.4 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and lysed with a French press in a buffer containing: 5 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Bacterial lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 39,000 × g, and supernatants were loaded onto Ni2+-NTA resin (Novagen). His-tagged mPLK was eluted in a buffer containing: 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 200 mM imidazole. Fractions were pooled and concentrated with Centricon-50 filters (Amicon Corp., Beverly, MA). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad reagent according to the manufacturer's specifications. The identity of mPLK containing fractions was verified by Western analysis with commercially available T7 tag monoclonal antibody, according to the manufacturer's specifications (Novagen). To generate the His-tagged IκBα protein E. coli strain BL21 (DE-3), cells containing a fusion gene encoding His-tagged IκBα were induced at 37°C for 3 h with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in a buffer containing: 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM NaPi, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 µMβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml pepstatin, sonicated and treated with DNase I (5 mg/ml) for 15 min. Bacterial sonicates were centrifuged (10,000 × g), and the supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA). The protein was then eluted with a 30-300 mM imidazole gradient according to the manufacturer's specifications. Protein determinations were done with a Bio-Rad reagent according to the manufacturer's specifications. The identity of IκBα containing fractions was verified by Western analysis with commercially available antisera to IκBα (Santa Cruz Laboratories, Santa Cruz, CA). Kinase assays were performed in 20 µl of kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol) containing 10 µM ATP (10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and 2 µg of purified His-mPLK in the presence or absence of 2 µg of purified His-IκBα at 37°C for 30 min. Individual reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 × SDS-sample buffer (0.1 M Tris, pH 6.8, 0.2 M dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) and boiled 5 min, and proteins were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Autoradiograms were prepared from dried gels exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham) film in the presence of intensifying screens at −70°C for 2 days. Given the parallel between the NF-κB/c-Rel and Dorsal pathways, we set out to determine whether mammals contain a homolog of the Drosophila Pelle protein. Degenerate primers corresponding to the sequences GGFGDVY (kinase subdomain I) and DIKPAN (kinase subdomain VIb) located in the catalytic domain of the Pelle protein kinase (see Fig. 1 legend) were used for PCR amplifications using mouse embryonic cDNA as a template. The DNA sequences of five different PCR products revealed similarity to protein kinases. One sequence encoded an open reading frame that shared 44% amino acid sequence identity with a portion of the Pelle kinase catalytic domain. A mouse embryo cDNA library (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) was then screened using the PCR product as a probe leading to the isolation of a clone containing a 2.7-kilobase insert. This cDNA encodes an open reading frame of 677 amino acids corresponding to a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 74 kilodaltons (Fig. 1, panel A). The first ATG of the open reading frame has an adenine nucleotide (A) in position −3, a favorable nucleotide and the most common context for initiating translation in vertebrates (22Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8149Google Scholar). The 300 amino acids spanning residues 200-500 of the mouse Pelle-like protein kinase (mPLK) contain the putative protein kinase catalytic domain; the region spanning kinase subdomains I through IX in mPLK is 55% identical to the homologous region in Pelle (20Shelton C.A. Wasserman S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 515-525Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal portion of mPLK contains identifiable counterparts to the 11 subdomains defined by blocks of identical and similar amino acid residues present in the majority of protein kinases (23Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 200: 38-81Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 15 amino acid residues invariant among all protein kinases are conserved in the mPLK protein sequence (Fig. 1, panel B). There is a high degree of sequence similarity (81%) between mPLK and the recently identified human interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK; 24Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that the cytoplasmic tail of the Drosophila Toll protein and the type 1 interleukin-1 receptor are 43% similar in sequence (25Schneider D.S. Hudson K.L. Lin T.-Y. Anderson K.V. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 797-807Google Scholar). Two other protein kinases with a high degree of similarity to mPLK are Pti-1 and Pto from Lycopersicon esculentum (26Zhou J. Loh Y.T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The mPLK amino acid sequence shares 36% identity to Pto and 36% identity to Pti-1 within their kinase domains. The similarity between mPLK, Pto, and Pti-1 is particularly interesting as Pto and Pti-1 belong to a family of plant protein kinase implicated in disease resistance. There is similarity between the Pelle NH2-terminal domain and regions, termed “death” domains, present in the type I tumor necrosis factor receptor and the Fas/ApoI protein required for cytotoxic responses (27Feinstein E. Kimchi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Google Scholar). Many of the amino acid residues identical between mPLK and Pelle within the NH2-terminal non-catalytic portion of the protein are the same residues that identify the death domain (Fig. 2). Additionally mPLK and the human interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase have identical death domains with the single exception that mPLK contains a glutamic acid at residue 30, whereas the human interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase contains a glycine. A putative death domain also exists in the Drosophila Tube protein, which has been shown genetically and biochemically to interact with Pelle (28Wasserman S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 767-771Google Scholar, 29Gro Shans J. Bergmann A. Haffter P. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Nature. 1994; 372: 563-566Google Scholar). The death domain has been implicated in protein-protein interactions and would suggest that this region of mPLK may be critical for interacting with another protein of its signaling pathway, such as a Tube homolog. The pelle gene is expressed throughout the Drosophila life cycle. However, levels of expression are transiently increased in 0-3-h embryos and are higher in adult females (20Shelton C.A. Wasserman S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 515-525Google Scholar). Since the mPLK cDNA was cloned from a day 17 mouse embryo cDNA library, we wanted to determine whether the mPLK gene was expressed at other times during mouse embryogenesis. Analysis of a mRNA isolated from developing mouse embryos revealed no detectable mPLK transcripts in day 7 embryos and a steady increase in the abundance of mPLK transcripts in mRNA isolated from day 11 through day 18 embryos (Fig. 3, left panel). Northern analysis of mRNA isolated from different adult mouse tissues revealed that, like the pelle gene, the mPLK gene is expressed in adult tissue. Interestingly there is a high level of mPLK gene expression in the liver, a tissue that also expresses a high level of NF-κB (30Kohchi C. Noguchi K. Tanabe Y. Mizuno D.-I. Soma G.-I. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 111-119Google Scholar). More moderate levels of mPLK transcripts are present in the kidney and in skeletal muscle (Fig. 3, right panel). The fact that mPLK resembled a protein kinase led us to determine whether it had protein kinase activity. Results of in vitro kinase assays with bacterially expressed His-tagged mPLK revealed that mPLK is a protein kinase, as judged by its ability to autophosphorylate (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). Pelle has been implicated in the control of the Dorsal/Cactus pathway; therefore, we considered the possibility that IκBα, a Cactus homolog, might be a substrate for mPLK in vitro. Recombinant mPLK was able to phosphorylate IκBα (Fig. 4). Autophosphorylation was reduced in the presence of IκBα substrate, as is commonly observed with protein kinases (Fig. 4, compare lanes 3 and 4). The novel mouse protein kinase mPLK appears to be a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila Pelle protein kinase. A family of plant protein kinases highly related to mPLK include not only Pto, which confers resistance to Pseudomonas syringae in tomatoes (26Zhou J. Loh Y.T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Google Scholar), and Pti-1, which may act downstream of Pto in a regulatory cascade (26Zhou J. Loh Y.T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Google Scholar), but also Fen, which confers sensitivity to fenthion in tomatoes (31Loh Y.-T. Martin G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4181-4184Google Scholar). The relationship between a kinase(s) potentially associated with a mediator of immune and inflammatory responses in mammals, and plant kinases involved in bacterial resistance, suggests not only a high degree of evolutionary conservation but also a high degree of functional commonality for this growing family of kinases. We have demonstrated that mPLK is capable of autophosphorylation. Like the mammalian MAP kinases, the plant Pelle-like kinases, Pto and Pti-1, are currently thought to function in a regulatory cascade with Pti-1 serving as a substrate for Pto. It will be interesting to determine if mPLK is a homolog of either Pto or Pti-1 or instead operates at yet another point in the signaling pathway. The nature of the activating signal is of great interest. Based upon the parallels between the Drosophila Dorsal protein and NF-κB, one potential mPLK substrate is IκBα. We demonstrate IκBα phosphorylation in vitro by recombinant mPLK. The functional significance of the IκBα phosphorylation remains to be determined. However these results coupled with the autophosphorylation of mPLK demonstrate that mPLK can function as a kinase. The role of the putative death domain in the activation of mPLK through its signaling pathway also needs to be evaluated. The link between mPLK and NF-κB/IκBα is of prime physiological importance. The acute phase response is the body's primary defense against bacterial, viral, and parasitic infection (32Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-80Google Scholar). The expression of numerous acute phase response genes, including those encoding interleukin-6 and −8 is modulated by NF-κB/c-Rel family members (33Sanceau J. Kaisho T. Hirano T. Wietzerbin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27920-27931Google Scholar, 34Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for mPLK in the control of genes encoding acute phase proteins, mPLK gene expression was highest in the liver, the primary site of acute phase protein synthesis in vivo. Intriguingly, massive degeneration of the liver via programmed cell death or apoptosis occurs in mice lacking the NF-κB family member, RelA (35Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Google Scholar). Developmentally, de novo expression of the mPLK gene occurred near the time that hematopoiesis is initiated in the fetal liver (36Tavassoli M. Meisami E. Timiras P.S. Ontogeny of Hemopoiesis in Handbook of Human Growth and Developmental Biology. CRC Press, Boston1988: 101Google Scholar). The functional significance of this latter finding is unclear; however, in parallel to the RelA/p65 null phenotype, it could reflect the initiation of mPLK expression during the early stages of liver organogenesis. Alternatively, expression by day 11 of development could reflect de novo expression of mPLK in monocyte/macrophages, another site of acute phase protein synthesis. Our data suggests that mPLK is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, yet the NF-κB/c-Rel family of transcription factors are ubiquitously expressed. It will be of great interest to determine if mPLK, like the plant kinases Pto, Pti-1, and Fen, is a member of a larger family of kinases in mammals with distinct patterns of tissue distribution. Based upon amino acid homology, the recently identified human interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase is a highly related family member (24Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Google Scholar). Therapeutically this class of kinases could be prime targets for the management of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. Based upon sequence comparison with IRAK, it is likely that the DNA sequence encoding the N terminus of mPLK has not been isolated. polymerase chain reaction mouse Pelle-like protein kinase."

We hypothesized that these differences in MU characteristics could result from the cumulative effects of the diurnal and nocturnal intermittent contractions of UA muscles in order to compensate for a permanent increase in UA collapsibility. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of UA collapsibility on MU characteristics. Seventeen SAHS and three nonapneic snorers, who underwent an uvulo-palato-pharyngoplasty as a treatment for snoring or SAHS, participated in the study. Awake and sleeping UA critical pressure (Pcrit) was measured during continuous positive or negative airway pressure trials by analysis of the relationship between maximal inspiratory flow and the upstream pressure of flow-limited breathing cycles. Maximum isometric twitch (Pt) and tetanic tension (Po), fatigability measurements, activities of marker enzymes for anaerobic and aerobic-oxidative profile, and fiber type proportions and areas of MU were determined. There was a significant positive relationship between Pt, Po, and Pcrit measured during wakefulness and sleep. The fatigability index was negatively correlated with awake Pcrit values (r = -0.79). Activity level of the anaerobic enzymes as well as the percentage of surface occupied by type I and type IIA muscle fibers as correlated witb awake Pcrit. We conclude that the differences in awake UA collapsibility help to determine the contractile properties and metabolic and histochemical characteristics of MU."

Renal epithelial Na+ channel activity is tonically inhibited by endogenous actin filaments (Cantiello, H. F., Stow, J., Prat, A. G., and Ausiello, D. A. (1991) Am. J. Physiol. 261, C882-C888). Thus, Apx was expressed and its function examined in human melanoma cells with a defective actin-based cytoskeleton. Apx-transfection was associated with a 60-900% increase in amiloride-sensitive (Ki = 3 µM) Na+ currents. Single channel Na+ currents had a similar functional fingerprint to the vasopressin-sensitive, and actin-regulated epithelial Na+ channel of A6 cells, including a 6-7 pS single channel conductance and a perm-selectivity of Na+:K+ of 4:1. Na+ channel activity was either spontaneous, or induced by addition of actin or protein kinase A plus ATP to the bathing solution of excised inside-out patches. Therefore, Apx may be responsible for the ionic conductance involved in the vasopressin-activated Na+ reabsorption in the amphibian kidney. Apx, the amphibian protein associated with renal amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel activity and with properties consistent with the pore-forming 150-kDa subunit of an epithelial Na+ channel complex initially purified by Benos et al.

https://openalex.org/W2018717132,"The CREB-binding protein (CBP) plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by several different second messenger pathways including serum growth factors, cAMP and phorbol esters. CBP specifically binds to the phosphorylated forms of CREB and c-Jun and is thought to activate transcription through a C-terminal activation domain. In this report, we demonstrate that the C terminus of CBP is dispensable for its ability to stimulate phospho-CREB activity, and, further, that the deletion of this domain produces highly active, mutant forms of CBP. The novel N-terminal activation identified by this deletional analysis consists of the first 714 amino acids of CBP and is sufficient for high levels of transcriptional activity. This domain is also capable of stimulating the activity of a second cAMP-regulated factor, ATF-1. Surprisingly, ATF-1 activity is not significantly stimulated by full-length CBP suggesting that the C-terminal domain of CBP may also serve to regulate ATF-1/CBP activity. Additionally, the demonstration that one of our hyperactive CBP mutants is able to activate a nonphosphorylatable mutant of CREB (M1 CREB) provides the first evidence that CBP may play a role in regulating the basal transcriptional activity of CREB.

INTRODUCTIONHormonally induced changes in the levels of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) regulate the expression of many cellular and viral genes through a common promoter element termed the CRE 1The abbreviations used are: CREcAMP response elementCREBcAMP response element-binding proteinKIDkinase-inducible domainPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseCBPCREB-binding proteinRSVRous sarcoma virusCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseaaamino acid(s)ATFactivated transcription factor. (1Goodman R.H. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1990; 13: 111-123Google Scholar). The activity of the CRE is, in turn, governed by a large family of transcription factors known as CREB/ATF proteins. These proteins share several common structural features including a DNA binding and dimerization motif, known as the bZIP domain, and transcriptional activation domains located in the N terminus of the molecule. Although poorly conserved overall, these activation domains share consensus phosphorylation sites for a variety of protein kinases suggesting that their activity, like that of many bZIP factors, is highly regulated by phosphorylation (2de Groot R. Derua R. Goris J. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 145-153Google Scholar, 3Mayer T. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290Google Scholar).The transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) represents the prototypical member of this family and it, along with the related factors ATF-1 and CREM, mediates many aspects of cAMP-regulated gene expression (4Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Google Scholar). The activation domains of all three of these proteins are highly homologous and can be divided into three basic elements, a kinase-inducible domain (KID), which contains a consensus phosphorylation site for the cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA), and two glutamine-rich domains (Q1 and Q2) flanking the KID. The phosphorylation of the CREB KID at a consensus PKA site (serine 133) is required for full transcriptional activity and mutation of this site effectively blocks stimulated activity (5Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Google Scholar). Although CREB is capable of interacting directly with several components of the basic transcriptional apparatus including TFIIB and TFIID, these interactions are not regulated by phosphorylation (6Ferreri K. Gill G. Montminy M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1210-1213Google Scholar, 7Xing L. Gopal V.K. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17488-17493Google Scholar), and it has been unclear how phosphorylation of the CREB activation domain results in enhanced transcriptional activity. The recent identification of a phosphorylation-dependent transcriptional co-activator of CREB has provided exciting new insights into this significant problem.The CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a large nuclear phosphoprotein capable of selectively interacting with the phosphorylated form of CREB by recognizing specific residues found in the CREB KID (8Chrivia J.C.

Biol. 1996; 16: 694-703Google Scholar). This interaction is required for PKA-dependent transcriptional activation as disruption of the complex by microinjection of either specific peptide fragments of the phospho-CREB binding domain or anti-CBP blocking antibodies is able to block stimulated expression of a CRE-dependent reporter gene in fibroblast cells (10Parker D.

Feramisco J. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Google Scholar). CBP is highly related to the E1a-associated protein p300, and both CBP and p300 are capable of acting as CREB co-activators and binding to E1a (12Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Google Scholar, 13Lundblad J. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Google Scholar). The binding of E1a to CBP/p300 is believed to be responsible for mediating many aspects of E1a-dependent transformation and has recently been shown to result in a strong inhibition of transcriptional activity of CBP/p300.Fusion of either the CBP or p300 cDNA to a heterologous DNA binding domain demonstrates that CBP is a potent transcriptional activator on its own (8Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Google Scholar, 12Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Google Scholar). This transcriptional activity is thought to reside in the C-terminal portion of the molecule and seems to be related to the ability of CBP to interact with the basic transcription factor TFIIB. Indeed, fusion of the C-terminal portion of CBP, including the TFIIB binding site, to a heterologous DNA binding domain produces a transcriptional activator which is more potent than the full-length CBP fusion protein (9Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bächinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Google Scholar). These results have suggested a simple model of CBP activity in which it binds selectively to the phosphorylated form of CREB proteins and activates transcription by recruiting TFIIB (14Nordheim A. Nature. 1994; 370: 177-178Google Scholar). CBP activity is not regulated by phosphorylation-dependent binding alone, however, and mutant forms of CREB have been identified which bind to CBP in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion but are not activated by CBP (15Sun P. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7041-7044Google Scholar).CBP/p300 proteins have also been implicated as potential co-activators for several other important transcriptional activators including c-Jun, c-Fos, and YY-1 (11Arias J.

Although the binding of CBP/p300 to both c-Jun and CREB appears to be phosphorylation-dependent, the binding of CBP/p300 to c-Fos and YY-1 is not, and it remains unclear if the transcriptional activity of CBP is regulated in these cases. Because CBP/p300 is capable of interacting with a wide variety of transcription factors, it is likely that the regulation of its transcriptional activity will play a central role in the overall regulation of gene expression by second messengers. To better understand how CBP activity is regulated, we have generated a series of mutant CBP molecules and assayed them for activity in a co-transfection assay with PKA-dependent transcription factors. In this report, we demonstrate that the previously identified C-terminal activation domain of CBP is dispensable for co-activator function in F9 cells and that the N terminus of CBP is sufficient for transcriptional activation.

To better understand how CBP activity is regulated, we have generated a series of mutant CBP molecules and assayed them for activity in a co-transfection assay with PKA-dependent transcription factors. In this report, we demonstrate that the previously identified C-terminal activation domain of CBP is dispensable for co-activator function in F9 cells and that the N terminus of CBP is sufficient for transcriptional activation.

https://openalex.org/W2052653753,"Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires specific interactions of Tat protein with the trans-activation responsive region (TAR) RNA, a 59-base stem-loop structure located at the 5′-end of all HIV mRNAs. We have used a new method based on psoralen photochemistry to identify a specific contact between a fragment of Tat protein (residues 38-72) and TAR RNA. We synthesized a 35-amino acid fragment containing arginine-rich RNA-binding domain of Tat (38-72), and replaced Arg57 with Cys to introduce a unique thiol group (-SH) in our model peptide. A psoralen derivative, which can react with thiol groups, was synthesized and used for specific chemical modification of Cys57-Tat-(38-72). We used this psoralen-Tat conjugate (psoralen-Cys57-Tat-(38-72)) to form a specific complex with TAR RNA. Upon near-ultraviolet irradiation (360 nm), this synthetic psoralen-peptide cross-linked to a single site in the TAR RNA sequence. The RNA-protein complex was purified and the cross-link site on TAR RNA was determined by RNA sequencing, which revealed that Cys57 of Tat is close to U31 of TAR RNA. Our results provide high-resolution proximity and orientation information about Tat-TAR complex. Such psoralen-peptide conjugates provide a new class of probes for sequence-specific protein-nucleic acid interactions and could be used to selectively control gene expression or to induce site-directed mutations.

Biol. 1988; 8: 2555-2561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TAR RNA contains a six-nucleotide loop and a three-nucleotide pyrimidine bulge, which separates two helical stem regions. The trinucleotide bulge is essential for high affinity and specific binding of the Tat protein (12Dingwall C. Ernberg I. Gait M.J. Green S.M. Heaphy S. Karn J. Lowe A.D. Singh M.

To achieve specific RNA binding by a Tat fragment, we synthesized a Tat peptide (amino acids 38-72), which contained an RNA-binding domain and 11 amino acids from the core domain of the Tat protein (Fig. 1). Since Tat protein mutants where Arg57 was substituted with Ser were functional for trans-activation (18Siderovski D.P. Matsuyama T. Elena F. Chui S. Min X. Erfle H. Sumner-Smith M. Barnett R.W. Mak T.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5311-5320Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we replaced Arg57 with Cys to introduce a unique thiol group (-SH) in our model peptide which was labeled with a psoralen derivative. Psoralens are bifunctional photoreagents that have been used as photoactive probes of nucleic acid structure and function (19Cimino G.D. Gamper H.B. Isaacs S.T. Hearst J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1151-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In this report, we have used a psoralen-Tat conjugate to determine the protein orientation in Tat-TAR complex.DISCUSSIONWe have used a site-specific cross-linking strategy to determine protein orientation in Tat-TAR complex. Our results establish that Arg57 of Tat-(38-72) is close to uridine 31 in the loop region of TAR RNA.How does Tat recognize TAR RNA? Several lines of evidence suggest that Tat protein contacts TAR RNA in a widened major groove. In a recent study from our laboratory, we used a rhodium complex, Rh(phen)2phi3+, to probe the effect of bulge bases on the major groove width in TAR RNA (21Neenhold H.R. Rana T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6303-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our studies establish two important factors involved in Tat-TAR recognition: (i) there is a correlation between major groove opening and Tat binding. At least a 2-base bulge is required for major groove widening and other conformational changes to facilitate Tat binding. This cannot be accomplished by a single base bulge. (ii) A Tat fragment (42-72) occupies the major groove of TAR RNA and abolishes access of the rhodium complex.To determine the relative orientation of the nucleic acid and protein in the Tat-TAR complex, we have devised a new method based on psoralen photochemistry (20Wang Z. Rana T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5438-5444Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We synthesized a 30-amino acid fragment containing arginine-rich RNA-binding domain of Tat-(42-72) and chemically attached a psoralen at the amino terminus. Upon near-ultraviolet irradiation (360 nm), this synthetic psoralen-peptide cross-linked to a single site in TAR RNA sequence. The RNA-protein complex was purified, and the cross-link site on TAR RNA was determined by chemical and primer extension analyses. Our results show that the amino terminus of Tat-(42-72) contacts, or is close to, uridine 42 in the lower stem of TAR RNA (20Wang Z. Rana T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5438-5444Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar).On the basis of our psoralen cross-linking results, we suggest a model for Tat-TAR recognition in which Tat binds to TAR RNA by inserting the basic recognition sequence into the enlarged major groove with an orientation where lysine 41 in the core domain of Tat contacts the lower stem and Arg57 is close to U31 in the loop region of TAR RNA (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 2B, there is a linker arm of 9.7 Å between the α-carbon of amino acid 57 in the Tat sequence and the psoralen moiety. Taking into account the rotational flexibility of the psoralen, the maximum distance between the protein backbone and U31 in TAR RNA would be ≈15 Å. Circular dichroism studies by Tan and Frankel (22Tan R. Frankel A.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10288-10294Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that Arg52 in basic RNA-binding peptides is an essential residue to induce a conformational change in TAR RNA. Recent NMR data suggest that after binding of an Arg (free or in Tat peptides), the trinucleotide bulge region TAR RNA undergoes a conformational rearrangement and forms a more stable structure (23Puglisi J.D. Tan R. Calnan B.J. Frankel A.D. Williamson J.R. Science. 1992; 257: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 24Aboul-ela F. Karn J. Varani G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 313-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). At present, there is no structural data available to determine which Arg is interacting with the bulge region of TAR RNA in the context of native HIV-1 Tat. According to our model, the proximity of Arg52 to U23 suggests that Arg52 is a likely candidate for such an interaction. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other arginines are involved in specific interactions with bulge nucleotides. Another interesting feature of our model involves a straight helix of TAR RNA in Tat-TAR complex, which is required to fit our cross-linking data. This is consistent with a recent study by Zacharias and Hagerman (25Zacharias M. Hagerman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6052-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in which they performed transient electric birefringence measurements and showed that TAR RNA bulge introduces a bend of 50° in the absence of Mg2+, which is straightened by the addition of Arg and Tat-derived peptides.Fig. 7Model for Tat-TAR recognition showing protein orientation in the RNA-protein complex. Ribbon structure of TAR RNA is shown in five yellow lines and nucleotides in red. Structure of Tat protein is illustrated in a magenta color shaded ribbon. Psoralen placed at position 41 in a Tat fragment cross-linked to U42 (20Wang Z. Rana T.M. J. Am. Chem.

The loop may provide the binding site for cellular factor(s) involved in trans-activation (27Gatignol A. Kumar A. Rabson A. Jeang K.-T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7828-7832Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Marciniak R.A. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tat could also be involved in rearranging the loop structure that can be recognized by cellular factors. Our results show that the COOH-terminal region of RNA-binding domain of Tat is in the close proximity of U31 in TAR RNA sequence, and whether Tat directly interacts with the loop or not remains to be determined.

Nucleotides spanning positions +19 to +42 are sufficient for Tat responsiveness in vivo (6Jakobovits A. Smith D.H. Jakobovits E.B. Capon D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2555-2561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TAR RNA contains a six-nucleotide loop and a three-nucleotide pyrimidine bulge, which separates two helical stem regions. The trinucleotide bulge is essential for high affinity and specific binding of the Tat protein (12Dingwall C. Ernberg I. Gait M.J. Green S.M. Heaphy S. Karn J. Lowe A.D. Singh M.

It has been shown by a number of groups that Tat-derived peptides, which contain the basic arginine-rich region of Tat, are able to form in vitro complexes with TAR RNA (13Cordingley M.G.

To achieve specific RNA binding by a Tat fragment, we synthesized a Tat peptide (amino acids 38-72), which contained an RNA-binding domain and 11 amino acids from the core domain of the Tat protein (Fig. 1). Since Tat protein mutants where Arg57 was substituted with Ser were functional for trans-activation (18Siderovski D.P. Matsuyama T. Elena F. Chui S. Min X. Erfle H. Sumner-Smith M. Barnett R.W. Mak T.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5311-5320Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we replaced Arg57 with Cys to introduce a unique thiol group (-SH) in our model peptide which was labeled with a psoralen derivative. Psoralens are bifunctional photoreagents that have been used as photoactive probes of nucleic acid structure and function (19Cimino G.D. Gamper H.B. Isaacs S.T. Hearst J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1151-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In this report, we have used a psoralen-Tat conjugate to determine the protein orientation in Tat-TAR complex. DISCUSSIONWe have used a site-specific cross-linking strategy to determine protein orientation in Tat-TAR complex. Our results establish that Arg57 of Tat-(38-72) is close to uridine 31 in the loop region of TAR RNA.How does Tat recognize TAR RNA? Several lines of evidence suggest that Tat protein contacts TAR RNA in a widened major groove. In a recent study from our laboratory, we used a rhodium complex, Rh(phen)2phi3+, to probe the effect of bulge bases on the major groove width in TAR RNA (21Neenhold H.R. Rana T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6303-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our studies establish two important factors involved in Tat-TAR recognition: (i) there is a correlation between major groove opening and Tat binding. At least a 2-base bulge is required for major groove widening and other conformational changes to facilitate Tat binding. This cannot be accomplished by a single base bulge. (ii) A Tat fragment (42-72) occupies the major groove of TAR RNA and abolishes access of the rhodium complex.To determine the relative orientation of the nucleic acid and protein in the Tat-TAR complex, we have devised a new method based on psoralen photochemistry (20Wang Z. Rana T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5438-5444Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We synthesized a 30-amino acid fragment containing arginine-rich RNA-binding domain of Tat-(42-72) and chemically attached a psoralen at the amino terminus. Upon near-ultraviolet irradiation (360 nm), this synthetic psoralen-peptide cross-linked to a single site in TAR RNA sequence. The RNA-protein complex was purified, and the cross-link site on TAR RNA was determined by chemical and primer extension analyses. Our results show that the amino terminus of Tat-(42-72) contacts, or is close to, uridine 42 in the lower stem of TAR RNA (20Wang Z. Rana T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5438-5444Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar).On the basis of our psoralen cross-linking results, we suggest a model for Tat-TAR recognition in which Tat binds to TAR RNA by inserting the basic recognition sequence into the enlarged major groove with an orientation where lysine 41 in the core domain of Tat contacts the lower stem and Arg57 is close to U31 in the loop region of TAR RNA (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 2B, there is a linker arm of 9.7 Å between the α-carbon of amino acid 57 in the Tat sequence and the psoralen moiety. Taking into account the rotational flexibility of the psoralen, the maximum distance between the protein backbone and U31 in TAR RNA would be ≈15 Å. Circular dichroism studies by Tan and Frankel (22Tan R. Frankel A.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10288-10294Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that Arg52 in basic RNA-binding peptides is an essential residue to induce a conformational change in TAR RNA. Recent NMR data suggest that after binding of an Arg (free or in Tat peptides), the trinucleotide bulge region TAR RNA undergoes a conformational rearrangement and forms a more stable structure (23Puglisi J.D. Tan R. Calnan B.J. Frankel A.D. Williamson J.R. Science. 1992; 257: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 24Aboul-ela F. Karn J. Varani G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 313-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). At present, there is no structural data available to determine which Arg is interacting with the bulge region of TAR RNA in the context of native HIV-1 Tat. According to our model, the proximity of Arg52 to U23 suggests that Arg52 is a likely candidate for such an interaction. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other arginines are involved in specific interactions with bulge nucleotides. Another interesting feature of our model involves a straight helix of TAR RNA in Tat-TAR complex, which is required to fit our cross-linking data. This is consistent with a recent study by Zacharias and Hagerman (25Zacharias M. Hagerman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6052-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in which they performed transient electric birefringence measurements and showed that TAR RNA bulge introduces a bend of 50° in the absence of Mg2+, which is straightened by the addition of Arg and Tat-derived peptides.Mutational analyses have shown that sequences in the loop of TAR RNA are required for trans-activation (5Feng S.

The loop may provide the binding site for cellular factor(s) involved in trans-activation (27Gatignol A. Kumar A. Rabson A. Jeang K.-T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7828-7832Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Marciniak R.A. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tat could also be involved in rearranging the loop structure that can be recognized by cellular factors. Our results show that the COOH-terminal region of RNA-binding domain of Tat is in the close proximity of U31 in TAR RNA sequence, and whether Tat directly interacts with the loop or not remains to be determined.

Brief exposure of the microsomes to heat abolishes saturable ethanol binding. Equilibrium binding data analysis, although only approximate in this context, suggests the presence of at least two groups of specific sites: high capacity sites with affinities near the pharmacological range and low capacity sites at lesser levels. The results indicate that the specificity of ethanol for tissue is considerably greater than previously recognized. The binding of ethanol to rat liver microsomes is shown to be saturable at clinically relevant ethanol concentrations, whereas this effect is not observed in extracted microsomal phospholipids.

The results indicate that the specificity of ethanol for tissue is considerably greater than previously recognized. Chronic alcoholism is a major public health problem, and alcohol abuse is known to damage many organs and interfere with many biochemical processes (1Lieber C.S. Medical and Nutritional Complications of Alcoholism. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1992Google Scholar). Despite considerable progress in the identification of the processes that are sensitive to ethanol, the origins of these effects remain largely obscure (2Hoek J.B. Thomas A.P. Rooney T.A. Higashi K. Rubin E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2386-2396Google Scholar, 3Taraschi T.F. Rubin E. Lab. Invest. 1985; 52: 120-131Google Scholar, 4Deitrich R.A. Dunwiddie T.V. Harris R.A. Erwin V.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 41: 489-537Google Scholar). In part, this problem stems from a lack of knowledge about the physicochemical basis by which ethanol interacts with tissue. Ethanol, like most organic solvents, binds nonspecifically to lipid membranes, although the binding is weak (5Dubey A.K. Zheng Y.O. Taraschi T.F. Janes N. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2307-2315Google Scholar). Its affinity for other cellular components is unknown. Yet, as a small amphipathic molecule, which exerts most of its effects at the millimolar level, its affinity for a variety of cellular components might be expected to exhibit weak specificity. In this study, we report the first direct evidence that ethanol binding to biological membranes is saturable at physiologically relevant concentrations. Liver microsomes were isolated from chow-fed Sprague-Dawley rats (Zivic Miller Laboratories, Allison Park, PA) weighing 300-350 g, as described previously (6Taraschi T.F. Wu A. Rubin E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7096-7101Google Scholar, 7Ellingson J.S. Janes N. Taraschi T.F. Rubin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1062: 199-205Google Scholar), except that the microsomal fraction was washed three times. The pellet was resuspended at a concentration of 10-15 mg/ml and stored under argon at −20°C. Protein was determined by Peterson's modified Lowry method (8Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Google Scholar). Cytochrome P-450 assays (9Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Google Scholar) indicated 0.818 ± 0.034 nmol/mg protein, in agreement with others (10Joly J.-G. Ishii H. Teschke R. Hasumura Y. Lieber C.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 1532-1535Google Scholar). Heat-treated microsomes were placed in boiling water for 5 min prior to being subjected to the protocols below. Microsomal phospholipids were extracted by the Bligh-Dyer procedure (11Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) and separated from neutral lipids by silicic acid chromatography (>99%) (12Kates M. Techniques of Lipidology. 2nd Ed. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). Solvents, which contained 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene to prevent oxidation, were flushed with N2. Lipids were stored under argon in CHCl3 at −20°C. Multilamellar vesicles were prepared by vigorous vortexing in buffer (10 mM Hepes, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Ethanol binding was determined using a modification of the dual radiolabel centrifugal technique originally described by Katz and Diamond (13Katz Y. Diamond J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1974; 17: 69-86Google Scholar). Binding to liposomes was performed as described by Janes et al. (14Janes N. Hsu J.W. Rubin E. Taraschi T.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9467-9472Google Scholar), except that 3H-labeled sucrose was used as a bulk water marker. The binding is expressed as the molal partition coefficients of the hydrated membrane. Binding to microsomes is performed as described below. Since the binding assay is a ratio method, it is insensitive to uncertainties in the specific activity of the sample, to evaporation, or to the adsorption of radiolabels to the sample tubes. Radiolabels were obtained from DuPont NEN ([14C]ethanol, [3H]water, [3H]glycine) or Amersham Corp. ([3H]sucrose). Radiolabels were deemed pure if partitioning between octanol/water or butanol/water was independent of the bulk solvent ratio at 1:1 and 1:10 (15Leo A. Hansch C. Elkins D. Chem. Rev. 1971; 71: 525-616Google Scholar). Typically, 0.7 ml of the microsomal suspension was transferred into a sealed 10-ml Oak Ridge polycarbonate centrifuge tube (Nalgene Co., Rochester, NY), along with 40 µl of [3H]water (9.0 µCi), 12 µl of aqueous [14C]ethanol (1.35 µCi), and 4.3 ml of buffer (10 mM Hepes, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4). The microsomal dispersion was equilibrated at 37°C in a water bath for 1 h and then centrifuged for 1 h at 37°C at 130,000 × g in a centrifuge and rotor that were previously equilibrated at 37°C. Centrifuged samples were placed immediately in a water bath at 37°C. The uncertainty in the temperature throughout the procedure was typically ±1°C. Four 100-µl aliquots of the supernatant and the pellet were transferred rapidly into tared glass scintillation vials that were immediately tightly sealed with Polyseal cone caps (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and again weighed (±0.1 mg). Additional supernatant was occasionally reserved for protein determinations to assess the centrifugal separation (>99%). Typical weights were 100 mg for the supernatants and 45-65 mg for the pellets. The four supernatant samples were divided into two pairs. To one pair, a nonradiolabeled microsomal pellet (∼50 mg) was added. Subsequently, 2 ml of tissue solubilizer (TS-2, Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL) was added to all five vials. The vials were transferred to a 45°C heating bath for at least 20 min for solubilization and then stored in the dark overnight. To the solubilized sample was added 9 ml of Biosafe II scintillation fluid (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL) and 1.5 ml of water. After preparation the sample vials were stored for 4 days in the dark to achieve a stable quench. Two sets of quench standards were prepared, counted several times, averaged, fit to a polynomial, and stored. Mock samples of known activity were used to ensure discrimination of radionuclei. One set of quench standards was prepared with microsomes as a color quenching agent in the presence of excess water and was used for the microsomal pellets and the supernatants which contained added cold microsomal pellet. The other set was prepared without microsomes and used with the supernatants that lacked tissue. Equality of the supernatant activities under the two quench curves provided a verification of the counting fidelity. The radiolabels were counted in a Packard Tri-Carb model 1900CA liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, IL) equipped with a barium-133 external γ-ray source, using a dual window analysis (0-9.1 keV; 9.1-156 keV). The instrument was calibrated weekly. Typical counting times were 5 min. Ethanol binding was determined according to Katz and Diamond (13Katz Y. Diamond J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1974; 17: 69-86Google Scholar, 16Katz Y. Diamond J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1974; 17: 87-100Google Scholar, 17Katz Y. Diamond J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1974; 17: 101-120Google Scholar). The determinations required the discrimination of bulk trapped water from the bound water of hydration in the microsomal pellet (16Katz Y. Diamond J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1974; 17: 87-100Google Scholar). The total pellet water was determined using 3H2O as a marker. The trapped bulk water was determined as that water accessible to labeled glycine. Binding constants are molal units, expressed as (mol of alcohol in membrane/kg of dry membrane)/(mol of alcohol in aqueous phase/kg of aqueous phase). Equilibrium binding data analysis was performed as described (18Bennett J.P. Yamamura H.I. Yamamura H.I. Enna S.J. Kuhar J.J. Neurotransmitter Receptor Binding. Raven Press Ltd., New York1985: 61Google Scholar). Binding site density (Bmax) 1The abbreviations used are: Bmaxconcentration of specific binding sitesKddissociation constant of specific binding. and dissociation constants (Kd) for each binding component were determined assuming a Hill coefficient of 1. Binding curves were fit to two specific and one nonspecific sites. concentration of specific binding sites dissociation constant of specific binding. The concentration dependence of ethanol binding to the rat liver microsomal fraction is shown in Fig. 1. At the lowest ethanol concentration examined (5 µM) binding was greatest (0.73 molal unit). Ethanol binding progressively declined with increasing ethanol concentrations before stabilizing at ethanol levels of approximately 200-400 mM. For comparison, the clinical effects of ethanol occur at 5-100 mM. At the low ethanol concentrations shown in the inset (5 µM-1 mM), a sharper concentration dependence was evident. Given the compositional complexity of the microsomal fraction, the scatter in the data, and the possibility that the higher ethanol concentrations used may be perturbing (see the lipid solubility data shown below), quantitative analysis of the ethanol binding curves must be viewed with considerable caution. A parsimonious first approximation, represented by the fit in Fig. 1, suggests the presence of (at least) two specific binding components and one nonspecific binding component. The first specific component exhibits a high affinity and a low capacity (Kd = 120 ± 70 µM; Bmax = 40 ± 20 µmol/kg membrane). The second specific component exhibits a lower affinity and a higher capacity (Kd = 110 ± 60 mM; Bmax = 50 ± 30 mmol/kg membrane). A third component is nonspecific and represents the residual binding at saturation (0.00 ± 0.17 molal unit). The actual situation may be considerably more complicated than the three-component binding model employed. Nonetheless, the saturable binding behavior observed is consistent with specific sites being filled at clinically relevant ethanol concentrations with site densities in the range of 20-80 mmol/kg of membrane. The absolute level of ethanol binding is dependent on the hydration of the microsomal fraction. Hydration, measured as that water which is inaccessible to glycine, is 0.35 ± 0.10 g/g, dry weight, and is independent of ethanol concentration. This value is in good agreement with the literature value of 0.34 (19Nilsson R. Peterson E. Dallner G. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 762-776Google Scholar). Such considerations shift the binding curve by a constant amount but do not alter the shape of the ethanol binding curve nor any of the fitted parameters for the specific binding components (16Katz Y. Diamond J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1974; 17: 87-100Google Scholar). The level of hydration does affect the nonspecific component of binding, which will be higher if some of the bulk water is inaccessible to glycine. The linearized form (Scatchard plot) of the binding curve is shown in Fig. 2 together with the nonlinear fit described above. Site densities of 20-80 mmol/kg of membrane are corroborated in this format. Estimates of site densities from Scatchard plots are subject to error if the data are restricted to low site occupancies (20Klotz I.M. Science. 1982; 217: 1247-1249Google Scholar). The Klotz format of the binding curve is shown in Fig. 3 along with the nonlinear fit described above. The fit includes the inflection point and the initial stages of the plateau, although higher specific site densities can be envisioned from the data. Further definition of the plateau was precluded because of perturbations at higher ethanol levels and the increasingly large error bars in the specific binding. The Klotz plot further reinforces the ethanol dependence of ethanol binding and the substantial specific site densities. To address the role of bulk membrane lipids in saturable ethanol binding, the binding of ethanol to multilamellar liposomes composed of extracted microsomal phospholipids was examined, as shown in Fig. 4. No negative concentration dependence that would be indicative of saturable binding was observed in the liposomes. By contrast, a small concentration-dependent increase in ethanol's lipid solubility is observed. To address the role of macromolecular conformation in saturable ethanol binding, microsomes were subjected briefly to heat (5 min in boiling water), and the binding assay was repeated at 37°C with 5 µM and 400 mM ethanol, as shown in Fig. 5. Thermal treatment appeared to expose additional nonspecific (or innumerable specific) sites without altering microsomal hydration. Saturable ethanol binding at pharmacologically relevant ethanol concentrations was abolished. Despite much effort, the elucidation of specific binding modalities of alcohols and anesthetics in tissue has proven elusive. Typically, high lipid solubilities tend to dwarf any specific effects (but see 21El-Maghrabi E.A. Eckenhoff R.G. Shuman H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4329-4332Google Scholar). Ethanol, by contrast, exhibits such a low affinity for lipids that specific effects predominate and can be observed directly. However, because the binding is so weak with respect to the aqueous ethanol concentrations, its determination requires exacting protocols that are able to distinguish low levels of tissue binding from the comparatively high levels of aqueous ethanol that are contained between and inside the microsomal vesicles. Evidence of ethanol-dependent ethanol binding at clinically relevant concentrations is shown above. Quantification of the binding behavior through traditional ligand binding analyses offers risks of overinterpretation in this context but provides a useful first approximation of the binding behavior. A group of high affinity site(s) of very low capacity (20-60 µmol/kg) saturates at concentrations below the onset of ethanol's behavioral effects. A second group of site(s) appears to be of much higher capacity (20-80 mmol/kg) and exhibits an affinity within the pharmacological range (50-170 mM). The specific site densities obtained substantially exceed the density of known sources of ethanol binding in microsomes that derive from the cytochrome P450 of the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (0.8 nmol/mg protein). Extracted microsomal phospholipids exhibit a weak concentration dependence, which would be expected for a partitioning mechanism without site specificity (5Dubey A.K. Zheng Y.O. Taraschi T.F. Janes N. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2307-2315Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation abolishes saturable ethanol binding and is consistent with the presence of defined structural features within proteins or their interfaces as important determinants of site specificity. The number of specific sites of weak affinity in the microsomes appears to be considerably greater than has been previously recognized. Assuming that on average the protein concentration of the microsomal fraction is 12 mmol/kg (22DePierre J.W. Ernster L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 201-262Google Scholar), the specific site density ranges from approximately two to seven sites per protein. No individual protein is likely to account for such widespread binding, which is more likely to arise from common structural motifs in proteins or at their interfaces. An abundance of specific sites with weak, yet clinically relevant, affinities is consistent with evidence for the numerous processes that are sensitive to ethanol. The results raise the possibility that there exist commonly found protein microstructures that are inherently ethanol-sensitive."
