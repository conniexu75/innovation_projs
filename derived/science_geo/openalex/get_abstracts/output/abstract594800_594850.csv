Gremer et al. used cryoelectron microscopy data to build a high-quality de novo atomic model of Aβ fibrils (see the Perspective by Pospich and Raunser). The complete structure reveals all 42 amino acids (including the entire N terminus) and provides a structural basis for understanding the effect of several disease-causing and disease-preventing mutations. The fibril consists of two intertwined protofilaments with an unexpected dimer interface that is different from those proposed previously. The structure has implications for the mechanism of fibril growth and will be an important stepping stone to rational drug design. Science , this issue p. 116 ; see also p. 45"
https://openalex.org/W2752710053,"Mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction have been implicated in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD), but how these pathways are linked in human neurons remains unclear. Here we studied dopaminergic neurons derived from patients with idiopathic and familial PD. We identified a time-dependent pathological cascade beginning with mitochondrial oxidant stress leading to oxidized dopamine accumulation and ultimately resulting in reduced glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity, lysosomal dysfunction, and α-synuclein accumulation. This toxic cascade was observed in human, but not in mouse, PD neurons at least in part because of species-specific differences in dopamine metabolism. Increasing dopamine synthesis or α-synuclein amounts in mouse midbrain neurons recapitulated pathological phenotypes observed in human neurons. Thus, dopamine oxidation represents an important link between mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in PD pathogenesis."

Agarwal et al. report a low-temperature (50°C) route in aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) for oxidizing methane to methanol in high yield (92%). They used colloidal gold-palladium nanoparticles as a catalyst. The primary oxidant was O 2 ; isotopic labeling showed that H 2 O 2 activated methane to methyl radicals, which subsequently incorporated O 2 . Science , this issue p. 223"

This subject has been dominated by Hebb's postulate of synaptic change. Although there is strong experimental support for Hebbian plasticity in a number of preparations, alternative ideas have also been developed over the years. Bittner et al. provide in vivo, in vitro, and modeling data to support the view that non-Hebbian plasticity may underlie the formation of hippocampal place fields (see the Perspective by Krupic). Instead of multiple pairings, a single strong Ca 2+ plateau potential in neuronal dendrites paired with spatial inputs may be sufficient to produce place cells.

https://openalex.org/W2612434226,"Condensin plays crucial roles in chromosome organization and compaction, but the mechanistic basis for its functions remains obscure. We used single-molecule imaging to demonstrate that Saccharomyces cerevisiae condensin is a molecular motor capable of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis-dependent translocation along double-stranded DNA. Condensin's translocation activity is rapid and highly processive, with individual complexes traveling an average distance of ≥10 kilobases at a velocity of ~60 base pairs per second. Our results suggest that condensin may take steps comparable in length to its ~50-nanometer coiled-coil subunits, indicative of a translocation mechanism that is distinct from any reported for a DNA motor protein. The finding that condensin is a mechanochemical motor has important implications for understanding the mechanisms of chromosome organization and condensation."

Why don't we suffer more invasive infections from ubiquitous fungal molds such as Aspergillus fumigatus ? Working in mice, Shlezinger et al. found that neutrophils phagocytosed germinating fungal spores deep in the lungs (see the Perspective by Wiesner and Klein). Once engulfed, the fungal cells underwent programmed cell death, likely induced by phagocyte NADPH oxidase. Fungal strains engineered to overexpress a fungal survivin homolog resisted cell death by inhibiting caspase-3 and -7. When a Survivin antagonist was applied, more fungal cells died. These findings may lead to therapies for immunocompromised patients threatened by invasive fungal lung infections. Science , this issue p. 1037 ; see also p. 973"
https://openalex.org/W2752435500,"Free fatty acid receptors 2 and 3 (FFAR2/FFA2/GPR43 and FFAR3/FFA3/GPR41) are mammalian receptors for gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These receptors are promising drug targets for obesity, colitis, colon cancer, asthma, and arthritis. Here, we demonstrate that FFAR2 and FFAR3 interact to form a heteromer in primary human monocytes and macrophages via proximity ligation assay, and during heterologous expression in HEK293 cells via bimolecular fluorescence complementation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The FFAR2-FFAR3 heteromer displayed enhanced cytosolic Ca2+ signaling (1.5-fold increase relative to homomeric FFAR2) and β-arrestin-2 recruitment (30-fold increase relative to homomeric FFAR3). The enhanced heteromer signaling was attenuated by FFAR2 antagonism (CATPB), Gαq inhibition (YM254890), or Gαi inhibition (pertussis toxin). Unlike homomeric FFAR2/ 3, the heteromer lacked the ability to inhibit cAMP production but gained the ability to induce p38 phosphorylation in HEK293 and inflammatory monocytes via a CATPB- and YM254890-sensitive mechanism. Our data, taken together, reveal that FFAR2 and FFAR3 may interact to form a receptor heteromer with signaling that is distinct from the parent homomers—a novel pathway for drug targeting.—Ang, Z., Xiong, D., Wu, M., Ding, J.

https://openalex.org/W2751607427,"Background The use of TNF-inhibitors and/or the IL-6 receptor antagonist, tocilizumab, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have pleiotropic effects that also involve circulating B-cells. The main goal of this study was to assess the effect of TNF-inhibitors and tocilizumab on B-cell phenotype and gene expression in RA. Methods Blood samples were collected from untreated early RA (ERA) patients, established RA patients under methotrexate treatment, established RA patients before and after treatment with TNF-inhibitors and tocilizumab, and healthy donors. B-cell subpopulations were characterized by flow cytometry and B-cell gene expression was analyzed by real-time PCR on isolated B-cells. Serum levels of BAFF, CXCL13 and sCD23 were determined by ELISA. Results The frequency of total CD19+ B cells in circulation was similar between controls and all RA groups, irrespective of treatment, but double negative (DN) IgD-CD27- memory B cells were significantly increased in ERA and established RA when compared to controls. Treatment with TNF-inhibitors and tocilizumab restored the frequency of IgD-CD27- B-cells to normal levels, but did not affect other B cell subpopulations. TACI, CD95, CD5, HLA-DR and TLR9 expression on B-cells significantly increased after treatment with either TNF-inhibitors and/ or tocilizumab, but no significant changes were observed in BAFF-R, BCMA, CD69, CD86, CXCR5, CD23, CD38 and IgM expression on B-cells when comparing baseline with post-treatment follow-ups. Alterations in B-cell gene expression of BAFF-R, TACI, TLR9, FcγRIIB, BCL-2, BLIMP-1 and β2M were found in ERA and established RA patients, but no significant differences were observed after TNF-inhibitors and tocilizumab treatment when comparing baseline and follow-ups. Serum levels of CXCL13, sCD23 and BAFF were not significantly affected by treatment with TNF-inhibitors and tocilizumab. Conclusions In RA patients, the use of TNF-inhibitors and/ or tocilizumab treatment affects B-cell phenotype and IgD-CD27- memory B cells in circulation, but not B-cell gene expression levels."
https://openalex.org/W2752551947,"The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to chronic stress is far from straight forward, particularly with regards to animal welfare. There are reports of no effect as well as both decreases and increases in cortisol after chronic stressors. Therefore, the first aim of the present study was to determine how measures of compromised welfare, such as chronic pain and haematological anomalies, related to cortisol levels in domestic horses (Equus caballus). Domestic horses are an informative model to investigate the impact of chronic stress (due to environment, pain, work, housing conditions…) on the HPA axis. The second aim was to determine whether levels of fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) may be used as an indicator of welfare measures. The present study used fifty-nine horses (44 geldings and 15 mares), from three riding centres in Brittany, France. The primary findings show that horses whose welfare was clearly compromised (as indicated by an unusual ears backward position, presence of vertebral problems or haematological anomalies, e.g. anaemia) also had lower levels of both FCM and plasma cortisol. This work extends our previous findings showing that withdrawn postures, indicators of depressive-like behavior in horses, are associated with lower plasma cortisol levels. We also found that evening plasma cortisol levels positively correlated with FCM levels in horses. Future research aims to determine the extent to which factors of influence on welfare, such as living conditions (e.g. single stalls versus group housing in pasture or paddocks), early life factors, and human interaction, act as mediators of cortisol levels in horses."

Most in vitro models use nonhuman, monolayer cultures for therapeutic-delivery studies, relying on transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements without other tight-junction (TJ) formation parameters. We aimed to develop reliable, reproducible, in vitro 3-dimensional (3D) models incorporating relevant human, in vivo cell types and BL proteins. The 3D BBB models were constructed with human brain endothelial cells, human astrocytes, and human brain pericytes in mono-, co-, and tricultures. TEER was measured in 3D models using a volt/ohmmeter and cellZscope. Influence of BL proteins—laminin, fibronectin, collagen type IV, agrin, and perlecan—on adhesion and TEER was assessed using an electric cell-substrate impedance-sensing system. TJ protein expression was assessed by Western blotting (WB) and immunocytochemistry (ICC). Perlecan (10 μg/ml) evoked unreportedly high, in vitro TEER values (1200 Ω) and the strongest adhesion. Coculturing endothelial cells with astrocytes yielded the greatest resistance over time. ICC and WB results correlated with resistance levels, with evidence of prominent occludin expression in cocultures. BL proteins exerted differential effects on TEER, whereas astrocytes in contact yielded higher TEER values and TJ expression.—Maherally, Z., Fillmore, H. L., Tan, S. L., Tan, S. F., Jassam, S.

https://openalex.org/W2752153892,"Aims The association of coronary arterial calcification with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is well-recognized. Lower limb arterial calcification (LLAC) is common in PAD but its impact on subsequent health is poorly described. We aimed to determine the association between a LLAC score and subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Methods LLAC scoring, and the established Bollinger score, were derived from a database of unenhanced CT scans, from patients presenting with symptomatic PAD. We determined the association between these scores outcomes. The primary outcome was combined cardiac mortality and morbidity (CM/M) with a secondary outcome of all-cause mortality. Results 220 patients (66% male; median age 69 years) were included with follow-up for a median 46 [IQR 31–64] months. Median total LLAC scores were higher in those patients suffering a primary outcome (6831 vs. 1652; p = 0.012). Diabetes mellitus (p = 0.039), ischaemic heart disease (p = 0.028), chronic kidney disease (p = 0.026) and all-cause mortality (p = 0.012) were more common in patients in the highest quartile of LLAC scores. The area under the curve of the receiver operator curve for the LLAC score was greater (0.929: 95% CI [0.884–0.974]) than for the Bollinger score (0.824: 95% CI [0.758–0.890]) for the primary outcome. A LLAC score ≥ 4400 had the best diagnostic accuracy to determine the outcome measure. Conclusion This is the largest study to investigate links between lower limb arterial calcification and cardiovascular events in symptomatic PAD. We describe a straightforward, reproducible, CT-derived measure of calcification—the LLAC score."
https://openalex.org/W2752672855,"C-reactive protein (CRP), was recently reported to be closely associated with poor renal function in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), but whether CRP is pathogenic or a mere biomarker in AKI remains largely unclear. Impaired autophagy is known to exacerbate renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). We examined whether the pathogenic role of CRP in AKI is associated with reduction of autophagy. We mated transgenic rabbit CRP over-expressing mice (Tg-CRP) with two autophagy reporter mouse lines, Tg-GFP-LC3 mice (LC3) and Tg-RFP-GFP-LC3 mice (RG-LC3) respectively to generate Tg-CRP-GFP-LC3 mice (PLC3) and Tg-CRP-RFP-GFP-LC3 mice (PRG-LC3). AKI was induced by IRI. Compared with LC3 mice, PLC3 mice developed more severe kidney damage after IRI. Renal tubules were isolated from LC3 mice at baseline for primary culture. OKP cells were transiently transfected with GFP-LC3 plasmid. CRP addition exacerbated lactate dehydrogenase release from both cell types. Immunoblots showed lower LC-3 II/I ratios and higher levels of p62, markers of reduced autophagy flux, in the kidneys of PLC3 mice compared to LC3 mice after IRI, and in primary cultured renal tubules and OKP cells treated with CRP and H2O2 compared to H2O2 alone. Immunohistochemistry showed much fewer LC-3 punctae, and electron microscopy showed fewer autophagosomes in kidneys of PLC3 mice compared to LC3 mice after IRI. Similarly, CRP addition reduced GFP-LC3 punctae induced by H2O2 in primary cultured proximal tubules and in GFP-LC3 plasmid transfected OKP cells. Rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, rescued impaired autophagy and reduced renal injury in vivo. In summary, it was suggested that CRP be more than mere biomarker in AKI, and render the kidney more susceptible to ischemic/oxidative injury, which is associated with down-regulating autophagy flux."

Objectives To evaluate the reliability, validity, responsiveness, and minimal important change (MIC) of the Dutch version of the Oxford Elbow Score (OES) and the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (Quick-DASH) in patients with a simple elbow dislocation. Background Patient-reported outcome measures are increasingly important for assessing outcome following elbow injuries, both in daily practice and in clinical research. However measurement properties of the OES and Quick-DASH in these patients are not fully known. Methods OES and Quick-DASH were completed four times until one year after trauma. Mayo Elbow Performance Index, pain (VAS), Short Form-36, and EuroQol-5D were completed for comparison. Data of a multicenter RCT (n = 100) were used. Internal consistency was determined using Cronbach’s alpha. Construct and longitudinal validity were assessed by determining hypothesized strength of correlation between scores or changes in scores, respectively, of (sub)scales. Finally, floor and ceiling effects, MIC, and smallest detectable change (SDC) were determined. Results OES and Quick-DASH demonstrated adequate internal consistency (Cronbach α, 0.882 and 0.886, respectively). Construct validity and longitudinal validity of both scales were supported by >75% correctly hypothesized correlations. MIC and SDC were 8.2 and 12.0 point for OES, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2752535205,"In Ethiopia, 20,000 women die each year from complications related to pregnancy, childbirth and post-partum. For every woman that dies, 20 more experience injury, infection, disease, or disability. ""Maternal near miss"" (MNM), defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a woman who nearly dies, but survives a complication during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days of a termination, is a proxy indicator of maternal mortality and quality of obstetric care. In Ethiopia, few studies have examined MNM. This study aims to identify determinants of MNM among a small population of women in Tigray, Ethiopia.Unmatched case-control study was conducted in hospitals in Tigray Region, Northern Ethiopia, from January 30-March 30, 2016. The sample included 103 cases and 205 controls recruited from among women seeking obstetric care at six (6) public hospitals. Clients with life-threatening obstetric complications, including hemorrhage, hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, dystocia, infection, and anemia or clinical signs of severe anemia (in women without hemorrhage) were taken as cases and those with normal obstetric outcomes were controls. Cases were selected based on proportion to size allocation while systematic sampling was employed for controls. Binary and multiple variable logistic regression (""odds ratio"") analyses were calculated at 95% CI.Roughly 90% of cases and controls were married and 25% experienced their first pregnancy before the age of 16 years. About two-thirds of controls and 45.6% of cases had gestational ages between 37-41 weeks. Among cases, severe obstetric hemorrhage (44.7%), hypertensive disorders (38.8%), dystocia (17.5%), sepsis (9.7%) and severe anemia (2.9%) were leading causes of MNM. Histories of chronic maternal medical problems like hypertension, diabetes were reported in 55.3% of cases and 33.2% of controls. Women with no formal education [AOR = 3.2;95%CI:1.24, 8.12], being less than 16 years of age at first pregnancy [AOR = 2.5;95%CI:1.12,5.63], induced labor[AOR = 3.0; 95%CI:1.44, 6.17], history of cesarean section[AOR = 4.6; 95% CI: 1.98, 7.61] or chronic medical disorder[AOR = 3.5;95%CI:1.78, 6.93], and women who traveled more than 60 minutes before reaching their final place of care[AOR = 2.8;95% CI: 1.19,6.35] had higher odds of experiencing MNM.Macro-developments like increasing road and health facility access as well as expanding education will all help reduce MNM. Work should be continued to educate women and providers about common predictors of MNM like history of C-section and chronic illness as well as teenage pregnancy. These efforts should be carried out at the facility, community, and individual levels. Targeted follow-up with women with history of chronic disease and C-section could also help reduce MNM."

Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate (CC) in increasing endogenous T levels in obese men with low serum T and with IGT or T2DM treated with metformin (MET). Design Cross-over, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Methods 24 obese men, aged 47.3 ±. 6.3 (range 35–55 years), with low T level (≤3 ng/mL) and naïve diagnosis of IGT or T2DM were included. Subjects were randomized to CC 25 mg/day or placebo (Plac) with MET 2 g/day for 3 months. After a 6-week wash-out period, subjects were moved to the alternative arm for additional 3 months. Clinical evaluation and blood exams performed prior to and at the end of treatment. Results Of 24 randomized, 21 were evaluable, classified as IGT (n = 11) or T2DM (n = 10). Compared to baseline levels, T levels increased significantly after 3 months of CC treatment (3.03±0.80 to 5.99±1.67 ng/mL P<0.001) but not after the Plac treatment (2.87±0.78 to 3.09±0.84 ng/mL P<0.001 between the treatments).

Robust monitoring programs have been rarely conducted prior to the establishment of dams to measure to what extent the fauna, and its associated habitats may be affected by upcoming impacts. Using bats as models, we performed analyses throughout the area under the influence of the Santo Antônio hydroelectric dam, Southwestern Brazilian Amazonia before its construction to estimate how the fauna and its associated habitats would be affected by the upcoming impacts. We surveyed bats in 49 plots distributed along the areas going to be inundated by the dam and those remaining dry. As predictors for the species distribution, we tested the variables of vegetation structure and topography. Species composition largely differed between the dry plots and the plots located in areas that will be flooded, and this was strongly associated with the variables of forest basal area and elevation. Vegetation-related variables also had strong influence on the guilds distribution. The flooding of lower elevations areas is expected to negatively affect the species number and abundance of frugivorous species. In contrast, it is likely that animalivores will be less vulnerable to dam-induced flooding, since they were abundant in the areas not expect to be inundated. We urge for the implementation of studies to predict impacts caused by large hydroelectric dams, including tests of the influence of the local conditions that shape diversity to avoid massive losses of the biota, and to build preventive monitoring and management actions."
https://openalex.org/W2750815609,"ATP fuels the removal of metabolic end-products, including H+ ions that profoundly modulate biological activities. Energetic resources in hypoxic tumor regions are constrained by low-yielding glycolysis, and any means of reducing the cost of acid extrusion, without compromising pH homeostasis, would therefore be advantageous for cancer cells. Some cancers express connexin channels that allow solute exchange between cells, and we propose that, via this route, normoxic cells supply hypoxic neighbors with acid-neutralizing HCO3_ ions. This hypothesis was tested by imaging cytoplasmic pH in spheroidal tissue growths of connexin43-positive pancreatic cancer Colo357 cells during light-controlled H+ uncaging at the hypoxic core. Cytoplasmic acid retention at the core was halved in the presence of CO2/HCO3−, but this process requires a restorative HCO3− flux. The effect of CO2/HCO3− was ablated by connexin43 inhibition or knockdown. In connexin-decoupled spheroids, 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS), an inhibitor of HCO3− uptake, had no effect on cytoplasmic [H+]inthe H+-uncaging region, indicating that DIDS-sensitive transport is not an adequate pH-regulatory strategy therein. With intact connexin-coupling, acid retention at the core increased upon DIDS treatment, indicating that HCO3− ions are taken up actively by peripheral cells and then transmitted passively to cells at the hypoxic core. Thus, the energetic burden of pH regulation is offloaded from hypoxic cells onto metabolically altruistic normoxic neighbors.—Dovmark, T. H., Hulikova, A., Niederer, S. A., Vaughan-Jones, R.

The objectives of this study are to document diagnoses and disease categories in Northern Syrian children after four years of conflict, and to document infectious diseases and injuries in this vulnerable population.In a prospective cross-sectional observational sample study conducted in May 2015, healthcare workers registered demographics, comorbidities, and diagnoses (categorised according to the International Classification of Diseases version 10) in children visited at home and in internally displaced persons camps in four Syrian governorates.Of 1080 filled-out records, 1002 were included. Children originated from Aleppo (41%), Idleb (36%), Hamah (15%) and Lattakia (8%). Median age was 6 years (0-15; IQR 3-11), 61% were boys, 40% were younger than 5 years old. Children suffered from respiratory (29%), neurological (19%), digestive (17%), eye (5%) and skin (5%) diseases. Clinical malnutrition was seen in 4%, accidental injury in 3%, intentional injury in 1%, and mental disorders in 2%. Overall, 64% had features of infectious diseases (OR 0.635; CI 0.605-0.665). Most common comorbidities were chronic respiratory diseases (14, malnutrition (5%), acute flaccid paralysis (5%), and epilepsy (4%). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the risk for children to have communicable diseases was higher in Aleppo than in Idleb (OR 1.7; CI 1.2-2.3), Hamah (OR 4.9; CI 3.3-7.5), or Lattakia (OR 5.5; CI 3.3-9.3).

Very little is known about continuation and switching of contraceptive methods in these settings. An evaluation of a contraceptive services program in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was conducted to measure 12-month contraceptive continuation by type of contraceptive method (short-acting or long-acting). Methods A stratified systematic sample of women who initiated a contraceptive method 12–18 months prior to data collection was selected retrospectively from facility registers. A total of 548 women was interviewed about their contraceptive use: 304 who began a short-acting method (pills, injectables) and 244 who began a long-acting method (intra-uterine devices, implants). Key characteristics of short-acting method versus long-acting method acceptors were compared using chi-square statistics for categorical data and t-tests for continuous data. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios were estimated to assess factors associated with discontinuation. Results At 12 months, 81.6% women reported using their baseline contraceptive method continuously, with more long-acting than short-acting contraceptive acceptors (86.1% versus 78.0%, p = .02) continuing contraceptive use. Use of a short-acting method (Hazard ratio (HR) 1.74 [95%CI 1.13–2.67]) and desiring a child within two years (HR 2.58 [95%CI 1.45–4.54]) were associated with discontinuation within the first 12 months of use. The vast majority (88.3%) of women reported no prior contraceptive use. Conclusion This is the first study of contraceptive continuation in a humanitarian setting. The high percentages of women continuing contraceptive use found here demonstrates that women will choose to initiate and continue use of their desired contraceptive method, even in a difficult, unstable and low contraceptive prevalence setting like North Kivu."

The plateau is covered by snow/ice and vegetation in the non-growing season (nGS) and growing season (GS), respectively. Based on the MODIS products, we investigated snow/ice cover and vegetation greenness in relation to the spatiotemporal changes of albedo on the Tibetan Plateau from 2000 through 2013. A synchronous relationship was found between the change in GSNDVI and GSalbedo over time and across the Tibetan landscapes. We found that the annual average albedo had a decreasing trend, but that the albedo had slightly increased during the nGS and decreased during the GS. Across the landscapes, the nGSalbedo fluctuated in a synchronous pattern with snow/ice cover. Temporally, monthly snow/ice coverage also had a high correspondence with albedo, except in April and October. We detected clear dependencies of albedo on elevation. With the rise in altitude, the nGSalbedo decreased below 4000 m, but increased for elevations of 4500–5500 m. Above 5500 m, the nGSalbedo decreased, which was in accordance with the decreased amount of snow/ice coverage and the increased soil moisture on the plateau. More importantly, the decreasing albedo in the most recent decade appeared to be caused primarily by lowered growing season albedo."
https://openalex.org/W2751552732,"Earth's geomagnetic field has undergone critical changes in the past. Studies on the influence of the magnetic field on Earth’s organisms are crucial for the understanding of evolution of life on Earth and astrobiological considerations. Numerous studies conducted both on plants and animals confirmed the significant influence of the geomagnetic field on the metabolism of living organisms. Water bears (Tardigrada), which are a mong the most resistant animals due to their cryptobiotic abilities, show significant resistance to a number of environmental stressors, but the influence of the geomagnetic field on their fitness has not been addressed before. In our studies, we used eutardigrade Hypsibius dujardini to analyse whether isolation from the geomagnetic field had an effect on mortality. We found that Hypsibius dujardini specimens demonstrated relatively high mortality during anhydrobiosis, also in control groups exposed to the normal geomagnetic field. Moreover, similar mortality was observed in anhydrobiotic specimens isolated from the geomagnetic field. However, a significant difference was noted between tardigrade survival and the moment of their isolation from the geomagnetic field. In particular, tardigrade mortality substantially increased in absence of a magnetic field during the process of entering anhydrobiosis and returning to active life. Our results suggest that these processes rely on complex metabolic processes that are critically influenced by the geomagnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W2751759220,"Population structure of three ecotypes of Oncorhynchus nerka (sea-type Sockeye Salmon, lake-type Sockeye Salmon, and Kokanee) in the Fraser River and Columbia River drainages was examined with microsatellite variation, with the main focus as to whether Kokanee population structure within the Fraser River drainage suggested either a monophyletic or polyphyletic origin of the ecotype within the drainage. Variation at 14 microsatellite loci was surveyed for sea-type and lake-type Sockeye Salmon and Kokanee sampled from 121 populations in the two river drainages. An index of genetic differentiation, FST, over all populations and loci was 0.087, with individual locus values ranging from 0.031 to 0.172. Standardized to an ecotype sample size of 275 individuals, the least genetically diverse ecotype was sea-type Sockeye Salmon with 203 alleles, whereas Kokanee displayed the greatest number of alleles (260 alleles), with lake-type Sockeye Salmon intermediate (241 alleles). Kokanee populations from the Columbia River drainage (Okanagan Lake, Kootenay Lake), the South Thompson River (a major Fraser River tributary) drainage populations, and the mid-Fraser River populations all clustered together in a neighbor-joining analysis, indicative of a monophyletic origin of the Kokanee ecotype in these regions, likely reflecting the origin of salmon radiating from a refuge after the last glaciation period. However, upstream of the mid-Fraser River populations, there were closer relationships between the lake-type Sockeye Salmon ecotype and the Kokanee ecotype, indicative of the Kokanee ecotype evolving independently from the lake-type Sockeye Salmon ecotype in parallel radiation. Kokanee population structure within the entire Fraser River drainage suggested a polyphyletic origin of the ecotype within the drainage. Studies employing geographically restricted population sampling may not outline accurately the phylogenetic history of salmonid ecotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2752743010,"Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait also experience sudden motor blocks (freezing) during other repetitive motor tasks. We assessed the proportion of patients with advanced PD and freezing of gait who also displayed segmental ""freezing"" in tapping tasks.Fifteen Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait were assessed. Freezing of gait was evaluated using a standardized gait trajectory with the usual triggers. Patients performed repetitive tapping movements (as described in the MDS-UPDRS task) with the hands or the feet in the presence or absence of a metronome set to 4 Hz. Movements were recorded with a video motion system. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of segmental freezing in these tapping tasks. The secondary endpoints were (i) the relationship between segmental episodic phenomena and FoG severity, and (ii) the reliability of the measurements.For the upper limbs, freezing was observed more frequently with a metronome (21% of trials) than without a metronome (5%). For the lower limbs, the incidence of freezing was higher than for the upper limbs, and was again observed more frequently in the presence of an auditory cue (47%) than in its absence (14%).Although freezing of the lower limbs was easily assessed during an MDS-UPDRS task with a metronome, it was not correlated with the severity of freezing of gait (as evaluated during a standardized gait trajectory). Only this latter was a reliable measurement in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2753312898,"Integration of sensory information across multiple senses is most likely to occur when signals are spatiotemporally coupled. Yet, recent research on audiovisual rate discrimination indicates that random sequences of light flashes and auditory clicks are integrated optimally regardless of temporal correlation. This may be due to 1) temporal averaging rendering temporal cues less effective; 2) difficulty extracting causal-inference cues from rapidly presented stimuli; or 3) task demands prompting integration without concern for the spatiotemporal relationship between the signals. We conducted a rate-discrimination task (Exp 1), using slower, more random sequences than previous studies, and a separate causal-judgement task (Exp 2). Unisensory and multisensory rate-discrimination thresholds were measured in Exp 1 to assess the effects of temporal correlation and spatial congruence on integration. The performance of most subjects was indistinguishable from optimal for spatiotemporally coupled stimuli, and generally sub-optimal in other conditions, suggesting observers used a multisensory mechanism that is sensitive to both temporal and spatial causal-inference cues. In Exp 2, subjects reported whether temporally uncorrelated (but spatially co-located) sequences were perceived as sharing a common source. A unified percept was affected by click-flash pattern similarity and the maximum temporal offset between individual clicks and flashes, but not on the proportion of synchronous click-flash pairs. A simulation analysis revealed that the stimulus-generation algorithms of previous studies is likely responsible for the observed integration of temporally independent sequences. By combining results from Exps 1 and 2, we found better rate-discrimination performance for sequences that are more likely to be integrated than those that are not. Our results support the principle that multisensory stimuli are optimally integrated when spatiotemporally coupled, and provide insight into the temporal features used for coupling in causal inference."
https://openalex.org/W2751476207,"Prediction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) remains a central task in systems biology. With more PPIs identified, forming PPI networks, it has become feasible and also imperative to study PPIs at the network level, such as evolutionary analysis of the networks, for better understanding of PPI networks and for more accurate prediction of pairwise PPIs by leveraging the information gained at the network level. In this work we developed a novel method that enables us to incorporate evolutionary information into geometric space to improve PPI prediction, which in turn can be used to select and evaluate various evolutionary models. The method is tested with cross-validation using human PPI network and yeast PPI network data. The results show that the accuracy of PPI prediction measured by ROC score is increased by up to 14.6%, as compared to a baseline without using evolutionary information. The results also indicate that our modified evolutionary model DANEOsf—combining a gene duplication/neofunctionalization model and scale-free model—has a better fitness and prediction efficacy for these two PPI networks. The improved PPI prediction performance may suggest that our DANEOsf evolutionary model can uncover the underlying evolutionary mechanism for these two PPI networks better than other tested models. Consequently, of particular importance is that our method offers an effective way to select evolutionary models that best capture the underlying evolutionary mechanisms, evaluating the fitness of evolutionary models from the perspective of PPI prediction on real PPI networks."
https://openalex.org/W2750832497,"Propagation-based phase-contrast computed micro-tomography (PPCT) dominates the non-destructive, three-dimensional inner-structure measurement in synchrotron-based biomedical research due to its simple experimental setup. To quantitatively visualize tiny density variations in soft tissues and organs closely related to early pathological morphology, an experimental study of synchrotron-based X-ray PPCT combined with generalized phase and attenuation duality (PAD) phase retrieval was implemented with the hepatic echinococcosis (HE) infection rat model at different stages. We quantitatively analyzed and evaluated the different pathological characterizations of hepatic echinococcosis during the development of this disease via our PAD-based PPCT and especially provided evidence that hepatic alveolar echinococcosis invades the liver tissue and spreads through blood flow systems with abundant blood supply in the early stage. Additionally, the infiltration of tiny vesicles in HE lesions can be clearly observed by our PAD-PPCT technique due to the striking contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and mass density resolution, which cannot be found by the medical imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound, in hospitals. The results demonstrated that our PAD-PPCT technique has a great potential for indicating the subtle structural information of pathological changes in soft biomedical specimens, especially helpful for the research of early micro-morphology of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2751568963,"The T allele of rs7927894 (at 11q13.5) was associated with atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases. Our purpose was to replicate the association with allergic phenotypes and explore the role of rs7927894 in predisposing to persistent allergic rhinitis and atopic asthma. We also wanted to explore if other SNPs at 11q13.5 contributed to effect of rs7927894. We studied patients with atopic dermatitis (N = 270), atopic asthma (N = 486), persistent allergic rhinitis (N = 589) and controls matched for age, sex and region (N = 540, N = 372 and N = 1178, respectively). We found that rs7927894 T was associated with atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.39, CI: 1.12-1.73, P = 0.003) and independently with persistent allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.24, CI:1.07-1.43, P = 0.0043, Pcorrected = 0.013) but not atopic asthma. Analysis of additional tagging SNPs (rs7930763, rs2513517, rs7125552) showed that effect of rs7927894 T was limited to haplotypes encoding G at rs7125552. In conclusion, rs7927894 T is associated not only with atopic dermatitis but also persistent allergic rhinitis. Since these effects are haplotype dependent rs7927894 alone does not account for the association between 11q13.5 and atopic dermatitis/persistent allergic rhinitis."
https://openalex.org/W2753458578,"Learning is an intentional activity, with several factors affecting students’ intention to use new learning technology. Researchers have investigated technology acceptance in different contexts by developing various theories/models and testing them by a number of means. Although most theories/models developed have been examined through regression or structural equation modeling, Bayesian analysis offers more accurate data analysis results. To address this gap, the unified theory of acceptance and technology use in the context of e-learning via Facebook are re-examined in this study using Bayesian analysis. The data (S1 Data) were collected from 170 students enrolled in a business statistics course at University of Malaya, Malaysia, and tested with the maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches. The difference between the two methods’ results indicates that performance expectancy and hedonic motivation are the strongest factors influencing the intention to use e-learning via Facebook. The Bayesian estimation model exhibited better data fit than the maximum likelihood estimator model. The results of the Bayesian and maximum likelihood estimator approaches are compared and the reasons for the result discrepancy are deliberated."
https://openalex.org/W2752394639,"This study investigated the potential role of sirtuin 1 in Müller glial cells in choroidal neovascularization. In the in vitro study, primary Müller glial cells were cultured and treated with resveratrol, a sirtuin 1 activator. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression and angiogenesis-related gene expression were examined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and phagocytosis, as a marker of Müller glial cell function; in addition, a latex bead assay was used to analyze cell function. For the in vivo study, choroidal neovascularization was induced in C57BL/6 mice via laser photocoagulation, and resveratrol was administered intravitreally. Eyecup whole mounts were created to measure choroidal neovascularization volumes on day 7. Immunohistochemical analysis with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody was used to detect Müller glial cell activation in eyes with choroidal neovascularization on day 1, 3, 5, and 7 after laser surgery. Resveratrol significantly promoted glial fibrillary acidic protein, anti-angiogenic factor, pigment epithelium-derived factor, and thrombospondin-1 expression in the cells as well as the phagocytic activities. Treatment of the choroidal neovascularization model with resveratrol resulted in early activation of Müller glial cells near choroidal neovascularization sites. Resveratrol-activated cells but not the controls migrated to the top of choroidal neovascularization sites and into the lesions from day 3. Resveratrol reduced the choroidal neovascularization size relative to controls. In conclusion, sirtuin 1 activation in Müller glial cells suppressed the development of choroidal neovascularization, and therefore, might be a therapeutic option."
https://openalex.org/W2752881997,"Mass migrations by Odonata, although less studied than those of Monarch butterflies and plague locusts, have provoked comment and study for many years. Relatively recently, increasing interest in dragonflies, supported by new technologies, has resulted in more detailed knowledge of the species involved, behavioral mechanisms, and geographic extent. In this paper we examine, in four independent but complementary studies, how larval habitat and emergence phenology interact with climate to shape the evolution of migratory strategy in Anax junius, a common species throughout much of the eastern United States and southern Canada. In brief, we argue that fish predation on larvae, coupled with the need for ample emergent vegetation for oviposition and adult eclosion, dictates that larval development and survival is optimal in ponds that are neither permanent nor extremely ephemeral. Coupled with annual variation in regional weather and winters in much of their range too cold for adult survival, conditions facing newly emerged A. junius may unpredictably favor either local reproduction or long-distance movement to more favorable areas. Both temperature and hydroperiod tend to favor local reproduction early in the adult activity period and migration later, so late emerging adults are more likely to migrate. No single pond is always predictably suitable or unsuitable, however, so ovipositing females also may spread the risk to their offspring by ovipositing at multiple sites that, for migrants, may be distributed over very long distances."
https://openalex.org/W2753593964,"Background Gingivo-buccal squamous cell carcinoma (GBSCC) is one of the most common oral cavity cancers in India with less than 50% patients surviving past 5 years. Here, we report a whole transcriptome profile on a batch of GBSCC tumours with diverse tobacco usage habits. The study provides an entire landscape of altered expression with an emphasis on searching for targets with therapeutic potential. Methods Whole transcriptomes of 12 GBSCC tumours and adjacent normal tissues were sequenced and analysed to explore differential expression of genes. Expression changes were further compared with those in TCGA head and neck cohort (n = 263) data base and validated in an independent set of 10GBSCC samples. Results Differentially expressed genes (n = 2176) were used to cluster the patients based on their tobacco habits, resulting in 3 subgroups. Immune response was observed to be significantly aberrant, along with cell adhesion and lipid metabolism processes. Different modes of immune evasion were seen across 12 tumours with up-regulation or consistent expression of CD47, unlike other immune evasion genes such as PDL1, FUT4, CTLA4 and BTLA which were downregulated in a few samples. Variation in infiltrating immune cell signatures across tumours also indicates heterogeneity in immune evasion strategies. A few actionable genes such as ITGA4, TGFB1 and PTGS1/COX1 were over expressed in most samples. Conclusion This study found expression deregulation of key immune evasion genes, such as CD47 and PDL1, and reasserts their potential as effective immunotherapeutic targets for GBSCC, which requires further clinical studies. Present findings reiterate the idea of using transcriptome profiling to guide precision therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2752072250,"Domestication is known to strongly reduce genomic diversity through population bottlenecks. The resulting loss of polymorphism has been thoroughly documented in numerous cultivated species. Here we investigate the impact of domestication on the diversity of alternative transcript expressions using RNAseq data obtained on cultivated and wild sorghum accessions (ten accessions for each pool). In that aim, we focus on genes expressing two isoforms in sorghum and estimate the ratio between expression levels of those isoforms in each accession. Noticeably, for a given gene, one isoform can either be overexpressed or underexpressed in some wild accessions, whereas in the cultivated accessions, the balance between the two isoforms of the same gene appears to be much more homogenous. Indeed, we observe in sorghum significantly more variation in isoform expression balance among wild accessions than among domesticated accessions. The possibility exists that the loss of nucleotide diversity due to domestication could affect regulatory elements, controlling transcription or degradation of these isoforms. Impact on the isoform expression balance is discussed. As far as we know, this is the first time that the impact of domestication on transcript isoform balance has been studied at the genomic scale. This could pave the way towards the identification of key domestication genes with finely tuned isoform expressions in domesticated accessions while being highly variable in their wild relatives."

https://openalex.org/W2752562985,"A plant’s performance and interactions with other trophic levels are recorgnized to be contingent upon plant diversity and underlying associational dynamics, but far less is known about the plant traits driving such phenomena. We manipulated diversity in plant traits using pairs of plant and a substitutive design to elucidate the mechanisms underlying diversity effects operating at a fine spatial scale. Specifically, we measured the effects of diversity in sex (sexual monocultures vs. male and female genotypes together) and growth rate (growth rate monocultures vs. fast- and slow-growing genotypes together) on growth of the shrub Baccharis salicifolia and on above- and belowground consumers associated with this plant. We compared effects on associate abundance (# associates per plant) vs. density (# associates per kg plant biomass) to elucidate the mechanisms underlying diversity effects; effects on abundance but not density suggest diversity effects are mediated by resource abundance (i.e. plant biomass) alone, whereas effects on density suggest diversity effects are mediated by plant-based heterogeneity or quality. Sexual diversity increased root growth but reduced the density (but not abundance) of the dietary generalist aphid Aphis gossypii and its associated aphid-tending ants, suggesting sex mixtures were of lower quality to this herbivore (e.g. via reduced plant quality), and that this effect indirectly influenced ants. Sexual diversity had no effect on the abundance or density of parasitoids attacking A. gossypii, the dietary specialist aphid Uroleucon macolai, or mycorrhizae. In contrast, growth rate diversity did not influence plant growth or any associates except for the dietary specialist aphid U. macolai, which increased in both abundance and density at high diversity, suggesting growth rate mixtures were of higher quality to this herbivore. These results highlight that plant associational and diversity effects on consumers are contingent upon the source of plant trait variation, and that the nature of such dynamics may vary both within and among trophic levels."
https://openalex.org/W2751004058,"Background Mosaicism and hyperinflation are common pathophysiologic features of bronchiectasis. The magnitude of ventilation heterogeneity might have been affected by the degree of hyperinflation. Some studies have evaluated the discriminative performance of lung clearance index (LCI) in bronchiectasis patients, but the additive diagnostic value of hyperinflation metrics to LCI is unknown. Objective To compare LCI and the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity (RV/TLC), along with the LCI normalized with RV/TLC, in terms of discriminative performance, correlation and concordance with clinical variables in adults with bronchiectasis. Methods Measurement items included chest high-resolution computed tomography, multiple-breath nitrogen washout test, spirometry, and sputum culture. We analyzed bronchodilator responses by stratifying LCI and RV/TLC according to their median levels (LCIHigh/RV/TLCHigh, LCILow/RV/TLCHigh, LCIHigh/RV/TLCLow, and LCILow/RV/TLCLow). Results Data from 127 adults with clinically stable bronchiectasis were analyzed. LCI had greater diagnostic value than RV/TLC in discriminating moderate-to-severe from mild bronchiectasis, had greater concordance in reflecting clinical characteristics (including the number of bronchiectatic lobes, radiological severity score, and the presence of cystic bronchiectasis). Normalization of LCI with RV/TLC did not contribute to greater discriminative performance or concordance with clinical variables. The LCI, before and after normalization with RV/TLC, correlated statistically with age, sex, HRCT score, Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, cystic bronchiectasis, and ventilation heterogeneity (all P<0.05). Different bronchodilator responses were not significant among the four subgroups of bronchiectasis patients, including those with discordant LCI and RV/TLC levels. Conclusion LCI is superior to RV/TLC for bronchiectasis assessment. Normalization with RV/TLC is not required. Stratification of LCI and RV/TLC is not associated with significantly different bronchodilator responses."
