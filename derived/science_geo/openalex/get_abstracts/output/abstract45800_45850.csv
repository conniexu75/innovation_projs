https://openalex.org/W2149051154,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is frequently amplified and/or overexpressed in human malignancies. To investigate the biological effects of its overexpression, we constructed a eukaryotic vector containing human EGFR cDNA. Introduction of this construct led to reconstitution of functional EGF receptors in NR6 mutant cells, which are normally devoid of this receptor. Transfection of NIH 3T3 resulted in no significant alterations in growth properties. However, EGF addition led to the formation of densely growing transformed foci in liquid culture and colonies in semisolid medium. NIH 3T3-EGFR clonal lines, which expressed the EGF at 500- to 1000-fold levels over control NIH 3T3 cells, demonstrated a marked increase in DNA synthesis in response to EGF. Thus EGF receptor overexpression appears to amplify normal EGF signal transduction. Finally, high levels of EGFR expression, which conferred a transformed phenotype to NIH 3T3 cells in the presence of ligand, were demonstrated in representative human tumor cell lines that contained amplified copies of the EGFR gene."
https://openalex.org/W2089741493,"Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have introduced mutations encoding 17 different amino acids at codon 61 of the human rasH gene. Fifteen of these substitutions increased rasH transforming activity. The remaining two mutants, encoding proline and glutamic acid, displayed transforming activities similar to the normal gene. Overall, these mutants vary over 1000-fold in transforming potency. Increased levels of p21 expression were required for transformation by weakly transforming mutants. The mutant proteins were unaltered in guanine nucleotide binding properties. However, all 17 different mutant proteins displayed equivalently reduced rates of GTP hydrolysis, 8- to 10-fold lower than the normal protein. There was no quantitative correlation between reduction in GTPase activity and transformation, indicating that reduced GTP hydrolysis is not sufficient to activate ras transforming potential."
https://openalex.org/W2049672602,"The orderly and sequential activation of genes during development is hypothesized to be related to the selective expression of groups of regulatory proteins acting primarily at the level of transcription. A nuclear protein was found in hepatocytes, but not other cell types, that binds to a sequence required for hepatocyte-specific transcription of the gene for the beta chain of fibrinogen. This protein, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1), also interacts with homologous sequences required for optimal promoter function of the genes for the alpha chain of fibrinogen and alpha 1-antitrypsin. The promoter or enhancer regions for several viral and cellular genes not expressed in the liver did not compete for this binding. The restricted expression of HNF1 and its selective interaction with the control regions of several liver-specific genes indicate that it is involved in developmentally regulated gene expression in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2015349792,"The initial event in the infection of human T lymphocytes, macrophages, and other cells by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is the attachment of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 to its cellular receptor, CD4. As a step toward designing antagonists of this binding event, soluble, secreted forms of CD4 were produced by transfection of mammalian cells with vectors encoding versions of CD4 lacking its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The soluble CD4 so produced binds gp120 with an affinity and specificity comparable to intact CD4 and is capable of neutralizing the infectivity of HIV-1. These studies reveal that the high-affinity CD4-gp120 interaction does not require other cell or viral components and may establish a novel basis for therapeutic intervention in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
https://openalex.org/W1974027176,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor gene EGFR has been placed in a retrovirus vector to examine the growth properties of cells that experimentally overproduce a full-length EGF receptor. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the viral DNA or infected with the corresponding rescued retrovirus developed a fully transformed phenotype in vitro that required both functional EGFR expression and the presence of EGF in the growth medium. Cells expressing 4 x 10(5) EGF receptors formed tumors in nude mice, while control cells did not. Therefore, the EGFR retrovirus, which had a titer on NIH 3T3 cells that was greater than 10(7) focus-forming units per milliliter, can efficiently transfer and express this gene, and increased numbers of EGF receptors can contribute to the transformed phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2114242966,"Transgenic mice carrying the murine granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene expressed from a retroviral promoter exhibit elevated levels of GM-CSF in the serum, urine, peritoneal cavity, and eye. The eyes of transgenic mice are opaque, contain accumulations of macrophages, and develop retinal damage. Similarly, lesions containing macrophages develop in striated muscle. The mice also display an accumulation of large, often multinucleate, activated macrophages in the peritoneal and pleural cavities. The transgene is transcribed in peritoneal cells, as well as in eyes and infiltrated striated muscle. A high proportion of transgenic mice die with muscle wasting when aged 2-4 months, possibly because of macrophage activation resulting from the high levels of GM-CSF."
https://openalex.org/W2123274418,"To identify gene products that function stoichiometrically in mitotic chromosome transmission, genes were cloned on high copy number plasmids and transformed into yeast cells, and the transformants were examined for an increase in the frequency of mitotic chromosome loss or recombination resulting from the gene imbalance. When either pair of the yeast histone genes H2A and H2B, or H3 and H4 was present on high copy number plasmids, both chromosomes V and VII exhibited an increased frequency of chromosome loss. The rate of chromosome loss was not elevated when the histone genes were present on single copy plasmids, when their transcription from high copy plasmids was repressed, or when frame-shift mutations were present in the coding sequence. This method for the identification of genes circumvents some of the limitations of traditional mutational analysis and yields the cloned gene."

https://openalex.org/W1573160214,"The biochemical defect in the mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines Clone 13 (Briles, E. B., Li, E., and Kornfeld, S. (1977). J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1107-1116) and Lec8 (Stanley, P. (1980) ACS Symp. Ser. 128, 214-221) was examined. These two mutants, which belong to the same genetic complementation group, were shown in previous studies to exhibit an 80-90% reduction in galactosylation and sialylation of proteins and lipids when compared to wild-type cells. The same studies, however, demonstrated that the mutants were not deficient in the corresponding sugar nucleotides, glycosyltransferases, and endogenous acceptors for these transferases. We now provide evidence strongly suggesting that the primary defect in Lec8 and Clone 13 cells is their inability to translocate UDP-galactose into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. Golgi vesicles from Lec8 and Clone 13 CHO glycosylation mutants translocate in vitro UDP-galactose at only 3-5% the rate of vesicles from wild-type CHO cells. The deficiency is specific because vesicles from the mutant cells can translocate adenosine 3‘-phosphate 5‘-phosphosulfate, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine at rates comparable to those of vesicles from wild-type cells. These studies also suggest that sugar nucleotides sharing a common uridine nucleotide utilize different translocators present in the Golgi membrane in vivo. The consequence of the above-described mutations and the resulting block in galactosylation of macromolecules in vivo on the translocation of CMP-sialic acid into the Golgi lumen was also examined. As expected, Golgi apparatus vesicles from Lec8 cells were unable to incorporate sialic acid into (endogenous) macromolecules. However, the vesicles were able to transport CMP-sialic acid into their lumen, although the rate of translocation was only 17% of that of wild-type-derived Golgi vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2053788986,"A novel T cell receptor (TCR) subunit termed TCR delta, associated with TCR gamma and CD3 polypeptides, was recently found on a subpopulation of human T lymphocytes. T cell-specific complementary DNA clones present in a human TCR gamma delta T cell complementary DNA library were obtained and characterized in order to identify candidate clones encoding TCR delta. One cross-hybridizing group of clones detected transcripts that are expressed in lymphocytes bearing TCR gamma delta but not in other T lymphocytes and are encoded by genes that are rearranged in TCR gamma delta lymphocytes but deleted in other T lymphocytes. Their sequences indicate homology to the variable, joining, and constant elements of other TCR and immunoglobulin genes. These characteristics, as well as the immunochemical data presented in a companion paper, are strong evidence that the complementary DNA clones encode TCR delta."
https://openalex.org/W1598595464,"ADP and ATP, in the 1-100 microM range of concentrations, increased the formation of inositol phosphates in bovine aortic endothelial cells. The accumulation of inositol trisphosphate in response to adenine nucleotides was rapid (maximum at 15 s) and transient. This material was identified as the biologically active isomer inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate on the basis of its retention time by high-performance liquid chromatography on an anion-exchange resin. AMP and adenosine have no effect on inositol phosphates. The action of ATP and ADP was mimicked with an equal potency and activity by their phosphorothioate analogs, ATP gamma S and ADP beta S, and with a lower potency by adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate, whereas adenosine 5'-(alpha,beta-methylene)triphosphate, was inactive. In the same range of concentrations, ADP and ATP induced an efflux of 45Ca2+ from prelabeled bovine aortic endothelial cells and increased the fluorescence emission by cells loaded with quin-2. Here, too, AMP and adenosine were completely inactive. The outflow of 45Ca2+ induced by ADP was partially maintained in a calcium-free medium. These data suggest that in aortic endothelial cells, P2-purinergic receptors, of the P2Y subtype, are coupled to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate by a phospholipase C. It is likely that the release of prostacyclin and endothelium-derived relaxing factor in response to ADP and ATP is a consequence of this initial event."

https://openalex.org/W2065019097,"A comparison of independent cultured isolates of Plasmodium falciparum revealed that while chromosome number was constant, the sizes of analogous chromosomes varied widely. We show here that chromosome size polymorphisms are not generated during differentiation of the asexual blood stages, as the molecular karyotype of a cloned parasite line is constant through this part of the life cycle. Experiments using whole P. falciparum chromosomes as hybridization probes to examine polymorphisms within two independent parasite populations indicate that the polymorphisms observed here are not the consequence of large-scale interchromosomal exchanges, and imply that deletions/duplications represent one mode of generating chromosome length polymorphisms. Although the deletions probably involve repetitive DNA, we show here that structural genes for P. falciparum antigens can also be lost. Furthermore, these dramatic size polymorphisms occur not only in cultured lines of P. falciparum, but with surprising frequency in natural malarial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2129795201,"Interleukin 1 (IL-1), a monocyte product, exerts a range of biological effects on nonimmune cells such as fibroblasts and chondrocytes including stimulation of synthesis and release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and collagenase. We have previously shown that crude mononuclear cell-conditioned medium, which contains IL-1, also stimulates synthesis of types I and III collagens by human synovial and dermal fibroblasts and chondrocytes when the formation of PGE2, which inhibits collagen synthesis, is blocked by indomethacin. To determine whether IL-1 is responsible for the affects observed using crude monocyte-conditioned medium patterns of collagen synthesis in the three types of human cells in response to recombinant preparations of IL-1 were compared. Preincubation of chondrocytes or synovial fibroblasts with either murine (m)IL-1 alpha or human (h)IL-1 beta alone decreased synthesis of type I collagen and fibronectin. In contrast, when endogenous IL-1-stimulated PGE2 synthesis was blocked by indomethacin, an enhancing effect of IL-1 on synthesis of these matrix proteins was unmasked. The synthesis of type III collagen was enhanced by IL-1 to a greater extent than that of type I collagen in the presence of indomethacin. In human foreskin fibroblasts, which produced low levels of PGE2 even in the presence of IL-1, synthesis of types I and III collagens was increased by IL-1 either in the absence or presence of indomethacin. These cells were more responsive to the hIL-1 beta preparation than to the mIL-1 alpha (half-maximal stimulation of PGE2 production was observed at approximately 2.5-5 pM hIL-1 beta and at approximately 2.5 nM mIL-1 alpha). Levels of alpha 1 (I), alpha 2(I), and alpha 1(III) procollagen mRNAs measured by cytoplasmic dot hybridization paralleled the levels of collagens synthesized under the various experimental conditions. IL-1, therefore, is one product of monocytes capable of modulating collagen synthesis by these human mesenchymal cells probably by altering collagen gene expression. These studies suggest that both positive (IL-1) and negative (PGE2) signals may control collagen synthesis at the transcriptional level resulting in modulation of matrix turnover in cartilage, synovium, and skin."
https://openalex.org/W1577631465,"Abstract The ability of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and angiotensin II to stimulate production of inositol trisphosphate and mobilize intracellular Ca2+ in hepatocytes was compared using quin2 fluorescence to monitor changes in Ca2+ levels and high performance liquid chromatography to resolve the inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) isomers. Both EGF and angiotensin II stimulated an increase in free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) as well as a rapid increase in the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). Concentrations of angiotensin II which gave a rise in [Ca2+]i equivalent to that seen with maximal doses of EGF produced an equivalent increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation. Both EGF and angiotensin II stimulated the formation of the Ins(1,3,4)P3 and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate isomers. The formation of the Ins(1,3,4)P3 isomer lagged behind production of Ins(1,4,5)P3 but eventually reached higher levels in the cell. The initial rise in [Ca2+]i and InsP3 levels stimulated by EGF and angiotensin II was not affected by reducing the external Ca2+ concentration below 30 nM with an excess of [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)] tetraacetic acid. Treatment of hepatocytes for 30-180 s with 1 micrograms/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate prior to the addition of EGF blocked the EGF-stimulated production of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and the increase in [Ca2+]i. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate attenuated the production of Ins(1,4,5)P3 generated by angiotensin II over the concentration range of 10(-10) to 10(-8) M; however, the Ca2+ signal was only inhibited at the 10(-10) M dose of angiotensin II. Treatment of rats with pertussis toxin for 72 h prior to isolating hepatocytes blocked the ability of EGF to increase Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4)P3 but did not inhibit the ability of any concentration of angiotensin II to stimulate formation of InsP3 or inositol tetrakisphosphate. The observation that pertussis toxin selectively abolishes EGF-stimulated inositol lipid breakdown suggests that EGF and angiotensin II use different mechanisms to activate phospholipase C in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2010670547,Two different assays for B cell growth factors (BCGF) and an antibody against lymphotoxin were used to show that the presence of lymphotoxin in conditioned media derived from normal activated T cells and in a partially purified BCGF accounts for a substantial portion of their B cell growth-promoting activity. A competitive binding assay confirmed the presence of significant amounts of lymphotoxin in the partially purified BCGF. Recombinant lymphotoxin enhanced the proliferation of activated B cells and augmented B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion induced by interleukin-2.
https://openalex.org/W1587194145,"Cell envelopes of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli were disrupted in a French pressure cell and fractionated by successive cycles of sedimentation and floatation density gradient centrifugation. This permitted the identification and isolation of several membrane fractions in addition to the major inner membrane and murein-outer membrane fractions. One of these fractions (fraction OML) accounted for about 10% of the total cell envelope protein, and is likely to include the murein-membrane adhesion zones that are seen in electron micrographs of plasmolyzed cells. Fraction OML contained inner membrane, murein, and outer membrane in an apparently normal configuration, was capable of synthesizing murein from UDP-[3H]N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-N-acetylmuramylpentapeptide and covalently linking it to the endogenous murein of the preparation, and showed a labeling pattern in [3H]galactose pulse-chase experiments that was consistent with its acting as an intermediate in the movement of newly synthesized lipopolysaccharide from inner membrane to outer membrane. The fractionation procedure also identified two new minor membrane fractions, with characteristic protein patterns, that are usually included in the region of the major inner membrane peak in other fractionation procedures but can be separated from the major inner membrane fraction and from contaminating flagellar fragments by the subsequent floatation centrifugation steps."
https://openalex.org/W2009632063,"We have identified circular DNA containing T cell receptor (TCR) β gene sequences in mouse thymocytes, thereby providing direct evidence for the intramolecular DNA deletion model of V-D-J joining in TCR β genes. Two types of excision products of V-D-J joining have been identified. Type I, a circular reciprocal recombinant of normal V-D or D-J joining, contains a 7mer-7mer head-to-head structure expected from an excised product of normal V-D or D-J joining. Type II contains a Dβ2-Jβ1 structure on the circular DNA; the recombination event producing this molecule occurs between an upstream J and a downstream D segment, probably leaving the reciprocal 7mer-7mer structure on the chromosome. Some type I molecules seem to represent excision products of secondary joining after formation of the first D-J or V-D-J structure. The recombination mechanism that generates the circular DNA is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2132611765,"We describe the phenotypes caused by a cold-sensitive lethal mutation (ndc1-1) that defines the NDC1 gene of yeast. Incubation of ndc1-1 at a nonpermissive temperature causes failure of chromosome separation in mitosis but does not block the cell cycle. This defect results in an asymmetric cell division in which one daughter cell doubles in ploidy and the other inherits no chromosomes. The spindle poles are properly segregated to the two daughter cells. The primary visible defect is that the chromosomes remain associated with only one pole, and are thus delivered to one daughter cell. Meiosis II, but not meiosis I, is sensitive to the ndc1-1 defect, suggesting that NDC1 is required for some feature common to mitosis and meiosis II. ndc1-1 appears to define a new class of cell cycle gene required for the attachment of chromosomes to the spindle pole."
https://openalex.org/W1498021746,"Levels of phospholipid/Ca2+-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C, 80 kDa) and its presumed proteolytic fragments were quantified in a variety of animal tissues and cultured human leukemic cell lines (HL60 and K562) using an immunoblot analysis technique. Of many tissues examined, the rat brain and HL60 cells were by far the richest sources of the 80-kDa native enzyme, with its concentration estimated to be about 2-3 microM in both tissues. The major enzyme species detected in most tissues, however, was the 67-kDa fragment; the 80-kDa native enzyme was present in a smaller amount except in spleen which contained nearly equal amounts of both enzyme species. It was also found that HL60 and K562 leukemic cells contained the 50-kDa species instead of the 67-kDa species. A study of the subcellular distribution of the 80- and 67-kDa species showed the enzyme to be localized predominantly in the soluble fraction for some tissues (e.g. heart) and nearly equally distributed between soluble and particulate fractions in others (e.g. spleen). In the brain, however, the majority of the enzyme was present in the particulate fraction, in agreement with the findings made with immunocytochemical localization of the enzyme. The total enzyme content in developing rat brain and heart increased during the first 2 to 4 weeks following birth and decreased to 60% of peak levels in the adult. The present immunological method, showing for the first time that the tissue levels of phospholipid/Ca2+-dependent protein kinase and its fragments can be quantitated, would be useful for studies on the regulation of cellular events and pathophysiology of tissues thought to be involved in this multi-functional protein phosphorylation system."
https://openalex.org/W2159865318,Two DNA sequences that reduce mitotic fidelity of chromosome transmission have been identified: MIF1 and MIF2. MIF1 is a unique sequence located on the right arm of chromosome XII that stimulates loss and recombination for both chromosomes V and VII when present in a high copy number plasmid. MIF1 is not essential for cell division but is necessary for the normal fidelity of chromosome transmission. MIF2 is a unique sequence located 15 cM distal to HIS6 on chromosome IX that induces a high frequency of chromosome VII loss and a lower frequency of chromosome V loss when present in high copy number; it has no effect on mitotic recombination. Disruption of the genomic MIF2 locus was lethal and cells lacking this function arrested division with a terminal phenotype characteristic of a block in DNA replication or nuclear division.

https://openalex.org/W36851002,"Abstract We have previously shown that membranes from the retinal pigment epithelium can transform added all-trans-retinol into a mixture of 11-cis-retinoids, demonstrating the missing reaction in the visual cycle for the first time (Bernstein, P. S., Law, W. C., and Rando, R. R. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 1849-1853). In this article, this isomerase activity is further characterized. Double-label experiments with [15-3H]- and [15-14C]all-trans-retinol as the substrate show that the tritium label is retained in the 11-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinyl palmitate products. This requires that isomerization occur at the alcohol level of oxidation. All-trans-retinyl esters, such as the palmitate, acetate, butyrate, and hexanoate esters, are not directly transformed into their 11-cis counterparts by the membranes. The data are consistent with the presence of an all-trans-retinol isomerase enzyme system or enzyme complex, which produces 11-cis-retinol. Other isomeric retinols were tested for substrate activity. Neither 9-cis-retinol(al) nor 13-cis-retinol were processed by the isomerase. Since the membranes containing the isomerase possess other retinol metabolizing activities, such as retinyl ester synthetase and dehydrogenase activities, further purification was attempted. Appreciable quantities of all detergents tested led to the disappearance of isomerase activity, and high salt or EDTA did not dissociate isomerase activity from the membranes. However, extensive sonication of the membranes did produce a 100,000 x g supernatant fraction of light membranes depleted of other all-trans-retinol processing activities. The isomerase activity in these membranes was saturable with all-trans-retinol, as required for a biologically significant process, and showed a Vmax of 5 pmol/h/mg of protein, a KM of 0.8 microM, and a pH optimum of 8. The isomerase was destroyed by proteinase K, by phospholipase C, by heating, or by ethanol at concentrations greater than 1%. The addition of high energy compounds, such as MgATP, MgGTP, or palmitoyl-CoA, did not appear to stimulate isomerase activity in the 100,000 x g supernatant."

These v-myc-expressing bursal cells repopulate the follicles of chemically ablated bursae more efficiently than total normal 18-day embryonic bursal cells. In contrast, comparable normal bursal cells lose the ability to repopulate follicles by four weeks. Bursal lymphocytes expressing either a retroviral v-myc or a c-myc gene deregulated by adjacent retroviral integration retain the ability of embryonic bursal lymphocytes to diversify their immunoglobulin light chain genes. These results suggest that retroviral deregulation of myc expression during avian B cell development induces outgrowth of a population of cells with the cardinal phenotypic characteristics of bursal stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W146030539,"Employing the rabbit liver progesterone-21-hydroxylase P-450 1 cDNA as a probe (Tukey, R.H., Okino, S., Barnes, H., Griffin, K.J., and Johnson, E.F. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 13347-13354), we have identified a highly homologous (81% within the coding region) human liver cDNA, termed Hp1-1, that encodes a 490-amino acid protein. Comparison of the predicted translation products between the human and rabbit homologues demonstrates that the two proteins are 73% homologous, while increasing to 82% similarity when allowing for conserved amino changes. The human P-450 1 is 82% homologous to the s-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylase (Umbenhauer, D. R., Martin, M. V., Lloyd, R. S., and Guengerich, F. P. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 1094-1099). Southern blot analysis using various portions of the human P-450 1 cDNA as probes indicates that the human P-450 1 gene is part of a larger gene family but can be selectively identified by using a 3'-noncoding portion of the cDNA. Identification of the gene from a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrids using the conserved 3' portion of the human P-450 1 cDNA as a probe places the location of the gene on human chromosome 10. Results are also presented which demonstrate that the human P-450 1 gene transcript is processed by an alternate RNA-splicing mechanism that generates two mRNA products, one which represents the functional transcript, and the other a form of mRNA that is not capable of encoding a functional P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1548505291,"Two mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb), AJ2 and J143, define two related human cell surface protein complexes, very common antigen 1 (VCA-1) and very common antigen 2 (VCA-2). In the present report, these complexes have been defined with respect to: (i) subunit arrangement; (ii) monoclonal antibody binding sites; (iii) carbohydrate content; (iv) homology to other cell surface protein complexes; and (v) possible functional roles. Analysis of the antigens from a human melanoma cell line, MeWo, reveals that VCA-1 is a noncovalently linked heterodimer of 170- and 140 (designated 1401)-kDa polypeptides. mAb AJ2 reacts with an epitope on the 1401-kDa polypeptide. VCA-2 is composed of the same 1401-kDa polypeptide as VCA-1 and another 170-kDa species; this 170-kDa species consists of a second distinct 140-kDa (designated 140(2)) and a 30-kDa polypeptide which are disulfide-bonded. Indirect evidence indicates that mAb J143 reacts with an epitope on this 170-kDa complex. Peptide mapping has shown that the complexes are members of a family of cell surface proteins that include antigens present on activated T cells (designated very late activation antigens). Since VCA-2 is found predominantly on the basal membrane of adherent cells and its expression increases 12-fold when HUT-102 lymphoblastoid cells are grown as an adherent cell culture, we suggest that VCA-2 plays a role in cellular adherence."
https://openalex.org/W1496605486,"The tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor was examined in fat cells made insulin resistant by hyperinsulinemia. Adipocytes previously treated for 16 h in vitro with 0.1 microM insulin were markedly insensitive to insulin as shown by the requirement of 2.3-fold higher concentration of insulin to stimulate half-maximal activation of glucose metabolism (glucose oxidation and glucose conversion to lipids). A similar rightward shift in the insulin dose-response curve was also evident for an insulin action not dependent on glucose metabolism, i.e. the inhibition of hormone-stimulated lipolysis. The almost 60% loss of insulin sensitivity occurred in conjunction with a 37% loss in insulin-binding activity, an alteration caused by a reduction in the number of insulin receptors. Studies of tyrosine kinase activity demonstrated a preferential alteration in this insulin receptor property, in addition to the receptor loss. The insulin-stimulated Vmax for the phosphorylation of the artificial substrate, Glu80-Tyr20, was significantly reduced by almost 40%, when the activity was expressed per insulin binding and measured in a receptor preparation purified by wheat germ affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation. An elevation in basal tyrosine kinase activity was also present, which correlated with a lower apparent Km for ATP (0.025 mM) in comparison to the Km of 0.070 mM for the receptors from control cells. These findings indicate the presence of two types of alterations that involve the insulin receptor and hyperinsulinemia: one constituted by a modest reduction in receptor number and a second by modifications in the tyrosine kinase activity of the remaining receptors. Both alterations are required to explain the magnitude of the insulin resistance that develops after 16 h of insulin treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1515821123,"We have purified two membrane glycoproteins from chicken gizzard smooth muscle. In the presence of reducing agents, these proteins have molecular weights on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 165,000 and 130,000, but they migrate at 165,000 and 110,000 without reduction. The two proteins can also be isolated as a complex in buffers containing physiologic salt concentrations. This complex has physical properties similar to two proteins of the integrin family of receptors for extracellular matrix proteins, the cell substratum attachment antigen from chicken embryos, and the glycoprotein IIb IIIa complex from mammalian platelets. When the smooth muscle complex is visualized by electron microscopy, it has a striking resemblance to both avian integrin and the glycoprotein IIb IIIa complex. Smooth muscle is a good source of the 165,000 and 130,000 proteins, and purification of both the individual subunits and the complex is achieved using conventional biochemical techniques. Antibodies directed against the 130,000 protein cross-react with integrin but do not cross-react with the 165,000 protein. Immunofluorescence microscopy using these antibodies reveals staining of fibroblast focal contacts and fibrillar streaks which coalign with fibronectin. Whereas monoclonal antibodies against integrin label the periphery of the focal contact more intensely than the center, the anti-130,000-protein serum stains the entire focal contact. Antibodies directed against the 165,000 protein also stain focal contacts and fibrillar streaks of fibroblasts in tissue culture. On the basis of similar physical properties, biochemical characteristics, and immunological cross-reactivity we conclude that the 165,000/130,000 complex is a smooth muscle integrin."
https://openalex.org/W2080003392,"DNA-nuclear protein interactions were studied with synthetic recombination signal sequences (RSSs) for immunoglobulin V-J joining. With a gel retardation assay, a DNA-binding protein that specifically interacts with RSSs was detected in nuclear extracts from a pre-B cell line, 38B9. This protein was found in all the recombination-competent pre-B cell lines tested in this study, but not in myeloma, mature T cell, monocyte, or fibroblast cell lines. DNA footprint analysis with dimethyl sulfate demonstrated that the 7-mer region of the RSS was strongly protected when complexed with the binding protein. Furthermore, a single base substitution in the 7-mer region totally abolished the binding. The molecular mechanism of V-J joining is discussed in the context of the RSS-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1512862681,"The signal peptide generated during the maturation of prolipoprotein by the purified prolipoprotein signal peptidase can be isolated in substrate amounts (Dev, I. K., and Ray, P. H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 11114-11120). This signal peptide is degraded predominantly from the carboxyl terminus by cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli. The signal peptide is degraded (at least 300-fold) more rapidly than other cellular proteins in E. coli. Greater than 90% of the signal peptide hydrolase activity is localized in the cytoplasm. Two enzymes from the cytoplasmic fraction responsible for the degradation of the signal peptide have been identified and purified to near homogeneity. The major activity is associated with a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 68,000 (S.E. 3,400) as determined by gel filtration and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This enzyme appears to be similar to the oligopeptidase (Vimr, E. R., Green, L., and Miller, C. G. (1983) J. Bacteriol. 153, 1259-1265) that hydrolyzes N-acetyl tetra alanine. The second protein represents approximately 5% of the total cytoplasmic activity and has been shown to be a dimer with a monomer molecular weight of 81,000 (S.E. 5,300). This enzyme is similar to protease So (Chung, H. C., and Goldberg, A. L. (1983) J. Bacteriol. 154, 231-238)."
https://openalex.org/W14928737,"The effects of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on parathyroid hormone (PTH)-responsive adenylate cyclase were examined in clonal rat osteosarcoma cells (UMR-106) with the osteoblast phenotype. Recombinant TFG-alpha and EGF incubated with UMR-106 cells for 48 h each produced concentration-dependent inhibition of PTH-responsive adenylate cyclase, with maximal inhibition of 38-44% at 1-3 ng/ml of either growth factor. TGF-alpha and EGF also inhibited beta-adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol)-stimulated adenylate cyclase by 32%, but neither growth factor affected enzyme response to prostaglandin or basal (unstimulated) activity. Nonreceptor-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin and cholera toxin was inhibited 18-20% by TGF-alpha and EGF. Pertussis toxin augmented PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase, suggesting modulation of PTH response by a functional inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component of the enzyme. However, pertussis toxin had no effect on TGF-alpha inhibition of PTH response. Growth factor inhibition of PTH response was time-dependent, with maximal inhibition by 4-12 h of TGF-alpha exposure, and was reduced by prior treatment of UMR-106 cells with cycloheximide. TGF-alpha was not mitogenic for UMR-106 cells. The results indicate that TGF-alpha and EGF selectively impair PTH- and beta-adrenergic agonist-responsive adenylate cyclase of osteoblast-like cells. Growth factor inhibition of adenylate cyclase may be exerted at the receptor for stimulatory agonist and at nonreceptor components excluding pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins. The inhibitory action of growth factors may also require protein synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2080530728,"A 16 bp Bgl II fragment was deleted in vitro from the minimal origin of replication of the Escherichia coli chromosome, oriC, and was replaced by a 10 kb R1 miniplasmid, pKN1562, containing the basic R1 replicon and a kanamycin resistance gene. The deletion-insertion was transferred by homologous recombination into the chromosome of a dnaA(ts) strain. P1 transduction separated the origin “mutation” from the dnaA46 allele. Integration of mini-R1 into oriC was verified by Southern blotting and by analysis of the R1 incompatibility phenotype. It was possible to isolate normal R1 miniplasmids from the integrated R1. Chromosome replication was initiated at random times after a short delay. The constructed strains grew 20%–30% slower than the wild type and showed more heterogeneous cell sizes."
https://openalex.org/W1569876389,"Superficial similarities led us to extend our designation for the transport of the plasma membrane for cationic amino acids, y+, to the lysosomal system also serving for such amino acids. Further study on the purified lysosomes of human skin fibroblasts leads us now to redesignate the lysosomal system as c (for cationic), rather than y+, to emphasize important contrasts. Lysosomal uptake of arginine at pH 7.0 was linear during the first 2 min, but attained a steady state in 6 min. This arginine uptake was Na+-independent and was tripled in rate when the lysosomes had first been loaded with the cationic amino acid analog, S-2-aminoethyl-L-cysteine. Uptake was slowed to one-third when 2 mM MgATP was added to the incubation mixture. The following differences in cationic amino acid influx between lysosomal System c and the plasma membrane System y+ became apparent: 1) arginine influx is increased 10-fold by raising the external pH from 5.0 to 7.0. This effect favors net entry of cationic amino acids under the H+ gradient prevailing in vivo. In contrast, arginine uptake across the plasma membrane is insensitive to pH changes in this range. 2) The Km of arginine uptake by lysosomal System c, 0.32 mM, is eight times that for System y+ arginine uptake by the fibroblast. 3) Certain neutral amino acids in the presence of Na+ are accepted as surrogate substrates by System y+, but not by lysosomal system c. 4) Cationic amino acids in which the alpha-amino group is monomethylated or the distal amino group is quaternary, also D-arginine, are recognized by lysosomal System c, whereas System y+ has little affinity for these analogs. This broader substrate specificity of lysosomal system c led us to discover that thiocholine serves to deplete accumulated cystine from cystinotic fibroblasts as effectively as does the therapeutic agent, cysteamine. The quaternary nitrogen of thiocholine renders the mixed disulfide formed when it reacts with cystine unsatisfactory as a substrate for System y+."
https://openalex.org/W1593254180,"Abstract D-beta-Hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase is a lipid-requiring enzyme with absolute specificity for phosphatidylcholine (PC). The enzyme devoid of lipid, the apodehydrogenase, inserts spontaneously into phospholipid vesicles where it exists as a tetramer. We now find the lipid activation to be limited by the mole fraction of PC in the total phospholipid. These studies suggest that the concentration of the enzyme-PC complex, which is essential for enzymic activity, becomes diffusion limited at lower PC concentration. The lipid activation and the tryptophan fluorescence of purified D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase were studied in the presence of a constant bilayer of approximately 100 nonactivating phospholipid molecules/enzyme monomer. Activation by PC was half-maximal at 20 PC molecules/enzyme monomer. This value was doubled when the amount of background phospholipid was doubled. Activation proceeded with positive cooperativity having a Hill coefficient of approximately 2.4. These data indicate interactions between at least three PC-binding sites. The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by the phospholipid activator, 1-palmitoyl-2-(1-pyrenyl)-decanoyl-PC (2-pyrenyl-PC), gives a saturation curve with half-maximal quenching of 6 quencher molecules/enzyme monomer. This value is equivalent to an apparent phospholipid-protein dissociation constant in the two-dimensional membrane and corresponds to approximately 6 mol % of total phospholipid. In distinct contrast to the phospholipid activation curve, the fluorescence quenching saturation curve was hyperbolic and there was no specificity for PC. The fluorescence quenching by 2-pyrenyl-PC could be diminished by using a several-fold excess of PC or other phospholipids so as to reduce the mole fraction of quencher in the bilayer. It would appear that formation of enzyme-PC complex is a dynamic process consisting of at least two discernible steps: 1) a primary interaction, as measured by tryptophan quenching, which is hyperbolic and not specific for lecithin. This interaction is independent from and precedes 2) phospholipid activation of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, which is cooperative in nature and specific for lecithin."

https://openalex.org/W1584959471,"We have examined by the liposome swelling technique the permeability properties of the modified LamB proteins isolated from mutants of Escherichia coli K12 with altered affinities toward starch and/or maltose (Ferenci, T., and Lee, K-S. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 160, 431-444). The results revealed the following. A mutant strain exhibiting a markedly lowered affinity toward starch produced a LamB protein that has lost the ability to permeate longer maltodextrins. This protein retained a nonspecific pore for a wide variety of small sugars. A mutant strain with partially reduced affinity for starch produced a LamB protein which still permeated maltodextrins, maltose, and non-maltose sugars but had also gained an ability to permit the diffusion of sucrose and raffinose; in this strain sucrose and raffinose could now compete for the starch-binding site. A mutant with enhanced affinity for both maltose and starch produced a protein which exhibited elevated rates of diffusion for longer maltodextrins but still permeated other small sugars. Two other mutants with altered affinities showed relatively minor changes in the diffusion of maltose and non-maltose sugars. It could be concluded from these studies that the LamB proteins form pores allowing the diffusion of a wide variety of monosaccharides irrespective of the presence or the absence of affinity of a binding site for maltodextrins. However, the presence of a sugar-binding site is crucial in determining the rate of the diffusion of maltodextrins or other oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1639883374,"A number of oncogenic viruses encode transforming proteins with protein kinase activities apparently specific for tyrosine residues. Recent evidence has raised questions as to the substrate specificity of these kinases in general and the physiological relevance of tyrosine phosphorylation in particular. The P130gag-fps transforming protein of Fujinami sarcoma virus (FSV) is strongly phosphorylated at 2 tyrosine residues in FSV-transformed cells of which 1 (Tyr-1073) is also the major site of P130gag-fps intermolecular autophosphorylation in vitro. We have investigated the specificity of the protein kinase activity intrinsic to FSV P130gag-fps by using site-directed mutagenesis to change the codon for Tyr-1073 to those for the other commonly phosphorylated hydroxyamino acids, serine and threonine. This approach has some advantages over the use of synthetic peptides to define protein kinase recognition sites in that the protein containing the altered target site can be expressed in intact cells. In addition it allows higher order as well as primary structure of the enzyme recognition site to be considered. Neither serine nor threonine were phosphorylated when substituted for tyrosine at position 1073 of P130gag-fps indicating a stringent specificity for tyrosine as a substrate of the P130gag-fps protein kinase autophosphorylating activity. Consistent with the suggestion that tyrosine phosphorylation is of functional significance we find that these and other FSV Tyr-1073 mutants have depressed enzymatic and oncogenic capacities."
https://openalex.org/W1501448850,"Assimilatory NADH:nitrate reductase from Chlorella is a homotetramer which contains one of each of the prosthetic groups FAD, heme, and Mo6+ per 100-kDa subunit. At low protein concentrations, this tetramer dissociates to a fully active dimer. To further elucidate the possible relationship between quaternary structure and activity, the functional size of nitrate reductase was determined by radiation inactivation analysis at high and low concentrations of enzyme where the principal physical species would be either tetrameric or dimeric, respectively. In both cases, the size obtained by this method was 100 kDa, suggesting that each subunit in the tetramer or dimer can function independently. These results confirm earlier results which indicated that the subunits are identical and that each contains a full complement of prosthetic groups. We also found that the functional sizes of the partial activities NADH:cytochrome c reductase, NADH:ferricyanide reductase, and reduced methyl viologen:nitrate reductase were fractions (approximately 58 kDa, 47 kDa, and 28 kDa, respectively) of the subunit molecular mass, suggesting that these domains are functionally independent."
https://openalex.org/W1513606541,"Monensin is an ionophore which disrupts the structure of the Golgi apparatus and inhibits vesicular transport in eukaryotic cells. In this study, we examined the effects of monensin on the incorporation of newly synthesized glycerolipids into retinal rod outer segment (ROS) membranes. Frog retinas were incubated in the presence or absence of monensin (50 nM) with either [1,2,3-3H]glycerol or [9,10-3H]palmitic acid as radiolabeled substrate. Total lipids were extracted from retinas and ROS membranes and resolved into individual phospholipid classes and neutral lipids by thin-layer chromatography. In the presence of monensin, the specific activity of ROS phospholipids was increased about 2-fold with [3H]glycerol and nearly 3-fold with [3H]palmitate as substrates relative to controls. In contrast, the specific activity of total retinal lipids, the relative incorporation of label into ROS and retinal phospholipids, and the total lipid phosphorous content of ROS membranes and retinas were not significantly different from control values. These data suggest that the enhanced labeling of ROS phospholipids in the presence of monensin was due to altered intracellular routing of lipids rather than increased glycerolipid synthesis. Under the same conditions, total retinal protein synthesis was about 90% of control, but light microscopic autoradiography indicated that newly synthesized proteins were not transported to the ROS for assembly into disc membranes. Thus, newly synthesized glycerolipids can be delivered to the ROS by a mechanism which is independent of protein transport to that cellular compartment."

https://openalex.org/W1582463600,"Abstract Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (CIDNP)-1H-NMR spectroscopy has been used to study the interaction of the protein hormone epidermal growth factor (EGF) with micelles of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and dodecylphosphorylcholine (DPC). Conventional 1H-NMR spectra show that most protein resonances remain unperturbed when micelles are added to solution, which argues that the overall protein conformation is maintained in the presence of SDS or DPC at the concentrations used. Photo-CIDNP enhancements of resonances assigned to aromatic side chains of residues at the COOH terminus and beta-sheet regions of murine EGF (i.e. Trp-49, Trp-50, and Tyr-37) are considerably reduced in the presence of micelles, while resonances of aromatic side chains of residues found elsewhere on the protein surface are mostly unaffected. This suggests that the primary interaction between murine EGF and the micelle occurs at the micelle-bulk solvent interface. The overall negatively charged surface of SDS micelles tends to induce a stronger interaction with the protein compared to the zwitterionic DPC micelles, probably due to electrostatic interactions. Cleavage of the COOH-terminal pentapeptide containing both tryptophan residues enhances the already present, but weak, interaction with Tyr-10 and attenuates it with Tyr-37. A similar interaction pattern is found with rat EGF suggesting that at least concerning these two species of EGF the interaction is somewhat specific and conserved. A simple mass-action model for protein-micelle interaction is also presented."
https://openalex.org/W1558355860,"The use of ultra high resolution giant two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has expanded the number of recognizable heat-shock proteins to 68 inductions in rat thymic lymphocytes, many of which are among the less abundant cellular proteins (Maytin, E. V., Colbert, R. A., and Young, D. A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2384-2392). Previous studies also show that cells receiving a prior heat shock recover more rapidly from the inhibition of protein synthesis induced by a second heat shock. In this report we use a monoclonal antibody to identify the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2 alpha) as a heat-shock protein. Its relative rate of synthesis increases approximately 40% in the 2nd h and 5-fold in the 4th h of a continuous heat shock and is stimulated more dramatically, 15-fold, in the 3rd h of recovery from a 1-h heat shock. These results suggest that the induction of eIF-2 alpha in the heat-shock response may be important for restoring the cell's ability to initiate protein synthesis. In addition to identifying a function for one of the heat-shock proteins, our findings draw attention to the likelihood that other low-abundance heat-shock proteins may play critical roles in the heat-shock response."
