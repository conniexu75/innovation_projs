https://openalex.org/W2058527555,"The x-ray crystal structure of the complex between human growth hormone (hGH) and the extracellular domain of its first bound receptor (hGHbp) shows that about 30 side chains from each protein make contact. Individual replacement of contact residues in the hGHbp with alanine showed that a central hydrophobic region, dominated by two tryptophan residues, accounts for more than three-quarters of the binding free energy. This ""functional epitope"" is surrounded by less important contact residues that are generally hydrophilic and partially hydrated, so that the interface resembles a cross section through a globular protein. The functionally important residues on the hGHbp directly contact those on hGH. Thus, only a small and complementary set of contact residues maintains binding affinity, a property that may be general to protein-protein interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2067859370,"Specificity of protein kinases and phosphatases may be achieved through compartmentalization with preferred substrates. In neurons, adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is localized at postsynaptic densities by association of its regulatory subunit with an A kinase anchor protein, AKAP79. Interaction cloning experiments demonstrated that AKAP79 also binds protein phosphatase 2B, or calcineurin (CaN). A ternary complex of PKA, AKAP, and CaN was isolated from bovine brain, and colocalization of the kinase and the phosphatase was established in neurites of cultured hippocampal neurons. The putative CaN-binding domain of AKAP79 is similar to that of the immunophilin FKBP-12, and AKAP79 inhibited CaN phosphatase activity. These results suggest that both PKA and CaN are targeted to subcellular sites by association with a common anchor protein and thereby regulate the phosphorylation state of key neuronal substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1670322156,"Urokinase receptors, expressed on surfaces of many cell types, focus to the pericellular space plasminogen-dependent proteolysis important in matrix remodeling and cell movement. We now report that the urokinase receptor (uPAR) is also a high affinity (Kd < 30 nM) receptor for vitronectin. Recombinant uPAR binds vitronectin in the absence of urokinase, but vitronectin binding is promoted by concurrent receptor binding of either urokinase or fragments thereof containing its uPAR binding domain. Stable epithelial cell transfectants expressing membrane-anchored uPAR, but not cells expressing soluble uPAR, become strongly adhesive with altered morphology in the absence of urokinase. These observations identify a new class of vitronectin receptor and imply a duality in function for the receptor that intrinsically links matrix adhesion to regulation of protease activity. Increases in urokinase receptor expression known to be associated with cellular activation and malignant transformation could modulate cellular trafficking and function by promoting attachment to vitronectin."
https://openalex.org/W2051048068,"The atherogenic effects of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) may be mediated, in part, by its effect(s) on endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO). To determine whether LDL can modulate NO production by changing NO synthase expression, we treated human saphenous vein endothelial cells with increasing concentrations of native or oxidized LDL (0-100 μg/ml) for various durations (0-72 h). Oxidized, but not native LDL caused a time-dependent decrease in steady-state NO synthase mRNA levels. This coincided with a maximal 56% decrease in NOS activity as determined by [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline conversion. In the presence of actinomycin D, treatment with oxidized LDL reduced the half-life of NO synthase mRNA from 36 to 10 h. This decrease in NO synthase mRNA correlated with the degree of LDL oxidation and was attenuated by pretreatment with cycloheximide. Nuclear run-off studies showed a biphasic transcriptional pattern of NO synthase gene with an initial 25% decrease during the first 6 h followed by a maximal 2.2-fold increase over baseline during the subsequent 18 h. These results indicate that oxidized LDL regulates endothelial NOS expression through a combination of early transcriptional inhibition and post-transcriptional mRNA destabilization.

Nitric oxide (NO) is produced in endothelial cells by an enzyme known as NO synthase which converts L-arginine to L-citrulline and NO(1.Palmer R.M.J. Ashton D.S. Moncada S.

Alteration of endothelial NO by oxidized LDL has been shown to occur at the level of membrane signal transduction(10.Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NO production(11.Minor Jr., R.L. Myers P.R. Guerra Jr., R. Bates J.N. Harrison D.G. J. Clin.

These findings are important since nitric oxide can potentially inhibit several components of the atherogenic process such as vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation(13.Garg U.C. Hassid A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1774-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar), platelet aggregation(14.Radomski M.W. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Br. J.

We have previously reported that native LDL can attenuate bradykinin-stimulated endothelial NO production via inhibition of specific guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (Gi) which couple the bradykinin receptor to NO synthase activation(17.Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to oxidized LDL which can inhibit NO production in response to the non-receptor-dependent calcium ionophore A23187(7.Tanner F.C. Noll G. Boulanger C.M. Lüscher T.F. Circulation. 1991; 83: 2012-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 8.Plane F. Bruckdorfer K.R. Kerr P. Steuer A. Jacobs M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that oxidized LDL differs from native LDL in being able to inhibit NO production at the level of NO synthase. Indeed, recent studies have shown that oxidized, but not native LDL can decrease the activity of the cytokine-inducible NO synthase in murine macrophages without affecting its steady-state mRNA or protein expression(18.Yang X. Cai B. Sciacca B.B. Cannon P.J. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similar findings have not been reported for the constitutive NO synthase isoform in endothelial cells. Furthermore, the effects of oxidized LDL on the expression of endothelial NO synthase is not known. Since the regulation of endothelial NO production by oxidized LDL may mediate some of its atherogenic effects, we sought to characterize the effects of oxidized LDL on endothelial NO synthase expression at the level of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. All standard culture reagents were obtained from JRH Bioscience (Lenexa, KS). Lipoprotein-deficient serum (Lot 83H9478), calcium ionophore A23187, Me2SO, dithiothreitol, L-arginine, heparin sulfate, cupric sulfate (CuSO4), polymyxin B, butylated hydroxytoluene, thiobarbituric acid, and 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane were purchased from Sigma. [α- 32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol), [α- 32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), and [3H]arginine (40.5 Ci/mmol) were supplied by DuPont NEN. Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase was obtained from Perkin Elmer. PCR primers were synthesized by Michael Berne (Tufts Medical School, Boston, MA). Purified human low-density lipoprotein (LDL, lot 730793), actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and L-N-monomethylarginine were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The Limulus amebocyte lysate kinetic assay was performed by BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Nylon nucleic acid transfer membrane (Hybond) was purchased from Amersham Corp. Human endothelial cells were harvested from saphenous veins using Type II collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp.) as described previously(19.Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1976; 3: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). Cells of less than three passages were grown to confluence in a culture medium containing Medium 199, 20 mM HEPES, 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth serum (Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, MA), 100 μg/ml heparin sulfate, 5 mML-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Lot 1112288), and antibiotic mixture of penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), Fungizone (1.25 μg/ml). They were characterized by Nomarski optical microscopy (Zeiss ICM 405, 40 × objective) and staining for Factor VIII-related antigens(5.Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For all experiments, the endothelial cells were placed in 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum for 48 h prior to treatment with the indicated concentrations of LDL. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with either actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 1 h prior to LDL treatment. Cellular confluence was maintained for all treatment conditions. Freshly obtained LDL samples were used within 7 days following isolation. Oxidized LDL was prepared by exposing known samples of native LDL to CuSO4 (5-10 μM) at 37°C for various durations (6-24 h). The samples were dialyzed with three changes of sterile buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.01% EDTA, and 100 μg/ml polymyxin B, pH 7.4) prior to filtering through 0.2-μm membrane. Its purity was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide and cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis. Cholesterol and triglyceride content were determined as described previously(10.Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein content was determined by the method of Lowry(20.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The indicated amounts of LDL used in the experiments were based upon the LDL protein concentration. The degree of LDL oxidation was estimated by measuring the amounts of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) produced using a colorimetric assay for malondialdehyde(21.Yagi K. Biochem. Med. 1976; 15: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). LDL samples (50 μg) or supernatant from cell incubation (500 μl) were mixed with 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid (20%) and 1 ml of thiobarbituric acid (1%), and heated at 100°C for 30 min. After cooling in a water bath (22°C), the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min and the absorbance was measured at 535 nm (Beckman DU-64 Spectophotometer). Serial dilutions of 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane which yields malondialdehyde was used to construct the standard curve. The extent of LDL modification was expressed as nanomole of malondialdehyde per mg of LDL protein. NO production was measured by [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline conversion as described previously with some modification(22.Ghigo D. Alessio P. Foco A. Bussolino F. Costamagna C. Heller R. Garbarino G. Pescarmona G.P. Bosia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C728-C732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent endothelial cells treated with the indicated amounts of LDL were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and placed in 10 ml of Krebs-Ringer buffer containing NaCl (118 mM), KCl (4.7 mM), CaCl2 (2.5 mM), MgSO4 (1.2 mM), KH2PO4 (1.2 mM), NaHCO3 (25 mM), and glucose (11 mM), pH 7.4. After 5 min, [3H]arginine (10 μCi) and L-arginine (10 μM) were added to the buffer and the endothelial cells were stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187 (0.5 μM) for 10 min at 37°C. In some studies, endothelial cells were pretreated with L-N-monomethylarginine (1 mM) for 15 min prior to A23187 stimulation. The assay was terminated with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing L-arginine (5 mM) and EDTA (5 mM). Cell number (5-7 × 106/T-150 cm2 culture flask) was determined using duplicate sets of confluent endothelial cells in another flask under corresponding lipoprotein treatment conditions followed by trypsinization and counting on a dispersion grid. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were scraped and lysed by a probe sonicator (Model W185F, Ultrasonics, Inc., Plainview, NY). Approximately 4 ml of this cellular extract and supernatant was applied to a column containing 2 ml of Dowex 50WX-8 resin (pre-equilibrated with NaOH) followed by elution of [3H]citrulline with 2 ml of water. A sample of the eluant (1 ml) was counted for 2 min in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 1800). Preliminary studies showed that these Dowex columns extracted >95% [3H]arginine and <8% [3H]citrulline. Nonspecific activity was determined by [3H]citrulline production in the absence of A23187 stimulation and represented approximately 5% of total activity. The Me2SO (0.1%) used to solubilized A23187 did not produce appreciable changes (<1%) in baseline NO synthase activity. Total RNA was extracted by guanidine isothiocyanate and isolated by CsCl equilibrium centrifugation(23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.19-7.22Google Scholar). Complimentary DNA template was synthesized using oligo(dT)-primed total RNA and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in a buffer containing 0.5 mM dNTP (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 10 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), 75 μM KCl, 3 μM MgCl2, 10 μM dithiothreitol, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. The NO synthase cDNA probe (JL58) was generated using the following paired primers (sense/antisense: GGCCGCTTIGAIGTGCTGCCTCT/GTCTCCATTICCAAAIGTGCTIGTIACCAC) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The annealing/elongating/denaturing conditions for the PCR reaction was 48/72/95°C for a total of 40 cycles in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, and 1.5 mM MgCl2. The PCR fragment ( ∼900 base pairs) was gel-purified, subcloned into PCR II vector (TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen), and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sequenase version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Equal amounts of total RNA (10-20 μg) from approximately 4 × 105 endothelial cells were separated by 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred overnight onto Hybond nylon membranes by capillary action, and baked for 2 h at 80°C prior to prehybridization. Radiolabeling of JL58 or human β-actin cDNA probe (ATCC 37997, Rockville, MD) was performed using random hexamer priming, [α- 32P]CTP, and Klenow (Pharmacia). The membranes were hybridized with the probes overnight at 45°C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 0.1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. All Northern blots were subjected to stringent washing conditions (0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C) prior to autoradiography with intensifying screen at −80°C for 24-72 h. Poly(A) mRNA from ∼108 human endothelial cells was isolated from oligo(dT) columns (Collaborative Research Inc.) and used to construct an oligo(dT) and random-primed library (size 5.6 × 106) in δgt10 phage (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to previously described protocols(24.Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 1. IRL Press, Oxford1988: 49-77Google Scholar). Approximately 600,000 plaques were initially screened by hybridization with JL58 probe under similar conditions used for Northern blotting. Upon secondary and tertiary screening, 17 positive clones were eventually identified. Two clones (19A3C1 and 20B4B1) of greater than 4.0 kilobases were sequenced completely using primer extension and both contain open reading frames of 3609 base pairs corresponding to the already published endothelial NO synthase sequence(25.Janssens S.P. Shimouchi A. Quertermous T. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14519-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these clones (19A3C1, GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank accession number L26914) containing 4219 base pairs was subcloned into pGEM-3z (Promega Inc., Madison, WI) and used as template for transcriptional analysis. NO synthase transcription was measured according to the method previously described by Kavanaugh et al.(26.Kavanaugh W.M. Harsh IVth, G.R. Starksen N.F. Rocco C.M. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8470-8472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Confluent endothelial cells (7 × 106 cells) were placed in lipoprotein-deficient serum for 48 h to achieve quiescence prior to exposure with indicated amounts of LDL for various durations. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The cellular pellet was gently resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, and lysed by a Dounce homogenizer (30-35 strokes) with intermittent inspection of nuclei. The lysate was recentrifuged at 300 × g and the resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 75 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol. In vitro transcription using the nuclear pellet (100 μl) was carried out in a shaking water bath at 30°C for 30 min in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 300 mM KCl, 50 μM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 units of RNasin, 0.5 mM CTP, ATP, and GTP, and 250 μCi of [α- 32P]UTP. The reaction was terminated by incubating the assay with 40 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 20 min at 30°C. Proteins in the mixture were degraded by a solution containing 0.4% SDS, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, and 400 μg/ml proteinase K (E. Merck, Darmstadt, W. Germany), and extracted by phenol/chloroform. Ammonium acetate (2 M) and an equal volume of EtOH were added to the radiolabeled RNA transcripts. The mixture was kept in dry ice for 20 min prior to precipitation by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Equal amounts (1 μg) of purified, denatured full-length endothelial NO synthase, human β-actin, and linearized pGEM-3z cDNA were vacuum-transferred onto nylon membranes using a slot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were baked and prehybridized as described for Northern blots. The precipitated radiolabeled transcripts ( ∼5 × 107 cpm) were resuspended in 2 ml of hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 0.1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization of radiolabeled transcripts to the nylon membranes was carried out at 45°C for 48 h. The membranes were then washed with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 65°C prior to autoradiography for 72 h at −80°C. Band intensities from Northern and nuclear run-off assay blots were analyzed densitometrically by the National Institutes of Health IMAGE program(27.Rasband W. NIH Image Program. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1993Google Scholar). All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. compared to controls and among separate experiments. Paired and unpaired Student's t tests were employed to determine the significance of changes in NO synthase activity and densitometric measurements. A significant difference was taken for p values less than 0.05. Relatively pure (>98%) human saphenous vein endothelial cell cultures were confirmed by their morphological features (i.e. cuboidal, cobble-stone, contact inhibited) using phase-contrast microscopy and immunofluorescent staining with antibodies to Factor VIII (data not shown). There were no observable adverse effects of lipoprotein-deficient serum or LDL on cellular morphology. Oxidized LDL having a higher concentration (>100 μg/ml) and TBARS value (>30 nmol/mg) caused vacuolization and some detachment of endothelial cells after 24 h. Otherwise, cellular confluency ( ∼7 × 106 cells/T-150 cm2 flask) and viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion were maintained for all treatment conditions described. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of native LDL revealed a single protein band migrating at ∼510 kDa corresponding to apoB-100. This band became progressively degraded following oxidative modification (data not shown). Lipoprotein-deficient serum on gel electrophoresis was devoid of apoB-100 protein staining with Coomassie Blue and lipid staining with fat red 7B. The native LDL had a protein, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentration of 6.13 ± 0.24, 23.1 ± 1.11, and 1.55 ± 0.17 mg/ml, respectively. Neither the lipoprotein-deficient serum nor the LDL samples had detectable levels of endotoxin (<0.10 units/ml). Native LDL had an initial TBARS value of 0.1 ± 0.1 nmol/mg which increased to 0.6 ± 0.3, 2.3 ± 0.8, and 4.5 ± 1.2 nmol/mg after 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation with endothelial cells in Medium 199 and lipoprotein-deficient serum, respectively. LDL samples which have been oxidized by exposure to CuSO4 exhibited much higher levels of oxidative modification with TBARS values ranging from 7.3 ± 1.4 nmol/mg after a 6-h exposure with 5 μM CuSO4 to 48.8 ± 4.3 nmol/mg after a 24-h exposure with 10 μM CuSO4. The sequence of the JL58 probe (882 base pairs) corresponding to amino acids 284-578 is identical to the human endothelial NO synthase sequence previously reported(25.Janssens S.P. Shimouchi A. Quertermous T. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14519-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blotting using this probe showed that native LDL (100 μg/ml) produced a slight increase in the steady-state NO synthase mRNA levels after 24 h with respect to β-actin mRNA (Fig. 1A). Lower concentrations of native LDL (10-50 μg/ml), however, did not produce any significant change in NO synthase mRNA levels after 72 h (data not shown). In contrast, oxidized LDL (50 μg/ml, TBARS 24.4 nmol/mg) caused a time-dependent progressive decrease in NO synthase mRNA levels with a steady-state half-life of 15 ± 3 h (Fig. 1B). Overall, the NO synthase steady-state mRNA level was reduced by 3.2-fold after 72 h with respect to β-actin. In addition, changes in NO synthase mRNA levels was also observed in human aortic endothelial cells (Fig. 2) and correlated with the degree of LDL oxidation as assessed by TBARS (Fig. 3). For oxidized LDL (50 μg/ml) with TBARS value of greater than 30 nmol/mg, there was a marked decrease in NO synthase mRNA after 24 h. The calculated TBARS IC 50 value was 15.7 ± 4.3 nmol/mg.Figure 2Northern blots (10 μg total RNA/lane) showing dose-dependent effects of oxidized LDL (TBARS 24.4 nmol/mg) at 24 h on NO synthase mRNA levels from primary human aortic endothelial cells.

Oxidized LDL (50 μg/ml) shortened the half-life of NO synthase mRNA from 36 ± 6 to 10 ± 3 h (Fig. 4, A and B). This reduction in NO synthase half-life suggests that oxidized LDL caused post-transcriptional decreases in NO synthase mRNA stability. Pretreatment with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), however, prevented the decrease in NO synthase mRNA prior to 18 h (Fig. 5, A and B). These findings indicate that the effect(s) of oxidized LDL on NO synthase mRNA destabilization requires new protein synthesis.Figure 5A, Northern blots (10 μg total RNA/lane) showing the effects of oxidized (ox) LDL (50 μg/ml; TBARS 24.4 nmol/mg) on NO synthase (NOS) mRNA expression in the presence and absence of cycloheximide (CHX; 10 μg/ml).

In the presence of L-N-monomethylarginine, NO synthase activity was reduced to 0.20 ± 0.06 pmol/min/million cells. Native LDL (100 μg/ml) caused a small, but significant decrease in A23187-stimulated NO synthase activity after 24 h (1.11 ± 0.06 pmol/min/million cells, p < 0.05) (Fig. 6A). In contrast, oxidized LDL (50 μg/ml, TBARS 24.4 nmol/mg) substantially reduced A23187-stimulated citrulline production in a time-dependent manner beginning after 6 h of treatment (1.12 ± 0.08 pmol/min/million cells, p < 0.05) and achieving maximal inhibition by 24 h of treatment (0.74 ± 0.05 pmol/min/million cells). Similar decreases in NO synthase activity were also observed with native and oxidized LDL (TBARS 24.4 nmol/mg) in a concentration-dependent manner with maximal effect occurring at a concentration of 50 μg/ml (Fig. 6B). After 24 h of treatment, native LDL decreased NO synthase activity to 1.07 ± 0.05 pmol/min/million cells; whereas, oxidized LDL had a greater effect in decreasing NO synthase activity to 0.65 ± 0.06 pmol/min/million cells. The calculated IC 50 values for native and oxidized LDL were 14.4 ± 0.18 and 11.2 ± 0.12 nmol/mg, respectively. Furthermore, decrease in NO synthase activity also correlated with the degree of LDL oxidation. After exposure to LDL (50 μg/ml) for 24 h, the calculated TBARS IC 50 value was 21.4 ± 3.8 nmol/mg (data not shown). Nuclear run-off studies using oxidized LDL (50 μg/ml, TBARS 24.4 nmol/mg) showed a biphasic pattern of transcriptional regulation of NO synthase gene (Fig. 7). Compared to baseline levels, treatment with oxidized LDL caused a 25% decrease in NO synthase mRNA transcription during the first 6 h followed by a 1.8- and 2.2-fold increase over baseline at 12 and 24 h, respectively. Preliminary studies using different amounts of radiolabeled RNA transcripts demonstrate that under our experimental conditions, hybridization was linear and nonsaturable. The density of each NO synthase band was standardized to the density of its corresponding β-actin band at each time point (relative index). To exclude the possibility that changes in NO synthase relative index is due to changes in β-actin transcription caused by oxidized LDL, another marker, β-tubulin, was included on each of the nuclear run-off blots. Similar relative indices were obtained when NO synthase transcription was standardized to β-tubulin transcription (data not shown). The specificity of each band was determined by the lack of hybridization to the nonspecific pGEM cDNA vector. In this study, we have characterized the effects of LDL on endothelial NO synthase mRNA expression and correlated these effects with decreases in NO production as assessed by L-arginine to L-citrulline conversion. We found that exposure to noncytotoxic concentrations of oxidized, but not native LDL caused a progressive time-dependent decrease in steady-state NO synthase mRNA levels. Furthermore, additional studies using human aortic endothelial cells yielded similar results. The mechanism(s) responsible for this decline is dependent upon oxidative modification of LDL and involves a combination of early transcriptional inhibition and predominantly, post-transcriptional mRNA degradation. This latter effect of oxidized LDL on NO synthase mRNA apparently requires the participation of newly synthesized protein(s) as demonstrated by studies using the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. It is not known whether these transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes are regulated separately by oxidized LDL, and are therefore, perhaps differentially sensitive to specific characteristics of the LDL particle such as the concentration or the degree of modification of its constituents. Increases in NO synthase mRNA degradation have been observed with exposure to certain proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β(28.Rosenkranz-Weiss P. Sessa W.C. Milstien S. Kaufman S. Watson C.A. Pober J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2236-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 29.Yoshizumi M. Perrella M.A. Burnett Jr., J.C. Lee M.E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Both tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β are associated with atherogenesis and their presence has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic lesions(30.Tipping P.G. Hancock W.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1721-1728PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cells can produce interleukin-1β which in turn, can regulate diverse vascular functions in an autocrine and paracrine fashion(31.Liao J.K. Bettmann M.A. Sandor T. Tucker J.I. Coleman S.M. Creager M.A. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Analysis of our endothelial NO synthase cDNA reveals a sequence (AUUUA) in the 3′-untranslated region which is known to be involved in mRNA destabilization(32.Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3124) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether this sequence is utilized as the putative site of regulation by oxidized lipids and cytokines. Since atherosclerotic vessels contain oxidized LDL (33.Ylä-Herttuala S. Palinski W. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Butler S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and respond abnormally with respect to altered endothelial NO activity(34.Libby P. Ordovas J.M. Auger K.R. Robbins A.H. Birinyi L.K. Dinarello C.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 124: 179-185PubMed Google Scholar), it is interesting to speculate whether translational induction of these cytokines by oxidized LDL is the mechanism by which oxidized LDL destabilizes NO synthase mRNA. The regulation of NO synthase gene transcription by oxidized LDL is complex and consists of at least two separate components. Early transcriptional inhibition occurring at 6 h is most probably due to direct effects of oxidized LDL since small decreases in transcriptional activity can be observed within 30-120 min of exposure to oxidized LDL. 2J. K. Liao, unpublished observation.The 5′-flanking promoter region of the human constitutive endothelial NO synthase has recently been characterized and found to contain a DNA binding sequence (GCGGGGCG) for an inhibitory transcription factor(35.Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). It is not known whether oxidized LDL represses NO synthase transcription through activation of this DNA binding protein or through other yet unidentified silencer elements. Increases in NO synthase transcriptional activity occurring after 12 h is probably the result of indirect effects of oxidized LDL or secondary to some feedback counter-regulatory mechanism induced by declining NO synthase activity and steady-state mRNA levels. This delayed increase in NO synthase transcription suggests translational induction of new protein(s) as the most likely mechanism for enhanced transcription although direct effects of oxidized LDL components with delayed access into endothelial subcellular compartments cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, despite a greater than 2-fold increase in transcription rate, steady-state NO synthase mRNA levels continue to fall after 12 h as a result of an even higher rate of NO synthase mRNA degradation. This marked effect on mRNA stability is evident by the more than 3-fold reduction in NO synthase half-life as determined in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D. Despite increases in NO synthase mRNA after exposure to native LDL, NO synthase activity remains mildly reduced. This suggests that native LDL can also inhibit NO production by either decreasing NO synthase protein expression or attenuating its enzymatic activity. This is in agreement with previous studies showing that short-term exposure of rabbit aorta to native LDL can diminish its endothelial-dependent response to the calcium ionophore A23187(36.Andrews H.E. Bruckdorfer K.R. Dunn R.C. Jacobs M. Nature. 1987; 327: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results showed that oxidized LDL produced a more profound inhibitory effect on NO synthase activity with most of the reduction occurring within 24 h. The reduction in NO synthase mRNA expression most likely contributes to this exaggerated effect although a direct effect on protein expression and/or activity cannot be ruled out. This finding is consistent with animal studies showing that the inhibitory effects of native and oxidized LDL operate through different mechanisms in attenuating the release of endothelial-derived NO(37.Jacobs M. Plane F. Bruckdorfer K.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 100: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the IC 50 values of NO synthase activity for native and moderately oxidized LDL were fairly comparable indicating that oxidative modification of the LDL particle rather than its concentration is more important in determining its inhibitory effects. Indeed, we found that NO synthase mRNA expression is negatively regulated by the degree of LDL oxidation as measured by the formation of malondialdehyde. Changes in the LDL particle associated with oxidative modification include lipid peroxidation, formation of conjugated dienes, carbonyl modification of apoB-100, and enzymatic conversion of phosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidylcholine by phospholipase A2 in apoB-100(38.Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.D. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Parthasarathy S. Barnett J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9741-9745Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that attenuation of bradykinin-stimulated calcium transients and inhibition of endothelial-dependent relaxation by oxidized LDL is mediated by its lysophosphatidylcholine component(40.Inoue N. Hirata K. Yamada M. Hamamori Y. Matsuda Y. Akita H. Yokoyama M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1410-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 41.Kugiyama K. Kerns S.A. Morrisett J.D. Roberts R. Henry P.D. Nature. 1990; 344: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). However, studies using different preparations of human oxidized LDL with similar lysophosphatidylcholine content demonstrate varying inhibitory effects on endothelium-dependent relaxations of rabbit aorta(8.Plane F. Bruckdorfer K.R. Kerr P. Steuer A. Jacobs M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that components in oxidized LDL other than lysophosphatidylcholine may also be influencing NO synthase expression and activity. It remains to be determined what the roles of each of these components in oxidized LDL are in regulating NO synthase mRNA expression and enzymatic activity. The effect of oxidized LDL on NO synthase expression in atherosclerosis, however, remains controversial. Studies of human atherosclerotic plaques with in vitro hybridization techniques demonstrate normal expression of NO synthase in the overlying endothelium(42.Sundell C.L. Marsden P.A. Subramanian R.R. Pollock J.S. Harrison D.G. Wilcox J.N. Circulation. 1993; 88: I-473Google Scholar). An increase in NO production was reportedly found in aorta from cholesterol-fed rabbits although NO activity was greatly reduced as a result of enhanced inactivation(11.Minor Jr., R.L. Myers P.R. Guerra Jr., R. Bates J.N. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 2109-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Yet, considerable evidence including the findings in this study suggest that oxidized LDL reduces endothelial NO production at the level of NO synthase(43.Flavahan N.A. Circulation. 1992; 85: 1927-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have found a strong correlation between decreases in NO synthase mRNA expression and reduction in NO synthase activity. Several possible explanations could account for this discrepancy. First, oxidized lipids may affect other cell types such as macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells which could indirectly influence NO synthase expression in vivo. Second, the regulation of NO synthase protein by oxidized LDL is not known and may differ from that of NO synthase mRNA. Third, oxidized LDL preparations used in various studies or found in atherosclerotic arteries may differ with respect to the concentrations encountered by endothelial cells or the degree of oxidative modification. Perhaps exposure of endothelial cells to lower concentrations of native or mildly-modified LDL would not alter NO synthase mRNA expression while higher levels of oxidative modification would inhibit expression. Finally, NO synthase mRNA transcription and its degradation may be regulated independently by different components of oxidized LDL. For example, certain factors in oxidized LDL which destabilize NO synthase mRNA may either be absent or counteracted by other mediators in the atherosclerotic lesion. Consequently, increases in NO synthase mRNA expression would result from the delayed transcriptional induction by oxidized LDL. In summary, regulation of endothelial NO synthase expression involves complex interactions between transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects of oxidized LDL. It remains to be determined which component(s) of oxidized LDL and which newly synthesized protein(s) mediate these effects. We are grateful to Drs. Peter Libby and Maria Muszynski for generously providing human saphenous vein and aortic endothelial cells."

Positivity of the isolated clones was assessed by (a) prototrophy of the transformed yeasts for histidine when grown in the presence of 5 mM 3-aminotriazole, (b) β-galactosidase expression, and (c) specificity tests (interaction with SNF4 and lamin fused to Gal4 DBD). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione S-transferase-p55-IC fusion protein (GST-p55-IC) were produced as described elsewhere(15.Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 16.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A.

Maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins were obtained using the pMalcRI vector (New England Biolabs) and purified on an amylose resin column. The interaction of the MBP and GST fusion proteins was investigated by incubating glutathione-agarose beads sequentially with the GST and MBP fusion proteins (5 μg of protein/20 μl of beads), first for 15 min and then for 2 h, at 4°C. Incubation with MBP fusion proteins was carried out in a buffer solution containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0,5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% (v/v) glycerol or, when indicated, in that same buffer containing 0.4 M KCl or 5 mM EDTA instead of MgCl2. Association of the MBP fusion proteins was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteins associated with the glutathione-agarose beads, followed by Western blotting. The blots were probed with rabbit antiserum against MBP (produced in our laboratory) and with horseradish-peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin. HeLa cells expressing the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (the HtTA-1 clone; (17.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bujard). The cells were transfected with the expression construct (5 μg of DNA/6-cm plate) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (16.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 8.0.1-8.1.6Google Scholar). Effects of transient expression of the transfected proteins were assessed at the indicated times after transfection in the presence or absence of tetracycline (1 μg/ml). Clones of cells stably transfected with the human p55-IC cDNA in the pUHD10-3 vector were established by transfecting the cDNA to HtTA-1 cells in the presence of tetracycline together with a plasmid conferring resistance to hygromycin, followed by selection for clones resistant to hygromycin (200 μg/ml). Expression of the cDNA was obtained by removal of tetracycline, which was otherwise maintained constantly in the cell growth medium. Effects of induced expression of the receptors and of TNF on cell viability were assessed by the neutral-red uptake method(18.Wallach D. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 2464-2469PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of interleukin 8 (IL-8) gene expression was assessed by Northern analysis. RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.), denatured in formaldehyde/formamide buffer, electrophoresed through an agarose/formaldehyde gel, and blotted to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (DuPont) in 10 × SSPE buffer, using standard techniques. Filters were hybridized with an IL-8 cDNA probe ((19), nucleotides 1-392), radiolabeled by random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), and washed stringently. TNF receptor expression in samples of 1 × 106 cells was assessed by measuring the binding of TNF, labeled with 125I by the chloramine-T method, as described previously(20.Holtmann H. Wallach D. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1161-1167PubMed Google Scholar). It was also assessed by ELISA, performed as described for the quantification of the soluble TNF receptors(21.Aderka D. Engelmann H. Hornik V. Skornick Y. Levo Y. Wallach D. Kushtai G. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5602-5607PubMed Google Scholar), except for the use of radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to lyse the cells (70 μl/106 cells) and to dilute the tested samples. The soluble form of the p55-R, purified from urine, served as the standard. Self-association of the death domain in the p55-R was observed by happenstance, on screening a HeLa cell cDNA library by the two-hybrid system technique (14.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar) for proteins that bind to the intracellular domain of this receptor. Among the cDNAs whose products bound specifically to the intracellular domain-GAL4 DBD fusion-protein, several clones encoded parts of the p55-R intracellular domain (p55-IC; marked with asterisks in Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The extent of specificity in the self-association of p55-IC and the particular region involved was evaluated by the two-hybrid test. Table 1 shows the following. (a) The self-association of p55-IC is confined to a region within the death domain. Its N terminus is located between residues 328 and 344; its C terminus, close to residue 404, is somewhat upstream of the reported C terminus of this domain (residue 414). (b) Deletion of the membrane-proximal part of p55-IC upstream of the death domain enhanced self-association, suggesting that this region has an inhibitory effect. (c) Mouse p55-IC self-associates and also associates with the death domain of human p55-R. (d) Examination of the self-association of the intracellular domains of three other receptors of the TNF/NGF receptor family: Fas/APO1, CD40(22.Stamenkovic I. Clark E.A. Seed B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and the p75 TNF receptor(23.Smith C.A. Davis T. Anderson D. Solam L. Beckmann M.P. Jerzy R. Dower S.K. Cosman D. Goodwin R.G. Science. 1990; 248: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar), showed that Fas-IC, which signals for cell death by a sequence motif related to the p55-R death domain, self-associates and associates to some extent with the p55-IC. However, CD40-IC, which provides growth stimulatory signals (even though also containing a sequence resembling the death domain), and p75-IC, which bears no structural resemblance to p55-IC, do not self-associate, nor do they bind p55-IC or Fas-IC. An in vitro test of the interaction of a p55-IC-GST bacterial fusion protein with a p55-IC-MBP fusion protein confirmed that p55-R self-associates and ruled out involvement of yeast proteins (Fig. 1). The association was not affected by increased salt concentration or by EDTA (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). To evaluate the functional implications of the self-association of the death domain, we examined the way in which induced expression of p55-R, or of parts of it, affects cells sensitive to TNF cytotoxicity. Using an expression vector that permits strictly controlled expression of transfected cDNAs by a tetracycline regulated transactivator(17.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar), we found that merely increasing p55-R expression in HeLa cells by expression of transiently transfected cDNA for the full-length receptor resulted in quite extensive cell death. Even greater cytotoxicity was observed when expressing just p55-IC (Fig. 2 and 3, A and B). Significant cytotoxicity was also observed when expressing just the death domain. In contrast, expression of parts of the p55-IC that lacked the death domain or contained only part of it (or expression of the luciferase gene, used as an irrelevant control) had no effect on cell viability. Expression of Fas-IC did not result in cytotoxicity, yet significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of co-expressed p55-R (Fig. 2). The cytotoxicity of p55-IC was further confirmed using cells stably transfected with its cDNA; these cells continued to grow when p55-IC expression was not induced but died when p55-IC was expressed (Fig. 3C).Figure 3Ligand-independent triggering of a cytocidal effect in HeLa cells transfected with p55-R or its intracellular domain: kinetic study of transient expression of the receptor and its expression in a stable transfectant.

Morishita K. Yoshimura T. Lavu S. Kobayashi Y. Lew W. Appella E. Kung H.F. Leonard E.J. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1883-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, transfection of HeLa cells with a tetracycline-controlled construct encoding the p55-R cDNA induced IL-8 transcription. An even stronger induction was observed in cells transfected with the cDNA for p55-IC. In both cases, the induction occurred only when tetracycline was excluded from the cell growth medium, indicating that it occurs as a consequence of expression of the transfected p55-R or p55-IC. Transfection with luciferase cDNA, as a control, had no effect on IL-8 transcription. Studies employing the two-hybrid technique suggested that the intracellular domain of the p55-R self-associates and located this self-association to a part of a region found to be critical for signaling by this receptor ((4.Song H.Y. Dunbar J.D. Bonner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22492-22495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the present report; see also (33.Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E.E. Bigda Y. Camonis H.J. Mett I. Cytokine. 1994; 6: 556Crossref Google Scholar)). Further tests confirmed that this association is not artifactual, as may well occur in the yeast genetic test(24.Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), and indicated that it has functional consequences. The self-association could be shown to occur also in vitro, using GST and MBP p55-IC fusion proteins, thus ruling out involvement of yeast proteins or of the Gal4 DBD or AD in this association. Moreover, the expected functional consequence of this association could be demonstrated, namely occurrence of spontaneous signaling under conditions that permit receptor aggregation. A mere increase in p55-R expression, or even expression just of the intracellular domain of the receptor or of its death domain, was found to be sufficient to trigger signaling for cytotoxicity as well for expression of the TNF-inducible IL-8 gene within cells. Normally, cells expressing the p55-R do not exhibit TNF effects unless exposed to this cytokine. Presumably, cells possess some mechanisms that reduce the self-association of the receptor and impose on it ligand dependence. Probably self-association of the receptors is in part restricted by mechanisms that maintain their self-surface expression at a low level. It may also be restricted by constraints imposed on the death domain in the receptor by other regions in the p55-R molecule. To some extent, self-association of the death domain seems to be inhibited by the membrane-proximal part of the intracellular domain (Table 1). Crystallographic studies of the extracellular domain of the receptor suggest that also this domain mediates an inhibitory effect; they indicate that, in the absence of TNF, the extracellular domains of neighboring p55-R molecules are capable of interacting in a way that obviates association of their intracellular domains. 2J. Naismith and S. Sprang, personal communication.Such interaction may well prevent spontaneous signaling by the receptors and allow their intracellular domains to self-associate only after TNF binding. The intracellular domain of Fas/APO1, which bears marked structural similarity to that of the p55-R and that likewise signals for cell death, was found also to self-associate and thus trigger signaling, suggesting that this receptor, too, plays an active role in its aggregation and is subject to control mechanisms that antagonize its propensity to self-associate. This may well be the case also for a number of other receptors, for example several tyrosine-kinase receptors, including Neu/HER-2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor, that are found, just like the p55-R, to signal spontaneously when expressed at high levels as well as after deletion of their extracellular domain (see, e.g., (25.Lonardo F. Di Marco E. King C.R. Pierce J.H. Segatto O. Aaronson S.A. Di Fiori P.P. New Biol. 1990; 2: 992-1003PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Downward J. Yarden Y. Mayes E. Scrace G. Totty N. Stockwell P. Ullrich A.

Waterfield M.D. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 273-283PubMed Google Scholar), and references therein). Interestingly, the p75 TNF receptor, even though it has, like p55-R and Fas/APO, the ability to signal for cell death(28.Heller R.A. Song K. Fan N. Chang D.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), does not display self-association, nor does a high level of expression of this receptor result in spontaneous signaling(29.Bigda J. Beletsky I. Brakebusch C. Varfolomeev Y. Engelmann H. Bigda J. Holtmann H. Wallach D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 445-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Apparently, the mode of signaling for cell death by this receptor differs from that of the p55-R(29.Bigda J. Beletsky I. Brakebusch C. Varfolomeev Y. Engelmann H. Bigda J. Holtmann H. Wallach D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 445-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Most likely, the self-associations of p55-R and Fas/APO1 serve to fortify the aggregated state imposed on them by their ligands. Such a mechanism has certain functional advantages. It may augment signaling and also provide ways for modulation of signaling by mechanisms that act within the cell. An intriguing possibility for such modulation is indicated by the slight association between p55-IC and Fas-IC, which may allow cross-talk between the two cell death-inducing receptors(7.Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). The propensity of these receptors to self-associate may permit also a kind of derangement of regulation that would not be expected if their aggregation occurred in a passive manner. It can lead to spontaneous signaling, independent of the ligand, in situations in which the mechanisms restricting the self-association of the receptors fail to function properly. Such ligand-independent function is, in the case of growth factor receptors, a well known cause for the uncontrolled growth of malignant cells. In receptors that signal for cytotoxicity, it may contribute to uncalled-for death of cells, as observed, for example, in response to cytopathic viruses and various other pathogens. We are grateful to Drs. Herman Bujard and Sabina Freundlieb for providing us with the reagents for tetracycline-controlled expression and to Ada Dibeman for careful handling of the cultured cells."

Restriction enzyme mapping, subcloning, and DNA sequence analysis of bacteriophage- and yeast artificial chromosome-derived human genomic DNA indicated that the mRNA for neuronal NO synthase is dispersed over a minimum of 160 kilobases of human genomic DNA. Analysis of intron-exon splice junctions predicted that the open reading frame is encoded by 28 exons, with translation initiation and termination in exon 2 and exon 29, respectively. Determination of transcription initiation sites in brain poly(A) RNA with primer extension analysis and RNase protection revealed a major start site 28 nucleotides downstream from a TATA box. Sequence inspection of 5′-flanking regions revealed potential cis-acting DNA elements: AP-2, TEF-1/MCBF, CREB/ATF/c-Fos, NRF-1, Ets, NF-1, and NF-kappa B-like sequences. Diversity appears to represent a major theme apparent upon analysis of human neuronal NO synthase mRNA transcripts. A microsatellite of the dinucleotide variety was detected within the 3′-untranslated region of exon 29. Multiple alleles were evident in normal individuals indicating the existence of allelic mRNA sequence variation. Characterization of variant human neuronal NO synthase cDNAs indicated the existence of casette exon 9/10 and exon 10 deletions as examples of structural mRNA diversity due to alternative splicing. The latter deletion of a 175-nucleotide exon introduces a frame-shift and premature stop codon indicating the potential existence of a novel NH2 terminus protein. In summary, analysis of the human neuronal NO synthase locus reveals a complex genomic organization and mRNA diversity that is both allelic and structural."
https://openalex.org/W1485515329,"In neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), electron transfer proceeds across domains in a linear sequence from NADPH to flavins to heme, with calmodulin (CaM) triggering the interdomain electron transfer to the heme (Abu-Soud, H. M., and Stuehr, D. J. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 10769-10772). Here, we utilized a neuronal NOS devoid of its bound heme and tetrahydrobiopterin (apo-NOS) to examine whether interdomain electron transfer is responsible for CaM's activation of NO synthesis, substrate-independent NADPH oxidation, and cytochrome c and ferricyanide reduction. Of the four activities, two (cytochrome c and ferricyanide reduction) were similarly stimulated by CaM in apo-NOS when compared with native NOS, indicating that activation occurs by a mechanism not involving flavin-to-heme electron transfer. Further analysis showed that CaM increased the rate of electron transfer from NADPH into the flavin centers by a factor of 20, revealing a direct activation of the NOS reductase domain by CaM. In contrast, CaM's activation of NO synthesis and substrate-independent NADPH oxidation appeared to involve flavin-to-heme electron transfer because these reactions were not activated in apo-NOS and were blocked in native NOS by agents that prevent heme iron reduction. Thus, CaM activates neuronal NOS at two points in the electron transfer sequence: electron transfer into the flavins and interdomain electron transfer between the flavins and heme. Activation at each point is associated with an up-regulation of domain-specific catalytic functions. The dual regulation by CaM is unique and represents a new means by which electron transfer can be controlled in a metalloflavoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2080399383,"ARIA, heregulin, neu differentiation factor, and glial growth factor are members of a new family of growth and differentiation factors whose effects have been assayed on Schwann cells, skeletal muscle cells, and mammary tumor cell lines. To gain insight into their roles in the CNS, we studied the expression of ARIA in the rat brain. We found ARIA mRNA in all cholinergic neurons throughout the CNS, including motor neurons and cells of the medial septal nucleus and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. We also found that ARIA induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a 185 kDa protein in central and peripheral targets of these cholinergic neurons. ARIA mRNA, however, is not restricted to cholinergic neurons, suggesting that it may also play a role at other types of synapses. Its distribution in germinal layers of the telencephalon and cerebellum suggests that it may also play a role in the proliferation and/or migration of neuronal and glial precursor cells."

The perinuclear space is continuous with endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear outer membrane shares many features with the reticular membrane. We now show that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors associated with the nucleus release Ca2+ from isolated Xenopus laevis oocyte nuclei. Electrophysiological measurements of the intracellular InsP3 receptor in its native membrane have not been possible on the fine filamentous endoplasmic reticulum. In this paper, we directly measure InsP3-dependent receptor channels in isolated nuclei. The nuclear InsP3 receptor is activated by InsP3 and modulated by Ca2+. The channel is weakly regulated by ATP, is mildly voltage dependent, and has a greater conductance with monovalent cations than with divalent cations."
https://openalex.org/W2054154416,"Receptor dimerization is ubiquitous to the action of all receptor tyrosine kinases, and in the case of dimeric ligands, such as the stem cell factor (SCF), it was attributed to ligand bivalency. However, by using a dimerization-inhibitory monoclonal antibody to the SCF receptor, we confined a putative dimerization site to the nonstandard fourth immunoglobulin-like domain of the receptor. Deletion of this domain not only abolished ligand-induced dimerization and completely inhibited signal transduction, but also provided insights into the mechanism of the coupling of ligand binding to dimer formation. These results identify an intrinsic receptor dimerization site and suggest that similar sites may exist in other receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1487500734,"The B cell-specific cell surface molecule CD19 plays a role in regulating immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor signaling, and cross-linking CD19 activates several signaling molecules in mature human B cells. In surface Ig-negative B cell precursors, a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK)-dependent homotypic aggregation response can be triggered by cross-linking CD19. In the current study, we examined the outcome of PTK-mediated signal transduction following CD19 cross-linking on surface Ig negative and surface Ig positive B cell lines, as well as freshly isolated surface Ig-negative B cell precursors. PTK activation resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple protein substrates and peaked at 0.5-1 min following CD19 cross-linking in all B-lineage cells examined. One of the tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates was identified as the hematopoietic-specific protein Vav, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates the Ras pathway. Evidence consistent with Ras pathway activation was also demonstrated by MEK activation and subsequent phosphorylation of a MAP kinase fusion protein. CD19 cross-linking, sequential immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting revealed that: (a) Vav becomes associated with CD19, (b) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) becomes associated with CD19, and (c) PI 3-kinase becomes associated with Vav. No such physical interaction occurred following control IgG1 cross-linking or cross-linking of class I major histocompatability complex cell surface molecules. Coupled with a previous report (Tuveson, D.A., Carter, R.H., Soltoff, S.P., and Fearon, D.T. (1993) Science 260, 986-988), our data support a model in which CD19 cross-linking induces the formation of a signaling complex that leads to the activation of two pathways involving Ras and PI 3-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1656557885,"Versican is a modular proteoglycan involved in the control of cellular growth and differentiation. To understand versican gene regulation and transcriptional control, we have isolated genomic clones spanning the entire gene locus including 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences. Versican was encoded by 15 exons encompassing over 90 kilobase pairs of continuous DNA. The exon organization corresponded to the protein subdomains encoded by homologous proteins, with a remarkable conservation of exon size and intron phase. We discovered an additional exon just proximal to the glycosaminoglycan-binding region that was identical to a recently identified splice variant of versican (Dours-Zimmermann, M.T., and Zimmermann, D.R. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 32992-32998). The versican promoter harbored a typical TATA box located approximately 16 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site and binding sites for a number of transcription factors involved in regulated gene expression. This promoter was shown to be highly functional in transiently transfected cells of both mesenchymal and epithelial origin. Stepwise 5' deletions identified a strong enhancer element between -209 and -445 base pairs and a strong negative element between -445 and -632 base pairs. This study provides the molecular basis for discerning the transcriptional control of the versican gene and offers the opportunity to investigate genetic disorders linked to this important human gene."

INTRODUCTIONThe biologic effects of NO are almost exclusively determined by its chemical properties. As a free radical, NO reacts rapidly with molecular oxygen, superoxide, and iron-containing proteins. Reaction with oxygen results in the formation of as yet poorly defined reactive intermediates causing oxidative damage of DNA(1Wink D.A. Kasprzak K.S. Maragos C.M. Elespuru R.K. Misra M. Dunams T.M.

Tannenbaum S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3030-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Reaction with superoxide is extremely fast and generates peroxynitrite, which is rapidly inactivated when protonated to the corresponding peroxynitrous acid(3Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6665) Google Scholar). Decomposition of peroxynitrous acid involves formation of cytotoxic intermediates with chemical and biological properties similar to hydroxyl radical(4Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar). Finally, the activity of a wide variety of iron-containing enzymes is affected by NO. Several non-heme iron proteins, such as cis-aconitase or ribonucleotide reductase are inhibited(5Henry Y. Lepoivre M. Drapier J.-C. Ducrocq C. Boucher J.-L. Guissani A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), whereas heme-containing soluble guanylyl cyclase is stimulated several hundredfold upon binding of NO to its regulatory prosthetic heme group(6Ignarro L.J. Blood Vessels. 1991; 28: 67-73PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal cytochromes P-450, however, which contain a catalytically active heme, are completely inhibited at submicromolar concentrations of NO(7Wink D.A. Osawa Y. Darbyshire J.F. Jones C.R.

We have recently studied the possible feedback inhibition of purified brain NOS, but observed no appreciable inhibition of citrulline formation upon addition of high concentrations of authentic NO or drugs believed to release NO. Moreover, reaction rates were not enhanced in the presence of oxyhemoglobin, an effective scavenger of NO(12Mayer B. Werner E.R. Leopold E. Klatt P. Schmidt K. Feelisch M. Busse R. Moncada S.

However, several reports from different groups demonstrate inhibition of NO synthesis by NO in brain cytosol, endothelial cells, and macrophages (13Rogers N.E. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Albeit these studies used fairly high concentrations of NO to produce inhibition, the results clearly conflict with our data.A major drawback of previous work on feedback inhibition of NOS was that actual NO concentrations have not been measured in the incubation mixtures. In the present study we have used an NO-sensitive Clark-type electrode for NO measurements under various conditions and found that the NOS cofactor H4biopterin induced a rapid oxidation of NO. This pronounced effect was apparently due to generation of superoxide in the course of H4biopterin autoxidation. Interestingly, purified NOS produced no detectable amounts of NO, unless high concentrations of SOD had been added, regardless whether H4biopterin was present or not.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsL-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine hydrochloride (57 Ci/mmol) and [α- 32 P]GTP (400 Ci/mmol) were purchased from MedPro (Amersham Corp.), Vienna, Austria. 3-Morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1), a generous gift from Cassellla-Riedel, Frankfurt, Germany, was dissolved at pH 5.0 prior to use.

NO and oxygen meters were connected to an Apple Macintosh computer via an analog to digital (A/D) converter (MacLab, World Precision Instruments). Depending on the required resolution in time, data were collected at rates of 0.3-10 Hz. Solutions to be tested (0.5-10 μl) were applied by injection into 1.8-ml glass vials sealed with a septum. To minimize head space volumes, vials were completely filled with 1.8 ml of triethanolamine/HCl buffer (pH 7.0), containing additives as indicated.

Following application of DEA/NO (20-120 nmol), NO concentrations rapidly increased to 3-9 μM, followed by a slow decrease of the signals. The areas under the curve were calculated by integration from t1 = 0 (addition of DEA/NO) and t2 (defined as the time point at which NO concentrations had decreased to 0.5 μM ( ~ 30 min)). There was a linear relationship between this area and NO generated from 20 to 120 nmol of DEA/NO. Consumption of NO was measured in the presence of 40-120 nmol of DEA/NO and 10-40 nmol of H4biopterin. NO:oxygen stoichiometry was measured by electrochemical determination of oxygen consumption in the presence of 0.1-0.2 mM DEA/NO. Initial oxygen concentrations were 210 ± 5.5 μM (n = 20).Autoxidation Kinetics of H4BiopterinH4Biopterin (1-10 μM) was incubated under constant stirring in 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer (pH 7.0) at ambient temperature.

Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 23Blair J.A. Pearson A.J. J. Chem. Soc. 1974; : 80-88Google Scholar), the apparent rate constants (kobs ) for NO and H4biopterin oxidation were divided by the initial oxygen concentrations (210 ± 5.5 μM; n = 20) to obtain the respective rate constants. All data are means ± S.E. of n experiments.Determination of NOS ActivityNOS was purified from porcine brain as described previously(24Mayer B. John M. Böhme E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined as formation of L-[3H]citrulline from L-[3H]arginine. Unless otherwise indicated, purified brain NOS (0.2 μg) was incubated at 37°C for 10 min in 0.1 ml of 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mML-[3H]arginine, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 0.2 mM NADPH, 10 μM H4biopterin, 5 μM FMN, and 5 μM FAD. Blank values were determined in the absence of enzyme. For electrochemical detection of NO, incubations were performed at ambient temperature in 0.5 ml of 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 μg of NOS, 1 mML-arginine, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5 μg of calmodulin, 0.3 mM NADPH, 5 μM FMN, and 5 μM FAD. H4Biopterin concentration-response curves were recorded in a cumulative manner in the absence and presence of 5,000 units/ml SOD by sequential addition of 100-fold concentrated H4biopterin stock solutions.Determination of Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase ActivitySoluble guanylyl cyclase purified from bovine lung (25Humbert P. Niroomand F. Fischer G. Mayer B. Koesling D. Hinsch K.-D. Gausepohl H. Frank R. Schultz G. Böhme E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from the late Eycke Böhme, Department of Pharmacology, Free University of Berlin, Germany. Formation of [ 32 P]cGMP from [α- 32 P]GTP was measured by incubation of 0.15 μg of enzyme at 37°C for 10 min in 0.1 ml of 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mM [α- 32 P]GTP (200,000-300,000 cpm), 1 mM Mg 2+ , 1 mM cGMP, and 1 μM GSNO. Reactions were terminated by ZnCO3 precipitation, and [ 32 P]cGMP was isolated as described elsewhere(26Schultz G. B ö hme E. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Graβl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 379-389Google Scholar).RESULTSWe obtained linear responses by calibration of a Clark-type NO-sensitive electrode with NO generated from 0.05 up to 10 μM acidified nitrite. As an example, Fig. 1 shows representative traces obtained by calibration of the electrode with 0.4-2 μM nitrite. A sensitivity of 3.85 nM/pA was calculated from the slope of the linear curve fit shown in the inset to Fig. 1. This is in good accordance with a previously reported sensitivity of 3.92 ± 0.23 nM/pA(27Tsukahara H. Gordienko D.V. Goligorsky M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Since fluctuations of basal currents were usually 2-3 pA, the detection limit of our setup was approximately 20 nM NO. For unknown reasons, basal currents were quite unstable occasionally, but grounding of the operator with a stainless steel wire markedly improved stability in these cases. It is possible, therefore, that taking additional precautions against interferences by surrounding electromagnetical fields could increase sensitivity. The method appears to be specific for NO, since no response of the electrode was observed in the presence of high concentrations of nitrite, nitrate, peroxynitrite, hydrogen peroxide, or a superoxide-generating system (not shown).Fig. 2 shows representative traces obtained with authentic NO. Addition of 4 μl of an NO solution ( ~ 2 mM) to total volumes of 1.8 ml induced a pronounced response of the electrode corresponding to a maximum of ~ 1.8 μM NO, followed by a decrease of the signal according to second order kinetics (see Fig. 2, inset). Measurement of oxygen uptake in the presence of defined amounts of NO released from the NO donor DEA/NO (21Maragos C.M. Morley D. Wink D.A. Dunams T.M. Saavedra J.E. Hoffman A. Bove A.A. Isaac L. Hrabie J.A. Keefer L.K. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) showed that 1 molecule of oxygen consumed 3.92 ± 0.23 (n = 5) molecules of NO. Assuming a first order rate law with respect to oxygen(22Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), we obtained a third order rate constant for NO autoxidation of 9.2 ± 0.33 × 106M -2 s -1 (n = 11), which was not changed by 5,000 units/ml SOD (9.5 ± 0.54 × 106M -2 s -1 ; n = 4).Figure 2:Autoxidation of NO. Experiments were performed at ambient temperature in the absence (-) and presence of 5,000 units/ml SOD (•••••). At time point zero, 4 μl of a saturated NO solution ( ~ 2 mM) were added to 1.8 ml of 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, and changes in NO concentrations were monitored over 13 min ( ~ 350 data points). Inset, replot of the original data (2.5 to 13 min; ~ 230 points) according to second-order rate law. The original tracing and the plot shown in the inset are representative of 11 (Control) or four (SOD) similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rates of NO oxidation were markedly increased by addition of H4biopterin. As can be seen from the representative experiment shown in Fig. 3, oxidation kinetics was changed from second to zero order with respect to NO, suggesting that NO itself was not involved in the rate-limiting reaction step that induced its rapid oxidation. The reaction was first order with respect to H4biopterin, and gassing the buffer with helium for 15 min prior to the experiments completely blocked the effect of H4biopterin (not shown), indicating that NO oxidation was triggered by a reaction of molecular oxygen with H4biopterin. Experiments in which DEA/NO was used for release of defined amounts of NO revealed that 1 mol of H4biopterin consumed 0.98 ± 0.10 (n = 23) mol of NO. However, the pteridine became substoichiometrically active in the presence of reducing compounds. Pure NADPH (0.1 mM), for instance, did not affect autoxidation of NO but markedly decreased H4biopterin:NO stoichiometry to at least 1:10.Figure 3:Effect of H4biopterin on NO oxidation. Experiments were performed at ambient temperature in the absence (-) and presence of 5,000 units/ml SOD (•••••). At time point zero, 4 μl of a saturated NO solution ( ~ 2 mM) were added to 1.8 ml of 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.0. At the maximum of the NO peak, a solution of H4biopterin (30 μM final concentration) was added. Inset, replot of the data (2.5 to 15 min; ~ 270 points) obtained in the presence of SOD according to second-order rate law. The original tracing and the plot shown in the inset are representative of 11 (Control) or 4 (SOD) similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since SOD (5,000 units/ml) completely prevented H4biopterin-induced oxidation of NO (Fig. 3), we speculated that the effect was mediated by superoxide generated via H4biopterin autoxidation. Two sets of experiments were performed to substantiate this hypothesis. First, we determined rates of H4biopterin autoxidation directly by quantitative HPLC analysis. Autoxidation was first order with respect to H4biopterin (kobs = 3.03 ± 0.37 × 10 -4 s -1 ; n = 5). Assuming first order kinetics of oxygen consumption(23Blair J.A. Pearson A.J. J. Chem. Soc. 1974; : 80-88Google Scholar), we obtained a rate constant for H4biopterin autoxidation of 1.44 ± 0.18 M -1 s -1 (n = 5), which was comparable with the respective constant obtained by determination of NO oxidation in the presence of H4biopterin (1.88 ± 0.15 M -1 s -1 ; n = 11). Second, we tested whether generation of superoxide by hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase mimicked H4biopterin-induced oxidation of NO. As shown in Fig. 4, addition of xanthine oxidase (1.67 milliunits) to an NO solution containing 1 mM hypoxanthine induced an SOD-inhibitable switch of NO oxidation from second to zero order kinetics, which was very similar to that observed in the presence of H4biopterin. Consumption of NO was 10.3 ± 0.73 nM s -1 (n = 4) under these conditions, demonstrating that rates of zero order NO oxidation were a good measure for superoxide production by the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase system. These data suggest that H4biopterin-induced generation of superoxide accounts for the rapid oxidation of NO in the presence of the NOS cofactor H4biopterin.Figure 4:Effect of hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase on NO oxidation. Experiments were performed at ambient temperature in the absence (-) and presence of 5,000 units/ml SOD (•••••). At time point zero, 4 μl of a saturated NO solution ( ~ 2 mM) were added to 1.8 ml of 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mM hypoxanthine. After reaching the maximal NO concentration, 1.67 milliunits of xanthine oxidase were added. Inset, replot of the data (2.5-15 min; ~ 270 points) obtained in the presence of SOD according to second-order rate law. The original tracing and the plot shown are representative of four.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since these findings appeared to be of potential relevance to the biology of NO, we investigated whether the biological activity of NO was affected by H4biopterin. Fig. 5 shows that H4biopterin produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of purified soluble guanylyl cyclase, which had been stimulated with 1 μM GSNO. Half-maximal effects were observed at 2 μM H4biopterin, and inhibition was complete at 0.1 mM.Figure 5:Effect of H4biopterin on NO-induced cGMP formation by purified soluble guanylyl cyclase. Soluble guanylyl cyclase purified from bovine lung (0.15 μg) was incubated at 37°C for 10 min in 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.5 in the presence of 1 μM GSNO and increasing concentrations of H4biopterin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are means ± S.E. of three experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taking into account the role of H4biopterin as essential cofactor of NOS, we measured enzymatically produced NO with the NO-sensitive electrode. As shown in Fig. 6(upper panel), we observed no detectable signal by incubation of purified NOS with L-arginine and requisite cofactors in the absence and presence (0.1-1 μM) of exogenously added H4biopterin. However, subsequent addition of 5,000 units/ml SOD resulted in the generation of NO at initial rates of approximately 20 nM s -1 , yielding steady state concentrations of ~ 0.3 μM NO after about 1 min. The lower panel in Fig. 6 shows a representative experiment performed in the presence of SOD. No response of the electrode was observed in the absence of calmodulin, addition of calmodulin produced a signal corresponding to ~ 0.1 μM NO, and this was further increased to ~ 0.3 μM in a concentration-dependent manner by added H4biopterin. The half-maximally active concentration of H4biopterin was approximately 0.1 μM and thus similar to the potency of the pteridine determined previously with other methods(24Mayer B. John M. Böhme E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 28Klatt P. Schmidt K. Uray G. Mayer B. J. Biol.

Experiments were performed at ambient temperature in 0.5 ml of 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mML-arginine, 0.3 mM NADPH, 5 μM FAD, 5 μM FMN, and 5 μg of purified brain NOS. Original tracings of experiments performed in the absence (upper panel) and presence of 5,000 units/ml SOD (lower panel) are shown. Where indicated, calmodulin (10 μg/ml), H4biopterin (0.1-100 μM), or SOD (5,000 units/ml) were added (final concentrations in parentheses). The tracings shown are representative of three.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results demonstrated that NOS produced detectable amounts of NO only when considerably high concentrations of SOD were present. We speculated that this may explain the controversy regarding feedback inhibition of NOS by NO and measured formation of citrulline by the purified enzyme in the absence and presence of 5,000 units/ml SOD. As shown in Fig. 7, the enzyme was inhibited to 51.2% of controls in the presence of SOD, and this effect was completely prevented by 20 μM oxyhemoglobin. SIN-1 (1 mM) had a slight, oxyhemoglobin-insensitive inhibitory effect in the absence of SOD (75.5% of controls), but rates of citrulline formation were reduced down to 26.6% of untreated controls when both SIN-1 and SOD were present. Again, the inhibitory effect of SOD was not observed in the presence of 20 μM oxyhemoglobin.Figure 7:Effects of oxyhemoglobin on SOD-induced inhibition of NOS. Purified brain NOS (0.2 μg) was incubated at 37°C for 10 min in 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, in the absence and presence of SOD (5,000 units/ml), oxyhemoglobin (20 μM) or SIN-1 (1 mM) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are means ± S.E. of five experiments performed in duplicates.

For the overall reaction we obtained a third order rate constant of 9.2 × 106M -2 s -1 , which is in good accordance to kinetic data published previously(22Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 29Ford P.C. Wink D.A. Stanbury D.M.

Chem. 1994; 269 (269, 5881-5883): 5881-5883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of an NO:oxygen stoichiometry close to 4:1 confirms that NO autoxidation may follow a reaction sequence suggested recently(31Ignarro L.J. Fukuto J.M. Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.E. Byrns R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8103-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar): 2NO+O2→2NO2 2NO2+2NO→2N2O32N2O3+2H2O→4NO2-+4H+The major finding of the present study is that fairly low concentrations of the NOS cofactor H4biopterin induce rapid oxidation of NO. Mechanism of H4biopterin-mediated NO oxidation is apparently different from that of NO autoxidation, because it followed zero order instead of second-order kinetics with respect to NO. Thus, the rate-limiting reaction is independent of the actual NO concentrations and appears to solely involve H4biopterin and oxygen. Autoxidation of H4biopterin is thought to generate superoxide(32Davies M.D. Kaufman S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which again rapidly reacts with NO to form peroxynitrite(3Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6665) Google Scholar). Several observations led us to suggest that the effect of H4biopterin is mediated by superoxide anions. First, SOD completely blocked H4biopterin-induced oxidation of NO. Second, rate constants for NO oxidation in the presence of the pteridine correlated well with rates of H4biopterin autoxidation, and, finally, a superoxide generating system was found to mimic the effects of H4biopterin on NO oxidation kinetics (see Fig. 4).Accordingly, superoxide generated during autoxidation of H4biopterin seems to react with NO to peroxynitrite, explaining the rapid, apparently zero order decrease in NO concentrations induced by H4biopterin. The fact that the H4biopterin-induced inactivation of NO was not apparent when either NOS-catalyzed NO production (28Klatt P. Schmidt K. Uray G. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14781-14787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or authentic NO (this study; not shown) were measured as loss of oxyhemoglobin may be explained by recent findings demonstrating NO-like reaction of peroxynitrite with oxyhemoglobin(33Schmidt K. Klatt P. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that peroxynitrite is produced from NO in the presence of H4biopterin, but direct demonstration of this was preclud"

Here, we identify a region of the channel associated with the activation gate using potentiation by intracellular Ni2+. Low concentrations of Ni2+ caused a dramatic increase in the response of rod channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes to both cGMP and cAMP. Whereas saturating cAMP normally activated less than 1% of the channels, Ni2+ increased the cAMP potency nearly 50-fold. Ni2+ did not produce potentiation in the related channel from the olfactory epithelium. We localized the Ni(2+)-binding site to a histidine residue in the putative intracellular mouth of the rod channel (H420). We propose a mechanism for potentiation in which Ni2+ binds to H420 primarily when the channel is open, stabilizing the open conformation. These experiments suggest that H420 is associated with the activation gate."

M., and Stuehr, D. J. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 90, 10769-10772). Here, we examined how L-arginine and the analogs N omega-methyl-L-arginine (NMA), N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (NAME), and d-(thioureido)-L-norvaline (thiocitrulline) affect electron flux through neuronal and macrophage NOS. L-Arginine and NMA increased or decreased NOS NADPH consumption depending on the isoform, while thiocitrulline and NAME decreased NADPH oxidation in both NOS by 73-86% relative to their ligand-free rates. Kinetic studies showed that thiocitrulline and NAME inhibited NOS NADPH consumption through binding within the substrate binding site. Thiocitrulline and NAME did not affect the NADPH-dependent reduction of NOS flavins nor NOS cytochrome c reduction, indicating that they blocked electron flux at a point beyond the flavins in the electron transfer sequence. Thiocitrulline and NAME inhibited both NADPH-dependent and dithionite-mediated heme iron reduction in the NOS isoforms relative to the substrate-free NOS, whereas L-arginine and NMA did not. Thus, L-arginine and NMA increase or decrease electron flux through the NOS by coupling NADPH oxidation to NO synthesis (L-arginine), or by occupying the substrate binding site with minimal catalytic coupling (NMA). In contrast, thiocitrulline and NAME decrease electron flux through both NOS isoforms by decreasing the reduction potential of the heme iron. Inhibition of heme iron reduction by substrate analogs is unusual and represents a new means to modulate electron flow through the NOS."

Here, we have studied two osteogenic cell lines, namely MG-63 and HOS, and a chemically transformed subclone of HOS cells, HOS-MNNG. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), a putative regulator of bone fracture healing, increased collagen gel contraction by MG-63 and HOS-MNNG, but not by HOS cells. Our data show that TGF-β-induced fibronectin synthesis is not sufficient for the process. Instead, anti-β1 integrin antibodies could prevent the contraction. There are three different integrin heterodimers that are known to mediate the cell-collagen interaction, namely α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1. In MG-63 cells TGF-β increased the expression of α2β1 integrin and decreased the expression of α3β1 integrin, whereas α1β1 integrin is not expressed. HOS cells had no α2β1 integrin, neither did TGF-β induce its expression. However, HOS-MNNG cells expressed more α2β1 integrin when treated with TGF-β.

INTRODUCTIONHydrated collagen lattices were first described as a method to mimic soft-tissue matrices (Elsdale and Bard, 1972). Watery milieu within fibrous collagen net has since been used as a substrate for growth and differentation for many types of cells. When fibroblasts are embedded in collagen they are able to reduce the areas of the collagen gels and form a tissue-like structure. The ultrastructure of fibroblasts during contraction differ from the same cells plated on a plastic surface. Differences in the prominence of cell coat, changes of the prevalence of cell processes and the state of aggregation of their associated microfilamentous material are seen (Bellows et al., 1981). Collagen gels can be used to study the contraction of either floating matrix or anchored matrix (Grinnell, 1994). In the two variations of in vitro collagen matrix reorganization model, the morphology and the behavior of fibroblasts differ. The first one is suggested to mimic dermis or scars and the latter granulation tissue (Grinnell, 1994). The exact molecular mechanism of collagen gel contraction is unknown. Previous studies have suggested an essential role for cell surface collagen receptors (Gullberg et al., 1990; Shiro et al., 1991; Klein et al., 1991). Also cellular fibronectin (FN) 1The abbreviations used are: FNfibronectinHOShuman osteogenic sarcoma cellsFCSfetal calf serumILinterleukinTGFtransforming growth factorMNNGN-methyl-N′nitro-N-nitrosoguanidineDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumkbkilobase(s).has been suggested to be required in the collagen matrix contraction by fibroblasts (Asaga et al., 1991).Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been discovered to enhance collagen gel contraction by skin fibroblasts (Montesano and Orci, 1988). Later, a similar effect has been described with other growth factors and cytokines (Clark et al., 1989; Gullberg et al., 1990). Some others, like interferon-γ, can inhibit the process (Dans and Isseroff, 1994). TGF-β is a multifunctional regulator of cells which acts in the process of wound healing (for review, see Massagué, 1990). Many cell types can in vitro and in vivo produce TGF-β, and it has been found abundant in platelets and in bone. It stimulates the accumulation of extracellular matrix (Ignotz and Massagué, 1986) and regulates cell adhesion apparatus (Ignotz and Massagué, 1987). TGF-β is supposed to have a central role in tissue healing. The fact that it is present in large amounts in bone and that it increases bone formation in vivo in test animals (Noda and Camilliere, 1989; Joyce et al., 1990) indicates the possible role of TGF-β in the healing of bone fractures. Here, we have shown that TGF-β can increase collagen gel contraction by osteogenic cells. Since TGF-β is known to regulate the integrin type collagen receptors in different cell lines (Heino and Massagué, 1989; Heino et al., 1989) and also to increase production of cellular FN (Ignotz and Massagué, 1986; Roberts et al., 1987), these are the candidate mechanisms to be responsible for the phenomenon. Integrins are a family of cell surface receptors consisting of two subunits, α and β (for review, see Hynes, 1992; Ruoslahti, 1991). Three different integrin heterodimers are known to mediate cell-type I collagen interaction, namely α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1. In addition to α1, α2, and α3 subunits, β1 subunit can form heterodimers with α4-α9 subunits and αv subunit. Several of these β1 integrins recognize FN as their ligand, namely α3β1, α4β1, α5β1, and αvβ1. Laminin is the ligand for α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α6β1, and α7β1 integrin heterodimers.We have determined the effects of TGF-β on collagen gel contraction by osteogenic cell lines, in which the pattern of collagen-binding integrins differs from each other, and identified the molecular mechanism by which TGF-β enhances collagen gel contraction. Our data suggest that up-regulation of α2β1 integrin is required and alone sufficient to increase contraction.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CulturesHuman osteosarcoma cells used were MG-63, HOS, and HOS-MNNG (HOS cells transformed with N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, tumorigenic) all from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM, Flow Laboratories, Irvine, United Kingdom) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Flow Laboratories).Cytokines and Growth FactorsPurified bovine bone transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) was kindly provided by Dr. Joan Massagué (Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York). Human recombinant interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Concentrations used were 200 pM (TGF-β) and 10 units/ml (IL-1β).AntibodiesPolyclonal rabbit antiserum against human β1 (Heino et al., 1989), α2, and α3 integrin subunits (Santala et al., 1994) were used in immunoprecipitation assays. Functional monoclonal antibodies used to block the collagen gel contraction were against β1 (mab13; Akiyama et al., 1989), α2 (Gi9; Immunotech S.A, Marseille, France), α1 (SR-84; Rettig et. al., 1984), and α3 (B1B5; Wayner and Carter, 1987) subunits.ImmunoprecipitationsCell cultures were metabolically labeled with 50 or 100 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine (Tran 35S-label, ICN Biochemicals) for 24 h in methionine-free minimum essential medium. When cytokines and growth factors were used, cells were preincubated with them in serum-free medium overnight, and they were also used during the labeling. Cell monolayers were rinsed on ice with a solution containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and then detached by scraping. Cell pellets obtained by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min were solubilized in 200 μl of the same buffer containing 100 mMn-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (Sigma) on ice with occasional vortexing. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Radioactivity in cell lysates was counted, and an equal amount of radioactivity was used in immunoprecipitation assays. Cytokines did not cause any systematic changes in the incorporation of [35S]methionine into cellular proteins as determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v) and bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml) were added to the supernatants, which were then precleaned by incubation with 50 μl of packed protein A-sepharose (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.). Supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-integrin antibodies for 12 h at 4°C. Immunocomplexes were recovered by binding to protein A-sepharose and washing the beads four times with 25 mM Tris-buffered isotonic saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and twice with 0.5 M NaCl and 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing 6% polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions followed by fluorography. Integrin bands were quantified from fluorograms by the Microcomputer Imaging Device version M4 (Imaging Research Inc). FN immunoprecipitations were done from [35S]methionine-labeled methionine-free cell culture mediums. An equal volume of medium and phosphate-buffered isotonic saline containing 100 mMn-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside were precleaned with packed protein A-sepharose and incubated with polyclonal antiserum against human plasma fibronectin (Chen et al., 1986) at 4°C for 12 h. Immunocomplexes were recovered and washed as mentioned previously, and reduced immunoprecipitants were analyzed by electrophoresis and quantified from fluorograms.Northern Blot HybridizationsTotal cellular RNA was isolated by using the guanidium thiocyanate-CsCl method (Chirgwin et al., 1979). RNAs were separated in 1% formaldehyde-containing agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes (ZETA-probe, Bio-Rad), and hybridized with [32P]-labeled (Amersham) human α2 integrin cDNA probe (Takada and Hemler, 1989).Collagen Gel ContractionsCollagen gels were prepared by using Vitrogen-100 collagen (Celtrix). Eight volumes of Vitrogen were mixed with two volumes of a 1:1 mixture of 10-fold concentrated medium and 0.1 N NaOH and kept on ice. Cells were detached, counted, and mixed gently into neutralized Vitrogen solution before transferred into 24-well plates (50,000 cells/well). In some experiments 96-well plates were used. Collagen polymerization was initiated by incubating the plates at 37°C for 45 min. DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and appropriate cytokines was then added on gels before detaching the edges of the gels from the sides of the wells. Contraction process was observed daily. After 2-6 days the cell culture wells were photographed and the surface areas of the gels were measured from prints. Data are presented as relative values (experiment/control). In one set of experiments 1 or 10 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin (pFN, Boehringer Mannheim) or cell-derived fibronectin (cFN, Fibrogenex, Mortons Grove, IL) were added into neutralized Vitrogen solution before adding the cells. In antibody blocking experiments monoclonal antibodies were added similarly.Cell Adhesion AssaysThe coating of a 96-well immunoplate (Maxi Sorp, Nunc, Denmark) was done by exposure to 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 4-5 μg/cm2 laminin (purified from basement membranes of the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor, Collaborative Research), fibronectin (human plasma fibronectin, Boehringer Mannheim), type I collagen (from lathyric rat skin, Boehringer Mannheim), or type IV collagen (Sigma) for 12 h at 4°C. Bovine serum albumin was used to measure the nonspecific binding. Residual protein absorption sites on all wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37°C. Confluent cell cultures were detached by using 0.01% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. Trypsin activity was inhibited by washing the cells with 1 mg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were suspended in MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10,000 cells were transferred into each well and incubated at 37°C for 45 min. Non-adherent cells were removed by rinsing the wells with medium. Adherent cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol, and washed with distilled water. The immunoplates were allowed to air-dry, and the stain bound to cells was dissolved into 10% acetic acid and spectrophotometrically measured at 600 nm with Multiscan Plus (Lab-Systems).TransfectionsA 4.5-kb fragment of human α2 integrin cDNA (nucleotides 1-4559 in the published sequence), containing the full translated sequence (kindly provided by Dr. Martin Hemler; Takada and Hemler, 1989) was linked into pAWneo2 expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. Arthur Weiss; Ohashi et al., 1985) which carries the neomycin resistance gene. Transfections were done by using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The neomycin analog G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the culture medium in the concentration of 400 μg/ml. G418-resistant cell clones were selected for 2-3 weeks, isolated, and analyzed for their expression of α2 integrin mRNA as well as α2 protein. Three out of 24 clones (HOS cells), and 3 out of 19 clones (MG-63 cells) showed high expression levels for α2 integrin. Control cells used were transfected with pAWneo2 plasmid only.The same 4.5-kb cDNA was linked to pAW vector also in antisense orientation. Cells were transfected and selected as above. Among the first 28 cell clones analyzed, two showed markedly reduced expression of α2 integrin and the presence of antisense α2 integrin mRNA.Statistical AnalysisThe statistical significance of differences in cell adhesion and in collagen gel contraction assays was assessed with general mixed model analysis of variance (BMDP/Dynamic, 7.0, BMDP Statistical Software Inc., Cork, Ireland), when multiple independent experiments were analyzed (random factor being the experiment and fixed factor being the treatment). One way analysis of variance with Dunnett's method (SAS statistical program package; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used when one experiment contained several differentially treated groups. Experiments with two groups were analyzed with Student's t test for independent samples.RESULTSTGF-β Increases Collagen Gel Contraction by MG-63 and HOS-MNNG Cells But Not by HOS CellsCollagen gel contraction assays cell-type I collagen interaction. It is suggested to simulate matrix reorganization during tissue healing. Type I collagen is the major component of bone matrix, proposing its importance for osteogenic cells. TGF-β is a growth factor involved in the regulation of fracture healing process. In this study we wanted to elucidate the effects of TGF-β on collagen gel contraction by osteogenic cells and to find out the mechanism by which it makes other cells more capable of contracting the gels than others. We have used in our experiments two different osteogenic cell lines, namely MG-63 and HOS, and a chemically transformed variant of HOS cells (HOS-MNNG). Cells were embedded in neutralized type I collagen solution, and growth medium supplemented with 10% of FCS was added on gels after polymerization was complete. Without serum no contraction could be seen (not shown). TGF-β was used in the concentration of 200 pM and it constantly enhanced collagen gel contraction by MG-63 (p <0.001; mixed model analysis of variance) and HOS-MNNG cells (p <0.05; mixed model analysis of variance; Fig. 1). In HOS cells, however, TGF-β had no effect (Fig. 1). In MG-63 cells also IL-1 could increase the contraction, but it seemed to be less potent than TGF-β (Fig. 1).Cellular Fibronectin Is Not Involved in TGF-β-induced Collagen Gel ContractionThe importance of cellular FN in the process of collagen gel contraction by fibroblasts has been proposed (Asaga et al., 1991). Knowing the fact that in many cell lines TGF-β can increase the production of FN, this is a putative mechanism for TGF-β-induced contraction. We added into the gels both plasma- and cell-derived FN (1-10 μg/ml), but this did not have any effect on the contraction (Fig. 2). We also measured FN synthesis by labeling cells with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitating FN from the growth media. In HOS cells TGF-β increased the production of FN 10-fold (not shown). The fact that the contraction by HOS cells did not increase although their production of FN increased when treated with TGF-β is also contradictory to the involvement of FN.Figure 2The effects of 10 μg/ml plasma fibronectin (pFN) and cellular fibronectin (cFN) on collagen gel contraction by MG-63 cells. Cells were added together with pFN or cFN into neutralized Vitrogen-100 collagen solution and were then plated into 24-well culture plates. Collagen polymerization was initiated by incubating the plates at 37°C for 45 min. After the polymerization was complete, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was added on gels, and the sides of the gels were gently removed from the sides of the wells. MG-63 cells treated with 200 pM TGF-β were used as a contraction control. After 4 days the areas of the gels were measured. Mean ± S.D. of four parallel measurements is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of α2β1 Integrin Correlates with Collagen Gel ContractionPrevious studies have suggested the role of collagen-receptor integrins (Gullberg et al., 1990), especially α2β1 (Shiro et al., 1991; Klein et al. 1991), but also α1β1 in collagen gel contraction by fibroblasts. Here, the first evidence of the involvement of β1-integrins came from the experiments showing that anti-β1 integrin antibody can almost completely block the TGF-β-induced contraction by MG-63 cells (p <0.05; one way analysis of variance; Fig. 3). Previous studies have shown that anti-α integrin antibodies are often alone incapable of inhibiting the contraction (Klein et al., 1991). Additionally, here the blocking effect of anti-α2 integrin antibody was much weaker than that of anti-β1 integrin antibody (inhibition was not statistically significant; Fig. 3). Anti-α1 antibody had no effect and anti-α3 antibody constantly increased contraction (p <0.05; one way analysis of variance; Fig. 3). We have previously analyzed the integrin pattern in MG-63 cells and shown that these cells express small amounts of α2 integrin subunit, whereas α3 integrin is the major partner of β1 subunit (Heino and Massagué, 1989). TGF-β increases the expression of α2 subunit to about 6-8-fold (Heino and Massagué, 1989; also shown here in Fig. 4) and concomitantly down-regulates the expression of α3 subunit about 60-80% (Heino and Massagué, 1989). HOS cells express both α1 and α3 subunits, but no α2 subunit (Santala et al., 1994). Here, we show that in spite of the lack of α2β1 integrin HOS cells can slightly contract the collagen gels (Fig. 5). Anti-β1 antibody can block this phenomenon (Fig. 5). This suggests that other β1 integrins, in addition to α2β1, can, at least to some extent, mediate collagen gel contraction. More importantly, TGF-β could not turn on the expression of α2 integrin in this cell line (not shown) as it could not increase their ability to contract collagen gels (Fig. 1).Figure 3The blocking of TGF-β-induced collagen gel contraction by MG-63 cells with functional antibodies against different collagen-binding integrin subunits. Antibodies were added into neutralized Vitrogen-100 collagen together with the cells. After incubation at 37°C for 45 min, the edges of the gels were detached from the sides of the wells, and DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 200 pM TGF-β was added on them. The areas of the gels were measured after 4 days of contraction. Antibodies against β1, α1, α2, and α3 subunits were used. Mean ± S.D. of four parallel measurements is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Effect of TGF-β on α2 integrin subunit biosynthesis.

The areas of the gels were measured after 6 days of incubation. The figure shows four parallel control and anti-β1 antibody-containing wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Chemical transformation of HOS cells turns on the expression of α2 integrin subunit (Santala et al., 1994). Here, TGF-β could slightly (about 2.5-fold) increase the expression of α2 integrin in HOS-MNNG cells (Fig. 4). TGF-β also enhanced the contraction by these cells (Fig. 1). The data suggest that the increased expression of α2β1 integrin correlates with the enhanced collagen gel contraction by TGF-β.Forced Expression of α2 Integrin in HOS Cells Increases Collagen Gel ContractionTo further examine the involvement of α2 integrin to the phenomenon, we linked the full-length α2 integrin cDNA (Takada and Hemler, 1989) to pAWneo2 expression vector (Ohashi et al., 1985) under a constitutive Friend's spleen focus forming virus long terminal repeat promoter. After transfection with the plasmid, G418-resistant HOS cell clones were selected and analyzed by immunoprecipitation. Polyclonal rabbit anti-α2 integrin antibody immunoprecipitated two polypeptides of 140 and 130 kDa (non-reduced) from the transfected HOS cells, the 140-kDa polypeptide representing the α2 integrin subunit and the 130-kDa representing the β1 subunit while the wild type cells and cells transfected with only the vector gave no signal (Fig. 6). Importantly, the expressed α2 subunit was capable of forming dimers with β1 subunit, which is essential for the integrin heterodimer to be expressed on the cell surface (Heino et al., 1989). Furthermore, the fact that these cell clones showed increased cell adhesion to type I collagen (p <0.001; t test; Fig. 7) suggests that the collagen receptor was functional. mRNAs encoding α2 integrin subunit were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. HOS wild type cells give no signal for α2 subunit mRNA (Santala et al., 1994), and MG-63 cells were used as a positive control. A 8-kb α2 integrin mRNA was seen in wild type MG-63 cells and a smaller about 4-kb transcript in cells transfected with the construct containing α2 integrin cDNA (Fig. 6). This suggests that α2 integrin seen in these cells is translated from cDNA-derived mRNA and is not due to artificial activation of the wild type gene. HOS cells forced to express α2β1 integrin heterodimer were more capable of contracting collagen gels than wild type cells or cells transfected with only the vector carrying the neomycin resistance gene (p <0.001; t test; Fig. 7).Figure 6Integrin expression in pAWα2 transfected HOS cells.

Human full-length α2 integrin cDNA was linked into pAWneo2 expression vector, which carries the neomycin resistance gene. HOS cells were transfected by using Lipofectin reagent, and stable cell clones were selected by using G418. G418-resistant clones were tested for their expression of α2 integrin protein in immunoprecipitation assays (in the figure clone 16 is shown). Control cells (marked as C) were transfected with pAWneo2 expression vector only. Wild type HOS cells are marked as Wt.

Residual protein absorption sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. 10,000 cells were let to adhere for 45 min after which the adherent cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and air-dried.

Collagen gel polymerization was initiated by incubating the plates at 37°C for 45 min. DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was added on gels, and the edges of the gels were gently removed from the sides of the wells. After 2 days of incubation at 37°C, the areas of the gels were measured. Two parallel experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Transfection of MG-63 Cells with Antisense α2 Integrin cDNA Decreases Collagen Gel ContractionThe transfection of MG-63 cells with α2 integrin cDNA increased their expression of α2β1 integrin and concomitantly their ability to contract collagen gels (p <0.001; t test; Fig. 8). Transfection of MG-63 cells with the same expression vector containing antisense-oriented α2 integrin cDNA produced cell clones with decreased α2β1 expression (Fig. 8). Two cell clones were further analyzed by Northern blot hybridization revealing that α2 integrin mRNA levels had decreased to 46 and 56% of that in control cells (not shown). Furthermore, both cell clones expressed an approximately 4-kb transcript which was supposed to represent the antisense mRNA. The ratios of antisense/α2 integrin mRNA were one and six (not shown). Thus, we suggest, that there is a pool of α2 integrin mRNA not reached by antisense mRNA, even if a larger amount of antisense mRNA is synthesized. However, it is not probable that all this mRNA is translated because the decrease in α2 integrin protein synthesis seems to be larger than in the corresponding mRNA levels. Both cell clones showed decreased ability to contract collagen gels (p <0.001; t test; Fig. 8). Thus, both in MG-63 and in HOS cells the increased α2 integrin expression alone is sufficient for the increased contraction of collagen gels. Furthermore, the amount of α2 integrin is critical for the process, and its decrease leads to diminished ability to contract gels.Figure 8Effects of the expression of sense and antisense α2 integrin mRNA in MG-63-cells.

Among other biological functions, TGFs-β are supposed to be essential for wound healing and tissue repair processes (Massagué, 1990). In general, they increase the accumulation of connective tissue macromolecules and angiogenesis (Massagué, 1990). Both phenomena are important in the formation of scars. A major source of TGF-β1, and also TGF-β2, is bone matrix. In the healing of bone fractures, recently discovered members of TGF-β superfamily called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP 2-7) are suggested to be involved in the initiation of the healing process (Reddi, 1992). TGF-β is more probably involved in the other stages of the healing process, e.g. in the synthesis of new matrix (Reddi, 1992). The important role of extracellular matrix and growth factors for bone forming cells has also been emphasized in the recent review by Robey et al.(1993).We have tested two osteogenic cell lines, MG-63 and HOS, for their ability to contract collagen gels and studied the effect of TGF-β on the process. Both cell lines could contract collagen gels, and anti-β1 integrin antibodies could inhibit this contraction. We and others (Takada et al., 1987; Heino and Massagué, 1989; Dedhar and Saulnier, 1990; Santala et al., 1994) have previously described the β1 integrin pattern in both cell lines. There are three putative integrin-type collagen receptors, namely α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1. In MG-63 cells α2β1 and α3β1 are expressed, whereas no α1β1 is present. HOS cells express distinct integrin pattern: α1β1 and α3β1 are present, but α2β1 is missing. Both MG-63 cells and HOS cells express α5β1 fibronectin receptor, whereas α6β1 laminin receptor is expressed only in HOS cells (Santala et al., 1994). Previous reports have suggested the involvement of β1 integrins in the collagen gel contraction, especially by skin fibroblasts (Klein et al., 1991; Shiro et al., 1991). Here, we show that osteogenic cells can still induce contraction, even if the α1β1 or α2β1 heterodimers are missing. Thus, the data suggest that these heterodimers can replace each other or that they both can be replaced by a third β1 integrin containing heterodimer. TGF-β could increase collagen gel contraction by MG-63 cells but not by HOS cells. In MG-63 cells TGF-β strongly induces the synthesis of α2 integrin and concomitantly decreases the expression of α3 subunit, whereas it cannot turn on the expression of α1 subunit (Heino and Massagué, 1989). This suggests that the effect of TGF-β is due to increased expression of α2 integrin. Here, the increased contraction could be inhibited totally by anti-β1 integrin antibody and partially by anti-α2 integrin antibody, whereas anti-α1 integrin antibody had no effect. Previous studies have shown that anti-α integrin antibodies can not alone inhibit collagen gel contraction by fibroblasts, but only enhance the effect of anti-β1 antibody (Klein et al., 1991). Interestingly, anti-α3 antibody constantly, in three out of three experiments, stimulated contraction. The mechanism of this phenomenon stays unknown. However, we have recently shown that in keratinocytes α3β1 heterodimer is connected to a signal transduction pathway regulating the expression of gelatinases (Larjava et al., 1993a). The role of α2 subunit was also suggested by the fact that in HOS cells TGF-β cannot induce its expression (Santala et al., 1994). We have previously shown that transformation of HOS cells with MNNG induces the cells to express α2 integrin subunit (Santala et al., 1994). Here, we show that TGF-β increases both α2 integrin expression and collagen gel contraction by HOS-MNNG cells.In addition to altered integrin expression, TGF-β induces several other changes in cell metabolism that could have explained the increased collagen gel contraction. Here, we have excluded the involvement of TGF-β-induced increase in fibronectin synthesis. More importantly, we have shown that increased expression of α2 integrin subunit alone is sufficient to increase contraction by both MG-63 and HOS cells. This was done by expressing α2 integrin cDNA in these cells. We have previously shown that both cell lines express a large intracellular pool of excess precursor β1 integrin subunit (Heino and Massagué, 1989; Santala et al., 1994). Therefore, it is possible to get functional integrin heterodimers by forced expression of an α subunit. Furthermore, transfection of MG-63 cells with antisense-oriented α2 integrin cDNA generated cell clones with reduced ability to contract gels.Cell behavior can be regulated by both growth factors and extracellular matrix. The fact that a growth factor, TGF-β, can regulate the synthesis of matrix molecules and their cellular receptors connects the two mechanisms together. Previously, some of the effects of TGF-β on cell growth and differentiation have been partially explained by the altered structure of extracellular matrix in TGF-β-treated cell cultures (Heino and Massagué, 1990; Nugent and Newman, 1989). The data presented here show that TGF-β regulates the cell behavior also by altering their integrin pattern. We and others have shown, that in addition to TGF-β also other cytokines, including interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ, can regulate integrin expression in numerous tissue-cultured cell types (Santala and Heino, 1991; Defilippi et al., 1991). In in vivo conditions, including wound healing (Larjava et al., 1993b) and chronic inflammation (Nikkari et al., 1993), where cytokines are present in large amounts, it is possible to detect dramatic changes in integrin expression. The role of osteoblast integrins in the healing of bone fractures is unknown. Recent studies have shown, that osteoblastic cells in bone and in culture express several integrin heterodimers. However, α2β1 is expressed only in small quantities, if at all (Hughes et al., 1993; Brighton and Albelda, 1992; Clover et al., 1992; Saito et al., 1994). Our data suggest that TGF-β might be involved in the reorganization of collagenous matrix also by osteogenic cells; however, only in the case that these cells already express α2β1 integrin. We have previously suggested the presence of an inhibitory element, other than DNA methylation, in HOS cells, which prevents the expression of α2 integrin gene (Santala et al., 1994). Transformation of cells with both MNNG and Kirsten murine sarcoma virus can induce the expression of α2 integrin in HOS cells (Santala et al., 1994), but we have not yet found a physiological inducer.To conclude, we have shown that TGF-β induces collagen gel contraction by osteogenic cells. The process is due to increased expression of α2β1 integrin-type collagen receptor. In cells which do not express α2 subunit, TGF-β can not turn on its gene expression or induce collagen gel contraction. The data show that TGF-β can regulate cellular functions by altering integrin pattern. Furthermore, we propose that TGF-β might be one of the factors involved in reorganization of bone matrix during the healing of fractures. INTRODUCTIONHydrated collagen lattices were first described as a method to mimic soft-tissue matrices (Elsdale and Bard, 1972). Watery milieu within fibrous collagen net has since been used as a substrate for growth and differentation for many types of cells. When fibroblasts are embedded in collagen they are able to reduce the areas of the collagen gels and form a tissue-like structure. The ultrastructure of fibroblasts during contraction differ from the same cells plated on a plastic surface. Differences in the prominence of cell coat, changes of the prevalence of cell processes and the state of aggregation of their associated microfilamentous material are seen (Bellows et al., 1981). Collagen gels can be used to study the contraction of either floating matrix or anchored matrix (Grinnell, 1994). In the two variations of in vitro collagen matrix reorganization model, the morphology and the behavior of fibroblasts differ. The first one is suggested to mimic dermis or scars and the latter granulation tissue (Grinnell, 1994). The exact molecular mechanism of collagen gel contraction is unknown. Previous studies have suggested an essential role for cell surface collagen receptors (Gullberg et al., 1990; Shiro et al., 1991; Klein et al., 1991). Also cellular fibronectin (FN) 1The abbreviations used are: FNfibronectinHOShuman osteogenic sarcoma cellsFCSfetal calf serumILinterleukinTGFtransforming growth factorMNNGN-methyl-N′nitro-N-nitrosoguanidineDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumkbkilobase(s).has been suggested to be required in the collagen matrix contraction by fibroblasts (Asaga et al., 1991).Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been discovered to enhance collagen gel contraction by skin fibroblasts (Montesano and Orci, 1988). Later, a similar effect has been described with other growth factors and cytokines (Clark et al., 1989; Gullberg et al., 1990). Some others, like interferon-γ, can inhibit the process (Dans and Isseroff, 1994). TGF-β is a multifunctional regulator of cells which acts in the process of wound healing (for review, see Massagué, 1990). Many cell types can in vitro and in vivo produce TGF-β, and it has been found abundant in platelets and in bone. It stimulates the accumulation of extracellular matrix (Ignotz and Massagué, 1986) and regulates cell adhesion apparatus (Ignotz and Massagué, 1987). TGF-β is supposed to have a central role in tissue healing. The fact that it is present in large amounts in bone and that it increases bone formation in vivo in test animals (Noda and Camilliere, 1989; Joyce et al., 1990) indicates the possible role of TGF-β in the healing of bone fractures. Here, we have shown that TGF-β can increase collagen gel contraction by osteogenic cells. Since TGF-β is known to regulate the integrin type collagen receptors in different cell lines (Heino and Massagué, 1989; Heino et al., 1989) and also to increase production of cellular FN (Ignotz and Massagué, 1986; Roberts et al., 1987), these are the candidate mechanisms to be responsible for the phenomenon. Integrins are a family of cell surface receptors consisting of two subunits, α and β (for review, see Hynes, 1992; Ruoslahti, 1991). Three different integrin heterodimers are known to mediate cell-type I collagen interaction, namely α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1. In addition to α1, α2, and α3 subunits, β1 subunit can form heterodimers with α4-α9 subunits and αv subunit. Several of these β1 integrins recognize FN as their ligand, namely α3β1, α4β1, α5β1, and αvβ1. Laminin is the ligand for α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α6β1, and α7β1 integrin heterodimers.We have determined the effects of TGF-β on collagen gel contraction by osteogenic cell lines, in which the pattern of collagen-binding integrins differs from each other, and identified the molecular mechanism by which TGF-β enhances collagen gel contraction. Our data suggest that up-regulation of α2β1 integrin is required and alone sufficient to increase contraction."

CD14 binding of LPS is enhanced by serum proteins, especially lipopolysaccharide binding protein. The serum-dependent binding of LPS to CD14 stimulates macrophages to make cytokines, which can cause septic shock in humans and animals. Here, we identify a region in human CD14 which is important in serum-dependent LPS binding and LPS-induced cellular activation. Four small regions (4-5 amino acids long) within the N-terminal 65 amino acids of CD14 were deleted singly or in combination. The deletion mutants were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The mutants were characterized in three assays: reactivity with anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody, serum-dependent LPS binding, and LPS-induced activation of NF-κB. Some of the mutants selectively lost reactivity with the anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody that inhibited serum-dependent LPS binding and cellular activation. All of the mutants bound much less LPS than wild type CD14 in the presence of serum. None of the mutants bound more LPS than control CD14-CHO cells in the absence of serum. CD14-CHO cells respond to LPS by activation of NF-κB. All of the deletion mutants were less active LPS receptors than wild type CD14-CHO cells. The ΔAVEVE mutant, the ΔDDED and ΔPQPD double mutant, and the ΔDDED, ΔPQPD, ΔAVEVE, and ΔDPRQY quadruple deletion mutants were essentially inactive LPS receptors in CHO cells. These studies suggest that the 65 N-terminal amino acids of CD14 are critical for serum-dependent binding of LPS to CD14 and subsequent signal transduction in CHO cells.

https://openalex.org/W2048804058,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 is released from NIH 3T3 cells in response to heat shock as a biologically inactive protein that is unable to bind heparin and requires activation by (NH4)2SO4 to generate a biologically active extracellular heparin-binding growth factor (Jackson, A., Friedman, S., Zhan, X., Engleka, K. A., Forough, R., and Maciag, T.(1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 10691-10695). To further study the mechanism of FGF-1 release in response to heat shock (42°C), we examined the kinetics of FGF-1 release from FGF-1-transfected NIH 3T3 cells and observed that the cells require at least 1 h of exposure to heat shock conditions for the release of FGF-1. Interestingly, agents that interfere with the function of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi apparatus, exocytosis, and the multidrug resistance pathway (brefelden A, methylamine, and verapamil, respectively) do not inhibit the release of FGF-1 in response to temperature; rather, they exaggerate the release of FGF-1. Because immunoblot analysis of FGF-1 in the conditioned medium of heat-shocked NIH 3T3 cells revealed the presence of a minor band with an apparent molecular weight of a FGF-1 homodimer and because we have previously shown that FGF-1, but not FGF-2, is able to form a homodimer in response to chemical oxidation by CuCl2 (Engleka, K. A., and Maciag, T.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 11307-11315), we examined whether reducing agents would substitute for (NH4)2SO4 and activate extracellular FGF-1. Indeed, dithiothreitol and reduced glutathione are able to individually generate a FGF-1 monomer as a heparin-binding protein from the conditioned medium of heat-shocked NIH 3T3 cell transfectants. To confirm that cysteine residues are involved in the release of FGF-1 in response to temperature, we used mutagenesis to prepare a human FGF-1 Cys-free mutant in which Cys30, Cys97, and Cys131 were converted to serine. Analysis of the release of the FGF-1 Cys-free mutant in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the FGF-1 Cys-free mutant demonstrated that the FGF-1 Cys-free mutant is not released into the conditioned medium in response to temperature. Interestingly, exposure of the NIH 3T3 cell FGF-1 Cys-free transfectants to brefelden A followed by heat shock also demonstrated the absence of the extracellular FGF-1 Cys-free mutant. Finally, ion-exchange and reverse-phase chromatographies of heat-shocked conditioned medium analyzed by FGF-1 immunoblot analysis were able to resolve FGF-1 as a homodimer under nonreducing conditions and as a monomer under reducing conditions. These data demonstrate that FGF-1 utilizes cysteine residues as an important component of its release from NIH 3T3 cells in vitro in response to temperature and exits the cell as a biologically inactive homodimer with reduced heparin affinity that requires activation by reducing agents to generate heparin binding and biological activities."
https://openalex.org/W2012614451,"Keratin polypeptides 8 and 18 (K8/18) are intermediate filament proteins expressed preferentially in glandular epithelia. We describe the identification, by co-immunoprecipitation from normal human colonic tissues and cultured cell lines, of the 70-kDa heat shock protein (hsp) and its related heat shock cognate protein as K8/18-associated proteins (hsp/c). The association is significant but sub-stoichiometric and occurs preferentially with the soluble rather than the cytoskeletal K8/18 fractions. Heat stress increases the level of soluble K8/18 in association with an increase in hsp70 levels and an increase in the stoichiometry of K8/18-hsp70 association. Identity of the associated proteins was confirmed by microsequencing of a tryptic digest of the purified associated protein and by using anti-hsp/c70-specific antibodies. The K8/18-hsp/c70 complex can be dissociated in a Mg-ATP-dependent manner that requires ATP hydrolysis. Binding of hsp to K8/18 can be reconstituted using purified bovine hsp70 and human K8/18 immunoprecipitates that have been depleted of bound hsp/c70 and increases slightly in the presence of ATP. The reconstituted K8/18-hsp70 complex can be again released in the presence of Mg-ATP. In addition, hsp70 binds to K8/18 without having a significant effect on in vitro filament assembly when added during or after assembly. Using an overlay assay, hsp70 binds exclusively to K8 in the presence of ATP. Our results show direct association of the hsp/c70 proteins with K8/18. This interaction may serve, at least in part, to regulate the function of these two abundant protein groups.

IF expression is generally tissue specific with the keratin IF subfamily being preferentially expressed in epithelial cells. Tissue-specific expression within epithelial subtypes also extends to keratins, which are comprised of at least 20 members (catalogued as K1-K20) that are found in cells as heteropolymeric pairs (Moll et al., 1982, 1990). Although each epithelial cell type may express several keratins, they usually express one pair as their dominant IF network. For example, glandular “simple” type epithelia, as found in the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas express K8 and K18 (K8/18), keratinocytes express K5/14, and esophageal epithelia express K4/13 as their major keratin pair. IF proteins are highly abundant in cells that express them, as noted for K8/18, which make up ∼ 5% of the total protein in cultured colonic cell lines (Chou et al., 1993), and for keratinocyte keratins, which account for ∼ 30% of the cellular protein (Sun et al., 1979).A number of intermediate filament-associated proteins (IFAP) have been described that may be involved in regulating the function of IF or that may utilize binding to IF to regulate their function (Foisner and Wiche, 1991). These IFAP may interact directly or indirectly with IF and include kinases, membrane-associated proteins, and nuclear proteins. Examples of IF-kinase interactions include the association of protein kinase C-related kinases with K8/18 (Omary et al., 1992a) and vimentin (Spudich et al., 1992; Murti et al., 1992) and the association of cGMP-dependent protein kinase with vimentin (Wyatt et al., 1991; MacMillan-Crow and Lincoln, 1994). Other IFAP include ankyrin and lamin B (Georgatos et al., 1987; Djabali et al., 1991), desmoplakin (Stappenbeck et al., 1993), a 140-kDa desmosomal antigen (Cartaud et al., 1990), IFAP 300 (Skalli et al., 1994), plectin (Foisner et al., 1991), gyronemin (also called filamin) (Brown and Binder, 1992), and KAP85 (Chou et al., 1994).Another highly abundant protein family is the heat shock protein family (HSP) with major classes including HSP25, −60, −70, −80, −90, and −110 (numbers correspond to approximate Mr of class members) (Gething and Sambrook, 1992; Georgopoulos and Welch, 1993; Hendrick and Hartl, 1993; Becker and Craig, 1994). An important function of HSP proteins is to act as molecular chaperones, and in doing so they form complexes with a variety of cellular proteins (e.g. see Schlesinger, 1990). In mammalian cells, two cytosolic members of the HSP70 family are the heat-inducible hsp70 (Mr 72,000) and the constitutively expressed hsc70 (Mr 73,000) (Becker and Craig, 1994). Several indirect reports and reviews have suggested an interaction of HSP70-like proteins with IF, although most describe an association of HSP70 with microtubules (e.g. Schlesinger, 1990; Gupta, 1990). For example, 1) a ubiquitous 70-kDa protein termed β-internexin was initially identified as a microtubule-associated protein and shown indirectly to associate with IF (Napolitano et al., 1985) and then was subsequently shown to be identical to hsp70 (Green and Liem, 1989); 2) hsp70 was shown to co-purify with microtubules in murine mastocytoma cells (Ohtsuka et al., 1986) and with retinal microtubule and IF fractions (Clark and Brown, 1986); 3) in vitro interaction of purified yeast HSP70 with vimentin and nuclear lamins in an ATP-dependent manner has been reported (Georgatos et al., 1989); 4) treatment of cultured rat brain cells with the natural product withangulatin A resulted in increased vimentin and hsp70 levels in the detergent-nonextractable fraction, although direct association was not shown (Lee et al., 1993). More recently, α-crystallins, which are related to the HSP25 family, were shown to co-immunoprecipitate with vimentin in bovine lens and to inhibit in vitro filament assembly of vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (Nicholl and Quinlan, 1994).During our studies of the post-translational modification of K8/18, we noted a 70-kDa band, visible by Coomassie staining, that co-immunoprecipitated with K8/18 (Chou et al., 1993). In this report, we show that this 70-kDa band corresponds to hsp/c70 and that its association with K8/18 increases with heat stress. K8/18-hsp/c70 association occurs preferentially with the soluble K8/18 fraction, with release of hsp in the presence of Mg-ATP. Furthermore, K8/18 and hsp70 binding and Mg-ATP-mediated release can be reconstituted using purified hsp70 and K8/18 immunoprecipitates that have been depleted of bound hsp/c70. In vitro binding of hsp70 to keratins using an overlay assay occurs exclusively with K8. Addition of purified hsp70 to K8/18 during or after filament assembly does not affect assembly. The potential functional significance of the K8/18-hsp70 association is discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagentsPurified bovine brain hsp, α-actinin, and ATP γ S were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to K8/18 that recognize different K8/18 epitopes (not shown) were CK5 and 8.13 ascites (Sigma) and L2A1 (Chou and Omary, 1991), which was used as ascites or covalently coupled to protein A-agarose. Other MAb used were M2B3, which recognizes a proliferation-associated cell surface glycoprotein (Omary et al., 1992c), and I4D4 (Omary et al., 1992b), which recognizes an epithelial cell adhesion marker termed KS-1 or more recently referred to as Ep-CAM (Litvinov et al., 1994). The latter two MAb were coupled to cyanogen-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Antibodies to hsp70(1197) and hsp/c70 (BRM-22) were purchased from Amersham Corp. and Sigma, respectively. 36 S protein-labeling mix (Met/Cys, 1200 Ci/mmol) and ENHANCE ® were from DuPont NEN.Cell Culturing, Metabolic Labeling, and Colonic TissuesHT29, T84, Caco2, and SK-CO-1 cell lines (human colon) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were grown at 37°C (10% CO2) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mM glutamine. For heat stress, cells at ∼ 50% confluency were grown at 42°C for 16-24 h. Colonic biopsies (2-3 mm in diameter) were obtained from patients undergoing routine colonoscopy for polyp screening under a protocol approved by the Medical Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects on Research at Stanford University.Metabolic labeling of HT29 cells with [ 36 S]Met/Cys was done by pre-incubating cells (1 h) in Met-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum dialyzed against 0.15 M NaCl, followed by addition of the 36 S label (100 μ Ci/ml) for 1, 5, or 10 min. Cells were then immediately placed over ice, followed by removal of the labeling medium and rinsing with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 15 μg/ml unlabeled Met. In some cases, cells were chased for 1-20 h by incubating in normal growth medium after rinsing off the label.ImmunoprecipitationCells were solubilized (30-60 min, 4°C) in 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS containing 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μM leupeptin, 10 μM pepstatin, and 5 mM EDTA (buffer A). Colonic biopsies were homogenized using a Dounce in buffer A (100 strokes) and then were allowed to solubilize with rocking for 1 h. Nonsolubilized material was pelleted (16,000 × g, 30 min, 4°C), and the solubilized material was used for immunoprecipitation. Alternatively, HT29 cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation (150 p.s.i., 5 min, 4°C) in PBS, 5 mM EDTA followed by pelleting (16,000 × g, 30 min, 4°C) to generate the soluble (S) fraction. The insoluble fraction was solubilized in buffer A (1 h) followed by repelleting to generate the detergent-solubilized P fraction. Immunoprecipitates were then obtained using the S fraction (directly or after adding detergent to a final concentration of 1% Nonidet P-40), buffer A-solubilized cells or biopsies, or the detergent-solubilized P fraction. For this, 200-500 μl of lysate (from 2-5 × 106 cells or 2 biopsies) were mixed with 20 μl of agarose- or Sepharose-coupled antibody or 3 μl of ascites. The ascites-antigen complexes were then collected using protein A-Sepharose conjugated to rabbit anti-mouse antibody.Protein AnalysisImmunoprecipitates were analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Laemmli, 1970). Isoelectric focusing (Chou et al., 1992) and Western blotting (Towbin et al., 1979) were as described except that an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL) was used as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham). Relative levels of K8/18 and hsp/c70 were determined using densitometric scanning of Coomassie stained-destained gels (LKB Ultrascan XL enhanced laser densitometer). Serial dilutions of bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a protein standard were analyzed on the same SDS-PAGE gel containing the proteins of interest.Filament Assembly and Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography Purification of K8/18Purified K8/18 were obtained prior to filament assembly using a two step procedure. The first step involved high salt extraction exactly as described (Achtstaetter et al., 1986; Chou et al., 1993). This generated a highly enriched K8/18, which is then solubilized in 6 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EGTA (pH 7.5) (buffer B). Non-solubilized material was pelleted (16,000 × g, 2 min) followed by filtering of the solubilized material (0.2-μm filters) and then passage over a Mono-Q Resource ™ column assembled in a fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus (Pharmacia). K8/18 were then eluted using a 0-0.5 M guanidine HCl gradient (in buffer B) with the K8/18 peak being eluted between 130 and 260 mM guanidine HCl. Average yield of purified keratin was ∼ 50 μg per confluent 100-mm dish of HT29 cells. The eluted keratins were dialyzed against buffer B (4°C, 12-24 h) and then stored at 4°C till further use.Filament assembly was initiated by dialyzing K8/18 (150 μg/ml) against 50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EGTA (pH 7.5) for 36 h with two buffer changes. Assembly was also done in the presence of bovine hsp70 or BSA. Alternatively, filaments were assembled for dialysis for 36 h and then incubated with BSA or hsp70 for 24 h at 4°C. Filament formation was assessed by negative staining followed by electron microscopy as described (Chou et al., 1993). Analysis of the soluble K8/18 fraction after assembly in the presence or absence of hsp70 or BSA was assessed by ultracentrifugation (300,000 × g, 1 h, 4°C) and then SDS-PAGE of equivalent fractions of the soluble and pellet fractions.Release of hsp/c70 from K8/18 and Reconstitution of K8/18-hsp70 BindingK8/18 immunoprecipitates were obtained from 1% Nonidet P-40 detergent lysates (of cells grown at 37 or 42°C) in the absence or presence of 5 mM Na-ATP, Na-ATP plus MgCl2 (Mg-ATP), Mg-AMP, Mg-ADP, Mg-GTP, ATP γ S, ATP γ S plus MgCl2, or MgCl2 alone. Alternatively, immunoprecipitates were isolated first and then incubated with 5 mM Mg-ATP for 15-90 min, followed by washing 2 times with PBS to remove released hsp/c70. K8/18 immunoprecipitates depleted of hsp/c70 (K8/18-hsp − ) were then incubated with 50 μl of PBS containing 2 μg of bovine hsp70 (60 min) in the presence or absence of 5 mM Na-ATP, Mg-ATP, or MgCl2 followed by washing to remove unbound hsp70 and then analysis by SDS-PAGE.Keratin-hsp70 Binding Using an Overlay AssayA highly enriched keratin fraction was prepared by high salt extraction (Chou et al., 1993) followed by separation using preparative SDS-PAGE. Individual K8, K18, and K19 bands were visualized using copper stain (Bio-Rad), cut and electroeluted, and then concentrated using Centricon ™ microconcentrators (Amicon). SDS-PAGE of individual K8, K18, K19, and α-actinin was then done, followed by transfer to two duplicate polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. One membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the second was blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 48-96 h, followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml of bovine hsp70 for 2 h in the presence of 5 mM Na-ATP in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA (buffer C). After four washes with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (10 min/wash), the membrane was incubated with anti-hsp70 antibody in buffer C for 2 h, washed 3 times, and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Bound hsp was visualized using ECL.RESULTSAssociation of K8/18 with HSP70In carrying out immunoprecipitations of K8/18 from the colonic epithelial cell line HT29, we consistently noted co-immunoprecipitation of a 70-kDa band with K8/18. This is exemplified in Fig. 1A (lanea), where a 70-kDa species is noted to co-immunoprecipitate with K8/18 using our high capacity anti-K8/18 MAb L2A1. As a control, immunoprecipitation of other antigens using well described antibodies to Ep-CAM and M2B3 antigens (Fig. 1A, lanesb and c, respectively) did not co-immunoprecipitate either K8/18 or the 70-kDa band. The Ep-CAM glycoprotein (Mr ∼ 38,000) is abundant in HT29 cells and can be visualized by Coomassie staining (Fig. 1A, laneb), whereas the M2B3 antigen (Fig. 1A, lanec) can only be visualized after radiolabeling (Omary et al., 1992c). Purification of the 70-kDa band shown in Fig. 1A followed by trypsinization, high pressure liquid chromatography separation of the generated peptides, and microsequencing of one of the peaks provided the sequence TTPSYVAFTDTE. This sequence showed 100% homology with amino acids 37-48 of human hsp70 and hsc70 proteins (Dworniczak and Mirault, 1987). The association of K8/18 with hsp/c70 by co-immunoprecipitation was noted also in normal human colonic biopsies (Fig. 1A, lanef) and in all colonic tissue culture cell lines tested including T84, Caco2, and SK-CO-1 (not shown). The identity of a 160-kDa band that co-immunoprecipitated with K8/18 in normal colonic tissue (Fig. 1A, lanef, openarrowhead) was not investigated further. Another Coomassie-stained band that migrates between K8 and K18 (e.g.Fig. 1A, lanesa, e, and f) is usually seen with variable intensity and likely corresponds to degraded K8 or a related keratin (based on tryptic peptide mapping, not shown).To confirm the specificity of association of hsp/c70 with K8/18, we used three MAb that recognize different K8/18 epitopes. All three MAb resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of hsp/c70 with K8/18 (Fig. 1B, lanesb-d), indicating that hsp/c70 co-immunoprecipitation is not due to cross-reaction of MAb L2A1. In addition, the identity of the 70-kDa band as hsp70 and/or hsc70 was further confirmed by blotting of K8/18 immunoprecipitates using two different MAb to HSP70 proteins (Fig. 1B, lanese and f). We were not able to adequately test if anti-hsp/c70 antibodies co-immunoprecipitate K8/18 since the two antibodies we used did not efficiently immunoprecipitate hsp/c70 (not shown).Effect of Heat Stress on K8/18 Solubility and Association with HSP70We studied the effect of heat stress on K8/18 association with hsp/c70 and asked how the association partitions between the soluble and cytoskeletal K8/18 pools. As shown in Fig. 2A, the amount of HSP70 associated with K8/18 increased ∼ 2.5-fold after heat stress (lanes3 and 4), and this correlated with the increased expression of hsp/c70 (lanes1 and 2). This was confirmed by blotting of K8/18 immunoprecipitates and detergent lysates obtained from normal and heat-stressed cells using anti-HSP70 antibodies (not shown). Analysis of K8/18 immunoprecipitates obtained from the S and P fractions of HT29 cells (normalized to nearly equal amounts of immunoprecipitated keratins) showed increased association of hsp/c70 with K8/18 upon heat stress in both fractions (Fig. 2A, lanes5-8). Of note, a band indicated by the dottedarrow in lanes3, 6, and 8 is co-immunoprecipitated with K8/18 from heat-stressed cells. This band, which may represent a hyperphosphorylated form of K8 that was previously observed in mitotically arrested cells (Chou and Omary, 1994), becomes more noticeable with increasing duration of heat stress (not shown).Figure 2:Hsp/c70 associates preferentially with the soluble K8/18 fraction, with increased association, and with increased K8/18 solubility induced by heat stress. Panel A, HT29 cells (37°C) or heat-stressed cells (42°C, 16 h) were solubilized in Nonidet P-40 followed by analysis using SDS-PAGE of the soluble lysates after pelleting (lanes1 and 2) or K8/18 immunoprecipitates obtained from the lysates (lanes3 and 4). Alternatively, cells (37 and 42°C) were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation followed by ultracentrifugation. The pellet (P fraction) and soluble supernatant (S fraction) were used for immunoprecipitation with MAb L2A1 (lanes5-8) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Panel B, equal numbers of HT29 cells (37 and 42°C) were solubilized directly in Laemmli sample buffer (Total) or disrupted followed by ultracentrifugation and isolation of the S fraction and then SDS-PAGE analysis (lanesa-d). Equal fractions (based on cell number) of the S preparations were also used for immunoprecipitation (i.p.) of K8/18 (lanese and f). Duplicate samples were analyzed by Coomassie staining or by immunoblotting using MAb L2A1. +, indicates heat-stressed cells; -, indicates cells grown at 37°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given that HSP70 association with K8/18 occurs preferentially with the soluble K8/18 pool with increased association noted after heat stress, we asked if heat stress results in an increase in the soluble K8/18 pool. As shown in Fig. 2B, the soluble K8/18 fraction increases after heat stress when analyzed by immunoprecipitation (lanese and f) or by Western blotting of the total soluble fraction before immunoprecipitation (lanesc and d) or after immunoprecipitation (lanese and f). For the analysis shown in Fig. 2B, equal numbers of cells grown at 37 and 42°C were used, which had nearly equal total keratin (Fig. 2B, lanesa and b).The molar stoichiometry of hsp/c70 associated with soluble K8/18 was ∼ 1:10 and 1:25 for cells grown at 42 and 37°C, respectively, as estimated after Coomassie staining using BSA standards (not shown). This assumes binding of hsp/c70 to either K8 or K18 and an average Mr of 70,000 for hsp/c and 50,000 for keratin. This stoichiometry decreases nearly 3-fold when analyzing the detergent-solubilized fraction (e.g.Fig. 1B or 2A).Binding of hsc70 and hsp70 to the Soluble and Cytoskeletal K8/18 FractionsThe 70-kDa K8/18-associated species were occasionally resolved in our gel system into two very closely migrating bands, thereby suggesting that both hsp70 and hsc70 associated with K8/18 (e.g.Fig. 2B, lanef). To confirm this, we used isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE and antibodies that recognized hsp70 or hsp/c70 to study K8/18 association with hsp/c70 after isolation of the complex from the soluble and cytoskeletal pellet fractions. As shown in Fig. 3, the anti-hsp70 MAb recognized a single hsp spot (panelsc and d), whereas the anti-hsp/c70 MAb recognized two spots corresponding to hsp70 and hsc70 (panelsa and b). The pI values for hsp70 and hsc70 were 5.8 and 5.5, respectively, which are similar to values previously reported for bovine hsp/c70 (Ungewickell, 1985). The hsc70 (Mr 73,000) migrated slightly slower than the hsp70 (Mr 72,000) species as noted by Coomassie staining (Fig. 3, panelse and f). Hence, both hsp70 and hsc70 associate with soluble and cytoskeletal K8/18.Figure 3:Two-dimensional gel and Western blot analysis of the associated 70-kDa heat shock proteins isolated from soluble and insoluble keratin pools. HT29 cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation followed by centrifugation to isolate the soluble and pellet fractions. K8/18-hsp/c70 co-immunoprecipitates were obtained from the S and P fractions followed by isoelectric focusing (IEF) in the first dimension and then SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. Two-dimensional gels were then analyzed by Western blotting using MAb BRM-22 (anti-hsp/c70) and MAb 1197 (anti-hsp70). Blots used in panelsa and b were also stained to confirm the position of hsc and hsp, which are indicated by arrows, and are shown in panelse and f.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since immunoprecipitation examines steady state levels of partitioning between the S and P fractions, we examined the K8/18-hsp/c70 association in terms of newly synthesized K8/18 and hsp/c70. As shown in Fig. 4, the majority of newly synthesized K8/18 (after a 1-min pulse label) is seen in the soluble fraction and is also associated with some newly synthesized hsp/c70. Labeling for 5 or 10 min resulted in rapid redistribution of K8/18 from the soluble to the cytoskeletal pools, with similar association with hsp/c70 (Fig. 4). As noted in Fig. 2, the steady state level for the various labeling time points, as determined by Coomassie staining of the immunoprecipitates from the S and P fractions, showed preferential association with the soluble K8/18 pool (Fig. 4B). Labeling for 10 min followed by 1-20 h chase gave results that were similar to the 10-min time point in Fig. 4A (not shown). This indicated that the K8/18-hsp/c70 association occurs not only at the early stages of biosynthesis but also subsequent to biosynthesis.Figure 4:Hsp associates with K8/18 early during biosynthesis. HT29 cells were incubated in Met-free medium for 1 h and then labeled with [ 36 S]methionine for 1, 5, or 10 min (100 μCi/ml). After labeling, cells were immediately placed over ice and then rinsed with cold PBS containing 15 μg/ml unlabeled Met. Labeled cells were disrupted using nitrogen cavitation followed by isolation of the S and P fractions and then immunoprecipitation of K8/18-hsp/c70. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (panelB) followed by fluorography (panelA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of hsp70-K8/18 Binding on Filament AssemblyGiven recent findings that the HSP25-related α-crystallins inhibited glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin in vitro filament assembly in an ATP-independent manner (Nicholl and Quinlan, 1994), we tested the effect of purified hsp70 on K8/18 in vitro filament assembly. This was done by adding bovine hsp70 to K8/18 proteins during assembly (i.e. before dialysis of the 6 M urea, which allows for filament assembly) or after filaments have assembled. As shown in Fig. 5, addition of bovine hsp70 to K8/18-assembled filaments for 24 h followed by ultracentrifugation resulted in binding of a small fraction of hsp70 to the cytoskeletal pellet pool in a dose-dependent manner. To exclude the possibility of protein trapping during assembly, no binding of BSA to the formed filamentous fraction was noted (Fig. 5, Pfraction, lane5). Analysis of the formed filaments by electron microscopy showed no effect of hsp70 (or BSA) on filament assembly (not shown). Similarly, inclusion of hsp70 during filament assembly resulted in binding of some of the hsp70 to the insoluble K8/18 pool in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 6, panelA) and did not significantly interfere with filament assembly (Fig. 6, panelB). No binding of BSA to the filamentous fraction was noted (Fig. 6, panelA, lane1). As a control, incubation of hsp70 in 6 M urea, followed by dialysis (i.e. under filament assembly conditions) and then ultracentrifugation, maintains all the hsp70 in the soluble fraction (not shown). Of note, hsp70 did not significantly alter the partitioning of K8/18 into the soluble fraction when added after (Fig. 5) or during (Fig. 6) filament assembly.Figure 5:Assembled K8/18 filaments bind to hsp70. K8/18 was purified from HT29 cells using high salt extraction of cells to enrich for keratin proteins followed by purification using anion exchange chromatography (Mono-Q column) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Purified keratins (15 μg in 100 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 2 mM EGTA, containing 6 M urea) were dialyzed to remove the urea and allow filament assembly. Assembled filaments were incubated with the indicated amount of bovine brain hsp70 or BSA as a control protein (24 h, 22°C), followed by centrifugation to isolate the soluble (S) and insoluble (P) fractions (300,000 × g, 30 min). Equivalent fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6:Hsp70 does not significantly alter solubility or in vitro assembly of keratin intermediate filaments. K8/18 were co-purified by ion exchange chromatography and then used for in vitro assembly (30 μg in 200 μl) alone or in the presence of the indicated amounts of BSA or bovine brain hsp70 in 6 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM EGTA. Filament assembly was initiated by dialysis against 50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EGTA (pH 7.5) for 36 h with buffer change every 12 h. Dialyzed samples were analyzed by electron microscopy (panelB) or were pelleted (300,000 × g, 30 min) followed by SDS-PAGE analysis of equivalent portions of the S and P fractions (panelA). Filament assembly was similar for all the treatments and is represented by the two micrographs shown in panelB. Smallarrow shows hsp70 particles, and bar = 60 nm. Similar hsp70 particles were noted by electron microscopy if hsp70 in the 6 M urea containing buffer, in the absence of K8/18, was dialyzed under assembly conditions (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"

Two of the selected RNA aptamers bind to this isozyme of protein kinase C with nanomolar affinities and inhibit activation with unprecedented selectivity; the highly related, alternatively spliced beta I isozyme, which differs by 23 residues, is inhibited with 1 order of magnitude lower potency; the next most similar isozyme, alpha, shows no detectable inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W1989138665,"Previous studies suggest that the mechanism of action of the ribosome in translation involves crucial transfer RNA (tRNA)-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) interactions. Here, a selection scheme was developed to identify bases in 16S rRNA that are essential for tRNA binding to the P site of the small (30S) ribosomal subunit. Modification of the N-1 and N-2 positions of 2-methylguanine 966 and of the N-7 position of guanine 1401 interfered with messenger RNA (mRNA)-dependent binding of tRNA to the P site. Modification of the same positions as well as of the N-1 and N-2 positions of guanine 926 interfered with mRNA-independent binding of tRNA at high magnesium ion concentration. These results suggest that these three bases are involved in intermolecular contacts between ribosomes and tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2051947839,"The ColE1 plasmid of E. coli encodes a small RNA-binding protein, Rop, which is involved in the regulation of plasmid copy number. Rop, a 4-helix bundle protein, facilitates sense-antisense RNA pairing by binding to the transiently formed hairpin pairs of RNA I and the complementary RNA II. We have identified the residues of Rop that are involved in RNA recognition. The residues form a narrow stripe down one face of the bundle and are symmetrically arranged, with recognition centered about two phenylalanine residues. Our results suggest that these phenylalanine residues interact with the loop region of the hairpin pair, with additional interactions between eight polar residues and the phosphate backbone. By modifying the identity of residue 14, we have created a variant of Rop that displays altered RNA binding specificity. The results of our studies allow us to present a detailed picture of RNA-protein recognition in a novel model system."
https://openalex.org/W1601446742,"The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) act through high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors and, in addition, interact with lower affinity receptors that represent cell- or matrix-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans. These lower affinity receptors modulate the biological activities of FGFs, but the mechanism by which they exert these effects is rather controversial. We have previously shown (Ron, D., Bottaro, D. P., Finch, P. W., Morris, D., Rubin, J. S., and Aaronson, S. A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2984-2988) that heparin potentiates the mitogenic activity of acidic FGF (aFGF) but inhibits that of the keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in cells that express the KGF receptor (KGFR). Both growth factors bind the KGFR with high affinity. To gain an insight into the mechanism by which heparin modulates the biological activity of aFGF and KGF, we studied the effect of heparin and cell-associated heparan sulfates on the binding of these two growth factors to the KGFR. To work in a well defined system, we expressed functional KGFR in L6E9 myoblasts that lack detectable high affinity binding sites for FGFs. Low concentrations of heparin inhibited the binding of KGF to the KGFR. By contrast, similar concentrations of heparin enhanced the binding of aFGF to this receptor. The effect of heparin was not unique to L6E9 cells expressing the KGFR; it was also observed in Balb/MK cells that naturally express KGFR. Treatment of cells with sodium chlorate, which blocks sulfation of proteoglycans, reduced the binding of aFGF to its low and high affinity binding sites by 95 and 80%, respectively. In contrast, the binding of KGF to its high affinity binding sites was enhanced about 2-fold. Similar results were obtained after degradation of cell-associated heparan sulfates by heparinase and heparitinase. Heparin restored the high affinity binding of aFGF to chlorate-treated cells and completely abolished the high affinity binding of KGF. Binding competition experiments suggest that aFGF and KGF bind to the same population of cell-associated heparan sulfates. In addition, KGF is apparently interacting with an as yet unidentified type of low affinity binding site that is not affected by chlorate or heparan sulfate-degrading enzymes. An important property of the FGF high affinity receptors is their ability to bind more than one ligand with high affinity. Based on the differential effect of cell-associated heparan sulfates on the binding of KGF and aFGF to the KGFR, we propose a regulatory role for cell-associated heparan sulfates as coordinators of the interaction of aFGF and KGF with the KGFR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The protein also formed diffraction quality crystals and analysis of the 2.5-Å resolution crystal structure indicated that the single N-acetylglucosamine residue present on domain 1 is unlikely to stabilize the ligand binding face of hsCD2. A second, fully deglycosylated form of hsCD2 also bound the ligand and antibodies although this form of the protein tended to aggregate.

The role of glycosylation in stabilizing IgSF domains is controversial. While many IgSF molecules are N-glycosylated, the extent of glycosylation varies considerably and glycosylation sites are generally not conserved, even between species homologues. The ligand binding function of rat CD2, which has four N-glycosylation sites, is not glycosylation-dependent(15.van der Merwe P.A. McPherson D.C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Cyster J.G. Williams A.F.

This observation has significant implications given that the evolutionary success of the IgSF, and the high level of conservation of the IgSF fold, are both thought to reflect the ability of IgSF protein domains to form stable structural units for the presentation of receptor-ligand recognition motifs(1.Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 27.Williams A.F. Immunol. Today. 1987; 8: 298-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In the present study a systematic analysis of the effect of glycosylation on the ligand binding properties of CD2 has been undertaken. The data indicate that the structural integrity and ligand binding function of human CD2 are not glycosylation dependent. The preparation and expression of the constructs encoding hsCD2 and sCD58 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are described in detail elsewhere(25.van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In initial optimization experiments with N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), 2 × 500 cm2 flasks (Nunc) were seeded with hsCD2 secreting CHO cells in 100 ml of GMEM-S (Applied Protein Products), 10% fetal calf serum containing NB-DNJ at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2 mM. After 6 days 100 ml of GMEM-S, 10% fetal calf serum containing 4 mM sodium butyrate, and NB-DNJ at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2 mM was added. Ten days after the addition of the butyrate, 0.5-ml samples of the supernatant were taken for comparison of secretion levels. The cultures were left for a total of 15 days before the supernatants were harvested. When large amounts of endoglycosidase H (endo H)-treated hsCD2 were required for crystallization, the cells were grown to confluence in cell factories as described above, and NB-DNJ was added with the sodium butyrate to a final concentration of 1.5 mM. These cultures were then left for a further 3-4 weeks prior to harvesting. After preclearing the spent tissue culture medium at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the hsCD2 was purified by affinity chromatography according to published methods (28.Arvieux J. Williams A.F. Antibodies: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1988: 113-136Google Scholar) using an antibody affinity column prepared with the anti-CD2 monoclonal antibody, (mAb) X/3. Final purification involved gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 in 10 mM Hepes, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. After preparation of the hsCD2 in the presence of various concentrations of NB-DNJ, endo H sensitivity was determined by incubating 10-μg aliquots of the purified glycoproteins with 0.012, 0.06, or 0.3 International Union of Biochemistry (I.U.B.) units/mg of endo H (Boehringer Mannheim) in 30 μl of 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.2. After incubation overnight at 37°C the digested samples were boiled in 1% SDS under reducing conditions prior to electrophoresis in 15% SDS-PAGE gels. For large-scale endo H treatment of hsCD2 for crystallization experiments, 4 mg of the purified glycoprotein were concentrated to 1-2 mg/ml in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and then digested with 0.1 I.U.B. units/ml endo H overnight at 37°C. To purify the endo H-treated hsCD2 from the contaminating endo H-resistant fraction, the protein mixture was concentrated to 0.5 ml and then passed through a 5-ml Sephadex G-50 column to remove free oligosaccharides. The eluate was then passed through a 15-ml lectin affinity column consisting of equal parts of lentil lectin, concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin, each coupled to Sepharose 4B (Sigma). The homogeneity of the hsCD2 was then confirmed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% acrylamide gel. The lectin purified protein was concentrated to 2 ml and then applied to Sephadex G-75 in 10 mM Hepes, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, to remove free lectin eluting from the lectin-affinity column. The deglycosylated hsCD2, in 10 mM Hepes, 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, was concentrated to 17 mg/ml. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion in sitting drops at room temperature. Initial trials were conducted using Crystal Screen reagents (Hampton Research). For large scale preparation of fully deglycosylated protein, hsCD2 (at 600 μg/ml) purified from untreated cultures was digested with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England BioLabs) at 0.085 I.U.B. units/ml in 0.5 M Tris, pH 8. Deglycosylated protein was then purified by gel filtration on a Superdex G-75 fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Amino sugars were quantitated by Dionex high performance anion exchange chromatography after hydrolysis in 6 N HCl at 100°C for 4 h. 2-Deoxy glucose was added as an internal standard after hydrolysis, and the reaction products were separated using an isocratic eluant containing 4 mM NaOH. Mass spectrometric analysis of the proteins in H2O was performed on a Fisons VG BioQ mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface operating in positive ion mode. Antibodies were obtained as previously described(25.van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Analysis of the interaction of hsCD2 with sCD58 and anti-CD2 mAbs was performed on a BIAcoreTM biosensor (Pharmacia). Experiments were performed at 25°C at the indicated buffer flow rates (3-20 μl/min). The buffer used was Hepes-buffered saline which contained (in mM): NaCl, 150; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1; NaN3, 10; 0.005% Surfactant P-20 (Pharmacia), and Hepes, 10 (pH 7.4). NaN3 was omitted during the immobilization procedures. The various forms of hsCD2 were covalently coupled to a CM5 sensor chip via primary amine groups (Pharmacia) as described using the Amine Coupling Kit (Pharmacia)(25.van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For immobilization of hsCD2, the glycosylation variants were used at 22-85 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 5), and the activation times were varied from 75 to 360 s. Immobilized untreated and endo H-treated hsCD2 were regenerated after immobilization or antibody binding with 10-100 mM HCl. However, HCl treatment of immobilized PNGase F-treated hsCD2 reduced its ability to bind ligand and antibody, and so it was omitted when analyzing PNGase F-treated hsCD2 (see Fig. 6D). sCD58 loses its ligand and antibody binding activity when coupled via primary amines. Therefore sCD58 was coupled, as described previously(25.van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), via thiol groups on two cysteine residues present within the second IgSF domain which can be exposed by mild reduction. The equilibrium binding data (see Fig. 3) were analyzed by 1) nonlinear curve fitting of the Langmuir binding isotherm to the primary data and 2) linear curve fitting of the Scatchard plots. The dissociation phases (see Fig. 4) were analyzed by first normalizing them so that the response before dissociation was 100% and the base line response was 0%. Dissociation rate constants (koff) for each dissociation phase were then determined by fitting mono- or bi-exponential decay functions to the data (see Fig. 4). All curve fitting was performed using the curve-fitting functions of the program Origin version 2 (MicroCal Software Inc, Northampton, MA) which was run on a Compaq PC. Linear curve fitting was by linear least squares regression. Nonlinear curve fitting employed iterative least squares curve fitting using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm.Figure 4Comparison of the rates of dissociation of sCD58 from untreated hsCD2, endo H-treated hsCD2, and PNGase F-treated hsCD2. Panel A, the dissociation of sCD58 (0.22 mg/ml) from immobilized untreated (open triangles, 3160 RU) or endo H-treated (filled triangles, 4983 RU) hsCD2. The fall in response following injection of sCD58 over a flow cell with nothing immobilized is also shown (dotted line). The equilibrium responses (100%) following injection of sCD58 over nothing, untreated hsCD2 and endo H-treated hsCD2 were 92, 373, and 705 RU, respectively. Panel B, dissociation of untreated hsCD2 (open triangles, 0.9 mg/ml) or PNGase F-treated hsCD2 (closed triangles, 1 mg/ml) from immobilized sCD58 (10,863 RU immobilized). The fall in response following injection of untreated (open triangles) and PNGase F-treated (closed triangles) hsCD2 over a flow cell with nothing (dotted line) immobilized is shown. The equilibrium responses (100%) following injection of untreated and PNGase F-treated hsCD2 over immobilized sCD58 were 850 and 1193 RU, respectively. The same samples injected though a control flow cell gave responses of 161 and 317 RU. The samples were injected at flow rates of 20 μl/min. The apparent dissociation times were obtained by fitting mono-exponential decay curves to the data (see dotted and solid lines). One exception was the dissociation of PNGase F-treated hsCD2 from immmobilized sCD58 which was fitted using a bi-exponential decay function.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A full-length cDNA clone encoding human CD2 (29.Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) was truncated and mutated to encode a soluble form of CD2 with three potential glycosylation sites (Asn-65, Asn-117, and Asn-126) and terminating at Lys-182 of the fully processed product as described elsewhere(25.van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The glucosidase I inhibitor, NB-DNJ, has previously been shown to prevent the maturation of N-linked oligosaccharides on recombinant human immunodeficiency virus gp120 expressed in CHO cells(30.Karlsson G.B. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 570-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sugars remain as oligomannose forms that are readily cleaved with endo H under denaturing conditions to single N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. To determine the effect of NB-DNJ on the endo H sensitivity of undenatured glycoprotein, hsCD2 expressing cells were cultured in the absence or in the presence of 0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2 mM NB-DNJ. Quantitative assays of the expression levels indicated that there was a 3-4-fold reduction in expression in the presence of 0.5-2 mM NB-DNJ (data not shown). After expression in the presence of increasing concentrations of NB-DNJ the hsCD2 migrated more slowly and as a narrower band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), consistent with an increase in the size and uniformity of its N-linked glycosylation(30.Karlsson G.B. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 570-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion of the 2 mM NB-DNJ-treated hsCD2 with limiting amounts of endo H produced three smaller products each differing by 2-3 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 18). These are likely to correspond to hsCD2 forms bearing zero, one, or two oligosaccharides indicating that all three glycosylation sites can be utilized. There was a concomitant increase in sensitivity to endo H with increasing NB-DNJ concentrations. However, at the two highest NB-DNJ concentrations there was little difference in the endo H sensitivity. Thus, 1.5 mM NB-DNJ appears to completely inhibit glucosidase I. Densitometric analysis of the gel revealed that at the highest NB-DNJ concentration 15% of the hsCD2 is endo H-resistant indicating that a relatively inefficient glucosidase I bypass mechanism exists in these cells (data not shown). Some of the N-linked glycosylation of hsCD2 expressed in the absence of NB-DNJ was also sensitive to endo H. The 2-3-kDa change in SDS-PAGE mobility is consistent with the presence of a single unprocessed site on hsCD2 expressed in CHO cells as observed previously(26.Recny M.A. Luther M.A. Knoppers M.H. Neidhardt E.A. Khandekar S.S. Concino M.F. Schimke P.A. Francis M.A. Moebius U. Reinhold B.B. Reinhold V.N. Reinherz E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22428-22434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This contrasts with rat sCD2 expressed in CHO cells which is completely endo H-resistant(31.Davis S.J. Puklavec M.J. Ashford D.A. Harlos K. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Williams A.F. Protein. Eng. 1993; 6: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Milligram quantities of hsCD2 were produced in the presence of NB-DNJ, purified and treated with endo H. The digested material was then purified to homogeneity by lectin affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography for functional studies and crystallization trials (Fig. 2, lane 2). The electrophoretic mobility of the endo H-treated hsCD2 suggested that the oligosaccharides had been removed from each glycosylation site. Using methods which quantitatively release amino sugars (incubation with 6 N HCl at 100°C for 4 h), 3.36 ± 0.31 and 14.79 ± 0.32 mol of GlcNAc/mol of protein were detected in endo H-treated and untreated hsCD2, respectively. Mass spectrometric analysis of the endo H-treated hsCD2 gave a mass expected for the polypeptide backbone with three GlcNAc residues (21, 575 Daltons; data not shown). This data indicates that all three glycosylation sites are fully utilized in CHO cells, and that endo H truncates the oligosaccharides at each site to single GlcNAc residues. Previous studies of the interaction of rat CD2 with its ligand CD48 (24.van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N.

Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) have shown that the BIAcoreTM instrument (33.Jönsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Lofas S. Persson B. Roos H. Ronnberg I. Sjolander S. Stenberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Ostlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar) offers significant advantages over conventional assays for analyzing the affinity and kinetics of weak protein interactions. The instrument uses the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance to detect binding of macromolecules to ligands immobilized on a dextran matrix within a small flow cell. An important advantage of the BIAcoreTM is that interactions are followed in real time. This provides kinetic data which enable the binding of monomers to be readily distinguished from that of aggregates, thereby reducing the likelihood that the measured affinities are artefactually high(24.van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 32.Davis S.J. Jones E.Y. Bodian D.L. Barclay A.N. van der Merwe P.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The binding affinities of sCD58, prepared as described elsewhere(25.van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), for untreated hsCD2 and for endo H-treated hsCD2 prepared after expression in the presence of NB-DNJ, were measured by equilibrium binding analysis on the BIAcoreTM, as described previously (24.van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Endo H-treated hsCD2 was compared with untreated hsCD2 by injecting sCD58 at increasing concentrations through flow cells in which either untreated or endo H-treated hsCD2 had been immobilized (Fig. 3A). sCD58 clearly binds endo H-treated hsCD2 and untreated hsCD2 with similar affinities (Fig. 3A). Scatchard plots of the data (Fig. 3A, inset) indicated that the affinities of sCD58 for untreated and endo H-treated hsCD2 were Kd 7 μM and 9 μM, respectively. While the affinity of endo H-treated hsCD2 for sCD58 was essentially unchanged, this does not rule out the possibility that the kinetics of binding are altered by glycosidase treatment. Very low affinity interactions, such as those between rat CD2 (24.van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and human CD2 (25.van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and their respective ligands, reach equilibrium very rapidly, making kinetic analysis of the association phase impossible on the BIAcoreTM. However, the dissociation phase of such interactions can usually be analyzed, and so the dissociation rates of untreated and endo H-treated hsCD2 were compared (Fig. 4A). It has previously been shown that the apparent dissociation rate constant (koff) observed on the BIAcoreTM is slower than the actual koff because 1) it takes time for the dissociated protein to wash out of the flow cell and 2) rebinding can occur during this washing phase(24.van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25.van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As a result, the measured koff values shown in this study represent a lower limit for the actual koff and are used here for comparative purposes. Under identical experimental conditions sCD58 dissociated from untreated and endo H-treated hsCD2 at about the same rate (with observed values of koff 0.8 s−1 and 0.7 s−1, respectivel"
https://openalex.org/W1529476232,"The ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 catalyzes the first step in the ubiquitin conjugation pathway. Previously, we have cloned and sequenced the cDNA for human E1. Expression of the E1 cDNA in the ts20 cell line, which harbors a thermolabile E1, abrogated the phenotypic defects associated with this line. However, little is known of the cell biology of the E1 protein or the nature of the E1 doublet. Thus, we constructed epitope-tagged E1 cDNAs in which the HA monoclonal antibody epitope tag sequence (from influenza hemagglutinin and recognized by the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody) was fused to the amino terminus of E1. Because the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of E1 is unknown, three constructs were made in which the HA tag was placed at each of the first three ATGs in the open reading frame (HA-1E1, HA-2E1, and HA-3E1). Western analysis of HeLa cells transfected with the constructs revealed that HA-1E1 closely comigrated with the upper band of the E1 doublet, and HA-2E1 comigrated with the lower band of the E1 doublet; HA-3E1 appeared smaller than either of the E1 bands. Metabolic labeling with 32P and immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody revealed that only the HA-1E1 protein product is phosphorylated; polyclonal anti-E1 antibody showed that only the upper band of the endogenous E1 doublet is phosphorylated. Each of the constructs was able to rescue the mutant phenotype of the ts20 cell line. Immunofluorescence studies showed that HA-2E1 and HA-3E1 were distributed in the cytoplasm with both negative and positive nuclei. This pattern of distribution has also been observed when immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody to E1 (1C5). However, the staining pattern associated with a polyclonal anti-E1 antibody (JJJ) is characterized by positive staining cytoplasm and nuclei in all cells. The HA-1E1 construct exhibited apparently exclusive nuclear distribution in HeLa cells. The difference between the staining patterns of the polyclonal and monoclonal anti-E1 antibodies can be explained by the existence of two subpopulations of E1: one cytoplasmic and partially nuclear, and one that is nuclear. Deletion of a small region at the amino terminus of the HA-1E1, including the basic sequence KKRR, transformed its immunostaining pattern to that observed with HA-2E1."
https://openalex.org/W1661402929,"Most peptides that bind to a particular major histocompatibility complex class I molecule share amino acid residues important for binding at one or two positions. Sequence analyses of peptides bound to HLA-B14 revealed at least four candidates for these so-called anchor residues: Arg at P2, Tyr at P3, Arg at P5, and Leu at P9. Combinations of any three of these amino acids sufficed for binding to HLA-B14 in vitro. Using this information, we identified an antigenic peptide critical for cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognition of virus-infected cells. Molecular models of HLA-B14 peptide complexes were constructed to investigate how the potential anchor residues might function. By using binding data to calculate the contribution to binding of each amino acid at anchor positions and predicting the stability of all possible nonapeptide complexes that could be formed from antigenic proteins, we estimate that three known antigenic nonapeptides are in the highest affinity cohort of peptides. Thus, even when multiple combinations of anchor residues contribute to binding, antigenic peptides are routinely identifiable."

(1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8144-8151). In the present study, we have generated a specific mouse monoclonal antibody against GD1 alpha and explored the distribution of GD1 alpha in murine central nervous system. In adult rat brain, GD1 alpha occurred as a minor constituent, and its expression was exclusively detected in the forebrain, the midbrain and the cerebellum. In the mouse cerebellum, the content of GD1 alpha was reduced significantly in the Purkinje cell-deficient mutants, lurcher (Lc/+), staggerer (sg/sg), and Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd/pcd), but were not reduced in the weaver (wv/wv) mutant, which loses mostly granule cells. The GD1 alpha synthase, assayed in cerebellar microsomes, was also reduced in Purkinje cell-deficient mutants. Immunohistochemistry showed that the staining for GD1 alpha in rat and mouse cerebella was mostly found in the proximal dendrites and cell bodies of Purkinje cells. Also, it appeared slightly in the processes of Bergmann glial cells. The immunoreactivity of GD1 alpha disappeared specifically from the Purkinje cell dendrites and the Bergmann glial processes after co-application of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and 8-bromo-guanosine 3‘:5‘-cyclic monophosphate, which induced long-term desensitization of the AMPA-selective glutamate receptors in Purkinje cells. The present data provide suggestive evidence that GD1 alpha ganglioside is enriched in Purkinje cells and may have a role in Purkinje cell functions in the cerebellum."

(1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3061-3066). The gene encoding for this enzyme was amplified from the E. coli genome by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into an overexpression vector, pJLA503. The enzyme was overexpressed by heat induction in E. coli transformed by this recombinant plasmid and purified to homogeneity by two column chromatographies. The sequence requirement in tRNA for recognition by this enzyme was investigated using minihelices corresponding to the anti-codon arm of E. coli tRNA(His). Two uridine residues (U33, U35) were found to be prerequisite for such recognition by this enzyme. Position 32 required pyrimidines, because the enzyme activity toward the minihelices was markedly reduced or entirely lost when this residue was replaced by purines or was deleted. Adenosine at position 37 and the G30-C40 base pair were not essential despite their conservation. Our results suggest that the enzyme recognizes the U33-G34-U35 sequence in the anti-codon loop and not the tertiary structure of tRNA itself."
https://openalex.org/W1678512432,"Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) action is due to mutations in the beta-isoform of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR-beta). RTH patients display inappropriate central secretion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus and thyrotropin (TSH) from the anterior pituitary in association with abnormal peripheral tissue responses to thyroid hormone. Whether TR-beta mutations cause a selective form of RTH, which only leads to abnormal pituitary TSH secretion (PRTH), is unclear. In a patient with PRTH, a novel mutation of a conserved arginine residue adjacent to the ninth heptad of TR-beta selectively disrupts TR homodimer formation. The mutant TR displays normal or enhanced function on stimulatory thyroid hormone response elements found in peripheral tissues, but has defective function on inhibitory thyroid hormone response elements found in the TRH and TSH subunit genes and explains the PRTH phenotype. This is the first report of a mutation in a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that selectively abolishes hormone-dependent inhibition and localizes a novel C-terminal domain necessary for this property."
https://openalex.org/W1627281567,"Among five different human alpha 1 --> 3 fucosyltransferases cloned, fucosyltransferases III (Fuc-TIII) and IV (Fuc-TIV) differ significantly from each other. Fuc-TIII transfers a fucose to both sialylated and nonsialylated N-acetyllactosamine, but Fuc-TIV apparently transfers a fucose only to neutral N-acetyllactosamine. In this study, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were stably transfected with Fuc-TIII or Fuc-TIV, and the resultant cell lines, CHO-FTIII and CHO-FTIV, were compared for the carbohydrate structures and for their binding to E-selectin or L-selectin. CHO-FTIII and CHO-FTIV cells were labeled metabolically with [3H]galactose, and glycopeptides obtained from these cells were fractionated by serial lectin affinity chromatography. The fractionated glycopeptides were then subjected to various combinations of exoglycosidase treatment or endo-beta-galactosidase digestion. The results obtained can be summarized as follows. CHO-FTIII cells express sialyl Lewisx, Lewisx, and VIM-2 structures, whereas CHO-FTIV cells express only an Lex structure with a small amount of VIM-2 structure. When CHO-FTIII and CHO-FTIV cells were tested for adhesion to E-selectin expressed by tumor necrosis factor-activated endothelial cells and to an E-selectin chimeric protein, only CHO-FTIII cells were found to adhere well to E-selectin. Moreover, both CHO-FTIII and CHO-FTIV cells failed to adhere to an L-selectin chimeric protein. These results clearly indicate that FT-III and FT-IV direct distinctly different fucosylated oligosaccharides. This difference in oligosaccharide structures results in an entirely different efficiency in adhesion to E-selectin. The results also demonstrate that expression of sialyl Lex itself is not sufficient for L-selectin binding."
https://openalex.org/W2155537309,"We previously demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases expression of the prostaglandin H synthase-2 (PGHS-2) gene (Hempel, S.L., Monick, M.M., and Hunninghake, G.W. (1994) J. Clin. Invest. 93, 391-396). In this study, the expression of the PGHS-2 gene in response to changes in cell oxidant tone was studied. During LPS exposure, inhibition of synthesis of the free radical, NO., resulted in a small decrease in prostaglandin E2 synthesis that did not reach statistical significance. There was no effect on enzyme mass or mRNA. In contrast, incubation of alveolar macrophages in the presence of LPS plus the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide, or hypoxia, resulted in near complete inhibition of prostaglandin E2 synthesis, PGHS-2 enzyme synthesis, and gene transcription of PGHS-2 mRNA. There was no evidence of cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate that synthesis of PGHS-2 in response to LPS is inhibited by agents that decrease cell oxidant tone."
https://openalex.org/W1552162740,"Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains are conserved, globular protein modules that mediate assembly of multicomponent signaling complexes. Phosphoproteins from the B-lymphoid cell line A20 were isolated by SH2 affinity chromatography; the peptide sequence from one of these proteins was used to molecularly clone several related complementary DNAs whose predominant protein product, p130PITSLRE, is an abundant serine/threonine kinase with ubiquitous expression in murine tissues. The sequence of a previously described cyclin-dependent kinase homologue, p58clk-1, is entirely contained within the p130PITSLRE sequence. Specific binding of p130PITSLRE to SH2 domains is mediated by a serine- and glutamic acid-rich cluster of amino acids in the N-terminal region. This interaction is dependent on serine/threonine phosphorylation but independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Binding is inhibited by free phosphotyrosine and by a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide from polyoma middle T antigen, suggesting that the p130PITSLRE binding site in the SH2 domain overlaps the region that binds phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. Bacterially expressed p130PITSLRE fragments acquire the ability to bind an SH2 domain when phosphorylated in vitro with casein kinase II. A subset of casein kinase II phosphorylation sites may therefore constitute a phosphotyrosine-independent class of SH2 ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1487636984,"Chemokines play a key role in recruiting leukocytes into inflamed synovial environment, and the cells of the synovial membrane, which express high levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, are a major source of these chemokines. Our data indicated that engagement of MHC class II molecules by staphylococcal enterotoxin A superantigen resulted in the induction of chemokine gene expression as well as protein synthesis. Pretreatment of the cells with cycloheximide potentiated the effect of superantigen on chemokine mRNA induction, suggesting that the expression of these genes may occur independently of prior protein synthesis. Ligation of MHC class II molecules in fibroblast-like synoviocytes by other ligands such as Mycoplasma arthritidis-derived superantigen and anti-class II antibody could also trigger an increase in the mRNA level of RANTES, MCP-1, and interleukin (IL)-8. The addition of dexamethasone to superantigen-treated fibroblast-like synoviocytes inhibited the mRNA expression of all three chemokines. IL-4 treatment decreased only the stimulating effect of superantigen on RANTES messanger suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in regulating these genes. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone did not require a de novo protein synthesis, whereas that of IL-4 was protein-dependent. This report demonstrates that MHC class II ligands (superantigens and anti-MHC class II antibodies) may represent an important agent by which inflammatory chemokines can be induced and shows that this response can be modulated by the anti-inflammatory agents dexamethasone and IL-4."

INTRODUCTIONReverse transcriptases (RT) ( 1The abbreviations used are: RTreverse transcriptasemsDNAmulticopy single-stranded DNAmsdRNARNA molecule attached to msDNAHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusIPTGisopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranosideddATPdideoxyadenosine triphosphateTdTterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferaseDTTdithiothreitol.) are unique among DNA polymerases because of their ability to use RNA as templates. Eukaryotic RTs associating with retroviruses and retrotransposons are known to use a specific cellular tRNA as a primer for cDNA synthesis(1Varmus H.E. Swanstrom R. Weiss N. Teich H. Varmus H.E. Coffin J. The Molecular Biology of Tumor Viruses: RNA Tumor Viruses. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 369-512Google Scholar). Recently it has been demonstrated that the 3′-OH group of the 3′-end A residue of tRNA Lys3 is used exclusively for the priming reaction by HIV retroviral RT(2Shimada M. Hosaka H. Takaku H. Smith J.S. Roth M.J. Inouye S. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3925-3927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these eukaryotic RTs, it has been suggested that bacterial RTs specifically initiate cDNA synthesis from the 2′-OH group of an internal G residue of a template RNA(3Inouye S. Inouye M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Inouye S. Inouye M. Goff S. Skalka A. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 391-410Google Scholar).Bacterial RTs have been shown to exist in a Gram-negative soil bacterium, Myxococcus xanthus(5Lampson B.C. Inouye M.

Cell. 1989; 56: 709-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and Escherichia coli(7Lampson B.C. Sun J. Hsu M.-Y. Vallejo-Ramirez J. Inouye S. Inouye M.

Bacterial RTs homologous to retroviral RTs are responsible for the synthesis of an unusual satellite single-stranded DNA called msDNA (multicopy single-stranded DNA). The 5′-end of msDNA is covalently linked to the 2′-OH group of an internal G residue of a single-stranded RNA (msdRNA). The DNA and RNA molecules form a heteroduplex at their 3′-ends. A number of different msDNAs have been found in Myxobacteria, E. coli, Rhizobium, Salmonella, Proteus, Klebsiella(3Inouye S. Inouye M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Inouye S. Inouye M. Goff S. Skalka A. Reverse Transcriptase.

Stacey G. Lampson B.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4250-4254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A genetic element called “retron” is required for msDNA production and consists of msr (a coding region for msdRNA), msd (a coding region for msDNA), and RT (a gene for RT)(3Inouye S. Inouye M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Eight different retrons have been so far identified and characterized in E. coli and Myxobacteria.The proposed synthesis of msDNA is shown in Fig. 1(3Inouye S. Inouye M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Inouye S. Inouye M. Goff S. Skalka A. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 391-410Google Scholar). First, an RNA transcript encompassing msr, msd, and RT is produced from the promoter located upstream of msr (step 1 in Fig. 1). The RNA transcript containing a1 and a2 inverted repeat sequences is thought to form secondary structures including a stable a1-a2 stem structure (step 2). The branching G residue is placed at the end of the a1-a2 stem in this folded structure. No specific primary sequences are required in the a1-a2 structure(11Hsu M.-Y. Inouye S. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6214-6219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Shimamoto T. Hsu M.-Y. Inouye S. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2684-2692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order for RT to initiate msDNA synthesis, another specific structure for each RT located downstream of the branching G residue is required in addition to the a1-a2 stem structure and the G residue(12Shimamoto T. Hsu M.-Y. Inouye S. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2684-2692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary reaction of msDNA or cDNA synthesis is thought to start from the 2′-OH group of the G residue (step 3). The first base is added using the RNA transcript as the template, and cDNA synthesis continues on the same template RNA to a specific termination site (steps 3 and 4). The template RNA is removed by RNase H, leaving the short 3′-end RNA-DNA overlapping region.In this report, we purified a bacterial RT to homogeneity from E. coli harboring the RT gene from retron-Ec73. Using the purified enzyme (RT-Ec73) and an RNA template synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase (Fig. 2A), we established a cell-free system synthesizing the full-length msDNA-Ec73 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we now unambiguously demonstrate that the bacterial RT is indeed able to prime cDNA synthesis from the 2′-OH group of a specific internal G residue of the template RNA molecule. Therefore, the cDNA-priming mechanism of bacterial RTs appears to be quite different from that of retroviral RTs. This raises interesting questions as to the molecular mechanism and the evolutionary significance of the 2′-OH priming reaction.Figure 2:Proposed secondary structures of msr-msd RNA from retron-Ec73 synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase and msDNA-Ec73.

Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar). A K-12 derivative containing DE3 phage, which contains the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of the lac promoter, was constructed. Using E. coli strain LE392 (supE44, supF58, hsdR514, galK2, galT22, metB1, TrpR55, lacY1) a DE3 lysogen was isolated as described previously(14Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4790) Google Scholar). The new λ -lysogen was designated LE392(DE3) and used as a host for the T7 expression system. All phage manipulations were done according to Sambrook et al.(15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). CL83 (16Lerner C.G. Inouye M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) was used as a host to manipulate plasmids.Construction of PlasmidspET73RT(His), which carries the RT-Ec73 gene under the control of a T7 promoter for high expression of the protein (13Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar) and a sequence encoding a histidine-tag (17Hochuli E. Bannwarth W. Döbeli H. Gentz R. Stüber D. BioTechnology. 1988; 6: 1321-1325Crossref Scopus (957) Google Scholar) at the N terminus of RT-Ec73, was constructed as follows. First, pET11a(Km) was constructed by inserting the 1.3-kilobase HincII-EcoRI fragment of the kanamycin-resistant gene from Tn5 (18Beck G. Ludwig G. Auerswald E.A. Reiss B. Schaller H. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) into the DraI-EcoRI sites of pET11a(13Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar). pUC7XbaI was constructed by inserting a oligonucleotide, 5′-GATCCTCTAGACCCGGGTCTAGAG-3′, into the BamHI site of pUC7. Then, 1,059-base pair XbaI fragment including the RT-Ec73 gene from the mutation 5 (19Sun J. Inouye M. Inouye S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4171-4181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of retron-Ec73 was inserted into the XbaI site of pUC7XbaI, and a resulting plasmid was designated pUC7Xba-RT. The 824-base pair NdeI-BamHI fragment containing the downstream part of the RT-Ec73 gene was cut out from pUC7Xba-RT and inserted into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET11a(Km). The resulting plasmid was designated pET73RTΔN. The upstream part of the RT-Ec73 gene containing the histidine-tagging sequence and an NdeI site was made by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides 73nh (5′-TCCATATGCATCACCATCACCATCACAGAATATATAGCCTA-3′) and 73n-1 (5′-AATGCATATGCAGCA-3′) as primers, and inserted into the SmaI site of pUC19. The sequence of the inserted fragment was confirmed by the dideoxy sequencing method(20Sanger F.S. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52361) Google Scholar). The NdeI fragment was then cut out and ligated into the NdeI site of pET73RTΔN. pET73RT(His) was isolated by screening a plasmid which had the insert in the correct orientation. To check whether pET73RT(His) produced the active RT-Ec73(His), LE392(DE3) was cotransformed with pET73RT(His) and p73-Hc0.7 which carries only the msr-msd region from retron-Ec73(12Shimamoto T. Hsu M.-Y. Inouye S. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2684-2692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction of the transformant, msDNA was isolated as a plasmid fraction according to the alkaline-sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) method (21Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9847) Google Scholar) and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The production of msDNA-Ec73 was confirmed (data not shown).pUCT7MS73 was constructed for in vitro transcription. First, an 84-base pair fragment including a T7 promoter (Ø10) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides T7p-73 (5′-CTAGGTTTGGCTCTGCTATAGTGAGTCGTA-3′) and PBR-b (5′-CCGGCCACGATGCGTCC-3′) as primers and pET11a (13Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar) as a template. A G residue was used as the first base for transcription in front of the 5′-end C residue of msr because the T7 RNA polymerase preferably uses G for the transcription initiation(22Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). After purification by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, this fragment was mixed with p73-Hc0.7, and the second polymerase chain reaction was done by using the PBR-b and 73f (5′-TCGGATCCTTATGCACCTT-3′) (12Shimamoto T. Hsu M.-Y. Inouye S. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2684-2692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as primers. The amplified fragment was isolated and cloned into the SmaI site of pUC19(23Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11425) Google Scholar). A plasmid, which had the insert in the opposite orientation against the lac promoter of pUC19, was selected and designated pUCT7MS73. The DNA sequence of the inserted fragment was confirmed by the method of Sanger et al.(20Sanger F.S. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52361) Google Scholar).Purification of RT-Ec73(His)LE392(DE3)/pET73RT(His) cells were grown in M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% Casamino Acids (Difco), 0.4% glucose, 20 μg/ml tryptophan, 2 μg/ml thiamine, 0.8 mM MgSO4, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37°C up to 90 Klett units. Then IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. After 1 h of induction, the cells were harvested and washed once with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (lane 2 in Fig. 3). Then the cells were resuspended in French press buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM MgCl2, and 10% glycerol) and disrupted by passing through a French press cell. Unbroken cells were precipitated by low speed centrifugation (4,000 × g, 10 min). The membrane and soluble fractions were then separated by ultracentrifugation (135,000 × g, 30 min) (lane 4). The overexpressed RT-Ec73(His) protein was fractionated into the membrane fraction. Thus, the membrane fraction was washed twice with French press buffer. RT-Ec73(His) was then solubilized from 20 mg of protein of membrane fraction in 2 ml of solubilization buffer (100 mM sodium-phosphate (pH 8.0), 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 M guanidine-HCl, and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol). The solubilized fraction was obtained by ultracentrifugation (135,000 × g, 30 min) (lane 5) and loaded to 1 ml of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) affinity resin (Qiagen). All column manipulations were performed under the denaturing condition at 4°C by using the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia). First the column was washed with 10 ml of elution buffer (7 M urea, 100 mM sodium-phosphate (pH 8.0), 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and 20 ml of elution buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. RT-Ec73(His) was eluted with 10 ml of elution buffer containing 100 mM imidazole. The eluted fractions (1 ml each) were dialyzed independently to refold the denatured protein as follows. Six peak fractions were first dialyzed against dialysis buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 M ammonium sulfate) containing 2.5 M urea at 4°C for 3 h, and then dialysis buffer A containing 1 M urea for 3 h, the same buffer containing 0.5 M urea for 3 h and without urea for 3 h. Finally, all fractions were dialyzed against dialysis buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 200 mM NaCl) for 3 h. Protein aggregates were then precipitated by centrifugation (13,500 × g, 15 min). Protein patterns were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (24, see Fig. 3), and RT activity was checked in a cell-free system as described below. Three peak supernatant fractions (1 ml each) were pooled (lane 6) and used for all experiments as the purified RT-Ec73(His).Figure 3:Purification of RT-Ec73(His). RT-Ec73(His) was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 1, total cell protein of LE392(DE3)/pET73RT(His) without IPTG induction; lane 2, with IPTG induction; lane 3, the soluble protein fraction after high speed centrifugation; lane 4, the membrane protein fraction; lane 5, protein fraction solubilized with guanidine-HCl; lane 6, purified RT-Ec73(His) from Ni-NTA column. An arrowhead indicates the band corresponding to RT-Ec73(His). The calculated molecular mass of RT-Ec73(His) is 37.6 kDa. Bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) were used as molecular mass markers. The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Preparation of the msr-msd RNA by T7 RNA PolymeraseFirst, pUCT7MS73 was digested with BamHI to linearize, then extracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and redissolved in 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). 10 μg of the linearized pUCT7MS73 was mixed with transcription buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, and 10 mM NaCl), 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each of NTP (ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP) and 200 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) to a total volume of 500 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 h and then extracted with phenol and chloroform. A half volume of 7.5 M ammonium acetate and three volumes of ethanol were added, and the mixture was placed at −70°C for 30 min and then centrifuged (13,500 × g, 10 min). By this step, unincorporated nucleotides were removed. The precipitated RNA fraction was redissolved in 1 ml of 1 M ammonium acetate and divided to 10 portions. Three volumes of ethanol were added, and tubes were stored at −70°C separately until needed. Immediately before use for cell-free synthesis of msDNA, the RNA was precipitated by centrifugation. The transcription buffer and DTT solution were supplied by Promega.Cell-free Synthesis of msDNA-Ec73 in VitroThe msr-msd RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro (corresponding to 50 μl of reaction) was redissolved in 60 μl of annealing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mM MgCl2). 3 μl of the RNA solution was used for each reaction. To cause the RNA to fold properly, each sample was boiled for 2 min, incubated at 37°C for 30 min and at 4°C for 30 min before the reaction. The RNA thus treated was mixed with RT buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 60 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40), 0.3 mM each of dGTP, dATP, dCTP, and 10 μCi of [α- 32 P]dTTP (3,000 Ci/mmol). 3 μl ( ∼ 0.15 μg) of the purified RT-Ec73(His) was added to make the final volume of 25 μl, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 20 min. Then 1.5 μl of 5 mM dTTP was added to the mixture, and the reaction was continued at 37°C for another 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of stop solution (20 mM EDTA and 0.5% SDS) and 3 volumes of ethanol. The precipitated sample was redissolved in 10 μl of 1 mM EDTA and divided to two portions. One of them was heat-denatured and treated with RNase A (0.4 μg) for 10 min at 37°C. The labeled products with and without RNase A treatment were separated by 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel.To characterize the cDNA products, cDNA was synthesized in a large scale and labeled at the 3′-end. 120 μl of the RNA transcript was first annealed and mixed with RT buffer and 0.3 mM (each) dNTP. cDNA synthesis was started by adding 400 μl ( ∼ 20 μg) of the purified RT-Ec73(His) to 3 ml of reaction mixture and stopped by adding the stop solution and 3 volumes of ethanol. The precipitated sample was redissolved in 1 mM EDTA and loaded on polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis. All bands were cut out of the gel and electroeluted to remove unincorporated nucleotides. The eluted products were labeled at the 3′-end in 200 μl of labeling buffer containing 250 μCi of [α- 32 P]ddATP (5,000 Ci/mmol) and 96 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT, International Biotechnologies, Inc.) at 37°C for 1 h as described previously (12Shimamoto T. Hsu M.-Y. Inouye S. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2684-2692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped with EDTA and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. The labeled products were redissolved in 10 μl of 1 mM EDTA and heat-denatured. RNA was digested by incubating with 0.8 μg of RNase A at 37°C for 10 min twice. Then the labeled products were separated on a preparative sequencing gel (12% polyacrylamide gel in 8 M urea). Each labeled band was cut out and eluted from the gel as described previously(12Shimamoto T. Hsu M.-Y. Inouye S. Inouye M. J. Biol.

The repurified products were dissolved in 20 μl (each) of the debranching reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES-HCl (pH 7.6), 40 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 10% glycerol), and 0.17 μg of the purified yeast debranching enzyme (from Dr. J. D. Boeke) was added to the mixture and incubated at 30°C for 1 h. 5 μl each of band 4 and 5 products with or without debranching enzyme treatment were annealed with oligonucleotides A (5′-CAAACCTAC-3′) and B (5′-CGTGCTCAAGTAGGTTTG-3′) in 10 μl of TM buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 10 mM MgCl2) as shown in Fig. 7A. The annealed oligonucleotides were mixed with ligation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM ATP) and 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase and incubated at 14°C overnight. All products were separated by sequencing gel (8 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide gel).Figure 7:Analysis of the phosphodiester linkage between RNA and cDNA.

Note that the length of band 4 product after RNase T1 treatment was the same as before treatment. The repurified band 4 product was first labeled at the 5′-end of the RNA portion using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and [ γ - 32 P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol), and the labeled product was repurified by urea/polyacrylamide gel. The labeled and repurified band 4 product was digested with the purified yeast debranching enzyme as described above. Band 4 products with or without debranching enzyme treatment were digested with RNase T1 or RNase U2 and separated by 8 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as shown in Fig. 8. To compare the size of the RNA portion from band 4 product with that from msDNA-Ec73 produced in vivo, msDNA-Ec73 was isolated from CL83 harboring p23S3.5 (12Shimamoto T. Hsu M.-Y. Inouye S.

For this purpose, we first purified RT-Ec73 with a histidine tag (RT-Ec73(His)) to homogeneity from E. coli cells, LE392(DE3) harboring pET73RT(His), as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see Fig. 3). E. coli strain LE392(DE3), a K12 derivative, was created as a host strain to express RT-Ec73. Note that strain BL21(DE3) (14Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4790) Google Scholar) commonly used as a host strain of T7 expression system is a derivative of E. coli B which has been known to contain retron-Ec86(8Lim D. Maas W.K. Cell. 1989; 56: 891-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A template RNA was produced using T7 RNA polymerase in vitro as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The synthesized RNA is 192 bases in length and is thought to be folded as shown in Fig. 2A. Next, using the purified RT-Ec73(His) and the template RNA (msr-msd RNA), we examined the synthesis of msDNA, which was analyzed by urea/polyacrylamide gel as shown in Fig. 4. Without RNase A treatment, a broad band appeared at the position corresponding to single-stranded DNA markers between 270 and 220 in length (lane 1, band a). As shown later (see Fig. 5), band a products were found to consist of not only the fully extended msDNA linked to the intact RNA molecule but also short single-stranded DNA of approximately 10-15 bases in length also linked to the intact RNA molecule. Because of the absence of the RNase H activity in RT-Ec73(19Sun J. Inouye M. Inouye S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4171-4181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), all the cDNAs produced are considered to contain the full-length RNA template (see Fig. 4). After RNase A treatment, several bands appeared at position c (band c), which corresponds to a single-stranded DNA marker of about 16 bases. The bands above band c at about 20 bases are also considered to be products resulting from further extension of band c products. In addition, a higher molecular weight band (band b) was detected at a position corresponding to approximately 80 bases, which was almost identical to the position of the cDNA products synthesized from the RNA template isolated in vivo (data not shown). A higher molecular weight band (band X) also appeared at a position corresponding to about 90 base"

https://openalex.org/W2027784216,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are cell surface heterodimeric glycoproteins consisting of one α and one β polypeptide chain of similar size. These molecules play a critical role in immune recognition by displaying processed antigens to CD4-positive T helper cells. Several attempts to express the MHC class II molecules by recombinant methods in various systems resulted in either failure or poor recovery of the intact heterodimer. The present study describes our successful effort to refold and reconstitute HLA DR2 heterodimer from individually expressed α and β polypeptide chains lacking the transmembrane hydrophobic regions in Escherichia coli, in the presence of an immunodominant epitope analog from human myelin basic protein (b-MBP(83-102)Y
83
). The reconstituted DR2 heterodimer complex was selectively purified from unfolded α and β chains using heterodimer-specific monoclonal antibody (L243) coupled to a solid support. The detection of two polypeptide chains in the purified refolded DR2-peptide complex preparations was accomplished by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using heterodimer- and chain-specific polyclonal antibodies, and the presence of equimolar amounts of both α chain and β chain in the reconstituted complex preparation was confirmed by a double label experiment. The quantitation of the bound peptide in complex preparation was measured by incubating two chains in the presence of 
125
I-labeled peptide. An increase in the yield of refolded and reconstituted DR2-peptide complexes was observed with increasing peptide concentration in the reaction mixture. Finally, the functional activity of the reconstituted DR2 complexes was measured by their ability to stimulate γ
-interferon production by SS8T cloned T cells in an antigen-specific and dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that biologically active complexes of human DR2•b-MBP(83-102)Y
83 can be prepared by proper folding of human leukocyte antigen DR2 α and β chains in the presence of antigenic peptide. The yield of such DR2 heterodimers with bound peptide is several thousand-fold higher over native DR2 purified from transformed B cells. Since purified MHC class II-peptide complexes have been shown to prevent autoimmune diseases in various animal models, reconstituted heterodimer complexes may have significant clinical relevance in antigen-specific treatment of various autoimmune diseases. In addition, such complexes with increased yield will provide better understanding of the trimolecular interactions between MHC-peptide and T cell receptor."

The present study shows that the autonomous growth of SV 40-transformed human fibroblasts also requires type-I IGF-I receptor activation but that this is not due to de novo induction of IGF-I gene expression since untransformed human fibroblasts, which fail to proliferate in the absence of serum, also showed IGF-I gene expression under serum-free conditions. DNA synthesis assays confirmed that untransformed cells were responsive to exogenous IGF and indicated that transformed cells were already maximally stimulated. In untransformed fibroblasts, IGF binding was principally to abundant membrane-associated IGFBP-5, whereas in transformed fibroblasts this protein was minimally expressed, and IGF binding was to IGF receptors. Loss of detectable membrane-associated IGFBP-5 in transformed cells was associated with diminished IGFBP-5 gene expression and with loss of IGF-II gene expression. Exogenous IGFBP-5 associated with the membranes of transformed cells and inhibited the autocrine growth of these cells. These findings suggest that loss of IGFBP-5 in SV 40-transformed fibroblasts facilitates interaction of endogenously produced IGF-I with the IGF-I receptor and increases their sensitivity to autocrine stimulation.

Several lines of evidence suggest that in Src these domains are sequence motifs that direct substrate recognition, regulate kinase activity, or control subcellular localization. We sought to investigate the function of the homology domains in human Lyn, and to determine whether the differences between various SH3 domains affect function. To do this, we generated variant forms of Lyn lacking SH2 and SH3 domains, and created chimeras in which the SH3 domains in human c-Src and Lyn were replaced with SH3 domains from other family members. In contrast to similar deletions in Src, forms of Lyn lacking SH2 or SH3 had decreased kinase activity. The SH3 chimeras all had individual characteristics. Insertion of the Blk SH3 domain into Lyn restored kinase activity, while insertion of the Fyn or Src SH3 into Lyn enhanced the kinase activity 2-3-fold. Insertion of the Lyn SH3 into Src also doubled kinase activity. Expression of the Lyn-Src SH3 chimera in mammalian cells induced cell transformation.

https://openalex.org/W203016415,"Activating transcription factor-1 (ATF1) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) have been implicated in cAMP-, calcium-, and virus-induced transcriptional alterations. Although CREB and ATF1 share extensive homology, they appear to mediate distinct cellular functions. We investigated the effect on DNA binding and in vitro transcription of four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that bound to domains in either the regulatory region (mAb 1 and 3) or unique regions near the DNA-binding domains (mAb 4 and 5) of ATF1.mAb 1 and 3 supershifted both ATF1 and CREB in a DNA binding assay but did not affect in vitro transcription. mAb 4 prevented ATF1-DNA binding while supershifting CREB.DNA complexes and inhibited in vitro transcription by 95% from the CRE-containing murine proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoter. mAb 5 reacted specifically with ATF1 and did not prevent DNA binding or affect in vitro transcription. The mAb 4 epitope was located within ATF1 amino acid residues 205-219, including the first 3 basic residues in the putative DNA-binding domain. Secondary structural analysis predicted that this region comprises a transition site from alpha-helix to a turn-like conformation in ATF1. The transition to turn-like motifs is predicted to occur in CREB after 5 additional residues, with a correspondingly longer alpha-helical domain. Although regulatory domains distinct from DNA binding regions are thought to account for most of the differences in activity of members of the CREB subfamily, our results suggest that small structural variations adjacent to DNA binding regions may also contribute to the distinct functional activities of ATF1 and CREB."

https://openalex.org/W1534629605,"Antigen association to its corresponding binding site in the immunoglobulin molecule can elicit conformational rearrangements, generating novel epitopes termed metatopes. Such metatopes were characterized for the immunocomplex between the AIDS virus envelope protein, gp120, and M77, a mAb directed against the V3 loop. Five novel mAbs were described (GV1, GV3, GV7, GV8, and GV12). These mAbs were found to bind epitopes harbored in the M77 Fab fragment. Binding to the epitopes was shown to require the complexation of Fab with its antigen. The degree of this antigen requirement was found to be variable for the different mAbs and also for the state of IgG fragmentation. Binding of GV12 to its antigen increased the affinity of M77 for gp120. Moreover, in the presence of GV12, M77 acquired extended cross-reactivity for a second gp120 variant, namely BaL. These results could indicate a novel approach towards improving the performance of anti-HIV antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1547425703,"The rat asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is an integral transmembrane glycoprotein composed of three polypeptide subunits, designated rat hepatic lectins (RHL) 1, 2, and 3. Each subunit contains one or more Ser and Thr residues in its cytoplasmic domain that are potential sites of phosphorylation; in addition, RHL1 also contains one cytoplasmic Tyr. Based on [32P]PO4 metabolic radiolabeling experiments, Takahashi et al. (Takahashi, T., Nakada, H., Okumura, T., Sawamura, T., and Tashiro, Y. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 126, 1054-1060) concluded that RHL2 and RHL3 are phosphoproteins but that RHL1 is not. We report here that RHL1 in active ASGPR is, in fact, a phosphoprotein. Western blot analysis using anti-Tyr(P) antibody identified Tyr(P) in RHL1 of affinity-purified ASGPRs. RHL2 and RHL3, which do not contain Tyr in their cytoplasmic domains, did not react with this antibody. When isolated hepatocytes were radiolabeled metabolically with [32P]PO4, RHL1, RHL2, and RHL3 became radiolabeled. Each ASGPR subunit was radiolabeled to a similar extent in the presence or absence of the ligand asialo-orosomucoid, indicating that functioning of the ASGPR does not change its steady-state 23P-radiolabeling. Phosphoamino acid analysis of radiolabeled ASGPR subunits identified Ser(P) as the predominant (approximately 95%) and Thr(P) as a minor (approximately 5%) phosphoamino acid in each polypeptide and confirmed the presence of Tyr(P) (approximately 1%) in RHL1. Furthermore, treatment of hepatocytes with 3 mM vandate at 37 degrees C for 30 min doubled the steady-state level of Tyr(P) in RHL1."
https://openalex.org/W1584375098,"The activation of plasminogen by macrophage is regulated by their expression of receptors for urokinase and plasmin(ogen). In these studies we have examined plasmin(ogen) binding to adherent human THP-1 macrophage. Plasmin bound to the THP-1 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Kd 15.8 +/- 6.2 nM; Bmax 1.4 +/- 0.3 x 10(6)/cell). The lysine analog epsilon-aminocaproic acid competitively inhibited plasmin binding. The fraction of membrane-bound plasmin, however, became increasingly resistant to displacement with epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Over a 24-h period, membrane-bound plasmin activity fell 80% despite the presence of catalytically active plasmin in the incubation media. The loss of receptor-bound plasmin activity was not due to proteolytic alterations of its receptor since 125I-Lys-plasminogen bound to THP-1 cells pretreated with plasmin with similar affinity as to untreated cells. Following a 24-h incubation of 125I-Lys-plasminogen or 125I-plasmin with THP-1 cells, several degradative fragments were apparent in their conditioned media. The smaller degradative fragments (28 and 36 kDa) lacked cell binding activity and were demonstrated to be active by casein-zymography. A 48-kDa fragment bound to cells in a lysine-dependent manner but was not active. In contrast, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-inactivated 125I-plasmin retained its binding activity over 24 h, and degradative fragments were not present in the conditioned media. The binding of 125I-Lys-plasmin(ogen) to THP-1 cells was also examined in the presence of excess alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor. Despite the absence of fluid-phase plasmin activity, membrane-bound 125I-Lys-plasmin(ogen) decreased over 24 h. At 24 h a radiolabeled 48-kDa fragment was observed in the conditioned media and together with 125I-Lys-plasmin(ogen) was bound to cells. Unlike 125I-Lys-plasmin, the 48-kDa fragment did not form a complex with alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor. Thus, autoproteolysis of receptor-bound plasmin results in fragments with truncated physiologic properties that possess either cell binding or catalytic activities. We propose that autoproteolysis is a mechanism for regulating membrane-bound plasmin activity."
https://openalex.org/W1585710681,"Abstract Src homology 2 (SH2) domains are noncatalytic regions that are conserved among a group of cellular signaling proteins. SH2 domains share the common property of binding phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. Previously, we showed that SH2 domains expressed as recombinant glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins (GST-SH2) from GTPase-activating protein, Shc, zeta-chain-associated protein tyrosine kinase Zap-70, and Src-like tyrosine kinases precipitated distinct sets of phospho-proteins from activated B cells. To determine the intrinsic structural motifs responsible for the binding within the different SH2 domains, we created chimeric SH2 domains especially focusing on crystal structure-defined contact residues. Recombinant SH2 domains of Lck, Zap-70, and Shc were tested in Ramos B cell lysates for phosphotyrosine-dependent protein binding. Biomolecular interaction analysis (BIAcore) was used to characterize the interaction between the various recombinant SH2 molecules and defined phosphorylated peptides. In agreement with the crystal structure data from the Src and the Lck SH2 domains, our results show that most of the specificity information of the Lck SH2 domain is provided by the beta D-sheet, located downstream of the SH2 conserved consensus motif GTFLVRES. In addition, the overall affinity is critically influenced by residues located at the N terminus of the SH2 domain."
