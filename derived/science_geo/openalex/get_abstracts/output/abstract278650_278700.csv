https://openalex.org/W2136208491,"Cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, and computer technology have advanced to the point where it is feasible to build computer systems that are as effective as intelligent human tutors. Computer tutors based on a set of pedagogical principles derived from the ACT theory of cognition have been developed for teaching students to do proofs in geometry and to write computer programs in the language LISP."
https://openalex.org/W2130360419,"Multis are a new class of computers based on multiple microprocessors. The small size, low cost, and high performance of microprocessors allow the design and construction of computer structures that offer significant advantages in manufacture, price-performance ratio, and reliability over traditional computer families. Currently, commercial multis consist of 4 to 28 modules, which include microprocessors, common memories, and input-output devices, all of which communicate through a single set of wires called a bus. Adding microprocessors together increases the performance of multis in direct proportion to their price and allows multis to offer a performance range that spans that of small minicomputers to mainframe computers. Multis are commercially available for applications ranging from real-time industrial control to transaction processing. Traditional batch, time-sharing, and transaction systems process a number of independent jobs that can be distributed among the microprocessors of a multi with a resulting increased throughput (number of jobs completed per unit of time). Many scientific applications (such as the solving of partial differential equations) and engineering applications (such as the checking of integrated circuit designs) are speeded up by this parallel computation; thus, multis produce results at supercomputer speed but at a fraction of the cost. Multis are likely to be the basis for the next, the fifth, generation of computersâ€”a generation based on parallel processing."
https://openalex.org/W1970467455,"The use of supercomputers and modern color-imaging techniques for numerical computation is beginning to fulfill von Neumann's vision that digital computers would become the most appropriate tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. An example of this approach, a model for the gas flow in the vicinity of a black hole, is described. From such calculations comes a realization that the multidimensional, dynamic solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations can exhibit complex behavior compared to what one normally encounters in analytic solutions. This complexity includes small-scale chaotic structure and large-scale persistently ordered structure. Computational methodology and the aesthetics that derive from it are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2069423430,"Modern production agriculture in the United States is becoming so complex and sophisticated that computers may soon be an essential tool of successful farm operation and management. Farmers are vigorously seeking information on relevant computer technology and using it as rapidly as economics and availability permit. Their demand for this technology is, however, price-sensitive under current economic conditions. The agricultural research and development system has a long way to go to provide the large integrated software and hardware packages-including simulators and expert systems interfaced with monitoring and control devices-needed to help American farmers retain their competitive edge."
https://openalex.org/W1975964190,"The level of detail of economic models has until recently been limited by the availability of computational capability. At present, the constraint is the systematic compilation of detailed and comprehensive economic and technical data and the ability to manipulate them. The effective use of enhanced data processing capabilities will have to proceed hand in hand with a concerted effort to develop the economic database and with the shift from analytic approaches based on aggregative data to those that can take advantage of detailed information."

https://openalex.org/W2076519757,"Colleges and universities are becoming test beds for the much-heralded ""information society"" as they incorporate a new series of information technologies. These include on-line databases, magnetic and optical data storage, digital telecommunications, computer networks, and, most visibly and dramatically, personal computers. The transition is presenting administrators and faculty with major challenges, however. This article discusses some of the issues involved, including access to computers and to computer networking, managing the transition, and the educational uses of personal computers. A final section discusses efforts at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brown University, and Camegie-Mellon University to shape a new-generation personal computer, the so-called ""scholar's workstation."""

https://openalex.org/W2092205314,"Recent advances in microprocessor technology are making a new generation of personal computers feasible and affordable. These computers, called ""workstations,"" can be connected with other workstations, with mainframe computers, with supercomputers, and with remote networks. Workstations provide the graphical interface to supercomputers and can run applications that formerly required the use of mainframe computers. Emerging standards for communications, graphics, databases, numerical algorithms, and languages allow workstations to share programs with various types of computers, including mainframe and personal computers."

https://openalex.org/W2035585679,"The earliest and still most prevalent use of computers in the humanities is the compilation of concordances, rationalized vocabulary lists for literary works. The residue of these efforts has created the potential for extensive databases of natural-language text for a wide range of studies and for instruction. As yet, however, computer-aided instruction has focused on mechanical skills, like spelling and grammar. With rapid advances in storage (like videodisks) and in communications between computers, humanists are finding a challengingly altered environment in which to study and teach."
